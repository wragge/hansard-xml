          <para>- I  present a petition from the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly praying that the Senate redress the grievances of the Assembly relative to the determination of self-governing power for the Territory and set right the wrongs imposed on the Territory by the Australian Government. The petition exceeds 250 words and under Sessional Orders may not be read. Honourable senators will be able to acquaint themselves with the text of the petition which will be incorporated in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record: </para>

          <para class="block">The Honourable the  President  and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the Legislative Assembly respectfully showeth: that the avowed intention of the Australian Parliament to further the interests of democracy and parliamentary government in the Territory is being frustrated by the executive and administrative arms of government. </para>
          <para>In particular the will of the Australian Parliament is being hindered by the extended delay in considering the reports from the Joint Committee on the Northern Territory. </para>
          <para>It is 12 months since the Legislative Assembly for the Northern Territory was elected. Without provision for executive authority this was a very limited constitutional advance. </para>
          <para>It is over 2 years since the Joint Committee was appointed. Eleven months have passed since the main report was tabled. Nearly 5 months have elapsed since the supplementary report was presented. </para>
          <para>Despite the firm recommendations of the Joint Committee relating to the transfer of executive powers and administrative functions to a Territory executive, the Government has transferred neither powers nor functions. It has not provided a statement of attitude to the reports, nor the opportunity for debating them. </para>
          <para>The major parties in government and opposition have espoused the cause of constitutional development for the Northern Territory in recent years. The evidence for this is in the &#39;Outline of proposals for the transfer of a range of functions to the N.T. Legislature and Executive&#39;, August 1972, and the &#39;Terms of reference of the Joint Committee on the N.T. &#39;, September 1 973, as well as in party platforms. </para>
          <para>The first report of the Joint Committee tabled on November 26 1974, included 25 specific recommendations and these were re-affirmed by the second report tabled on May28 1975. </para>
          <para>Apart from confirmation of the arrangements for election of the composition of the Assembly the recommendations dealt with. </para>
          <para>Legislative Responsibility (4);</para>
          <para>Executive Responsibility (5);</para>
          <para>Financial Arrangements (2);</para>
          <para>Public Service (7);</para>
        <para>Relationship between the National and Territory Executives (2); </para>
        <para>Role of the Administrator ( 1 ); </para>
        <para>No action has been taken in respect of any of these 2 1 recommendations, but certain initiatives of the Australian Government continue to cut across the spirit and terms of the report, particularly in the fields of legislation. </para>
        <para>LEGISLATIVE RESPONSIBILITY</para>
      <para>Recommendation 5- that the Legislative Assembly continue to have power to legislate in respect of all state-type matters but an over-riding power be vested in the GovernorGeneral to make regulations. This over-riding power to be used only when the Assembly has failed to pass, after consultation, in a form acceptable to the Australian Government, Australian Government sponsored legislation in respect to functions being the executive responsibility of the Australian Government. </para>
      <para>Recommendation 6-that all State-type matters, the executive responsibility of the Australian Government, be introduced into the Legislative Assembly. </para>
      <para>The Australian Government has continued to enact in respect of many State-type matters, without any reference or consultation with the Assembly- e.g. National Parks and Wildlife, Darwin Reconstruction, Land Price Stabilization, Ombudsman, Aboriginal Land, Australian Police. </para>
      <para>Recommendation 8- that the present arrangements for the withholding of assent by the Australian Government in respect to those State-type functions retained by the Australian Government be exercised only after the fullest consultation with the Territory Executive. </para>
      <para>The Government has withheld assent to 8 Ordinances in the past two years, including the Cyclone Disaster Emergency Ordinance 1975, where the withholding of assent to part of a section changed the whole sense and intention of the legislation- again without reference or consultation. </para>
      <para>In the case of the Northern Territory police force, the Government, acting on an Administrative Arrangements Order, has continued to ignore the laws of the Territory. </para>
        <para>THE PUBLIC SERVICE</para>
      <para>Recommendation 17- that a Northern Territory Administration be created, comprising the existing Northern Territory Public Service and those officers of the Australian Public Service engaged in the functions to be transferred to the control of the Territory Executive. </para>
      <para>Recommendation 23- that the Australian Government co-operate fully with the Territory Executive in the provision of required services on an agency basis. </para>
      <para>Attempts by the Legislative Assembly to function as a Westminster-style parliamentary institution have been frustrated by the failure of the Government to provide staff to enable executive members to function in an executive capacity. </para>
      <para>The decision of the Government to remove senior officers of the Department of Northern Australia from Darwin to Canberra has reversed the trend towards local responsibility in the administration of the Territory and restored the old concept of the Territory as a colonial outpost of Canberra. </para>
      <para>As the duly elected representatives of the people of the Northern Territory we humbly pray that the Parliament will take steps to redress our grievances and to set right the wrongs imposed on us by the Australian Government. </para>
      <para>And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. </para>

            <para>- The Government is not hanging on to power. The Government is remaining in office because it has a mandate from the Australian people to do so. That mandate was given to it in May last year. The Prime Minister has stated repeatedly, and it is the Government&#39;s, position, that there will be no continuation of the Government unless everything that it does is constitutional and legal, and that any moneys which are expended are expended with the authority of the Parliament. The Government has stated on numerous occasions that the hardship that will be caused by the action of the Opposition must be alleviated if it is at all possible for the Government to do so. We are investigating, as we should properly investigate, whatever alternatives are available to us to ensure that the Australian people are not hurt by the actions of the Opposition. </para>

              <para>- J have just answered that question in the first part of my answer. I refer the honourable senator again to what I said. The Government will not be acting illegally or unconstitutionally. If the present position remains, the Government will continue to examine schemes which it believes are practical, legal and constitutional. When those schemes are brought to finality the Parliament will be advised accordingly. </para>

Last year <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee,</inline> who was representing the then Special Minister of State, presented to the Senate the report of the Interdepartmental Committee on the Review of the Public Works Committee Act. This report recommended a number of substantial changes to the Act which would enable the Public Works Committee to review the works of all government bodies except those bodies which are principally of a business nature, such as Qantas Airways Ltd. Under the current Act, the Public Works Committee is restricted to examining the works of Australian Government departments. Can the Minister inform the Senate how this review is progressing? </para>

            <para>Senator Poyser is a member of the Joint Public Works Committee and he has raised this matter with me on a number of occasions. I should mention to him that before considering the report of the Interdepartment Committee on the Review of the Public Works Committee Act the Government believed it to be appropriate that it should seek the views of the Public Works Committee and other interested bodies on the proposals of the Interdepartmental Committee. Those views have been received and indeed have been considered. The review of the Act was nearing completion when the Joint Committee on the Parliamentary Committee System brought down its interim report. This report makes several recommendations which, if implemented, would make substantial changes to the Public Works Committee. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>A major recommendation of the interim report of the Joint Committee on the Parliamentary Committee System relating to the Public Works Committee was that the Senate should establish a standing committee specifically empowered to carry out the functions of the Public Works Committee, the Joint Committe on the Australian Capital Territory, and the Joint Committee on the Northern Territory. I therefore have suggested to the Prime Minister that it would be inappropriate for the Government at this stage to proceed with proposed amendments to the Public Works Committee Act until the Joint Committee on the Parliamentary Committee System has been able to prepare its final report and that final report has been considered, examined and determined by the Parliament. </para>

          <para>- Yes, the statements are compatible. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> ought to consider a little more closely what he believes to be some contradiction. The Treasurer was referring to the Budget. I have just indicated in my earlier answer that the Government has been investigating alternative ways of continuing the financial arrangements which are necessary for the Government to pay its employees and to provide the necessary finance and payments to the suppliers of goods and services. I think that time will demonstrate that alternative methods which are legal and constitutional will be formulated. As I said earlier, the Parliament will be advised of them. There is no contradiction in the 2 statements. It is a matter of new methods and avenues being explored. These certainly may be different to the traditional ways but there is no contradiction in the 2 statements which have been made, as I read them. </para>

            <para>-The reports and papers to which the honourable senator refers are documents which are produced by the staff of the Royal Commission, by consultants employed by the Royal Commission and also by the task forces- there have been 5 task forces in all- which have been set up by the Royal Commission. It is in line with the Commission&#39;s policy of having its investigations open to the public that these documents generally are made available for public scrutiny in the Commission&#39;s offices. In a limited number of cases submissions to the Commission are published, I understand for sale to the public. This permits a much wider access. The main purpose of providing public access to material which is made available to the Commission is, as I understand it, to stimulate discussion within the community about the matters reported on to the Commission and to allow the Commission to examine various views which may be forthcoming from the discussion which takes place. Of course, these views will be taken into account by&#39; the Commission when it formulates its conclusions and recommendations. </para>

          <para>I know that just recently- I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle</inline> placed a question on the notice paper in relation to the matter- much publicity was given to a report prepared for the Royal Commission by Professor Caiden from the University of California. I understand that Professor Enid Campbell, herself a member of the Royal Commission, is about to produce a report on the manner in which royal commissions are established and staffed. I assume that this report will be made available by the Commission. The papers which are released by the Commission are not formal reports of the Commission, nor does acceptance of them by the Commission necessarily reflect any viewpoint or recommendations which the Commission may ultimately express in its final report. </para>

Is the Minister in agreement with a statement made by the Prime Minister recently that the Government has funds sufficient to enable it to carry on until the end of November? Is the Repatriation Department unable to meet its obligations through overspending and lack of supervision or are payments being withheld to blackmail the public and the Parliament?

            <para>- I did receive a letter from the Leader of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser,</inline> last week on the subject. He also wrote to me about the plight of some local government authorities in his electorate. I was surprised to get these letters as I had answered questions in this place a week earlier about the general situation of Regional Employment Development scheme projects and had issued a statement on 24 October on the subject generally, outlining the difficulties which the deferral of the Appropriation Bills was causing in this area of my Department&#39;s administration. I repeat for the information of honourable senators and also of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> that the $5 8m provided from Supply and the Advance to the Treasurer for the RED scheme has been exhausted and my Department is unable to meet any further claims until additional funds become available. Apparently the Leader of the Opposition has belatedly realised the difficulties which his unprincipled action has already caused local government.  His  action could also cause 20 000 people to lose their employment before the projects they are working on are completed. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> sought my urgent advice as to what he should tell the Dundas Shire Council about its outstanding claims for nearly $50,000. I advise him to tell the Shire Council that its claims will be met as soon as possible once he and his colleagues in this place decide to cease deferring the Appropriation Bills. </para>

            <para>- I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> that single supporting mothers receive a greater contribution from the Australian Government than do single supporting fathers. I do not have the precise figures in my head. I also agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> that there can well be circumstances in which a single supporting father is in a more difficult position than a single supporting mother. I do believe that we ought to have as an objective the provision of a rate of benefit for single supporting parents, whether they are fathers or mothers. I think it can be said that in the Budget which is at present before the Parliament some recognition has been made of this by way of the taxation deductions which are now available to single supporting parentswhether they are fathers or mothers- and which are of quite considerable financial benefit to the single supporting fathers. </para>

          <para>If I may be quite frank, I would have proposed that in the context of the present Budget there ought to have been some equalisation of the position of single supporting fathers to that of single supporting mothers, but the Government felt that this was not a time for new initiatives so far as expenditure on social welfare is concerned. In this, as in so many other very deserving fields, action which we hope will be taken in the near future when we are able to take it was not taken because of the general overall economic situation. But I do agree with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> has said so far as the principle of it is concerned.

The untied grants to local government by the Australian Government come within a special appropriation of grants for local government. The Bill providing for them was introduced into and passed by the House of Representatives last week and is due to be introduced into the Senate this week. Of course, there are, I think, some 34 Bills lying on the Senate notice paper because the Senate has been debating whether the Government will receive passage of the present Appropriation Bills and the existing Loan Bill. The Local Government Grants Bill makes provision for an amount of $79.9m to be made available to local government organisations throughout Australia. I can assure the honourable senators that it is the wish of the Government that this Bill be passed as soon as possible so that the resultant assistance to local government organisations can be provided by the Australian Government. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. Some weeks ago I asked him about Medibank refusing to pay for medical services rendered by doctors to doctors and members of their families or doctors in partnership and their families, and received the reassurance from the Minister that he would see that this practice was stopped. I draw his attention to a segment of a letter from the Queensland State Manager of Medibank to a Queensland doctor dated 10 October 1975, which reads: </para>

            <para>- I cannot remember giving any undertaking that I would see that a practice would stop. I think what I said at the time was that I was not even aware that the practice existed. If the practice were as I recollect that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheil</inline> put it- that medical practitioners were not being paid by Medibank for treating other medical practitioners, and he put it in as broad a term as that- I would regard it as being improper. I think that there are of necessity special arrangements which apply when medical practitioners are treating members of their own families or their partners. However, 1 shall obtain a more detailed answer in relation to the principles which underlie the letter from the Queensland Manager of Medibank and let <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheil</inline> have the answer in due course. </para>

            <para>- I preface my question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate by reminding the Minister that the Australian Liberal Government in February 1969 negotiated a German loan for 200 million deutchemarks, roughly the equivalent of $A59,6 12,000, on which the expenses were $A 1,824,000 and interest was at the abnormally high rate, at that time, of 6V4 per cent. Can the Minister inform the Parliament whether a prominent member of the Liberal Party was involved in the negotiations for that particular loan and received a substantial fee for his troubles? Will the Minister investigate the circumstances of the loan and inform the Parliament of his findings? </para>

            <para>- I have seen statements attributed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lewis,</inline> in the same way as I have seen statements attributed to people who are responsible for the management of State Government insurance offices and statements made by private insurers who handle both compulsory third party insurance and workers compensation insurance about the difficulties that both of those branches of general insurance are getting into. Iri a statement reported to have been made on 14 May last <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lewis</inline> said that if some sort of national compensation scheme were not passed quickly he would be obliged to make alternative arrangements within New South Wales for compulsory third party and workers compensation insurance. I am not aware of any approach which has been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lewis</inline> to the Government in general or to me in particular about any assistance that could be given to him. In fact, on 19 March last I did have a meeting with all the relevant Ministers from the different States, including the New South Wales Minister, and I did receive submissions from them with regard to national compensation. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As the honourable senator knows, the Government is now in the process of preparing a new National Rehabilitation and Compensation Bill to deal with the proposals for a national compensation scheme which will take into account most if not all of the recommendations which were made by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I was rather puzzled to see a report in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> on 30 October which stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lewis</inline> thought that this was the wrong time to introduce such a scheme because it was so extravagant. It seemed additionally puzzling in view of the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lewis&#39;s</inline> own Government Insurance Office announced that it had lost $8m last year on workers compensation insurance and $37m on compulsory third party insurance. The net cost to employers of compulsory workers compensation and third party premiums this year is estimated to be $700m. The plateau cost of the national compensation scheme, after allowances have been made for taxation, would be only $535m. In fact, the national compensation scheme would be considerably cheaper than the scheme which is at present being operated in New South Wales by the New South Wales Government Insurance Office. I find it quite bewildering why <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lewis</inline> who has already expressed serious concern about the state of third party and workers compensation insurance in New South Wales, should be adopting this attitude towards a government which is doing something which he himself said only a few months ago was essential. </para>

The question is whether the issuing of radio licences by the Government under the Wireless and Telegraphy Act rather than under the Broadcasting and Television Act is legal, and whether the Government has received an opinion from the Attorney-General on this matter. I also ask the Postmaster-General: Is he aware that there are legal opinions which question the legality of the issue of such licences? As he has had the opinion of the Attorney-General on this matter for some time, will he now present it to the Senate; if not, is it because the AttorneyGeneral&#39;s opinion also places in question the issue of such licences? </para>

I ask the Minister what effect this recession is having, or could have, on Australian coal exports to Japan and what action the Government may be planning to take. </para>

            <para>- There has been a slowing down in the Japanese steel industry this year- a drop in production of about 20 per cent compared with last year. Under the arrangements which we have concerning our export of coal to Japan, it is agreed with the Japanese steel industry that despite any downturn in the Japanese production of steel, the rate of shipment of coal will be observed under the contractual arrangements which have been entered into. It is not expected that there will be any detrimental effect on our exports of coal. There has been a fall-off in exports in the last few months due primarily to industrial reasons. No doubt this has enabled the Japanese to keep their stocks of coal at manageable levels, although I understand that they are reaching virtual maximum capacity now in the storing of coking coals. There is no immediate danger to our coal exports. As I have mentioned, the Japanese will maintain their level of shipments under the agreements which have been entered into. </para>

            <para>- I ask a question of the Minister for Repatriation and Compensation. In view of substantially increased funds provided by the Senate in appropriations earlier this year for the period to the end of November, can the Minister say why the Department of Repatriation and Compensation is unable to pay nursing home accounts for repatriation patients for September? Is it a fact that the Prime Minister stated that the Government had sufficient funds to the end of November? Will the Minister table in the Senate this week a statement certified by the Treasury indicating the current financial position of his Department in order that the Senate can determine whether the Department is unable to meet its obligations through overspending or unnecessary spending? Does the Minister agree that if there are no funds this is indicative of the Government&#39;s economic mismanagement? If there are funds available, is there not a continuation of the scaremongering campaign which has been directed by this Government against various sections of the community? </para>

I have asked my Department to look into the question of protecting other wearers of helmets, such as those worn on building sites or mining and industrial helmets which would not be subject to the standards code, to see if we can establish a standard for such helmets. As from today, traffic helmets that do not meet the requirements of the Standards Association will be prohibited imports. </para>

            <para>- It is true that the supplementary hospital insurance tables which have been offered by the Medical Benefits Fund of Australia Ltd. as ancillary to the Medibank hospital agreement in New South Wales have been rejected by the Government. They have not been rejected arbitrarily if by &#39;arbitrarily&#39; one means acting just out of the blue in rejecting propositions without there being some principles on which they are rejected. In fact, these tables have been rejected because they do not comply with the specific guidelines which have been set down for the approval of such ancillary health insurance which the private funds can offer. The Government has an obligation under the National Health Act to protect the contributors to these private funds. That obligation is specifically made clear in the National Health Act. The guidelines have made clear to funds how they can change their rules so that new tables can be offered in order to provide the additional or fringe benefits. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The proposed table of the Medical Benefits Fund lists a wide range of expenses which the Fund claims are associated with the hospitalisation of people who go into a private hospital. This was one of the matters which particularly attracted our attention. We do not think that on the propositions that the Fund has put forward it is likely there would be any surplus, after the private hospital daily bed charges in New South Wales had been met, for moneys to be available, firstly, to provide some of the additional benefits which the Fund claims it can make available. Secondly, we have some objection to the manner in which the Fund has asked for a contribution of $1.86 a family for the theatre fees in private hospitals. Other funds have included the payment of theatre fees in private hospitals amongst the general ancillary payments which are asked for if one takes out additional insurance with those funds. </para>
          <para>In addition to that, the Medical Benefits Fund wishes to make provision for sickness benefits which go beyond the normal provision of hospital and medical expenses which are covered by Medibank and which it is intended should be covered by the funds in their ancillary arrangements which they propose to make through their private subscribers. The provision of sickness benefits is not a proper matter for funds of this type. There is nothing wrong with people taking out sickness benefit insurance, but it ought to be done through an ordinary private insurer and not through a hospital or medical benefits fund. The guidelines and the reasons why the Government insisted on these guidelines were contained in 2 circulars which were forwarded to all of the registered hospital benefit organisations in New South Wales on 13 August and 19 September last. The Medical Benefits Fund is the only fund whose proposals have been rejected. All the other funds have complied with the guidelines of the Government under the National Health Act. </para>

            <para>- I do not know whether there are statistics in the sense that a systematic analysis of this proposition has been done, but certainly the proposition has been put to me that former prisoners of war, particularly prisoners of war of the Japanese, are susceptible to arthritis. I think this may well be the case. I will take up <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bessell</inline> &#39;s suggestion and ask that some investigation be made into this matter with a view to giving consideration to his proposition. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I think it should be remembered that the Government, in the 1974-75 Budget, provided for all hospital and medical expenses of former prisoners of war to be met as part of the repatriation entitlement of these returned servicemen. To a certain extent, that provision has lost some of its relevance since the introduction of Medibank. I can well appreciate that there are a number of particular problems from which former prisoners of war are suffering. Arthritis could well be one of them. I believe it is a proper matter for study by the relevant officers of my Department. </para>

            <para>- Talks on Portuguese Timor between the Indonesian and Portuguese Foreign Ministers took place in Rome between 1 and 3 November. A communique was issued at the conclusion of the talks. We have not yet received the full text of the communique, but according to news reports the 2 Foreign Ministers agreed that there should be a restoration of peace and order in the Territory and that resolution of the conflict should be sought through talks with all the political groups in Portuguese </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Timor. The Portuguese have reportedly agreed to try to arrange such talks in the near future. The 2 Foreign Ministers, in their communique, were also reported to have agreed that in the implementation of the decolonisation of Portuguese Timor it would be essential to safeguard the legitimate interests of the countries in the region, particularly Indonesia&#39;s interest as the nearest neighbouring country. </para>
          <para>The Government welcomes this reported outcome of the talks. It has long urged that the solution of the problems of Portuguese Timor should be sought through talks between Portugal and all the Timorese parties. We have consistently held that any durable solution must recognise the importance of the Indonesian interest in the territory. We hope that the talks now foreshadowed will lead to the restoration of a decolonisation program like that agreed earlier at Bacan in which the claims of all political parties could be satisfactorily decided. </para>
          <para>May I add one thing, which is not a direct answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Everett&#39;s</inline> question. The reports from Portuguese Timor are that there is a considerable amount of tension in the area. As I mentioned in regard to Beirut last week, I make the point that people who do not have very important business there ought to look to whether they should remain in an area which is potentially dangerous and in which there is not a normal war being fought, as there is not in Beirut, which would put themselves in considerable danger. </para>

          <para>- The constitutional crisis is quite obvious. It has been brought about by the Opposition taking an unprecedented step in refusing the Appropriation Bills. I should have thought that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> would be aware of that as he has been a member of the Senate for the past few months. As <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden,</inline> the Treasurer, pointed out only yesterday, certain items of normal expenditure will not reach the Australian people. They have been referred to here this morning in answer to some questions. </para>

        <para class="block">The Appropriation Bills do not cover all government spending, as we well know. A great deal of spending goes through in separate legislation. Even under the proposals which the Government is considering, there would still be certain areas in which the Government would not be able to expedite payments. </para>

            <para>- Everyone who enters Australia is subject to the application of the Act and regulations under which the Department of Police and Customs operates and is liable to search. The procedure at landing places, such as port terminals, is to random search passengers, so everyone is not searched. I think the case referred to is one where someone came in with a boat and as a result a number of people were charged with having prohibited imports of the narcotic cannabis. Two individuals who are now subject to a charge were searched but they were not searched at the point of landing. I think that as they are subject to police prosecution we should not say any more on the matter at this stage. But still, they were liable to be searched and two of them subsequently were searched. </para>

              <para>- There is particularly good co-operation, especially between the Narcotics Section of the Department of Police and Customs and the State Police Drug Squad. There is co-operation also between the Australia Police and the State police forces right throughout Australia. I think there was co-operation in this particular case but, as I understand the case, drugs were landed in an area in Western Australia. This case is an example of one of the near impossibilities that exist in policing our coastline in Australia. There has been cooperation between the State and Commonwealth Police and the Air Force in this particular case with the result that the drugs were discovered and arrests took place. </para>

            <para>-The Government has consistently taken the view that all aspects of the National Estate must be protected from the pillaging of those who seek personal benefit from the cultural heritage of the Australian people. I suggest that in the past little has been done to protect items of our cultural heritage from the inroads of overseas museums, galleries and private collectors. I believe that the message is now becoming known and that overseas collectors are turning their attention elsewhere. When I heard of the sale referred to by the honourable senator which included centennial medals struck as long ago as 1888, I immediately contacted my colleague, the Minister for Police and Customs. He reported that the export of vintage coins was already controlled under the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations. He said that he would take urgent action to ensure that the centennial medals were kept in Australia. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh,</inline> in his capacity as Minister for Police and Customs, issued a Press statement to that effect shortly afterwards. </para>

            <para>- I have heard suggestions of this kind made by way of questions asked in this chamber by members of the Opposition. All that I can say is that the Government has adopted the practice religiously that the Australian Broadcasting Commission, financed by the Government, should have complete political and programming independence. Any matter coming within the purview of the Australian Broadcasting Commission is a matter for the responsibility of the  Chairman  of the ABC, Professor Downing, the members of the ABC and the management of the ABC. I do not for one moment suggest that there is bias one way or the other on the part of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. In the time I was Minister for the Media I had great respect for its general approach to matters of current affairs. However, if there be bias in the media generally I suggest that honourable senators refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> &#39;s speech on the Appropriation Bills last week concerning allegations he made in relation to certain sections of the newspaper medium. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister for Labor and Immigration. I refer to the curtailment of the working week at Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd as an alternative to the retrenchment of 155 personnel. This matter was the subject of a public meeting in Hobart yesterday. It is. accounted for by a depression in the confectionery trade throughout Australia generally. I refer to the announcement in this morning&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> of retrenchment following curtailment of production of steel at Whyalla- I think to the extent of 30 per cent- due to the depressed state of the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd steel market, both domestic and overseas. Does the Minister keep himself systematically informed of all announcements of retrenchment in the labour market due to the depression in industry? If so, what is the trend for the month of October? </para>

            <para>- I suppose one would have to be a member of the Opposition to place any reliance on a report in the newspaper the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> which is the authority for the honourable senator&#39;s question. The article in question implies that this man Saysavath Vichidvongsa, a Laotian Colombo plan student, received only acknowledgments of his letters to my Department. This is not correct. On 2 October 1975 the Department wrote to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Vichidvongsa</inline> telling him that as he came to Australia on a Colombo Plan award the question of his continued stay in Australia and of the admission of his wife and child was a matter for determination by the Australian Development Assistance Agency which falls within the responsibility of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Similar advice was given on 23 September to the Honourable A. J. Grassby, Commissioner Designate for Community Relations who had made representations on behalf of Vichidvongsa. My Department&#39;s file shows that on 8 October 1975 the Australian Development Assistance Agency also wrote to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Grassby</inline> about the same case, indicating that inquiries would be conducted through the Sydney office of the Agency. The article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> has been brought to the attention of the Australian Development Assistance Agency and the Department of Foreign Affairs and they are currently making inquiries as to the situation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Vichidvongsa.</inline></para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It would appear that the ADAA office in Sydney, in providing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Vichidvongsa</inline> with a return ticket to Laos for departure next week, has followed its normal procedure for all Colombo Plan students who complete their course. The changed political situation in Laos would not have been weighed as a factor. Instructions which ADAA sent to its State offices on 30 October, following an interdepartmental meeting on 29 October in Canberra which considered the implications for Laotian students here of the changed political situation in Laos, would not have been acted upon at the time <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Vichidvongsa</inline> was provided with his ticket. When the ADAA and Department of Foreign Affairs inquiries are completed my Department will be informed. However, the matter at this stage is not one in which I as a Minister for Labor and Immigration am directly involved. My colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs has responsibility for Colombo Plan and other sponsored students. That, I think, also answers the section of the question concerning the Prime Minister&#39;s responsibility. </para>

            <para>- I am aware, as I think everybody is, that private insurers are getting out of the compulsory third party insurance field as fast as their legs will carry them. In a number of States they have completely abandoned the field to the State government insurance offices and, having abandoned this unprofitable field to the State government insurance offices, have drawn attention to the losses which the State government insurance offices have made in a field in which they will not work themselves and have used this as an argument against State enterprises. In Tasmania, where, I think, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Devitt&#39;s</inline> episodes have taken place, a number of private insurers still engage in compulsory third party insurance; but as they are on a losing proposition and, I think, all acknowledge this, they have tried to protect themselves a little by asking people who wish to take out compulsory third party insurance with them to take out all their other insurance with them as well. Whether this is a breach of the Trade Practices Act I do not know; that would be a question for the Attorney-General. </para>

The only alternative available to the motorist who has been denied third party insurance by the private insurers or has been faced with an ultimatum that he will not get third party insurance cover unless he takes out all his other insurance with them is to transfer his business to the State government insurance office in the State in which he lives or, better still, to wait a few months until the Australian Government Insurance Corporation has been established and take out all his business with it. </para>

            <para>-On 30 September 1975 <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> made certain statements during the adjournment debate. He made allegations arising from his claim to have overheard a private conversation at a table next to that at which he was seated in the parliamentary guests dining room. He stated that on 30 October 1974 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Street,</inline> in the company of a leading South Australian senator, were discussing the coming move to oust <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Snedden</inline> and what the plans would be if the move were successful&#39;. He did not mention the senator by name, but later identified him with these words: </para>

        <para class="block">That description applies to only one South Australian Liberal senator; that is to me. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> claimed by inference that I was involved in intrigue for my own advancement. At the time these allegations were made I chose to treat them with disdain. I now find that his allegations are being repeated, that their repetition is damaging to me and that an attempt is being made to damage <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> and the Liberal Party of Australia. I refer to the publication <inline font-style="italic">Inside Canberra</inline> of 10 October 1975 as an example. Finding that this situation exists, I believe that it is in my own interests and in the interests of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> and the Liberal Party, that I should reply, even though I still regard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren&#39;s</inline> scurrilous rumour creation and peddling as a poor substitute for argument and generally unworthy of any form of recognition. </para>
        <para>I emphatically deny having been present on 30 October 1974 or at any time during any conversation with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Street</inline> regarding the ousting of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Snedden.</inline> The facts are these: Firstly, I ceased to be a shadow Minister at my own request in June 1974; secondly, I have never participated in any intrigue against any Leader of my Party; thirdly, I supported <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Snedden</inline> throughout his term as Leader and in the ballot in March 1975 when he was defeated- a fact which can be corroborated by another senator who sat next to me during that ballot; fourthly, although there have been occasions when I have dined with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Street,</inline> as I have with most if not all of my Liberal Party colleagues, I have never been present at any conversation such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> described. </para>

I want to say further that if what I am saying is untrue, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laucke</inline> has said, I must have very great powers as a clairvoyant because many of the things that I divulged in the Senate on the night of 30 September have now come true.

          <para>Honourable senators will recall that on 27 May I announced that the Australian Government had approved the continuation of the minimum reserve price arrangements for wool during the 1975-76 season. The Australian Wool Corporation has been authorised to continue operating a minimum floor price equivalent to 250 cents per kilo clean for 2 1 micron wool at auction. The Government has made it clear that this authority will apply throughout the 1975-76 wool selling season. </para>
          <para>During the 1974-75 season a total of $289m was advanced to the Corporation by the Government to finance the purchase of wool under the reserve price scheme, and to provide for advances to growers. This total was made up of $ 1 3m which had been available in the Australian Wool Corporation Working Capital Trust Fund, and $276m which was advanced from the special appropriation of $350m under the Wool Marketing (Loan) Acts. </para>
          <para>During that season, the Corporation bought extremely heavily, especially earlier in the season. During the first 3 months of the selling season the Corporation&#39;s purchases averaged 43 per cent of offerings at auction. As the season progressed the market strengthened considerably, and in the last 3 months of the season the Corporation&#39;s purchases averaged 10 per cent of offerings. Towards the end of the season there was a net reduction of some thousands of bales of wool in the Corporation&#39;s stockpile. At 30 June the Corporation&#39;s net purchases had averaged 33 per cent of the season&#39;s offerings at auction and its stockpile of wool had reached some 1.6m bales. </para>
          <para>The purpose of the present Bill is to amend the Wool Marketing (Loan) Acts to increase the amount of the appropriation under that act to $356m. After account is taken of the $276m advanced to the Corporation last year, the remaining appropriation available for advances to the Corporation in 1975-76 will be $80m. Honourable senators will recall that this is the amount which is included in the Budget for advances to the Corporation. The Government also will guarantee new borrowings by the Corporation of $70m from trading banks. Those borrowings would be additional to borrowings under the existing facility of $34m, made available by a consortium of trading banks under Government guarantee. </para>
          <para>In addition to this provision of $150m, the Corporation will be able to finance wool purchases and advances to growers, from the cash proceeds of the 5 per cent levy on growers returns from sales of wool, estimated to amount to $46.25m in 1975-76. This is in accordance with the arrangements agreed with the Australian Wool Industry Conference and provided for in the Wool Industry Act. As honourable senators will be aware, advances to the Corporation under the Wool Marketing (Loan) Acts are made to the Corporation by the Treasurer, on terms and conditions determined by him, after the customary consultation with me. </para>
          <para>I take the opportunity to refer to reports which appeared in the media, following the presentation of the statements attached to the Budget Speech, to the effect that Government assistance to rural industries would be reduced by some $200m this year. That amount is, of course, roughly the extent of the reduction in advances from the Government to the Wool Corporation, from $289m last year to the provision of $80m this year. Honourable senators will appreciate that this is a complete misconception. There is no reduction whatever in the effective support for the Wool Corporation. In both years the Government has pledged its support for the floor price at 250c. We judge the provision of $150m-$80m from the Budget, $70m by way of Government guaranteed borrowing from the trading banksto be adequate for this purpose. However, as the Treasurer made abundantly clear in the Budget Speech, we will as a matter of course keep the position under close review throughout the year. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

          <para>The purpose of this Bill is to authorise revisions to the financial assistance grants arrangements settled at the Premiers&#39; Conference held on 19 June 1975, and to authorise adjustments to the financial assistance grants payable to South Australia and Tasmania in connection with the railway transfers in those States and in connection with the former State&#39;s withdrawal from the Grants Commission system. The changes to the financial assistance grants arrangements provided for by this Bill are an increase in the financial assistance grants of $220m in 1975-76 above those which would otherwise be payable under existing legislation, and the addition of this amount to the base for calculating the grants in subsequent years; an increase in the &#39;betterment&#39; factor from the present 1.8 per cent to 3.0 per cent to apply for purposes of calculating the financial assistance grants for 1976-77 and later years; an addition of $5m to the base amount on which Western Australia&#39;s grant for 1975-76 and subsequent years will be calculated; an addition of $2 1 m to the base amount on which South Australia&#39;s financial assistance grant for 1975-76 and subsequent years is to be calculated; and the deduction of $10. 7m from the base amount on which Tasmania&#39;s financial assistance grant for 1975-76 and subsequent years is to be calculated. </para>
          <para>As honourable senators will know, the financial assistance grants are the chief form in which grants are made to the States for general revenue purposes. They are subject to no conditions as to the purpose for which they may be spent. Very briefly, the present arrangements provide for the financial assistance grants to be determined by a formula under which the grant paid to each State in each financial year is calculated by taking the grant paid to it in the preceding year and increasing that grant by factors which take into account the growth in each State&#39;s population, the increase in average wages in Australia as a whole and a &#39;betterment&#39; factor to assist the States in improving the standard and range of their services. In accordance with the Government&#39;s undertaking to review the existing arrangements before the end of 1974-75, consultations took place with the governments of the States and with their respective officers prior to last June&#39;s Premiers&#39; Conference. At that conference the Australian Government agreed to introduce legislation to provide for the first three of the changes to the financial assistance grants arrangements which I listed earlier. </para>
          <para>The details of our consultations with the States prior to and at last June&#39;s Premiers&#39; Conference, and the basis of the changes agreed to, are set out in the Budget paper entitled: &#39;Payments to or for the States and Local Government Authorities 1975-76&#39;. I only point out here that the $220m increase in the financial assistance grants is a very substantial amount, particularly when it is considered that this increase is on top of the increases produced in the grants this year by the operation of the formula. Furthermore, the addition of this amount to the base for calculating the grants in future years, and the raising of the betterment&#39; factor from 1.8 per cent to 3.0 per cent, will ensure that the States will receive further large increases in general revenue funds in 1 976-77 and subsequent years. </para>
          <para>I should also explain here that the addition of $5m to Western Australia&#39;s grant is being made following representations by the Western Australian Government in relation to the additional financial assistance grants it has received since 1967-68 following its withdrawal from the special grants system. The remaining two adjustments to the grants arrangements are connected with the transfer of railways in South Australia and Tasmania and with the former State&#39;s withdrawal from the Grants Commission. The addition of $2 1 m to South Australia&#39;s base grant is comprised of: (i) a reduction of $29m, being an agreed figure representing the State&#39;s nonmetropolitan railway loss in 1974-75; (ii) an increase of $2 5 m providing general budgetary assistance to the State; and (iii) a further increase of $2 5 m to compensate the State for loss of special grants which it received prior to its withdrawal from the Grants Commission system. </para>
          <para>The deduction of $10.7m from Tasmania&#39;s base grant is comprised of: (i) a reduction of $14m being an agreed figure representing the State&#39;s railway loss in 1974-75; and (ii) an increase of $3.3 m providing general budgetary assistance to the State. </para>
          <para>Turning to the details of the Bill, the first 2 clauses are of a machinery nature. Clause 3 of the Bill provides for the amendment of the States Grants Act 1973-74- the legislation which at present authorises the payment of financial assistance grants to the States- by the insertion of 4 new sub-sections to section 6, namely subsections (5), (6), (7) and (8). Sub-section (5) specifies that an addition of $2 1 m is to be made to the base for calculating the grant payable to </para>
          <para class="block">South Australia in 1 975-76 and subsequent years under the formula laid down in earlier parts of section 6. Sub-section (6) specifies that an addition of $5m is to be made to the base for calculating the grant payable to Western Australia in 1975-76 and subsequent years. Subsection (7) specifies that an addition of $4.3m is to be made to the base for calculating the grant payable to Tasmania in 1975-76 and subsequent years. The $4.3m is the difference between the addition of $15m made to Tasmania&#39;s grant under section 6A of the existing Act- which is to be repealed under clause 4 of the present Billand the deduction of $10. 7m to be made to Tasmania&#39;s grant in connection with the railway transfer in that State. </para>
          <para>Sub-section (8) specifies that the &#39;betterment&#39; factor in the formula is to be raised from the present 1.8 per cent to 3.0 per cent for purposes of calculating the grants in 1976-77 and subsequent years. Clause 4 of the Bill provides for the insertion of a new section 7 consisting of two subsections. The first of these specifies that $220m is to be added to the grants payable in 1975-76 under section 6, and distributed among the States in the same proportion as the grants payable under section 6. Sub-section (2) of the new section 7 specifies that the $220m is to be added to the base for calculating the grants payable in 1 976-77 and subsequent years. </para>
          <para>Finally, clause 5 of the Bill provides for the amendment of section 1 1 of the existing Act in order to specify that the financial assistance grants arrangements are to be reviewed again before the end of 1979-80. Full details of the financial assistance grants to be paid to the States in 1975-76 and the nature of the formula for calculating the grants in subsequent years are given in chapter 2 of the Budget paper entitled: Payments to or for the States and Local Government Authorities 1975-76&#39;. </para>
          <para>After incorporating the changes I have outlined and on the basis of current estimates of increases in population and average wages, the financial assistance grants are estimated to total $3, 184.6m in the current financial year. This is $8 10.8m or about 34 per cent higher than in the previous year. It would, 1 believe, be appropriate for me at this stage to refer to the overall position in relation to Australian Government assistance to the States and their authorities in 1975-76. It is estimated that over 38 per cent of outlays from the Australian Government&#39;s Budget in 1975-76 will take the form of payments to or for the States or their authorities. Such payments are expected to grow much more rapidly than other forms of outlays- that is outlays on matters for which the Australian Government is directly responsible. Payments to or for the States and their authorities are expected to increase by over 30 per cent, compared with an increase of about 1 8 per cent in all other Budget outlays. </para>
          <para>This very large increase in payments to or for the States- amounting to about $2,000m- is attributable to a number of factors. First, and most important, is the very large increase- about $900m- in general purpose funds- that is untied&#39; funds which the States are free to spend as they decide themselves. This reflects, amongst other things, the improved financial assistance grants arrangements which I have been discussing. Secondly, the large increase in payments to the States reflects the new Medibank arrangements for financing the running costs of public hospitals, under which payments of the order of $700m are to be made to the States in 1975-76. The purpose of the new arrangements is, of course, to improve the quality and availability of health care and to rationalise and make more equitable the financing thereof. However, the new Medibank arrangements will also have the effect of providing very substantial and continuing relief to the States&#39; budgets which in effect amounts to further general assistance which the States are free to use as they decide themselves. Thirdly, the increased allocations for local government, including $79.9m as untied assistance as recommended by the Grants Commission, and about $97m under the Regional Employment Development scheme, are relevant. </para>
          <para>In other areas of payments to or for the States there are lesser increases or, in some cases, relatively small reductions. This is consistent with the Government&#39;s overall budgetary strategy of expenditure restraint. Taking all forms of payments to the States together, however, and looking particularly at the area of untied assistance, it is clear that the States and their authorities have come out of the Budget quite well. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

            <para>- Following upon the comments made by the Special Minister of State <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Douglas McClelland),</inline> the Opposition is willing to give immediate passage to this and the other related Bills. In the ordinary course of events, of course, a Bill such as this one would take its normal course of debate in this Senate and be entitled to scrutiny by the Senate; but the Government has indicated that it desires the Bill and the Opposition proposes to let it have it. In those circumstances, I wish to make some very brief remarks. This is a Bill which essentially aims to bring about new and revised financial assistance grants arrangements which were settled at the Premiers Conference on 19 June 1975. Briefly, the Bill authorises adjustments, firstly, for South Australia and Tasmania with regard to rail transfers and, secondly, for South Australia with regard to that State&#39;s withdrawal from the Grants Commission. The Bill provides for an increase of $220m to the base from which the grants shall be calculated in a subsequent year. It proposes that for the years 1976-77 and beyond the betterment factor should increase from 1.8 per cent to 3 per cent. It provides an addition of $5m to the base amount on which Western Australia&#39;s grant for the year 1975-76 is calculated. It adds $21m to the base amount on which South Australia&#39;s grant is calculated. As a result of a deduction of $ 14m for rail losses in Tasmania and a $3.3m general Budget addition, it deducts $ 10.7m from Tasmania. That is the substance of the Bill, to which the Opposition will agree. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I say simply that in this Bill we are perpetuating a formula which, under this and previous governments, has proved to be very unsatisfactory. The formula itself takes the grant of the previous year, increases it by factors which take into account increases in population, increases in average wages and a betterment factor to assist in improvement; and, when it does so, it inevitably produces a result whereby the States in their general purpose revenue grants receive less in total than the ordinary growth rate of Commonwealth revenue. In other words, the States continuously get a worse deal than the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth raises its income tax from the States and gives back less to the States for general purposes. This is doubly unsatisfactory because, in basic terms, in the <inline font-style="italic">Vh</inline> years that this Government has been in office it has used special purposes grants to erode the sovereignty of the States and therefore to destroy them. It is therefore of prime necessity that for the future there should be a major change in the whole approach of the Government in Canberra towards the finances of State and local government. It is in foreshadowing that and in foreshadowing the Federal Opposition&#39;s announced policies of an entirely new deal for the States that we will allow this Bill to pass. </para>

          <para class="block">The main purpose of this Bill is to authorise the payment in 1975-76 of special grants of $36.3m to Queensland and $2. 5m to South Australia. These payments are in accordance with the recommendations of the Grants Commission contained in its Forty-Second Report on Special Assistance foi States, which has been tabled by the Special Minister of State <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Douglas McClelland).</inline> The Bill also seeks authority for payment of advances to Queensland in the early months of 1976-77, pending receipt of the Commission&#39;s recommendations for that year and enactment of any necessary legislation to provide for the grant that may be paid to the State in that year. </para>
          <para>The Australian Government makes special grants to certain of the States to compensate them for such factors as lower capacity to raise revenue from their own resources and higher costs in providing government services of a standard similar to those in the financially stronger States. When special grants were first paid they constituted the only regular form of general revenue assistance paid to the financially weaker States for this purpose. For many years now, however, the main way in which special compensatory assistance has been provided has been through the higher per capita financial assistance grants paid to the 4 less populous States. The financial assistance grants, are, of course, the main general revenue grants to the States. The special grants may, therefore, be regarded as supplementing the financial assistance grants, and as having the special characteristic of being independently as well as expertly assessed by the Grants Commission. </para>
          <para>In arriving at its recommendations, the Grants Commission makes an assessment of the &#39;financial needs&#39; of the claimant States. To quantify these needs, the Commission compares in detail the finances of each claimant State with those of New South Wales and Victoria, taking into account differences in revenue-raising capacity and differences in the cost of providing comparable services. The payments of special grants recommended by the Grants Commission consist of 2 parts. One part is based on a preliminary estimate of the claimant State&#39;s financial need in the current financial year, and is treated as an advance payment subject to adjustment 2 years later when the Commission has compared in detail the finances of the claimant and standard States. The other part represents the final adjustment to the advance payment made 2 years earlier and is known as the completion payment. This adjustment may be positive or negative and therefore may result in the final grant in respect of that year being higher or lower than the original advance payment. </para>
          <para>The Commission has recommended that an advance payment of $25m be made to Queensland in 1975-76- an increase of 67 per cent on that made for 1974-75- and that a completion payment of $1 1.3m be paid to the State in respect of 1973-74. The 1975-76 advance grant will, of course, be subject to adjustment, if necessary, in 1977-78. The $2. 5m payment to South Australia referred to in this Bill is a completion payment in respect of 1973-74. </para>
          <para>For the information of honourable senators, 1 mention that as part of the negotiations on the transfer of South Australia&#39;s non-metropolitan railways, arrangements were agreed with the State for withdrawal from the Grants Commission system at the end of 1974-75. To compensate the State for the loss of special grants, an addition of $25m is to be made to the 1974-75 base&#39; on which the State&#39;s financial assistance grant for 1975-76 is to be calculated. This is provided for in the States Grants Bill 1975. I also add, for clarity, that payments totalling $ 16.434m were also made to the State in 1974-75 in this connection, comprising amounts of: $10m in lieu of the completion payment which the State would have expected to receive in 1976-77 in respect of 1974-75 if the State had remained claimant under the procedures of the Grants Commission; and $6.434m being payment of the &#39;unused assessed grants&#39; referred to in paragraph 1-17 of the Grants Commission&#39;s Forty-first Report. </para>
          <para>The Commission&#39;s recommendations have been adopted by Parliament each year since the Commission&#39;s inception and the Government considers that they should be accepted on this occasion. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

          <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is to authorise payments, in 1975-76, of amounts totalling $79,908,000 to local governing bodies throughout Australia. These payments are in accord with the recommendations of the Grants Commission contained in its Second Report on Financial Assistance to Local Government which I tabled in the Senate on 19 August 1975. They represent an increase of almost 42 per cent on the 1 974-75 allocations of $56. 3m. The 844 local governing bodies which will benefit from the passing of this Bill comprise 95 per cent of all the bodies which applied for financial assistance. Last year, 13 councils chose not to apply for assistance. This year all eligible local governing bodies sought grants. Our aim is to reduce inequalities between local governing authorities throughout Australia. The Australian Government believes that until the barriers of inequality have been broken down, local government will not be in a position to fulfil its proper role as a true partner in the federal system. </para>
          <para>Since coming to office, the Government has vigorously pursued its commitment to strengthen the status of local government. The Government&#39;s decision to extend the Grants Commission operation to local government represented an historic breakthrough. It enabled the Grants Commission to play the same role in reducing inequalities between local governing authorities as it has since 1933 in reducing inequalities between the States. It gave local government, for the first time, access to untied Federal funds. In accordance with the principles of fiscal equalisation which have been developed by the Grants Commission over many years the grants are designed to reduce inequalities between local governing bodies in the provision of services to their communities. Again there will be no conditions attached to the expenditure of the grants this year. They are untied grants completely without strings. The grants are not intended to replace existing State Government grants, or rates and charges by councils. They will be made to the States for payment to local governing bodies to supplement their general revenues to enable them to provide services of a standard comparable with those provided by councils elsewhere. The nature of the equalisation process is such that in any year some local governing bodies will receive lower grants than their neighbouring councils. Some will receive no grants. In this year&#39;s program, the number of councils not receiving a grant was reduced to forty-one. Last year 70 councils did not receive a grant. </para>
          <para>The Commission&#39;s methods require that comprehensive and up-to-date financial and statistical information be submitted by councils as a basis for assessment of their claims. But the </para>
          <para class="block">Commission&#39;s assessment does not rest there. It also ensures it has a first-hand appreciation of the problems faced by councils. During its second round of public hearings which led up to these recommendations, members of the Grants Commission travelled extensively making inspections in all regions and in all States to see at first hand the problems of local government. Over the last 40 years, the Grants Commission has earned for itself an enviable reputation for its role in reducing the financial inequalities which exist between the Australian States. Under its new <inline font-weight="bold">chairman- Mr Justice</inline> Rae ElseMitchellthe Commission is continuing to bring to bear the same expertise and sympathetic understanding to the problem of reducing the inequalities which abound in local government. A total of over $136m in equalisation grants has been earmarked for payment through State Governments to specified councils in the 2 years of the scheme &#39;s operation. </para>
          <para>This period has witnessed significant progress towards the new federalism in which local government will take its rightful role in a balanced working partnership with the State and Federal Governments. It is to be hoped that the current Australasian joint study into local government finances, which involves representatives of the 3 tiers of government, will provide the kind of solutions that will cement that partnership. The Grants Commission scheme is an excellent example of the level of co-operation and understanding that can be achieved between Federal, State and Local Government. The Government believes that these grants will go a long way towards alleviating the problems of local government. The many letters of appreciation the Government is receiving from councils support this belief and reflect the widespread approval of the initiative the Government has taken in making this form of untied grant available. </para>
          <para>I turn now to the detail of the Bill. Clauses 4 and 7 are intended to ensure that out of the moneys payable to the States under the Act the States will pay to the local governing bodies the amounts specified for each body in the Schedule to the Act and that the payments of those amounts will be unconditional and will be made without undue delay before 1 July 1 976. Clause 5 provides for the situation of a local governing body ceasing to exist before the commencement of the Act or before receiving payment for all or part of the amount specified in the Schedule. This situation might arise, for example, upon the amalgamation of local governing bodies. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

            <para>- The Opposition will support the Local Government Grants Bill and will very willingly give it a speedy passage. Honourable senators will recall that last year I spent quite some wearying weeks urging the Government, once the Grants Commission had made its decisions, to get the Bills passed by the Senate so that the moneys could go out to local government bodies. It is in that spirit that we give a speedy passage to this Bill today. I will be brief and I hope not too provocative in my comments. The simple fact is that local government, being the poorest relation of the 3 spheres of government, is facing enormous difficulties today because of the huge rate of inflation which has hit it, in its struggle to keep alive in its rating system, and with the high interest rates charged on its borrowing programs. These grants which total some $79.9m are not insignificant in themselves. Nevertheless, they in no way make up for the erosion caused by inflation and by high interest rates. The real cure or relief for the position of local government can come only when the economy is returned to stability, when inflation is mitigated and when interest rates are diminished. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It is well to remind honourable senators, in the brief space of time I devote to this Bill, of the origins of&#34; local government grants. I am reminded of them in a speech which the present  Chairman  of the Grants Commission made recently to, I think, a local government body. The simple fact is that a royal commission in 1967 and 1968, I think under the chairmanship of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Else.Mitchell, made recommendations to the New South Wales Government with regard to the principle of grants to the States and a Grants Commission. In 1968 the New South Wales Government set up a Grants Commission and would have greatly expanded its funds had not its revenues been restricted. We can obtain some idea of the dimensions of the assistance given by referring to the fact that last year, 1974-75, no less than $ 10m was made available by the State Government to its State Grants Commission. I draw the attention of honourable senators also to the fact that State Grants Commissions exist in 2 other States. Because local government is in such a dreadful situation in terms of its finances at this moment and because of the pressure upon it due to inflation and high interest rates, I have been very brief in my remarks and simply commend the Bill to the speediest possible passage through the Senate. </para>

          <para>- Last Thursday evening I referred to the gross and monumental incompetence of the Government in relation to its economic and financial policies and said that in 1972 the Government inherited a stable economy which within a matter of months it turned from an area of financial and economic stability to one of economic instability. I referred also to the oftrepeated claims of members of the Government that our economic problems were imported. I referred to the Organisation for Economic and Co-operation Development report of July 1975 which laid the blame clearly upon the Government. This was the first matter to which I referred in justification of the stand being taken by the Opposition at this moment. The next major issue to which I refer and for which the Government quite palpably stands condemned is the Government&#39;s lack of integrity and its deceit. Despite the boast of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> of &#39;open government&#39;, it surely must be the most secretive government in Australia&#39;s history. It has attempted, by this secretiveness, to conceal the deceit, the illegality and possibly the criminal conspiracy, if not corruption, involved in the infamous and scandalous loans affair. Nothing illustrates more the deceit and dishonesty of the Government than this issue. The Prime Minister has often claimed that no one has made any charges against the Government. The Prime Minister, like Nelson, obviously turns a blind eye, because allegations of illegality, of deceit, indeed of criminal conspiracy have been made repeatedly. The Government has given no answer to these allegations. The Prime Minister has given no answer to these allegations but has chosen to ignore them. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>We have the ACTU-Solo Enterprises Pty Ltd affair. We have the Gair affair. I could go on almost <inline font-style="italic">ad infinitum.</inline> All these matters seriously involve the integrity and honesty of the Government. It is without doubt a discredited government led by a discredited Prime Minister who conceals the lack of integrity and incompetence of the Government by irrationality and by smart aleck comments. He has turned the House of Representatives into a comedy theatre, and this is no answer to the serious charges being made against the Government. The Prime Minister is a man who repeatedly denies the truth, no doubt in a belief that if a lie is told often enough and repeated often enough, someone will believe it. One wonders whether he can even lie straight in bed. </para>
        <para>One of the untruths that the Prime Minister repeats- I regret to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> repeated it last Thursday, and I will come to that in a moment- is that the Senate has not rejected a money Bill in 75 years. I asked the Leader of the Government in the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt,</inline> on Tuesday, 21 October, whether it was a fact that in 1967, 1968 and 1970 the Senate had rejected money Bills. I refer to the Post and Telegraphs Rates Bill in 1967, the Air Navigation (Charges) Bill in 1968 and the States Grants (Receipts Duty) Bill in 1970. </para>

            <para>- That is another matter. It was not a major Bill as the Appropriation Bills are. Let us come to this matter, because the Prime Minister has some very strong views about resignation as a result of the defeat of money Bills too. I repeat what the Prime Minister had to say about this. The fact is that money Bills have been rejected, and it is time this untruth was laid to rest. I charge the Prime Minister with repeatedly telling untruths to deceive and mislead the Parliament and to deceive and mislead the public. </para>

        <para>This fact has now been acknowledged by the Government. I do not charge <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> with being dishonest, but he repeated the statement last Thursday. It is an untrue statement. The Prime Minister seems to repeat these untruths with great conviction and with all the assurance of long practice. Recently, in fact last week, at his Curtin lecture- I am indebted to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> for drawing attention to further untruths by the Prime Minister- he made an attack on the Senate. I quote from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> &#39;s speech at page 1643 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> The Prime Minister said: </para>

            <para>. it&#39;s worth looking more closely at this Opposition tactic of referring Bills to Senate committees. They do it all the time. It is a familiar and characteristic method of Liberal obstruction. They will neither vote for a Bill nor vote against it. </para>

But the Prime Minister has completely misrepresented and distorted the truth. </para>
        <para>My memory goes back to the days when the Senate was establishing these committees.

In those days <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> acknowledged the value of those committees to consider complex legislation.

            <para>- That is a very interesting point. I am talking about the steam engine which is examined well by an inspector so that the safety valve is never required for the life of the engine; but it is ensured that the safety valve is there to prevent an explosive force being built up. The power of the Senate is the same. It is not to be used without discretion, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> said. It is to be used with discretion. The power is there and I think there is an analogy between this power of the Senate and the safety valve on a steam engine. When a government, as in this case, exceeds its powers and its authority then these powers of the Senate are and were meant by the constitutional fathers to be a safeguard. If one reads the reports of the constitutional convention one sees that 20 per cent or so of the time of the proceedings of the convention was taken up with a discussion of the powers of the Senate. Those powers were given to the Senate deliberately to be used if the need should arise. They were not to be used capriciously but only if the need arose. Surely the need exists today. The Senate is exercising its powers properly and constitutionally. I regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> made the comment, in the speech  I  referred to earlier, that the Senate was acting against tradition. He is at conflict. By way of interjection he said that the Senate was breaking the Constitution. Those were his words. </para>

        <para>We have the words of the previous AttorneyGeneral, the former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy,</inline> which have been quoted very often in this chamber. We have also the words of the Prime Minister in 1 970. 1 do not wish to quote <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> in full but we know his words when he upheld without equivocation the powers of the Senate which, he said, were without limit. I think it is important that on this matter of tradition referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt, Senator Murphy</inline> is reported in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 1 8 June 1 970 at page 2647 as having said, referring to the States receipts duties legislation: </para>

        <para>In doing this the Opposition is pursuing a tradition which is well established, but in view of some doubt recently cast on it in this chamber, perhaps I should restate the position.  lt is a great pity that the then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> is not here today to restate the position because he then went on to restate it, as I said, in clear and unequivocal terms. But what of the Prime Minister, who charges the Senate with acting improperly and unconstitutionally? The Prime Minister suddenly finds a great virtue in the Senate&#39;s being stripped of its powers with respect to money Bills but in 1970 the Prime Minister took an entirely different view. He is reported at page 349 1 of House of Representatives <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for 1 2 June 1 970 as having said: </para>

            <para>- That is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall&#39;s</inline> opinion but that is a matter of political judgment.  I  do not rely on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall&#39;s</inline> political judgment because he does not have a very good track record of political judgment. So that is better left alone. I do not argue on that issue and I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hall</inline> ought to keep very quiet about it. But he is entitled to his opinion and I am entitled to mine. I am amazed at the effrontery of the Government in challenging the powers of the Senate in view of the Government&#39;s track record in the past. This must be the most cynical and hypocritical exercise in history. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland, in his attitude of righteous indignation the other day, quoted some constitutional authorities. They were selective and he is entitled to be selective in this respect if he wishes to be. But the views of the former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy,</inline> whose standards of constitutional law are so high that the Prime Minister saw fit to elevate him to the High Court, were made quite clear. He is in very good company. Before dealing with the good company that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> is now in, I mention that it always amuses me that in 1970, the then Opposition defeated money Bills and it voted against the third reading of an Appropriation Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> mentioned some of the distinguished members of the then Opposition who on 3 November- if my memory serves me correctly- attempted to defeat an Appropriation Bill in pursuance of the present Prime Minister&#39;s statement that the Budget would be defeated. They included <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt,</inline> who has a wry smile on his face. They tried to defeat it. No one could argue that they did not have the numbers. No one can tell me that if the Democratic Labor Party had supported them they would not have gone ahead and defeated the Appropriation Bills in 1970. 1 do not remember any sense of outrage from members of the Australian Labor Party. There were no challenges then to the power of the Senate and there was no irresponsible talk about unwritten conventions. </para>

            <para>- Do not tell me you were not fair dinkum, senator. I believe better of you. No unwritten conventions were spoken about which the apologists for the Government today are falling back upon. There has never been a convention. There has never been an unwritten convention. There certainly was not a convention acknowledged by the present Government in 1 970. This argument that there is a written or unwritten convention is nothing more than a pack of garbage. I do not believe the Prime Minister meant other than what he said in 1970. No smart aleck words of his can conceal the fact that he meant what he said. There are other authorities. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt,</inline> by way of interjection last week, said that the Senate was breaching the Constitution.

        <para>I fall back now upon the decision by the High Court the other day to uphold the Petroleum and Minerals Authority. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> quotes 2 Justices of the High Court, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Stephen and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Gibbs, as upholding the power of the Senate. We now have the authority of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Mason and the Chief Justice, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Garfield</inline> Barwick. Four Justices of the High Court unequivocally stated that the Senate&#39;s powers were not being misused and that the Senate did have the power to reject. No doubt <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Murphy, in view of his past record, would support that view. That makes 5 justices of the High Court who would support that view. What utter nonsense it is for the Government and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> to talk about breaking the Constitution when the High Court- the highest constitutional authority in the land- has upheld the Senate&#39;s powers. 1 need refer to no more than that. I do not need to refer to other constitutional authorities such as Professor Lane and others who have upheld the powers of the Senate. </para>
        <para>It is sheer hypocrisy for the Government to claim now that the Senate is acting illegally and unconstitutionally. What is at stake is quite clear. It is the integrity and competence of the Government. The Government has proved incompetent in economic affairs and government generally. Indeed, the Government&#39;s incompetence is incredible. It has shown a lack of honesty and integrity. Its gaggle of funny Ministers are all going their own way, all making statements and all spending recklessly in pursuit of pet schemes without any control from the top. The Government has provided jobs for the boys - </para>

            <para>- Yes. A government is not elected for a 3-year term. The 3-year term is provided as a maximum term. Indeed, a Prime Minister or a Premier is entitled to go to the Governor-General to ask for a dissolution of the Parliament at any time he thinks it could be of political advantage to him. Only a couple of months ago the Premier of South Australiaafter only 2 years of government- decided that the portents were favourable and he sought a dissolution of the Parliament. </para>

The issue is quite clear. The Parliament is not elected for 3 years, it can be dissolved at any time by the GovernorGeneral on the advice of the Prime Minister. It is elected and can remain in office only so long as it has the confidence of the Parliament. When it has not the confidence of the Parliament and the Senate is - </para>

            <para>- Cock-a-doodle-doo. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> cackles the whole time. The Government does not have the confidence of the Parliament, because the Senate is a part of the Parliament. Honourable senators opposite recognised this in 1 970. The third issue at stake is the right of the Parliament to control the Executive. No one who believes in Parliament and the rights of Parliament can but deplore the Prime Minister&#39;s arrogant attempt to defy the Parliament and to defy the Constitution. He defies what he has said is British tradition- that when a government is defeated on a money Bill then it should resign. The Prime Minster is defying that- the Constitution to which he himself has adhered and which he has laid down as being correct. </para>

        <para>The Prime Minister is now engaged in hysterical and irrational threats to smash the Senate. This indicates his frustrations that there should be any parliamentary control over his actions. I know that from reports sometimes Caucus also has been frustrated at its lack of control over the Prime Minister who completely ignores Caucus and goes his own way. He might get away with it in Caucus but he cannot get away with it in the Parliament. It indicates, despite his high sounding words, a contempt for the Parliament. This is exemplified, of course, by the illegal attempt to raise loans without the knowledge of Parliament. His attempt in this loans affair to subvert the Constitution shows the Prime Minister to be a man without principle. </para>
        <para>The supremacy of Parliament must remain. We are indebted to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack for laying clearly on the line last week the necessity for the supremacy of Parliament to be upheld. The Prime Minister and the Government are attempting to conceal these facts behind a mass of false and misleading information from a propaganda machine, very reminiscent of Goebbels. The same lies and distortions which were poured out by Goebbels in his vicious and wicked propaganda machine are being repeated here. The sooner this is understood, the better. I just make one more reference to misleading information. I refer to the Minister for Defence, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Morrison,</inline> who has apparently caught the </para>

          <para>- I notice that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers)</inline> has just walked into the chamber with a reprehensible circumstance under his arm. I do not doubt that we will hear more about that later. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Acting Deputy President,</inline> I take this opportunity to address you without very much fear of an interjection because I know that a very important event is taking place in Melbourne. As the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> said this morning, even the banks are closed. One of the methods which he suggested might be used to see the Government through its difficulties was an approach to the banks. I do not doubt that today would be a poor day to approach the banks in Melbourne. I have listened to this debate for 2 or 3 weeks now. We have the Appropriation Bills before us for the third or fourth time. It could be the fifth or sixth time. If we go into next week or the week afterwards it possibly will be the seventh or eighth time. This indicates and really describes fairly clearly the tedious method which the Opposition has used in order to have its own way. Its own way is to demand of the House of Representatives- not this chamberthat it should go to an election. </para>

        <para>I have listened to a variety of constitutional lawyers and politicians on this matter. I must admit that I am as confused now as I was before I commenced. I am not quite certain whether there is the constitutional power for the Senate to reject a money Bill. I have been told by many </para>
        <para class="block">Opposition senators that there is such constitutional power; that there is no constitutional crisis as such, that it is a political crisis. Whatever it is, the result is exactly the same. Those people and departments which need funds to carry out their programs- whether they be State government programs or Australian Government programs- are not receiving the necessary funds to carry them out. In fact, it is said that at the end of November there will be many people who will be deprived of payment for their services, whether they happen to be employees or employers. This is a sorry situation to which we have been brought. It is quite a simple matter. We have had several weeks for reflection. </para>
        <para>I can hear the quorum bells ringing in the other place. It is rather poor timing on the part of someone to call a quorum. I doubt that it is a division at this time of the afternoon. Let me put this to the Opposition: After some 4 weeks of debate on this matter, surely the Opposition has come to the conclusion that by a simple act on its part, that is by walking across the floor, the Supply Bills could be passed, this crisis would be over, we could proceed to pass the necessary legislationwe now have a considerable backlog of legislation- and we could have an opportunity to be with our families for the Christmas period. But of one thing we can be certain, and that is that the Australian economy will not suffer the consequences of the Opposition&#39;s act. </para>

            <para>- It is a rather complicated course and one which the Opposition ought not to impose upon the House of Representatives. I decided to read back over the speeches which led to the setting up of the Federation. There are several books on this matter. Honourable senators opposite would have been wise to have read the speeches which were delivered at the various conventions which led up to Federation. Honourable senators will find that almost all speakers took the view that, although the 2 Houses were to be co-ordinate and were to have almost equal power, one power which they did not intend to give to the Senate was the power to reject money Bills. Section 53 of the Constitution merely refers to the amendment of Bills and to those Bills which cannot be amended by the Senate. I wonder whether constitutional lawyers and some of our constitutional experts opposite could put their minds to this proposition: If it is not possible for the Senate to amend money Bills, if it is not possible for the Senate to amend 99 per cent of a money Bill and to leave one per cent unamended- I take it that that is not possiblethen surely it must be accepted that it is not possible to reject the Bill in toto. The only people who could decide upon this would be the judges of the High Court. Unfortunately, there is no means by which this matter can be tested. Perhaps one ought to do some investigation in order to find some means whereby the Parliament can refer sections of the Constitution for interpretation by the High Court without the legislation having to be passed through the House. It seems to me to be a simple proposition. Parliament should be able to ask whether a matter is constitutional before the legislation is passed. We would have fewer problems on the Senate Select Committee on the Corporation and Securities Industry Bill 1975 - </para>

            <para>- I do think big at this time of the afternoon. It is wise to think big and now that I am on my feet I have to think long, until at least 3 o&#39;clock. But let me get back to the consequences of the action taken by the Opposition, the consequences of that search for the reprehensible act. We have been taken through the loans affair and the ACTU-Solo affair. We have been through the Khemlani episode. We are about to have the Khemlani episode resurrected. The Opposition has been in search of a reprehensible act. This search has gone on continually, and continually it has failed. The proposition is simple enough. Why does not the Opposition change its mind? Why does not the Opposition think of the people if it is talking about the people? It looked at the various polls and judged them some time ago. The Opposition thought the polls were in its favour and it acted accordingly. Now that the polls are not in its favour, why does it not act accordingly and pass the Appropriation Bills so that we can get down to the business of running the country? I take it from the looks on the faces of members of the Opposition, both in this chamber and in another place, that it is somewhat dejected. </para>

What the Leader of the Opposition is intending to do, I have no doubt, having had here the author of the papers which he holds so dearly to himself at present and that author having departed to other places, is to go through the exercise today of having those papers presented to us as papers of great authority. That is for the Leader of the Opposition to establish and I doubt very much whether he can establish a case against the Government. </para>

        <para>In any case the people are very tired of what is going on. I do not know whether they really appreciate the antics of the Opposition. They certainly will not appreciate, especially the people and commercial interests in Canberra, the drying up of Supply funds which will place them in a precarious position before the end of November. I believe that the people hold the Opposition responsible for this situation. As to the constitutional power to deny Supply, as I said before, having listened to all the constitutional lawyers and having become aware of their divisions and variety of opinions, 1 am not certain of this power. However, I can accept that there could be a situation where the Senate could take unto itself the power to reject Supply. Let me put myself in this position: The House of Representatives could seek to appropriate a vast sum of money, speaking in retrospect, for the continuation of the Vietnam war. I most certainly without hesitation would vote against that appropriation. Speaking from an individual point of view in a circumstance of that sort, I would say, standing where I do at the moment, that I would vote against that appropriation. </para>
        <para>However, the situation, the circumstances, now are different. Here we have what is without doubt a grab for power by the Opposition led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser. Mr Fraser</inline> has been poorly advised. He has sought to achieve power before his time. If he had struck to his original decision- though <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> has indicated that he did not have one- that the Government was entitled to serve out its full term, no doubt his chances of winning government would have been considerably better than they are at present. I have no doubt that some members of the Opposition parties did give that advice, that is, that it would have been better to wait until then. Twice now the Opposition has attempted to reject Supply. Eighteen months ago it attempted it and failed. Opposition senators should realise that if they had not attempted it then, the elections they are looking for would have been held right now and held without the loss of favour which they have suffered as a result of this manoeuvre. There is no doubt in my mind having looked at the polls, the economic situation and the inflationary trend that seems to continue, that those would have been circumstances which would have led to a change of government. But the Opposition has messed it. There is no doubt about it, the Opposition has placed itself in a sorry state and has itself to blame for that. </para>
        <para>What members of the Opposition parties should do- and most of them now are taking the view that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> got them into this mess and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> should get them out of it- is at their next Party meeting, and I say this with all sincerity and for the good of the economy, to advise <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> to back off and back off quickly. In fact he has half backed off. What a strange situation! The Liberal Party, the Liberal Premiers, Liberal Opposition leaders and the senior members of the Liberal Party met at the weekend and pulled away from their position by announcing that they would allow the Appropriation Bills through providing the Prime Minister gave them an assurance of a House of Representatives election before next June. </para>

            <para>- Maybe he was going to do it last year, but it appears to me that the Opposition has held the Government to ransom for an election immediately but has now backed off and said: &#39;Give us a half election and hold it before next June, if you like&#39;. That is a back down and it must be causing some Opposition senators considerable embarrassment. I think the best idea would be for them to call the whole thing off. I do not think the Opposition would lose any face. It should let the Supply Bills go through and fight its political battle on the legislation before the Parliament. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>We have not yet debated the provisions of the Bill. No one on the Opposition side has bothered to do that. They have merely attacked the Government on its performance referring to three unusual circumstances, but it has not really attacked the Government on the Appropriation Bills. Those Bills need to be tested, and if the Opposition had any sense it would allow those Bills to go through and be tested. There will be a half Senate election before 30 June and there will be an opportunity then for the people to judge the Budget but it cannot be judged until it has been passed. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sim</inline>made the statement that the Government had lost the confidence of the Parliament. That is not correct. It has not lost the confidence of the House of Representatives. It still has a majority in the House of Representatives and that is where there should be the test of money Bills of this sort. There is no lack of confidence in the Government in the House of Representatives. The Government has the numbers and as long as it has the numbers it is the master of the situation. Even if we took the Parliament of the whole, that is, the House of Representatives and the Senate together, there is not a majority of the members of this Parliament who want the rejection of Supply. In fact, even if we take the whole of the Opposition as being in favour of the rejection of the Budget, and I do not think all Opposition members are, the Opposition still does not have a majority of members of Parliament favouring rejection. There is a difference of one in this place and the vote here will possibly be 29 votes to 28, or even allowing for pairs, with a majority of just one. So if we count members of the House of Representatives as well, that is, taking the Parliament as a whole, the Government has a majority of members of Parliament in. favour of the passing of the Budget. In other words, the whole of the Parliament believes that the Appropriation Bills should go through. I trust that we will not have to debate these Bills again. As I said when I spoke on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4), I hope this will be the end of it and that we will not have to debate Appropriation Bills Nos 5 and 6, Nos 7 and 8, and Nos 9 and 10. It is tedious. </para>

Neverthless the Opposition had every opportunity to bring him before the Bar of the Senate.

            <para>-The lawyer from Scottsdale is giving us the benefit of his knowledge again. I do not know why he does not make a speech. My understanding of what has happenedI have not seen <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani-</inline> is that his solicitor has sent to me a mass of material, for none of which I vouch. I do not know the truth of it. I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> is accurate. He has made it available in the form of a statutory declaration. </para>

            <para>-Wait a minute; I am not vouching for the accuracy of this. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> the Prime Minister was to form one of a group which was to arrange its consummation and, according to what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> says in his statutory declaration, the Government deliberately and possibly illegally arranged to pay Khemlani commission by making arrangements to wash the loan- a device to prevent parliamentary scrutiny of the loan raisings. Fifthlythis is the important thing- the Prime Minister&#39;s claim that any relevant documents had been tabled is patently untrue, because the documents produced by Khemlani include telexes which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> did not table on 9 July which discussed the loan washing arrangements. </para>

            <para>- Well, on 7 January he had a transit pass which was valid until 1015 hours on 8 February. He arrived in Sydney on 25 February 1975 and he had a transit pass which was valid until 1700 hours on 26 February. He arrived in Sydney on 7 March with permission to stay for 4 days. I should imagine that these details could be checked with the Department of Labor and Immigration to discover the truth or falsity of them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> asked me when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> was here and how he was here. I am just illuminating him. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> was even in Perth on 20 June last, and he had a transit pass which was valid for 3 days.

On 23 August 1975 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> was in Sydney with a transit pass which was valid until 1500 hours on 24 August. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> gives details up until his last visit to Australia.

        <para>I put it to the Senate, without in any way vouching for the truth or accuracy of what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> says, that these documents ought to be tabled in the Senate. It is an interesting story. I could quote from the large mass of telexes, if honourable senators wished. I think that the telexes form part and parcel of the declaration. In fact, they are annexures; they are part and parcel of the one operation. I thought that for the information of honourable senators the documents should be tabled. I thought that the information ought to be given to anybody. Therefore, I seek leave to table the documents in the Senate. </para>

            <para>-One of the advantages that I had when I was in practice was that I was not a senior counsel and I did not have the assistance of others when I was addressing the Bench. The opportunity was open to the Opposition last week to call <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> before the Bar of the Senate to explain whatever it was that he had to tell us. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> was not called, despite the fact that the Government made it quite clear that in no way would we prevent <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> from coming before the Senate and giving to the Senate evidence on which he could be examined by those who called him and crossexamined by those who did not call him- if examined&#39; and &#39;cross-examined&#39; are proper terms to use in regard to a senatorial inquiry. The opportunity was not taken by the Opposition to call <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani;</inline> nor was the opportunity taken to call <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Crawford</inline> who, apparently, also has made a statutory declaration. I am informed that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Crawford</inline> is a much more interesting person than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> in his modest manner has let us know. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Crawford</inline> apparently is prominent in  Scientology  circles. He is a man of many parts. He once conducted a pirate radio station in Great Britain. One of his financial ventures, which was of quite some interest to those who participated in it, was the selling of tickets for the first flight to the moon which, apparently, some people in the United States of America agreed to buy. </para>

            <para>- I am not suggesting anything, but I think it is possible that something like that happened somewhere along the line. Yes, I think that that may well be the case. I know that the Senate is not a court, but I hope that those lawyers who sit on the Opposition side of the Senate will remember the days when they were in practice and remember that the rules about the calling of witnesses are not there just because of some quirk in the minds of the judiciary or because of some strange archaic practice which has not yet gone out of fashion. They are there for very good reasons. It is a very soundly established principle that one does not accept evidence by way of affidavit or declaration when the witness himself is available to give oral evidence on which he can be examined or cross-examined. I believe that this shows that what the Opposition is trying to do, what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> is trying to do with regard to the tabling of these documents, is completely bogus. If the Opposition had really wanted the people to know what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> and his colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Crawford</inline> knew about this matter, if it really felt that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Crawford</inline> had some useful information which would illuminate a topic which seems to have become rather murky with the passage of time, it had the opportunity last week to call them before the Senate. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>What is the purpose of tabling these declarations at present? If they are matters of which the Senate ought to be apprised, if they are matters about which the Parliament ought to be fully informed, then clearly the people who have made the statutory declarations ought to be called before the Bar of the Senate, as we agreed to have them before the Bar of the Senate. Apparently they wanted to come. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> said that he was waiting anxiously for advice from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers, Mr Lynch</inline> or whoever it was so that he could come before us and tell us his story. He did not come forward, and he did not come forward because he was not called by the Opposition. If they are not matters which are properly the subject of the Senate&#39;s attention, the Opposition should not be cluttering up the business of the Senate, it should not be cluttering up the Senate <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> with these voluminous documents which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> has now prepared. </para>
        <para>If these matters are or could be, defamatory, it is quite improper that the Opposition should attempt to circumvent the laws of defamation by allowing these statements by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Crawford</inline> to be admitted in this way so that full Press, radio and television publicity can be given to them, but without the authors of the declarations being in any way subject to any of the laws relating to defamation. If the Opposition believes that these documents stand on their own feet, if it is prepared to defend what is within these documents, there is nothing to stop it calling a Press conference, issuing a statement, writing a letter to the editor of a newspaper or in some other way having the documents published but without hiding behind parliamentary privilege, which is what the Opposition is doing at present. </para>
        <para>This is a completely improper practice. It is a practice which the Government does not intend to condone. If the Opposition by the use of numbers is able to make a mockery of the Senate in this way, then it is a misuse of proper parliamentary procedures. Already the Opposition has had the opportunity to examine these documents. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> has said that these declarations apparently show that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> was aware of some subsequent negotiations with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani,</inline> but then we find that none other than the former Solicitor-General, who now has rather sunk from grace as a back bench Liberal member of Parliament, has examined the documents which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> and I presume his colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Crawford</inline> had, but certainly the documents that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> had. As a result of his examination of the documents, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott</inline> said that there was no evidence whatsoever to link the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> with any of these alleged negotiations. Surely that is sufficient. Why do Opposition senators want to repudiate the advice of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott</inline> in the same way as they themselves have repudiated <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott?</inline> This is an improper practice, and the Government opposes the tabling of these statutory declarations. If people want to make these statements, let them make them outside the Parliament where they are not protected by parliamentary privilege; or alternatively let them come into the Senate- the Government agreed to allow <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> to come into the Senate- so we can cross-examine them on these matters and so that we can test whether they are telling the truth or whether they are telling falsehoods. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Wheeldon</inline>by his opposition to this motion is attempting to prevent the whole truth from being revealed. He is talcing a course which is unprecedented. I am sure that it is not within the memory of any honourable senator here, except possibly those who have been here for a very long time, that a motion under standing order 364 has been opposed. It is a rare experience. If my recollection is inaccurate, certainly I have not heard such a motion being opposed with such vehemence by a Minister of the Crown. Secondly, the motion is being opposed with such specious arguments. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon</inline> asked why <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> was not called. He said that the best evidence is the evidence of a witness himself. But as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> said, the last time the Senate had before it a witness to give evidence the behaviour of Government senators was so shocking and reprehensible that injustice was done to an individual. Why should any person be subjected to that treatment if the story he desires to present to the Senate can be presented in a different way? </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Further, the Government has ordered <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> to leave the country. He was told that he had to leave Australia by Monday, 3 November, at the latest. Although his solicitor wrote to the Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt)</inline> indicating that the material <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> wanted to present to the Senate had not been completed, the Government did not yield. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> is not in the country at the moment, and I imagine that the Government heaved a sigh of relief after he left and felt that one of the other burdens it might have had to suffer had removed himself from the jurisdiction. But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> has left a statutory declaration and it is desired to have that declaration, together with an accompanying declaration, tabled in the Senate. What was the other specious argument used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon?</inline> He said that in some way a person is being granted parliamentary privilege. That rings hollow from the lips of a Minister who week after week, month after month, has pleaded executive privilege to prevent the story behind this sordid loans affair from being revealed. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> has said, the Opposition was assured that all the relevant documents had been tabled. This statutory declaration, declared to be a truthful statement by the man who made it, indicates that there were other documents which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> did not table. Why should there be any specious claim of privilege to prevent exposure of what the Government has tried to conceal? </para>
        <para>I suggest to the Senate that the man who has made this declaration has done so knowing that there are provisions of the law which render him liable to penalties if he has made the statement untruthfully. That is a position which ought to be remembered by anyone who wants to challenge what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> is saying. At least we ought to be prepared to hear what he has to say. We have received in this Senate in times past, in particular on 9 July, a mass of documents; the House of Representatives received a mass of documents, all from the one source- the Government. At that stage <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> was relied upon by the Government as a man who was conducting negotiations on its behalf. When the Opposition sought information about what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> was doing it was told that as a matter of responsibility and confidentiality it could not be told. Now the Government has fallen out with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> wants to tell his story. Upon what basis or principle of justice is his account to be denied? Why should not we in the Parliament and the people of Australia be informed as to what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> has done and what is his account of these transactions? </para>
        <para>More and more the Whitlam Government resembles the discredited Nixon Government in the United States. I have thought time and time again, as I have seen the florid countenance of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam),</inline> that more and more he resembles Spiro Agnew. The more I hear the Prime Minister on this issue the more I think he resembles Richard Nixon. We have seen a total cover-up which persistence is exposing. I think we should remember that it took approximately 2 years and 4 months- from April 1972 to September 1974-before Richard Nixon was driven from office for the crimes he had attempted and for the misleading of the Congress and the people of the United States of America. We saw last July one of the most massive criminal conspiracies ever attempted by people in power in this country slowly being exposed and revealed for the illegalities which it contained. Persistence is bringing the truth to light. The resemblance between the Nixon cover-up and the Whitlam cover-up I think is one of the remarkable events of history. </para>
        <para>There is not any doubt that the Prime Minister month by month has had the truth dragged out of him. Still we do not know the full truth because he is doggedly hanging on and refusing to reveal. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon</inline> today wants to keep the truth hidden. Is it not remarkable how Richard Nixon over the months was forced to dispense with the services of so many of his trusted servants? First, there was James Dean; then there was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ehrlichman;</inline> and then there was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Haldeman.</inline> They were followed by a host of&#39; minor, lesser officials who eventually found themselves before the courts and in gaol. What have we found here in Australia? We find that the former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy-</inline> I wonder what will happen to hi m one day- leaves the Government. We find that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> ceases to be the  Deputy  Prime Minister. He is disgraced and discredited and is no longer a Minister. We find that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> has to go the same way. How many other people are there? </para>

            <para>- I am conscious of this constant cacophony of noise from the back benchers in the Labor Party who know that they are seeing the end of their Government and who are determined, so far as they can, to make it a noisy demise. Their purpose is simply to prevent the truth coming out and to participate further in the massive cover-up. The word &#39;Watergate&#39; will be associated in this country with the name Whitlam&#39;. It has been made an event of history which will last for all time because of what occurred in the United States. It will have indelibly marked the discreditable record of this Government which hid the truth, which hid criminal conspiracy and prevented to the very end every opportunity for it to be exposed. </para>

          <para>- I can understand why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> had that sickly grin on his face throughout his speech; it is because he evidently finds even himself ridiculous. Honourable senators opposite will recall that just the other day he rose in this sanctimonious, pious manner which has become his trade mark and accused me of the awful crime of defaming someone under privilege. Let us have a look at what he has done today. A man who was once an idolexPresident Nixon- a man whose every decision in relation to Vietnam <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> applauded, a man who was very much of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood&#39;s</inline> ilk because he went over to the far extreme of conservatism, even for a Republican, this man who has now been convicted of being one of the great criminal figures of American history, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> now uses in an attempt to besmirch our own Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam),</inline> a man against whom no wrongdoing has yet been established, despite the attempts of the Opposition to dig up dirt from the 4 corners of the world. The Prime Minister of Australia is, in the view of this man who hates defamation, to be lumped in with one of the great political criminals of our time, ex-President Nixon. 1 would hope that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> wishes to maintain his stance he will at least have the grace in future not to claim that other members of the Senate are defamers. This is one of the greatest pieces of defamation that one could imagine. </para>

        <para>Let us look at some of the more absurd propositions that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> is advancing today. He says that when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Karidis</inline> was called before the Senate the Government members of the Senate behaved in such a shameful way as to deter honourable senators opposite from repeating the performance. Let us recall some of the shameful things that were done by people from </para>
        <para class="block">
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood&#39;s</inline>side of the Senate.  His  own leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> called upon the  President  to order <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Karidis&#39;</inline> solicitor to table a document which he, if he had any skerrick of legal knowledge, must have known to be a document privileged as between an attorney and client. He acted as though <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Karidis</inline> and his solicitor were under the same obligation as a senator in this place under standing order 364. Not only was it a disgraceful exhibition of a lack of knowledge of his Standing Orders but also it was an abdication of any of the principles that any legal man should hold dear. He asked the  President  to order the tabling of a document that was confidential as between solicitor and client. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> then has the nerve to say that we were the ones who behaved badly when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Karidis</inline> was before the Senate. The fact of the matter is that the more responsible, the more dignified, the more serious and honest members of the Opposition- I concede that they exist- were so shamed by their own performance when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Karidis</inline> was brought before the Senate that they were not game to repeat the dose with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani.</inline> We have this absurd motion that we are trying to suppress the facts from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani.</inline> For a week - <inline font-style="italic">(Opposition senators interjecting)</inline></para>

            <para>- I will come to that. I will answer every point that has been raised. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> himself, from the moment that he arrived, was asking for the opportunity to appear before the Senate. But what did our opponents do? They opened up his 8 cases of documents. They sent their legal expert, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott,</inline> the man who has given such unfortunate advice to the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> as to have got him into his present sorry plight, and another of their legal experts to examine everything that Khemlani had brought to this country. They came up with nothing. So they did not call him before the Bar of the Senate. Are they suggesting that I had anything to do with making that difficult? Let me recount again the story of Khemlani coming to this country. On the Friday before he arrived, his attorneys in New York rang my Department and asked whether he would be given a visa. </para>

            <para>-Let me make the point, and you can reply later. They asked whether he could have a visa. If the Government had wanted to suppress the truth, if we had wanted to keep <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> &#39;s testimony out of this country, I could have said no then. I said yes he could have a visa, no obstacle would be put in his way. Nonetheless, he arrived in this country without a visa. If I had wanted I could have turfed him out of the country there and then. He was given the ordinary transit courtesies and was told that he could stay here for another 72 hours. The Opposition knew this. He was in its hands at this stage. He had become its client.  His  papers were being sifted by its experts. When his time was up his solicitor rang me and asked whether he could have an extension of time. I said yes he could have an extension of time until Monday of this week. Can the Opposition seriously and truthfully try to tell us that I am any sort of reason why Khemlani was not brought before this place? It is absolutely absurd. It had a whole week to call him, and it did not call him. If blame, is to rest for the fact that we have not had the best evidence that could be offered on anything that Khemlani has to say, it rests at the door of the Opposition. If Khemlani has anything to say, if there is anything that the public should know, let it be said openly. Let it be published in the newspapers. </para>

            <para>- I do not know what the honourable senator is suggesting. Is he suggesting that somehow we control the newspapers? This is the oddest of all propositionsthat somehow or other we control the newspapers. I suggest that what we are witnessing is the death throes of the Opposition&#39;s attempt to make something out of the Khemlani story. Members of the Opposition have fallen on their faces. They have hit the fence. They are fools before the whole Australian public. It is understandable that they cannot reconcile themselves to this, but let us get this silly charade over as soon as possible and get back to running the country because the public knows who to blame if the country is at a standstill at the present time. It is these people opposite who never reconciled themselves to the fact that we have won office, who think they are entitled to be over here and who have attempted by every method possible to usurp power again. The public has seen through them. None of their gyrations, none of their attempts to turn the blame away from themselves onto us in this matter will work. The Australian voter is a little bit more sensible than they thought he was. So the sooner they get around to being sensible again themselves the better it will be for their Party and for the Australian people. </para>

          <para>- After that tirade from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland I think it would be just as well to consider the motion that the Senate is actually debating. This afternoon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> quoted from a large number of documents, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> moved that the documents from which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> quoted be tabled. The speech which we have just heard from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland has ranged far and away from that proposition- a proposition which is so normal in the Senate that the request is usually agreed to as a matter of course. In this case the Government is refusing to allow documents which have been quoted from to be tabled. In any ordinary circumstance when a senator quotes from a document- certainly when the Leader of the Opposition quotes from a document- the Government or the Opposition is most anxious to see the document. In this case the Government is concerned about the contents of these documents. That is the reason it is fighting tooth and nail to prevent these documents from being tabled. It is not even prepared to have them opened. It is not even prepared to look at them , much less let the public know what is contained in them. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>What are the documents from which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> quoted and which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> seeks to have tabled? They are documents which have come into existence over many months. They are from the man whom the Government has made famous in Australia. About this time last year, about November 1974, the Government got in contact with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> when it conceived the extraordinary and bizarre notion that it could raise $4,000m of overseas money, of Arab money, and put Australia into hock for 20 years to the tune ultimately of $20,000m. The man whom the Government sought to do this most extraordinary, bizarre and clearly wrong exercise as far as Australia was concerned, was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani.</inline> The Government had constant dealings with this gentleman from November 1974 until September 1975. Over that period <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> has been working constantly for the Government. I will not confine my remarks to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr</inline></para>
        <para class="block">Connor. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> has had dealings not only with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor, Mr Cameron</inline> and many other senior Ministers but also with a great battery of senior public servants. Let us not run away from this for one minute. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> &#39;s dealings have been for months at the very highest levels of government. </para>
        <para>In the course of these dealings the Ministers and the senior public servants who have been dealing with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> have obviously been informing the Prime Minister what was going on. The Prime Minister, the then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy, Mr Connor</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> were parties to and the principals who brought into existence the famous or infamous and illegal Executive Council Minute of 13 December 1974. From November 1974 to September 1975 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> was the agent for the Government in this extraordinary but- from the Government&#39;s point of view- highly important exercise. The Government, as part of its policy, attached the most enormous significance to this loan raising activity. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> was the man upon whom the Government was relying to get the money for it. He came to Australia time and time again. What utter nonsense it was for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland the other day and today to make some bones about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> staying in Australia for a few days or coming back to Australia. In November and December last year, in January, February or March this year, or on the numerous other times that he came to Australia, did the Government worry whether he had a visa? This man came to Australia as and when he liked and when the Government liked. He was coming in and out of Australia, naturally at the wish and invitation of the Government. </para>
        <para>It is ridiculous to suggest that this man who had dealt with this Government over these months should have any qualms or concern about coming to Australia without a visa. The way the Government has treated him over these months, he is just carrying on in the same way as he has done over that time. But apart from coming to Australia on numerous occasions, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> has been in almost daily contact by telephone with Ministers, with senior public servants and with other intermediaries on behalf of this Government. He has been using the telex machine from his office or from many other parts of the world in contacting Ministers, in particular, the former Minister for Minerals and Energy. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline>has come into the Senate this afternoon and has in his possession a very lengthy statutory declaration of something like 100 pages in which this man- this agent of the Government for months and months- sets out in great detail his story of this relationship that he has had with this Government. It is not just a declaration. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> has said, it has been made on oath and there are the severest penalties of the law for perjury which would apply if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> deliberately has misrepresented the facts or told any untruths in the declaration. The declaration is supported not only by that oath, but it is also supported by the contemporaneous documents that have come into existence during <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> &#39;s relationship with the Government over this period of 10 months. There are over 100 of these documents here and, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> has said, many of them are documents that have not been tabled by this Government. </para>

            <para>- The Government was tabling relevant documents. The Prime Minister sacked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> because some documents had not been tabled on 9 July and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> had made a statement to the effect that all documents of substance had been tabled. The fact of the matter is that those documents related to the dealings and the transactions between the Government and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> and the banks and others with whom they were associated. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani,</inline> in the course of his statutory declaration, has now referred to a large number of documents- as I said, over 100 documentsmany of which have not been tabled prior to now and in respect of some of which, when they came to light after 9 July, the Prime Minister sacked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor.</inline> That is the situation. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>We have this statutory declaration from a man whom the Government itself contacted to do its great job- this extraordinary and bizarre exercise, as it may be. Nevertheless it is the job that the Prime Minister, the Government and honourable senators opposite who support that Government have regarded as of the highest importance to Australia, to the Government&#39;s interest and to its policies. This is the man who has now brought into existence this affidavit and who has now backed it up with his 100 or more documents and who has taken very great care in doing so. He certainly has taken a week to prepare these documents and has not been able to complete it in a week. Any lawyers on the other side of the chamber who have had any experience of practice- I do not refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon</inline> who apparently thinks these things can come into existence overnight, or to some other lawyers on the other side- would know how tremendous a job it is to produce a statutory declaration of that order and to collect the documents in that way, and would know that it certainly is reasonable for it to have taken <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> and his legal advisers the whole of last week to prepare these documents. </para>
        <para>That is the reason- and the only reason- why we have not taken any of the steps which the Government senators are saying should have been taken last week. In fact, last week a notice of motion was given by the Opposition to enable a committee to be established for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> to come before, if it is desired, and be crossexamined on the statutory declaration and on anything else he likes to say, if it is desired. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon</inline> has made great play on the fact that we are seeking somehow or other to act in an unusual manner so far as legal procedures are concerned. Well, it is a long time since <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon</inline> has practised and perhaps he has got a little rusty as to the development of the law in regard to these matters. But I think that even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon</inline> would realise that a great many legal procedures take place on the basis of affidavits and statutory declarations. </para>

            <para>- You did not give any indication of that in your speech earlier today. But the procedure in these cases is that if any party wants the deponent- the person who has sworn the affidavit- to come along and be crossexamined, the facilities are made available for that to be done. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon</inline> knows that as well as I do. If a person presents a document- it is quite common in legal proceedings- the test of cross-examination is most important and the facilities are then provided for him to be crossexamined by the other side. We are not resiling from having <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> cross-examined. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> says he is prepared to come back to Australia on 48 hours notice to be examined on his statutory declaration by such means as the Senate chooses. But who is stopping <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> from coming before the Senate? It is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland who has not allowed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> to remain in Australia. He has booted him out of Australia. This man came and went to and from Australia for 10 months at the invitation of the Government. Time and time again he was in and out of Australia without a visa. But when he comes to Australia now and when he is going to produce something that may reveal the truth, this Government will not have him in Australia for more than 72 hours. </para>

          <para>- I believe the Opposition, by this motion, by its use of standing order 364 in this manner and by its use of its numbers in this Senate, is setting a very dangerous precedent for this Senate to pursue. It is giving unrestricted and unqualified privilege to people, particularly people who are now outside Australia, to use the Australian Parliament, perhaps- I use the word &#39;perhaps&#39; because we do not know what is contained in these documents- to vilify and defame any Australian citizen. During the course of his remarks this afternoon, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> said repeatedly that he could not vouch for the authenticity or accuracy of the documents. He read one or two sentences from the documents- presumably statutory declarations. I suggest he read those sentences merely to bring himself within the ambit of standing order 364. Then he sought the Senate to allow him to table the entire 100 pages that he suggests there are of the documents. I believe that that is an untenable position for the Senate to be placed in and indeed, as I have said, that it is creating a very dangerous precedent. The use of this standing order in this manner, I suggest, is a misuse of the standing order. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> sought leave of the Senate to table the documents, leave was not granted. Certainly under standing order 135 leave of the Senate can be granted only if there is no dissenting voice. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> then rose and moved his motion under standing order 364, which states: </para>

        <para class="block">I suggest that standing order 364 was written with the intention of ensuring proof of accuracy of the document from which an honourable senator was quoting. I suggest that that is the very purpose of the standing order- to ensure the protection of the Senate and to ensure the accuracy of the document from which an honourable senator quotes. In this instance <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> in quoting one or two sentences from the multiplicity of documents that he seeks to table, repeatedly said that he himself could not vouch for the accuracy of the documents. As <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Odgers</inline> has said in his publication <inline font-style="italic">Australian Senate Practice,</inline> by the use of standing order 364 the members of the majority party can impose the rule on the minority but because of their numbers can be in a privileged position themselves. He then states that with that factor and others in mind it may well be argued that standing order 364 needs reconsideration. If standing order 364 is to be used in this fashion, I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Odgers&#39;</inline> comment in his publication that the standing order needs further consideration by the Senate. Again I assert my belief that this is a misuse of the Standing Orders. </para>
        <para>What are the facts? There is no need to relate or recite them. We know that these allegations about the loans affair have been made for the last 9, 10 or 11 months. We have heard accusation after accusation. We have had public servants brought to the Bar of the Senate. A private Australian citizen has been brought to the Bar of the Senate. We, as a Government, said that, if the Opposition sought to bring <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> or any other person to the Bar of the Senate at any time to give testimony in this manner, whilst we objected in principle to the use of the Senate in this way we would not object to such persons appearing before the Bar of the Senate. The Opposition did not accept that principle. Last Wednesday <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> as Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, gave notice of motion that he would move that a select committee be established for the purpose of inquiring into the Khemlani loan affairs. At the time he gave that notice he indicated that it was merely a holding notice. As reported at page 1521 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> said: </para>

        <para class="block">Here we have a situation in which all last week <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> and his solicitor were ensconced with leading members of the Opposition. They had brought to Canberra some 8, 10 or 12 bag loads of documents for the Opposition to study. Senior members of the Opposition who are lawyers- a former Solicitor-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Howard-</inline> were ensconced with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> for a great deal of time, having a look at these documents and giving them every consideration. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott</inline> went to Sydney to have further discussions with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> and to have another look at the documents. He then made a statement that there was nothing in the documents that in any way implicated <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> in the loan affair after 20 May. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott</inline> then came back to Canberra and received new riding instructions from the present Leader of the Opposition ( <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Malcolm</inline> Fraser). </para>
        <para>The Opposition has had every chance in the world to bring <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> before the Bar of the Senate. The Opposition has had every opportunity to have <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> &#39;s case stated. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> stated when he came to Australia that he was coming here to have his case stated, and he had the opportunity while he was here to do so. The Opposition now, in this manner of subterfuge, I suggest, is using this standing order to try to get these documents on to the table of the Senate. I suggest that it is wrong. I suggest that the Opposition is creating a very dangerous precedent. I suggest that it is a misuse of the privileges of this House. It is giving unwarranted protection to people who are not within the confines of Australia. I believe that the members of the Opposition, in using the tactics they have used, are doing the wrong thing by this Senate. I believe that the motion should be rejected. </para>

            <para>- I make the point very seriously and I ask you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President,</inline> to treat it not with the levity with which the Opposition would invite you to treat it but with complete solemnity. Let us take the analogy of a court. Whoever heard of a document going into evidence without its being seen by the other side? Whoever thought of a document being used in cross-examination without its being shown to the other side? This document will go into the court of public opinion in relation to a matter which, 10 days ago, was the linchpin of the Opposition&#39;s case against the Government to bring about its defeat. It is as serious as that. This is not a trivial matter which arises every day. This is terribly important for the future of the Senate and for a proper judgment of history. This relates to the propriety of the Senate and its behaviour in these matters from the parliamentary institutional point of view. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President,</inline> I urge you to rule that if the Opposition seeks by this motion, as it has done, to get the authority of the Senate for papers to be tabled or for certain documents to be tabled., at least those documents should be shown to the other side which has a responsibility to vote upon the very motion which the Opposition has moved. This is not a formal or technical objection. There may be no precedent for it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President,</inline> I urge that you do not just ride over the matter as though it is a formality. I am sure you will not. History will be looking at this afternoon, I do not doubt. I strongly press the point of order which I have made. </para>

When a Government is engaged in a massive cover up what platitudinous nonsense it can put forward.

I think that a point of disorder was indicated by a submission of that sort. </para>

It is possibly the reason for refusing leave to table the documents. These documents are considerable. Perhaps in them may be some material that is defamatory against a person or persons.

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Deputy President,</inline>I rise to speak on the point of order. It seems quite clear to me that the object of standing order 364 is to ensure that any document which is quoted from in this chamber is available in full to the Senate so that the Senate may judge the document, not on the part which has been quoted but on the whole. I think it is consistent with that principle that the document quoted from in the present case ought to be on the table of the Senate. I refer to the procedure which has already taken place in relation to this so-called loans affair and in particular to the fact that on 9 July, in both this chamber and in the House of Representatives, extensive documents were tabled without notice being given to the Opposition. The document purported to set out what the Government said were the facts of the matter. </para>

        <para>In support of my opposition to the point of order I shall quote what the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> said about the privileges of the Parliament and the use we ought to make of them. On 9 July the Prime Minister stated: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The privileges of this Parliament fully protect members who believe that their information - </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I emphasise these words-  even partial information, even suspect information, would warrant making specific charges of impropriety against Ministers which the laws of defamation might render dangerous if made outside. Here allegations can be made, persons can be  named  and documents can be produced with impunity and immunity, lt is not only a privilege which Parliament bestows but a responsibility which it imposes. </para>
        <para class="block">I would say that it is quite clear, on the precedent which has been established by honourable senators on the Government side and by Government members in the other place, that this is the perfectly normal and proper procedure to be followed. I refer to the 38 pages of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> taken up by the documents tabled by the Prime Minister on 9 July. These documents, like the Prime Minister&#39;s documents, ought to be on the table where they can be judged. </para>

In regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Everett&#39;s</inline> point, the honourable senator may well put to me that his view is that the documents should be available to the Government prior to their being tabled. Again, that is not a matter for me to decide. The honourable senator may put that request to the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers).</inline> The Chair is guided by standing order 364 which gives the decision to the Senate. </para>

          <para>-I support the motion that these -documents be tabled. It is an extraordinary thing today that although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Everett</inline> does not know what the documents contain- he is worried about that- there seems to be no trouble on the part of the 3 Ministers who have spoken already. They seem to have a very good idea that there may be something in these documents which they do not want to see tabled and publicised in the Senate. They even reached the situation where <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland queried the Standing Orders under which these documents are sought to be tabled and wondered whether they ought to be changed. He tried to read into the Standing Orders a reason for someone wanting to look at the documents, a reason for someone asking for them to be tabled. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> has given another reason and, of course, there may be all kinds of reasons for a person who, having seen a document quoted from, wants to check it, wants to see it and wants to find out its date. There might be all kinds of reasons for him wanting it tabled so that it is open for the public. So there is no point in that minor suggestion which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland made. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>He complained that the Opposition had a holding notice of motion and that we had not used it, that it is still there and can still be used. There is absolutely no point in him saying: &#39;It was not used last week and the Opposition should have used it&#39;. In fact it is there and it is an opportunity to take a step from the position we are now in if, when these documents have been tabled, examined by senators and by members and by the public, it is found that it is worth while to examine the person who made the declaration. In this afternoon&#39;s debate there was one very significant point made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland. He maintained that the Opposition had had a chance to look at these documents and came up with nothing. It fell flat on its face, he said. Why then is he protesting now? Why is he complaining about these documents and what I assume to be a chronology of events, among other things, being put before the Senate? Why is the Government so worried? I think the expression is: &#39;Me thinketh they protest too much&#39;. </para>
        <para>Government senators have protested all the afternoon about the tabling of these documents and obviously they have no confidence that there is nothing in them. Why should they complain if there is nothing in them but that this man Khemlani, the Government&#39;s man, a man it negotiated with for a considerable amount of money over a considerable period of time, a man it trusted and a man whose involvement with the Government we have criticised, wants to clear his name. He has been involved throughout a long period and his name has been bandied about this country. He is in a special position where he seeks now to clear his name by putting all the facts before the public. If that is so, why should those facts not be put before the public? Why should we not have an opportunity to see them? It is no use interjecting and barking in the way that a little dog would all afternoon and as the senator who is interjecting now, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poyser,</inline> has done throughout the afternoon, asking: &#39;Why don&#39;t you give it to the Press to publish; let the Press do it?&#39;. I should have said a macaw or some kind of parrot. </para>

            <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poyser</inline> listens for a moment I will tell him. We are entitled to see the whole document, to see how this man sets out his case. We should not have to depend on reading tomorrow morning&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> or <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> or some other newspaper and see only the extracts which it chooses to publish. It is not for their judgment. This man sought to put material before the Senate so that he could clear his name. He subscribed to this material on oath and if he has done that we are entitled to see the whole of the documents and make our judgment not only on whether they are of value but also on what parts of them are significant. We should not be dependent upon what a newspaper tomorrow morning chooses to print of these documents. We have already seen selective tabling and printing of documents and we have not yet seen the whole story. It is of value to this Senate to see the whole of the documents. Although there could not be anything left of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon</inline> has said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> has not already disposed of in his magnificent speech, there are one or two sludges that I want to pick up. In his attack, and this is something that has been said already, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon</inline> talked of his petty sessions experience and the fact that in that jurisdiction documents are not used in this way. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>It was pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> that in the courts time and again in custody proceedings and all kinds of other cases proceedings are based on documents. Documents are produced. What is the particular value of that? Instead of coming into a jurisdiction and finding out the evidence piece by piece with no prior knowledge, the documents are there in which a person sets out his record and his evidence. There is the advantage that those concerned can look at it and cross-examine on it. There is the advantage of being able to tear it to pieces if it is not true. This is the situation here. The correct procedure for this Senate is not to have another grand type of investigation by having someone before the Bar of the Senate and having no knowledge of what he is going to say and then having Ministers, as has happened today, endeavouring to make a laughing stock of such proceedings. Obviously we ought to give this man the chance to have these documents tabled. One look at them shows how extensive they are. It is no use <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon</inline> asking us why we are cluttering up the Senate with these documents for one only has to look at <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> to see that there has been a cluttering up of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> with documents, but not all the documents- just those that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor,</inline> the Prime Minister and others have chosen to put before us. </para>

            <para>-That is right. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> points out to us that that is what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland said on television in a debate with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood-</inline> &#39;The public knows all that it needs to know&#39;- and he has since admitted that he was wrong in saying that and that sometimes one makes mistakes on television. I give him that to his credit. However, we want to know all that this man wants to put before the Senate so that we can then judge whether further investigation is needed. When we have all looked at the documents those of us who think there is something worth doing about what is contained in them can go ahead and do it. There is machinery to do that. It is no use saying here that this man should have been brought here next week, stood up in the back of the Senate and examined in a way which we have already seen demonstrated to be not very effective. It is obviously a matter where the facts should be looked at first. A man who has put his own words in writing can be judged by them and examined upon them. </para>

        <para>Finally, it is not just the case of an individual claiming to have been slandered and wanting to clear his name and put forward some views. The Senate could not cope with that sort of thing. This deals with a matter that has been in the Senate and in the other House of Parliament for something like 6 months now. It is a matter in which this man&#39;s name has been brought forward and in which all kinds of claims have been made. The Government relied so strongly on him and subsequently has gone cold on him. </para>
        <para class="block">Surely the least that he is entitled to is to be able to present the documents and have the Senate do something about them if the documents warrant it, but with all the protests this afternoon, with all the screams, yells and the cackling of geese in this chamber, one can say only that there must be some truth hiding somewhere, there must be something which those honourable gentlemen and ladies opposite are unhappy about because they would not otherwise have put up such a performance to avoid the mere tabling of documents. </para>

          <para>-A precedent is being established this afternoon. Never in my time in this Parliament have I seen a member of the Opposition seeking to have tabled a document produced by the Opposition, nor have I seen a motion by a member of the Government seeking to have tabled a document produced by the Government. This is obviously a plan, a plot, and we saw the puppet rise to his feet when the string-puller said: &#39;Get up&#39;. It was obvious to everybody on this side of the House that he was directed to do what he was told when he was told. We are now in a situation where we have challenged the Opposition to release freely to the Press a document which would protect any person who may be defamed in that document. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> hides behind the privilege of Parliament, as he has often done, to ensure that if that document is not accurate there can be no reaction against any person. </para>

        <para>The whole purpose of standing order 364 is to prove the authenticity of a document. We have the situation where a person who is endeavouring to have a document published has got his puppet to argue the point that the document should be tabled so that he does not have to prove the authenticity of the document. He is afraid to walk out into the Press Gallery and give it to the Press and say: &#39;This is the document that we have received from a person who is no longer in Australia and who may never come back to Australia. &#39; </para>

            <para>- I am unashamedly a member of the Labor Party. I support the decisions made by the Labor Party Caucus. I have never pretended, as honourable senators opposite do, that I have a free vote and that if I exercise a free vote no disciplinary action will be taken against me. Pressures have been put upon certain people in the last week. People who I thought would not succumb under the so-called free vote situation have succumbed because of the threat that they will not get another endorsement if they cross the floor or refrain from voting. But that is not what we are debating now. We are debating the question whether an 80-page document should be tabled. I do not know whether the Leader of the Opposition is also suggesting that the other documents that he has before him should be tabled. I am saying that he does not have the guts to release this document to the Press without its tabling. He does not have the guts to stand up and say: &#39;We will give this to the open Press of this country&#39; and let the persons who may be defamed take the appropriate action. Again I repeat that we have not had the opportunity of seeing it. The Leader of the Opposition is hiding in a coward &#39;s castle- the Parliament- in relation to this matter.  His  tame cat puppet has risen at the motion of a finger to move a motion to have the document tabled. </para>

        <para>In my time in this Parliament it has never happened that a member of the same Party has sought to use that standing order in order to have a document tabled. I challenge honourable senators opposite to show me one occasion on which a member of the same Party, whether he be a member of the Opposition or, indeed, a member of the Government, has used standing order 364 to force the tabling of a document for which the Opposition or the Government has refused leave so to do. That, is an example of the kind of Dirty Dick tricks that the Opposition is getting up to. We heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> talk earlier about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Richard</inline> Nixon, the former  President  of the United States of America. At one time Nixon was holier than thou to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood.</inline> He put the kids into Vietnam to be slaughtered. At that time <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> was saying that Nixon was right. But the moment Nixon gets caught with his fingers in the till who repudiates him first? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood. Senator Greenwood</inline> is the man who had mothers&#39; homes raided on Christmas Day in the hope that he would catch some person who was legitimately and properly evading the draft. That is the kind of person with whom we are dealing. At the same time as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> was running around Carlton trying to find draft dodgers the Ustashi were blowing up people in Sydney. He could never find the people who were responsible for those bombings because he has never exercised his mind to do so. He was happy when that kind of thing was happening. He was happy when he had to find draft dodgers. </para>

I hope the same point of order will be raised in the future when people like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> stray from the mark in the remarks that they are making and that they will be kept to the point at issue. The point I am making now and the point I made in my earlier remarks is that a precedent is being established today by the action of a puppet in rising to his feet at the instigation of a string-puller to move a motion in relation to the tabling of documents that he believes should be tabled. The Leader of the Opposition does not have the guts to give them to the Press for free publication; so he is using a standing order of this Parliament for the purpose of having these documents tabled. He is going to win on the vote of a dead man. Good luck to him if he gets away with this kind of snide and underhand practice. </para>

        <para>The  DEPUTY PRESIDENT-  Order! I think it would be fair, unless the Senate determines otherwise, to hear other speakers who wish to be heard on this matter. A member of the Government side of the chamber rose and I then looked across to the Opposition side of the chamber to see whether any Opposition senator wanted to speak and only one Opposition senator had risen. I will give the opportunity to any honourable senator who wishes to participate in this debate to do so. I call <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button.</inline></para>

          <para>-I understood <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poyser</inline> to describe <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> as a poppet rather than a puppet. I think we all agree with that. Many references have been made in the debate by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> and others to the desire of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> to clear his name. I understand that when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> came to Australia that was his announced purpose. There is a difference, of course, between somebody who wants to come before the Senate and clear his name, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> said he did, and the exercise which was engaged in last week. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> could quite properly have come before the Senate on Tuesday or Wednesday of last week and cleared his name by a simple statement. But that was not the cause of the delay last week. The cause of the delay was not that the Opposition wanted to facilitate <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani&#39;s</inline> clearing of his name but that it wanted to obtain material which hopefully would besmirch the name of the Government and particularly the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam).</inline> That is a completely different exercise which is still being a little confused in the minds of honourable senators opposite today. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The purpose of the motion now before the Senate is to use <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani&#39;s</inline> express wish to clear his name as a sort of trojan horse to be wheeled into the Senate and out of which will come some material which may or may not be damaging to the name of the Government. </para>

The Government&#39;s case in this regard is not that we are particularly concerned about the contents of the documents; in a political sense, they have now become a great yawn and I do not think many honourable senators, let alone anybody else, would even bother to read them. The basis of our objection is not, as is hoped by Opposition senators, that the documents will be embarrassing in some way, but rather that it is a misuse of the procedures of the Parliament to introduce documents in this way. It is a misuse of the procedures of the Parliament because the exercise is not to protect <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani&#39;s</inline> name, as has been claimed, but to do something else and to do it on the basis of a classic hearsay situation. </para>

            <para>- Let me come back to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> &#39;s point. He said that we did not table all the documents. Of course we did not table all the documents. The ones which were in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani&#39;s</inline> possession and which I understand now to be in the possession of the Opposition were not our documents. We could not table them. I do not see the point that the honourable senator is making about that. The only objection we have is that it is a misuse of the procedures of the Parliament. To go on with this nonsense about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani&#39;s</inline> name as being a matter of importance to the Opposition is just the utmost hypocrisy. If one looks to see who asked that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> be brought before the Bar of the Senate, that information can be found in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 28 October when the  President  recorded that he had received a letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> about this matter and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> had received a letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> asking him to facilitate his appearance before the Bar of the Senate for the purpose of clearing his name. The Opposition had all last week to do that. It was not a difficult thing for an Opposition which has a majority in the Senate to facilitate, if it was applying its mind to that particular problem. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> laughs because he knows that the Opposition was not the least bit interested in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr</inline></para>

          <para>- That small bundle of papers is a pretty tiny bit of change out of $4 billion; and, if it writes the final words on this unsavoury adventure into the backyards of London, Geneva and wherever else these people travel in their shady dealings, it might do a service if it were tabled. I can see nothing wrong with adding that mass of papers to all the others with which we have been dealing. I tabled some papers the other day. Some of them obviously were false; yet they appeared on the front page of a nationally known newspaper and were brandished in front of the public as being of importance. They have since proved to be of no importance. I tabled another letter copy which I hope is not true. I do not know whether it is or is not. </para>

            <para>- Yes, and I had them incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> So I see nothing wrong with having these documents added to the general mass of paraphernalia. I take the point that not many honourable senators, if any, will read them. They will have all sorts of funny little code aspects to them. They will have funny little names that probably will mean something else, and they will be practically useless, I believe. I think it would be useful to get on to some fresh subjects in politics. As I said, if that little bit of change out of $4 billion is going to do the trick, let us have it. I can see nothing wrong with supporting the motion. </para>

          <para>- 1 wish to speak briefly to this motion because 1 doubt very much whether at least some members of the Opposition realise just what they are doing by invoking standing order 364 in these circumstances. It is inevitable that this motion will be agreed to and that the documents will be tabled, but that result will have been achieved by the Opposition, in my submission, choosing an extremely wrong procedure when, while it continues to have the numbers, it has open to it two completely proper forms of procedure. The simple fact is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> has become the foster child of the Opposition. 1 hear the laughter from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sim,</inline> but I believe that members of the Opposition are acting as good foster parents. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Members of the Opposition became aware of the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> was about to arrive in Australia. They organised government transport to meet him at the nearest airport. That is a quite proper thing to do. Then they took him to a $23- a-night motel, but the pressure was a little hot there so they removed him- again acting like good foster parents- to the more rarified atmosphere of the Lakeside Hotel. They gave him the very best counsel that they were able to muster during the next 24 hours. I use the words &#39;that they were able to muster&#39;, because I should imagine that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> was not invited to advise on the documents; otherwise I think that the result might have been quite different. I do not believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> would have got his 2 professions of law and politics so mixed up as to do what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott</inline> did; that is, act like a lawyer, speak properly in Sydney at lunchtime on the Tuesday and say that there was nothing to implicate the Prime Minister in the 8 suitcases of documents, and then come back to Canberra about 4 hours later, act like a politician and retreat from the previous position. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> would not have done that because he is an honourable man. All I can say is that it is a great pity that the Opposition does not take more notice of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> in the negotiations that are taking place, and seek his advice. I said that there were open to the Opposition 2 options which were proper. One was to do what I believed from all the media statements that I read about 9 days ago the Opposition would do, that is, to call <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> to the Bar of the Senate. </para>

Does it mean that in the days when the previous Government was infamously committing this country to war in Vietnam, if with the support of the Australian Democratic Labor Party the Opposition had produced a statutory declaration which purported to prove that the former Prime Minister had lied in relation to our involvement, it would have been proper to get that declaration before the public by this means?

            <para>- I am concerned-I thought that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> had assented to my proposition- that it is extremely dangerous for the Opposition in the Senate to use its numbers and standing order 364 in this way when it has other avenues open to it. Why does it not move to set up the select committee? </para>

            <para>-Senator Withers will learn then. He does not tell us what he is going to do, and we will not tell him what we are going to do. That is a separate issue. I will not be diverted. The Opposition has the numbers to set up the select committee. If the Opposition is really serious in getting to the public the truth of this matternot a one-sided story, but a story tested by crossexamination why did it not today, before it adopted this procedure, move for the setting up of the select committee and let the statutory declaration go to the committee? The Opposition has the numbers to set up the committee, and it knows it. </para>

            <para>-That may be all right. The Opposition can make light of this matter. Opposition senators will live to regret that they used standing order 364 in this manner. Finally, on the merits, lest it be said that we want to conceal something, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> could not produce out of the document that undoubtedly he has read something a little more cogent than paragraph 15 and the evidence in the document allegedly supporting what is contained in paragraph 15, all I can say is that this is much ado about nothing. </para>

One is the matter which is now before the Senate, and that is the restoration of the Appropriation Bills to the notice paper. The situation in which we now find ourselves would not have arisen if it had not been for the lunatic course upon which the Opposition set itself, namely, to try, for the second time within 2 years, to destroy a government which was elected for the first time less than 3 years ago. </para>

            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">-Senator Greenwood</inline>said that members of the Opposition do not destroy governments. I think that between the lot of them they destroyed the Gorton Government and the McMahon Government which preceded us, and they destroyed those governments quite admirably. Not only do they destroy governments but they destroy Leaders of the Opposition. We saw only recently the destruction of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Snedden</inline> after we had an undertaking that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> would walk on hot coals through the Valley of Death on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Snedden</inline> &#39;s behalf. In fact they tried to destroy the Government in May 1974, but the people would not accept their offer. The Government was returned in May 1974. Since then we have tried to carry out the policy on which we were elected. We have carried out that policy to a very large extent. The Opposition does not like that policy. For that reason it is hellbent on destroying the Government which the Australian people elected by overwhelming majorities in 1 972 and 1 974. </para>
          </talk.start>

        <para>The Opposition is using its majority in the Senate. At the last Senate election in 1974 the Australian Labor Party gained approximately 200 000 more votes than the Liberal and Country parties senators who sit opposite us. Opposition senators have not been prepared to come out openly and reject the Budget. They have tried to use a subterfuge by moving a motion which is similar in effect to a motion which they moved last year and which we acted upon at that time. It is a motion to the effect that the Senate should withhold supply until such time as the Government has agreed to hold an election. </para>
        <para>As a number of senators on this side of the chamber have pointed out, that motion would not have been carried had not the Premier of Queensland acted completely contrary to all convention, to all decency and to all established practice. When the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner</inline> died the Premier of Queensland appointed to fill his position a person who was not a member of the Australian Labor Party in contravention of the practice which has always been religiously followed by Labor governments. </para>
        <para>Only a couple of years ago when the former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Prowse</inline> retired from the Senate shortly before his term of office was due to expire, the Labor Government of Western Australia appointed a gentleman by the name of Reid to fill the position for a short time. He was known as Easy come easy go Reid&#39;. He became a senator before the next Senate election was due. As it happened, he was caught up in the thralls of the double dissolution and we lost him. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> was appointed here, obtaining an advantage -by not having to stand for election. It was quite obvious what the Country Party was doing in artificially inducing not a birth but a departurein this case that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Prowse-</inline> in order to replace him with former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid.</inline> Despite that fact, because a Country Party senator had retired the Tonkin Labor Government in Western Australia had no hesitation in appointing a Country Party senator to replace him. Had that been done here; had the same decency been shown by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen</inline> as was shown by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tonkin;</inline> had the same respect for democratic traditions and conventions been shown by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen</inline> as was shown by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tonkin</inline> when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tonkin</inline> had much more reason not to follow the conventions because it was quite obviously a ploy that was being followed by the Country Party whereas in fact our former colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner,</inline> died while he was in office; and had <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen</inline> followed tradition, the Opposition would not have had the majority to enable them to carry a resolution that the Budget be deferred until such time as we had undertaken to hold this election. </para>
        <para>I think that tells us volumes of the character of the people who sit opposite and it tells us volumes also about those people within the Opposition who say that they would not vote to reject a Budget. When they say that they are speaking with a forked tongue because they know very well that the resolution which has been voted on here was a resolution which would not have been carried had proper procedures been followed. The resolution was tantamount to the rejection of the Budget. The Opposition says to us: &#39;Why do you not go to the people? Why do we not have an election?&#39; We have an answer to this- a reasonable answer and an answer which is accepted by an overwhelming majority of the Australian people. It is that if a government is elected for a 3-year term it is completely improper and completely undemocratic that an undemocratically constituted Upper House should be able to pick the time for that government to go to an election. It is completely improper because all of us ought to know, even if we do not know, that at the present time the whole of the world is involved in an economic crisis and that all governments become unpopular during a period of economic crisis. </para>
        <para>Everyone remembers the Great Depression which extended from 1929 into the 1930s. Every government in Australia which was in office in 1929 was defeated. A Federal Labor government was defeated, a State Labor government in Victoria was defeated, a State Nationalist Government in Queensland was defeated. In every State in Australia whoever was in office of whatever party went out of office. They went out of office because of the unpopularity that comes from being in government when there is a recession. If a government has a Senate which rejects its legislation- if a government faces the circumstances that we have faced while we have been in government- it is almost impossible for a government to introduce the legislation and to carry out the programs which are necessary in order to combat this great depression. There is a depression. I do not believe it is any exaggeration, when one sees the level of unemployment and the level of inflation in the advanced capitalist countries throughout the world, to say that there is a depression. Although this depression is taking a different form from that which the last great depression took, on this occasion we have inflation instead of the deflation which accompanied the previous depression. But it is a depression and it requires measures which must, for the time being, be unpalatable. Even if the Opposition were in government whatever it did would be unpalatable to many Australian people. So unpatriotic are our opponents that they take advantage of this situation to create economic chaos throughout the country so they can move across to the right hand side of the Senate and the House of Representatives and once again be a government which can again pursue the policies which proved so disastrous to this country during the 23 years for which they were last in office. </para>
        <para>The members of the Opposition have said that the Budget which has been introduced by this Government ought to be condemned. They have said that the Budget ought to be rejected. They have even said that the Budget has failed. How they can tell that a Budget has failed when the Budget has not even been passed and has not even been given an opportunity to be seen in action by the people is a mystery which defies the most vivid imagination. That is what members of the Opposition have said. They have said there is a great crisis which must be solved- a crisis relating to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> about whom we have heard so much this afternoon and about whom I would not want to weary the Senate by referring to him at any greater length. We have heard so much about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani.</inline></para>

            <para>- Well, directly. If there had been something which implicated the Prime Minister or anyone else indirectly, I think we would ha.ve heard all about it. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott</inline> had found anything there that could have linked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> or anybody else directly or indirectly I do not think that he would have preserved this maidenly silence on the subject. I think we might have heard from him today, for example, in the House of Representatives. Have we heard anything from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott,</inline> Q.C., or his instructing solicitor, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Howard?</inline> No, we have heard not a word from either of them of any evidence which would implicate anybody directly or indirectly, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> reminds me, on this topic. This is such a gripping matter that I feel it would be a pity to rush it. I think that the things which I will be revealing here during the course of this debate will be so exciting that it would be a pity to cramp them in any manner whatsoever. I  therefore seek leave to continue my remarks later. </para>

          <para>In the 1972 election speech of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> it was foreshadowed that moves would be made to licence overseas and interstate travel agents operating in Australia. Shortly after the Government assumed office, action was taken to commence the preparation of appropriate national legislation the basis of which was to be the protection of consumer interests. Ensuing discussions with the State governments and travel industry organisations revealed general support for such legislation. </para>
          <para>In their operations, travel agents are principally engaged in the sale of both domestic and international bookings on all forms of transport and on package tours which generally include travel, sightseeing and accommodation. For providing this service travel agents receive a commission on sales. </para>
          <para>Accurate information is not available at present regarding the financial magnitude of travel agency operations in Australia, although recent estimates have it that the gross commissionable sales of international and domestic air travel by agents during the year ended 1973-74 were of the order of $400m. </para>
          <para>At present the main constraints on travel agents are associated with the accreditation requirements of the major air and sea carriers and travel industry associations. Indirectly, the various accreditation systems have benefited travellers because the systems, particularly those of carriers, maintain standards relating to such factors as financial stability, turnover and experience. Bonding is an integral part of accreditation. However, its prime purpose is to protect the interests of carriers not travellers; travellers must rely on the goodwill of carriers to look after their interests. </para>
          <para>There are no reliable statistics on the number of businesses operating ostensibly as travel agents although conservative estimates suggest around 1500 agencies Australia wide. Of this number, less than 50 per cent would have any recognised accreditation to support their operations. </para>
          <para>From his knowledge of the travel trade, the Minister for Tourism and Recreation is convinced that the vast majority of travel agents conduct their business by reasonable and sensible standards having due regard to the interests of both clients and principals. However, because of the actions of some irresponsible people, the reputation of travel agents is clouded not only to outsiders but also to those within the travel industry. </para>
          <para>All the efforts of travel industry organisations such as the Australian Federation of Travel Agents and the International Air Transport Association to enforce their codes of ethics have so far proved ineffective in preventing agency failures. While the number of failures has been small, the impact on those affected has been considerable. </para>
          <para>To stress the tragic implications of agency failures for travellers, it is worth highlighting one of the more outstanding recent failures. Some honourable senators will no doubt recall the spectacle of the collapse of Travel House of Australia during 1972. When the company closed its doors hundreds of travellers were stranded throughout the world and many were unable to take that overseas trip for which they had already paid. In addition to losing their money many travellers were subjected to gross inconvenience and had to seek assistance from Australian missions overseas. </para>
          <para>Investigations by the Victorian AttorneyGeneral revealed that the company had accumulated debts amounting to $774,000 and had realisable assets worth less than $100,000. It was found the company&#39;s affairs had been grossly mismanaged and clients&#39; funds had been misused. </para>
          <para>It is time, therefore, that the community can turn to travel agents confident in the knowledge that they are dealing with professional people bound by codes and practices which uphold their interests. Travel industry organisations have tried to develop such confidence, but since they have been unable to enforce those standards aimed at achieving this, they looked to the Government for assistance. The Bill could thus be seen as a response to industry needs quite apart from its consumer protection emphasis. </para>
          <para>State governments have indicated that they favour a uniform Act and, with the exception of N.S.W., have agreed not to introduce separate legislation if Australian Government legislation is satisfactory. In the case of N.S.W., that Government felt its citizens needed protection against travel agents in the interim and, therefore, proceeded to introduce their legislation which was implemented last year. It should be added at this stage that the then N.S.W. Minister for Tourism, now the Premier, stated that if national legislation was introduced and it was acceptable to the N.S.W. Government, then the N.S. W. legislation would be allowed to lapse. </para>
          <para>The legislation has been developed after lengthy and detailed discussions with the travel industry and the States. The Minister for Tourism and Recreation has made every effort to include all the points raised, provided they met the basic objective of protecting the travelling public. At the same time, he sought to avoid imposing such harsh and stringent controls as to cause a major disruption to the travel industry. </para>
          <para>The result has been a complex piece of legislation, It requires careful study to be fully understood. </para>
          <para>The Bill has been subject to close public scrutiny since the Government introduced it on 6 March in the other place. Suggestions for amendments were received by the Minister for Tourism and Recreation and those which were seen to improve the Bill have now been included. I would now like to provide honourable senators with some brief comments on the principal elements of the Bill. Part I defines the business of a travel agent. In summary, the definition covers persons who, in their normal course of business, undertake or offer to arrange travel and /or accommodation and meals for other persons involving the use of facilities they do not own. Charter and tour operators are specifically included as travel agents because, although they are principals in marketing tours, their operations involve the use of facilities which do not belong to them. </para>
          <para>Whilst this definition can be interpreted widely, it is not intended to cover certain activities and in order to exclude them appropriate exemption provisions are incorporated. For example, the legislation will not apply normally to principals provided they only offer to the public, services or facilities they own. The appointment of the Registrar of Travel Agents is also provided for under Part I. The Registrar will be engaged under the Public Service Act and his main functions will be to assist the proposed Travel Agents Regulation Board in administering the legislation. Part II provides for the establishment of the Travel Agents Regulation Board which will be primarily responsible for the administration of the legislation. The board will comprise three part-time members, namely a chairman, with a legal background, a departmental representative and another member who will have a knowledge of and experience concerning the business of travel agents. </para>
          <para>To facilitate meetings of the Board, provision has been made for the appointment of up to 7 deputy members any one of whom could stand in for the member representing travel agents on the Board. Normally, a deputy member would be invited to stand in for the other member when the member was unable to attend a particular meeting. The Board will be assisted in its work by staff from the Department of Tourism and Recreation. For the convenience of enabling decisions to be made without continual reference to the Board, provisions has been made for the Board to delegate powers and functions to the Registrar or staff. Part III is a key section of the Bill. This </para>
          <para>Part outlines various restrictions on conducting a travel agency and specifies penalties which will result from contravention of the different provisions. The question of penalties was the subject of particular attention during drafting of the Bill. To maximise the effect of consumer protection, onerous penalties have been provided for in this Part and in other Parts of the Bill as a deterrent to malpractices by agents. </para>
          <para>It should also be pointed out that Part III embodies a fundamental principle which is developed in later Parts of the Bill, namely that each authorised travel agency premises will have to be under the immediate control of a registered travel agent manager unless the Board approves otherwise. The concept underlying this principle is that a person competent in travel matters will be responsible for the maintenance of statutory standards within the agency at all times. Part IV is concerned with the registration of travel agent managers and the licensing of travel agencies. Individuals will be registered as travel agent managers on the basis of integrity and expertise in travel matters. Registration is an integral part of the principle of travel agency management. Through registration, it is envisaged that minimum standards for qualifications and experience will be established which should lead to a higher degree of professionalism in the conduct of persons engaged in travel matters. </para>
          <para>On the other hand, travel business, that is, agencies, will be licensed on the basis of financial stability and the business integrity of the owners. Licensing will be the principal device used to control the activities of travel agencies. In essence, without a licence, no person, partnership or company will be allowed to operate a travel agency. Provided an applicant for a licence meets the necessary criteria, the Board will approve the licence. However, the licensee will not be able to conduct the agency unless he is a registered travel agent manager or until he engages the services of a registered travel agent manager to supervise the business. The Bill requires that all travel agency premises will be licensed. Therefore, in cases where an organisation owns several agencies, each location will have to be licensed separately. Part V deals with the accounts and records which licensees will be required to maintain. The provisions are designed to ensure that proper accounts are kept, that clients&#39; funds are used for the purpose for which they are paid to an agent and also to bring a degree of uniformity in accounting methods adopted by agencies. Agents will be required to open an account with a bank and deposit into it all moneys received from or on behalf of clients. </para>
          <para class="block">The account will be subject to regular audit and also scrutiny by authorised officers of the Board. </para>
          <para>Some honourable senators will no doubt be prompted to ask why trust accounting provisions are not specified. Before proceeding to develop the accounts provisions, various policy options, including trust accounts, were carefully studied. Having regard to the objectives of the legislation, travel industry practices and the practical application of trust accounts it was decided to avoid the use of trust accounts in their strictest sense. It was felt that the most sensible approach would be to devise accounting arrangements which would require moneys exchanged between travel agents and their clients to be channelled through a statutory account. An important point which should be stressed is that this Bill provides for the stringent supervision of accounts and records. Wide powers are given to the Travel Agents Regulation Board and the Registrar to ensure that accounts and records are properly maintained. The Minister for Tourism and Recreation informs me that he is satisfied that the legislation provides ample protection of clients&#39; moneys in travel agents statutory accounts. Trust accounts would afford no greater protection but would be more costly to administer. In addition, there is the protection of the proposed Fidelity Fund. </para>
          <para>Under Part VI, the duties of licensed travel agents in their dealings with clients and principals, are outlined. The key requirement is for the agent &#34;to exercise due care, skill or diligence in acting for a client&#34;. The failure by an agent to observe his statutory obligation will be dealt with by the Board which could order, among other penalties, revocation of a licence. Provision has been made for the Board to consider legitimate grievances against licensees or registered travel agent managers. Parts VII and VIII are mainly concerned with procedural matters associated with cancellation of the registration of a travel agent manager, the surrender or cancellation of licences and the conduct of inquiries by the Board. Honourable senators will find the various provisions of these Parts self-explanatory. So far the Bill has concentrated on supporting the interests of and promoting the rights of travellers- and to a degree principals. Part IX seeks to protect the rights of those persons seeking approval to operate as travel agents and those persons already authorised to operate as such, by allowing them the right of appeal to a tribunal. Part X provides for the issue of permits for the temporary supervision of an agency, for example, in the event of the death of a licensee. A permit may be subject to special conditions as determined by the Board. </para>
          <para>Part XI is another important area and relates solely to the establishment and maintenance of the Travel Agents Fidelity Fund. The purpose of the Fund is to compensate travellers for financial losses suffered because of the activities of travel agents. The Fund, which will be administered by the Board, is seen as the ultimate protection that can be afforded the interests of agents&#39; clients. The resources of the Fund will initially be raised using deposits contributed by licensed travel agents. Details of the size of the Fund and the amount of the deposit licensees will be required to contribute are to be covered in the regulations. It is intended that the Fund should be selfperpetuating and in order to achieve this the Board will be empowered to invest the resources of the Fund. In time, the growth of the Fund through investment could ease the financial obligations of licensed travel agents towards maintaining the Fund. In the event that the resources of the Fund are depleted due to successive agency failures, the Board will be able to make a levy on licensees. In this way the Fund can be maintained at a level such that additional claims for compensation can be met. Only certain types of financial losses will be eligible for compensation under the Fidelity Fund. The various categories are covered under Clause 91. For each category, the loss sustained must be related to a failure on the part of an agent to properly discharge his obligations to a client. Compensation will not be payable unless it can be shown that a travel agent failed in his obligations under the Act and the licence of a travel agent was subsequently suspended, revoked, cancelled or expires and not renewed. It will be appreciated that the Bill provides for the travel agent to exercise due care, skill and diligence. </para>
          <para>Honourable senators will note that compensation will not be payable for every conceivable circumstance or &#39;loss&#39; which a person may suffer. A claim on the Fund must be for the actual pecuniary loss suffered. By this, it is meant that travellers must accept that during the course of a tour, certain events or additional costs may be imposed upon them over which an agent has no control whatsoever and could not reasonably be held to blame. Claims for damages in respect of inconvenience, ill health, etc., will not be allowed. Some limit needs to operate to enable the Fund to meet claims arising from several failures at any particular time. For this purpose, it is proposed that in respect of any one defaulting licensed travel agent a limit be prescribed in the regulations on the total amount which may be paid out to cover the aggregate amount of claims for compensation. Honourable senators will note that the Board may direct a claimant to institute proceedings against a licensee to ensure all avenues of recourse open to the claimant have been properly pursued. The costs of such proceedings will be borne by the Fund. In the event of an overpayment on a claim, the Board will be able to institute its own proceedings against a claimant or the former licensee to recover the amount. </para>
          <para>Finally, I come to Part XII of the Bill. This Part covers a number of miscellaneous matters regarding the conduct of an agent or licensee and the general administration of the legislation. For example, if the Board has refused a person registration as a travel agent manager on the grounds that he was not a person of business integrity or has had his registration revoked then a licensee must not knowingly employ that person unless the approval of the Board is obtained. This provision clearly seeks to protect the public interest against those persons whose competence or integrity in the arrangement of travel are questionable. In relation to administration, specific provision is made to exempt the Board&#39;s operations from taxation liability- the provision is in the usual form for statutory bodies. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I commend the Bill. </para>

              <para>- I shall seek the adjournment of this debate but indicate, as I did in relation to the Travel Agents Bill 1975 in reply to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland said about there being 34 Bills on the notice paper waiting to be dealt with, that if we did not keep on dealing with the same legislation day in day out as we have done over the past couple of weeks and if we got on with the legislation we would be able to get all these Bills through. I indicate again that the Opposition is anxious to see this legislation, with what we believe to be improvements, passed as soon as possible. We certainly will be supporting the overall objectives of the proposed legislation. </para>

          <para>The Customs Tariff Bill now before the Senate proposes amendments to the Customs Tariff 1966-1974. The Bill, which contains 27 Schedules, is designed to enact tariff changes made by Tariff Proposals introduced into the Parliament from 25 September 1974 to 20 August 1975. The tariff changes arise, in the main, out of decisions by the Government on recommendations made in reports by the Tariff Board, Industries Assistance Commission and Temporary Assistance Authority. The Bill also contains increases in Customs duties on potable spirits and manufactured tobacco products which formed part of the Government&#39;s budgetary program. </para>
          <para>All of the changes in the Bill have been in operation for some time. In view of the magnitude of the Bill and the numerous reports involved, I do not propose at this stage to detail at length the contents of each of those reports. However, I have had prepared a comprehensive summary setting out the nature of the changes in duty rates and the origin of each of the amendments contained in the Bill. This summary is now being circulated to honourable senators and I feel sure will be of assistance to them during the ensuing debate. I commend the Bill. </para>

              <para>The National Medical Media Council was not consulted about these specific requirements since its activities are not directed at radio and television advertising. The Council is concerned only with advertisements for therapeutic goods directed to medical practitioners in the publications of its member organisations. However, consultation took place with the representatives of all organisations whose members were likely to be affected by the new requirements in I heir commercial or professional activities. </para>

              <para>Not necessarily with each advertisement, but any information included must be factual.

              <para>I am not aware of the amount of any extra cost involved.

            <para>The Hospitals and Health Services Commission has established certain guidelines in relation to national organisations receiving support under the Community Health Program. These guidelines apply not so much to the organisations, beyond requiring them to be national in character, as to the types of activity which will be supported. Support is directed towards activities associated with influencing public and professional attitudes concerning various aspects of health care, and towards the provision of co-ordination and central resource services for organisations providing community health services through various branches or accredited groups. The Government is, however, currently considering the establishing of certain common guidelines in relation to the funding of national organisations by government welfare agencies. </para>
