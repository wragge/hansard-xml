          <para>Prime Minister Canberra  15 July 1975 </para>
          <para class="block">My Dear President, </para>
          <para>I refer to the summonses which have been served on certain officers of the Australian Public Service and on the Solicitor-General to attend before the Senate on Tuesday 15 July 1975 and from day to day thereafter to answer questions, and to produce relevant documents, files or papers in their possession or control, upon the matters contained in the Resolution of the Senate of 9 July 1975. The Resolution, a copy of which was attached to each summons, is directed to the activities of Ministers and servants and agents of the Government, relating to dealings by them prior to and subsequent to the Executive Council meeting of 13 December 1974 authorising the Minister for Minerals and Energy to borrow a sum not exceeding four thousand million dollars in the currency of the United States of America for temporary purposes. </para>
          <para>I write to you concerning the summonses that have been served on officers of the Public Service. The SolicitorGeneral, as the Second Law Officer under the Law Officers Act, is writing to you directly. The officers of the Public Service summoned will attend in accordance with the summonses. I wish to inform you, however, that each officer will be instructed by his Minister to claim privilege in respect of answers to all questions upon the matters contained in the Resolution of the Senate and in respect of the production of all documents, files and papers relevant to those matters. </para>
          <para>The inquiry is plainly an inquiry into Government policy and decisions of Government. The principle of Ministerial responsibility is, and must remain, the keystone of our Parliamentary system. In keeping with that principle, officers do not decide, and are not responsible for, Government policy or for Government action. </para>
          <para>What I have just said reflects a time-honoured constitutional principle of the greatest importance. It is a principle that has been frequently stated and has been endorsed by, among others, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies who has written . . . &#39;it would be curious and alarming if an anti-Government Senate could undermine the objectivity and non-political integrity of the Public Service by exposing its senior and most responsible officers to a Parliamentary inquisition from which they had a right to be immune and compelling their entry into a field of political debate &#39;. </para>
          <para>In the Government&#39;s view, the real intention of the nonGovernment parties in the Senate is to seek to avoid the normal and proper procedures of the Parliament. </para>
          <para>The House of Representatives was specially convened on 9 July 1975 to debate the whole subject of overseas borrowings. There had previously been a debate in the Senate on 12 June on an Opposition urgency motion. Answers have been provided to 69 questions without notice on the general subject of overseas borrowings, 37 in the Senate and 32 in the House of Representatives, between 31 October 1974 and 12 June 1975. Of the 7 questions placed on notice, 6 have been answered already. </para>
          <para>In the course of the proceedings in the House of Representatives on 9 July, the Leader of the Opposition tabled a series of 44 questions and all will be answered. He requested the tabling of certain documents and a response to this request will be given when the House of Representatives reconvenes on 19 August, although I add in that context that, in respect of the four Executive Council Minutes, the information sought has already been provided in answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>
          <para class="block">Wright&#39;s Question No. 646 (Senate Hansard 9 July, pages 2723/24). </para>
          <para>It is clear that the non-Government parties in the Senate have by no means fully tested this matter through the normal and proper Parliamentary procedures available to them- in debate, in questions and, if necessary, in urgency motions or even no confidence motions. The House of Representatives was recalled so that the normal and proper Parliamentary procedures could apply. What the Opposition proposes is a procedure essentially foreign and contrary to established Parliamentary principles and practice. </para>
          <para>I make plain the Government&#39;s view that what the Senate is seeking to do is to obtain through officers of the Public Service information and documents which should be sought from Ministers by the normal and proper procedures of the Parliament. In taking this course, the fundamental character of Ministerial responsibility is challenged. It is the Governmentnot the Public Service- that will answer in the Parliament any request, any challenge put to it. It is the Governmentnot the Public Service- that is responsible to the people. This is in accord with the principles on which our democracy is based. If these principles are successfully challenged, Government would become unworkable. </para>

        <quote>
          <para>Solicitor-General of Australia Canberra A.C.T. 15 July, 1975 </para>
          <para class="block">Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline></para>
          <para>May 1 refer to the summons and its attached Resolution which I received last Thursday, 10th inst. That Resolution recites the Senate&#39;s opinion &#39;that the Government has failed to give to the Parliament and the Australian people a proper, full and accurate account of the activities of its Ministers, servants and agents, relating to all dealings by them both prior to and subsequent to the Executive Council Meeting of 13 December 1974, which authorized the Minister for Minerals and Energy to borrow a sum not exceeding four thousand million dollars in the currency of the United States of America for temporary purposes&#39; and states that the Senate resolves that a number of named persons of whom I am one be called to the Bar of the Senate &#39;to answer questions upon these matters&#39;. The matters are the activities and dealings previously recited both prior to and subsequent to the Executive Council meeting of 1 3 December 1974. </para>
          <para>It is apparent, therefore, that whatever opinions I may have expressed in order that ultimately members of the Federal Executive Council might advise the Crown, fall within its terms. The Act (the Law Officers Act 1964-68) under which I was appointed provides that the Solicitor-General of the Commonwealth &#39;shall be the second Law Officer of the Commonwealth&#39; and is to be appointed by the GovernorGeneral. That is, the Solicitor-General is the second Law Officer of the Crown. The point of my mentioning this is but to indicate that I stand in a constitutional relationship to the Crown in which under the Constitution the Executive power of the Commonwealth alone is vested. </para>
          <para>It is a well recognised constitutional principle that the deliberations of the Crown are secret. To quote <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Owen</inline> Dixon: &#39;The counsels of the Crown are secret and an inquiry into the grounds upon which the advice tendered proceeds may not be made for the purpose of invalidating the act formally done in the name of the Crown by the GovernorGeneral in Council&#39;. </para>
          <para>The passage I have quoted may be found in his judgment in <inline font-style="italic">Australian Communist Party</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">The Commonwealth</inline> (1951) 83 C.L.R. 1 at 179. The principle is reflected in the oath taken by members of the Federal Executive Council which presumably in this respect derives from that taken by a Privy Councillor. This latter oath is set out in full in <inline font-style="italic">Anson &#39;s Law and Custom of the Constitution</inline> (1935) 4th Ed. Vol. II Part I p. 153. The relevant pan of each is, of course, the obligation of secrecy. </para>
          <para>In addition the right of the Crown or what is legally the same thing, the Executive, to claim privilege is clear enough. The accepted practice as mentioned in paragraphs 127 (as to the House of Commons) and 136 (as to the Courts) in <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Paper 1972 No. 168 Parliamentary CommitteesPowers over and Protection afforded to Witnesses</inline> by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator the</inline> Honourable I. J. Greenwood, Q.C. and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr R.</inline> J. Ellicott, Q.C. is that this privilege extends to opinions of the Law Officers. The principle applies whether they be written or oral. The Crown has claimed its privilege. As one of its Law Officers, I may not consistently with my constitutional duty intentionally act in opposition to its claim. </para>
          <para>The above considerations and much anxious thought have compelled me to conclude that I must object to answer any question relating to the Resolution that may be put to me, for should I answer any, the claim to privilege may be to that extent defeated. Naturally, 1 shall attend the Senate in  answer to the summons issued by it as one of the constitutional organs of government. </para>
          <para>I have taken the liberty of writing this letter to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> in the hope that you will inform the Senate of it and in the wish that it may receive prior notice of the position I have felt impelled to adopt. </para>
          <para>Yours sincerely, M. H. BYERS Solicitor-General of Australia </para>

            <para>- The Minister for Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator&#39;s question: ( 1 ), (2), (3) and (4) I have been personally interested in the development of non-smoking areas in Australian domestic aircraft. In February 1972, Ansett Airlines and TAA agreed to set aside groups of seats in both first class and economy class compartments for non-smokers, who might ask to bc seated in these areas when seats were being allocated prior to the departure of the flight. At that time 18 seats were set aside for non-smokers in DC-9 aircraft and 20 seats in Boeing 727-100 aircraft. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Since the introduction of non-smoking seats, which, I might add, were not widely availed of initially, both Ansett and TAA have carried out continuous market surveys to ensure that the provision of non-smoking seats has kept pace with social trends. In this regard non-smokers are now provided with 27 seats on DC-9 aircraft, 30 seats on B.72 7-100 aircraft and 36 seats on Boeing 727-200 aircraft, the number of seats being proportionate between first class and economy class compartments. </para>
          <para>I am sure that you will also be interested to learn that Qantas Airways has recently doubled its seat allocation for nonsmokers and will now provide up to 108 non-smoking seats on Boeing 747 aircraft and 40 non-smoking seats on Boeing 707 aircraft. Although some other international airlines do provide slightly more non-smoking seats, it is pleasing to see Qantas adapting to passenger requirements. lt must be recognised, however, that a significant number of air travellers do wish to smoke and would undoubtedly object strenuously to measures preventing them from doing so. The airlines are, of course, sensitive to this as. indeed, they are to the position of the non-smoker. The arrangements which they have introduced for the segregation of smokers and non-smokers is essentially a compromise. Nevertheless, it is an encouraging development in line with social trends and one which 1 am personally keen to see pursued further. </para>
          <para>As the level of community reaction against smoking increases, as hopefully it will, the arrangements made by the airlines for the accommodation of smokers on their aircraft will unquestionably reflect this changed community attitude. We might look forward, perhaps, to the assignment of smokers to seats in smoking areas, segregated from the majority of non-smokers. For the present, however, the airlines are endeavouring to ensure that their passengers, both smokers and non-smokers alike, are subject to the minimum of inconvenience. </para>

Is it also a fact that the administration of South Vietnam is being conducted by North Vietnamese military forces and not the PRG? Is the Minister aware that all indications are that the control of South Vietnam will be exercised by the People&#39;s Revolutionary Party of South Vietnam, referred to by North Vietnam as the Southern Party, and that the PRG has never been more than a shadow organisation with no right of independent action? When will the Government recognise the realities of the situation in South Vietnam? </para>

          <quote>
            <para>While the DRV has not made any announcement of its recognition of the PRG, it considers the PRG to be a separate government. The DRV relationship with the PRG is regarded as special and not on a par with the position of other governments whose recognition of the PRG it nevertheless supports. The PRG has a Special Representative in Hanoi who is in charge of Southern interests. </para>
            <para>The city of Saigon is being administered by a Military Management Committee. Other areas of South Vietnam appear to be administered by similar military management committees or by People&#39;s Revolutionary Committees. No details of the composition of these Committees are available. </para>
            <para>The PRG is the executive arm of the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF) which was established in 1960 and is a coalition of three South Vietnamese political parties, one of which is the People&#39;s Revolutionary Party (PRP) </para>
            <para>At least sixty-five countries have recognised the PRG. Before it assumed power on 30 April, the PRG was recognised by forty-six countries. Since then many other countries have recognised it. These include Britain, Burma, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, India, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan, Malaysia, Mexico, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Niger, Pakistan, Sweden and Thailand. In addition, a number of Governments claim that they recognise states not governments and therefore that the question of recognition does not apply. Included in these are France, Belgium and Switzerland, all of which have announced their intention to establish diplomatic relations with the PRG. </para>
            <para>The recognition of a government implies nothing more than the acceptance that the government is the government of the country. We accept that there are two legal entities in Vietnam, the one the DRV in North Vietnam and the other South Vietnam. The PRG is the only government now claiming to be the government in South Vietnam. In recognising it the Australian Government was recognising the realities in South Vietnam. The only alternatives to recognising the PRG were either to continue to recognise a government- the Government of the Republic of Vietnam- which all acknowledge went out of existence on 30 April, or to recognise a government- the Government of the DRV- which makes no claim to be the Government of South Vietnam. To have followed either of those courses would have been absurd precisely because neither would have recognised the realities of the situation in South Vietnam. </para>

            <para>-On 10 June 1975 (Hansard page 2389) <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sim,</inline> Western Australia, asked the Minister for Labor and Immigration How far have the guidelines laid down by the Prime Minister prevented South Vietnamese refugees from entering Australia on humanitarian grounds? Does the Minister accept the fact that South Vietnamese refugees pose a great human problem and that Australia has a role to play in alleviating this problem?&#39; The Minister undertook to convey the honourable senator&#39;s question to the Prime Minister, who has provided the following information. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The guidelines which I laid down for the admission of refugees from South Vietnam take into account those categories of people who have had the closest links with Australia, i.e. designated categories of relatives of people in Australia and people with long and close associations with the Australian presence in Vietnam. </para>
          <para>This policy has in fact provided for the entry of more people from Vietnam than the number who have arrived to date. Many of those eligible for entry were not able to take advantage of our offer to fly them to Australia because they could not obtain the travel documents required by the then Government in Saigon for them to leave South Vietnam. Since the change of Government in Saigon, the Australian Government has worked actively to assist those who were able to leave South Vietnam and are eligible for entry to come to Australia. Immigration officers have been sent to such places as Guam and Hong Kong and the Government has provided aircraft to bring approved cases to Australia, the most recent instance being the airlift of 201 refugees from Hong Kong. As I explained in my answer on 5 June 1975 (House of Representatives Hansard page 3403), the criteria for the admission of&#34; refugees from Vietnam to Australia are wider than the criteria which applied to migrants from Vietnam before the change of Government in that country and than those applying to evacuees from Vietnam who are now within American jurisdiction. </para>
          <para>The Government has consistently maintained that an international effort under the direction of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), who has the experience and respect required to carry out a humane and effective program, offers the best solution to the difficult problem of repatriating or resettling refugees from South Vietnam. In early May the Government approached the UNHCR to urge that a co-ordinated international program be adopted. Since then we have been in continual contact with the UNHCR about the resettlement of refugees. Only recently, on 20 June, I announced a further grant of $A1m to the UNHCR in response to a request for money to meet the costs for maintaining and resettling or repatriating Vietnamese and Cambodians who are temporarily resident in a number of Asian countries and America. This brought to $A3.5m the total of Australian grants to the UNHCR &#39;s Indo-China operations in financial year 1974-75 and to $A4.75m the amount that Australia has contributed to all international agencies over the same period for humanitarian relief in the area. In addition to this Australia has provided RAAF Hercules aircraft for ferrying humanitarian relief supplies in South Vietnam. The Australian Government has been both humane and generous in responding to the plight of refugees from Vietnam and has, I believe, made a significant contribution to alleviating the hardships they have experienced. </para>
