            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline>all honourable senators were saddened to hear of the death of former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline> Ivy Wedgwood on 24 July last. Dame Ivy was the first woman elected to the Senate to represent Victoria and played a full and active role in this chamber from her election in 1949 until her retirement in July 1 97 1 . She will be long remembered for untiring service as a member of various Senate and joint parliamentary committees, which included chairmanship of the 2 important committees concerned with health and welfare. From August 1962 until she retired, Dame Ivy held the position of Temporary  Chairman  of Committees. </para>
          <para>Both within and outside Parliament <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline> Ivy Wedgwood was a tireless campaigner for improved facilities for handicapped people. She was also vitally involved in the role of women in politics and in the work force. It was she who first suggested that the Government should set up a women&#39;s sect on within the Department of Labor and Immigration. In her work in the community at large, Dame Ivy was a Justice of the Peace and a Special Magistrate in the Children&#39;s Court of Victoria. In 1968 she was awarded the title of Dame Commander of the British Empire. </para>

            <para>- On behalf of the Opposition I join the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt)</inline> in expressing regret at the passing of our former colleague Dame Ivy Wedgwood. Dame Ivy had a long and distinguished record as a member of this chamber for 2 1 years. Before then she was active in politics for many years. In her political career she achieved many firsts. She was one of the original delegates to the 1944 Canberra and Albury conferences which formally constituted the Liberal Party of Australia. In 1949 she entered this Senate the first woman senator from Victoria. She became, and always was, an active member of the Senate, of the Senate committees and of the joint committees of the Parliament. She became the first woman member of the Public Accounts Committee in 1955, and she also served on the Joint Select Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House, and the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>She had the distinction of becoming the first woman Chairman of a Senate committee when, in 1 968, she was elected to chair the Senate &#39;s Select Committee on Medical and Hospital Costs. Her deep interest in health and welfare matters led to her becoming Chairman of the Standing Committee on Health and Welfare in 1970. Her services, as the Leader of the Government has said, were rightly honoured when she became a Dame Commander of the British Empire. Throughout her time in Parliament, Dame Ivy was a tireless campaigner for improved facilities for the handicapped. This was reflected in her service on the Senate Standing Committee on Health and Welfare. When I heard of the death of Dame Ivy I felt that I had lost not just a parliamentary colleague but also a very good personal friend and certainly a very good political friend. She was full of wisdom and had a lot of common sense. She had the capacity of being able to cut through a lot of the male political nonsense that goes on in this place, like a hot knife cuts through butter. Many a time I saw her put quite pompous politicians in their place by the exercise of some sound common sense. </para>
          <para>I know that throughout her parliamentary career Dame Ivy made great sacrifices to be within the Parliament.  Her  husband and survivor, Jack, had a very distinguished career as an infantryman, I understand, during the First World War. He had a very hard war and basically has suffered ever since. It was a great problem for Dame Ivy to be in politics while worrying about her husband at the same time. I am quite certain that Jack, as most of us in the Senate knew him, will be comforted by the fact that all honourable senators within this chamber who served with Dame Ivy are joining with the Leader of the Government in support of this motion. </para>

            <para>- I think it is appropriate that I, as Minister for Social Security, should say something about the death of Dame Ivy Wedgwood because she was certainly conspicuous during her membership of the Senate as one most interested in health and social welfare. She made many very constructive contributions to the determinations of the Senate on these matters. In fact her interest did not cease when she retired from the Senate. Only a few weeks before her death I had a very long conversation with her about some matters which interested her. She was still active in Victoria, her home State, in a number of pursuits of a social nature which were beneficial to the people in the area in which she lived. Apart from those activities, I think that all of us who knew her in the Senate had a very high regard for her not only as a member of Parliament but also as a person. As the Leader of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> has said, her husband <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jack</inline> Wedgwood was well known to nearly all of us who were senators at the same time as Dame Ivy. He was very favourably known; a man who had suffered great hardship as a result of serving this country. I know that the sympathy of all of us will go to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wedgwood</inline> in his very sad loss. </para>

            <para>-My National Country Party colleagues and I regret the passing of Dame Ivy Wedgwood. Women&#39;s International Year will mark the death of a woman who must be judged to be one of the most notable and successful women of Australia. Since federation there have been only 5 Dames of the British Empire to serve in Federal Parliament. This honour has been accepted by women from both political sides of Federal Parliament. It is an ultimate honour. In 1949 Ivy Wedgwood became the first woman senator from the State of Victoria. That flowed from her being one of the original delegates to the Canberra and Albury conferences which formally constituted the Liberal Party of Australia. My State is indebted for her representation and for her achievements. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In Federal Parliament Dame Ivy served as a Temporary  Chairman  of Committees, as a member of the House Committee, a member of the Joint Select Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House and a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts where she served for an unequalled record time of 16 years and virtually until the day of her retirement from Federal Parliament. I was a member of that Committee and can speak well of her contribution. Dame Ivy&#39;s work for community stability and progress was equal to her parliamentary career. She was a Justice of the Peace and a Special Magistrate in the Children&#39;s Court. She was also  president  of the Australian Council of Domiciliary Nursing and was that body&#39;s only  president. </para>
          <para>Dame Ivy contributed in a tireless way to the affairs of the Royal District Nursing Service, but her on-going work for the After-Care Hospital in my State was, 1 believe, her greatest work. During her last 3 years she served as president, and the work involved tremendous dedication and duty. She was involved in after care work for 15 years and on the day of her death was presiding on the board of that Hospital when she suffered a setback to her normal good health. Dame Ivy passed away on the evening of 24 July 1975. She led a full life and a successful life. Australia was a fortunate country to have provided a climate for her work. She did more than her share; she went the second mile. My Party colleagues and I extend our sympathy to Jack Wedgwood in his loss. </para>

            <para>-I rise also to pay my tribute to a lady who was a good friend and whose record distinguishes her as a notable Australian. Dame Ivy Wedgwood was the third woman senator to enter this chamber. As the Leader of the Government in the <inline font-weight="bold">Senator (Senator Wriedt)</inline> said, she was the first woman senator to represent the State of Victoria. She was elected to this Senate on 5 occasions and her constructive contribution to the work of this chamber is indelibly marked in its records. I remember her well as a person whose understanding and encouragement I have cause gratefully to remember because she was a friend throughout my entire political life. She was wise in the ways of politics. She was considerate and concerned. She was tolerant of people, of causes and of other people&#39;s problems. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I knew her for approximately 30 years. She had a wide range of interests throughout the period that I knew her, but I think her 3 great interests, as we would all remember, were her husband, the Liberal Party and the work she was able to do as a member of this chamber. She had been active, of course, in the Australian Women&#39;s National League and in the women&#39;s sections of the Liberal Party after the Women&#39;s National League disbanded in 1945. As the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers)</inline> has said, she was a foundation member of the Liberal Party and was one of the great band of people who, with little more to sustain them than the cause to promote and the enthusiasm to generate, founded one of the great political parties of this country. I think she will be remembered for her work, but to those who knew her she will be remembered as a friend. She leaves behind her a distinguished career, a compassionate concern for causes, for the handicapped and for people in whom she was interested. Above all, she leaves behind her a warm memory. </para>

            <para>-I support the motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt).</inline> Although I am a Victorian Government senator I had not quite so long an association with Dame Ivy as did some in this House. She was a remarkable person in her compassion and her feeling for aged persons. Everybody is aware of the work she did in this area, both in relation to aged persons homes and hospitals that could be established to assist those persons. This Parliament almost did the gravest injustice done to any person ever to sit in it when it allowed a situation under our pension scheme whereby, although she was an equal member of this chamber, she was not able to participate in the pension scheme in relation to the husband she loved and cared for for so many years. Fortunately this discrimination now does not exist. I can recall Dame Ivy and me discussing at great length and speaking in this Parliament about the terrible discrimination which was exhibited against a woman member of this chamber. I am pleased that that situation no longer exists, because there was not a more sincere or real case for equality than the case of Dame Ivy Wedgwood and the husband she has left. Jack is a very fine person. He is a man whom everybody on both sides of the Parliament respects and admires. In spite of the disabilities he suffered while giving service for his country, I have never heard him make one complaint. When one met him one never found him to be anything other than a cheerful person. I express my deep sympathy to Jack because he has lost a wonderful partner. </para>

          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir MAGNUS</inline>CORMACK (Victoria) This is the first time in my service in the Senate that I have felt bound to seek your eye, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> and rise to my feet when the Senate has had before it a motion of condolence. It is very sad for me that I have to do this on the occasion that marks the death of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline> Ivy Wedgwood. I do not intend to traverse the remarks that have been made by other honourable senators except to say, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> observed, that Dame Ivy Wedgwood died as she had lived- working hard and earnestly at those matters that had always concerned her in her parliamentary life and after she retired from the Senate. If anyone ever died in harness it was the late senator who, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> remarked, felt unwell when presiding over the board of the After Care Hospital. She was driven home and put to bed and died peacefully shortly afterwards. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Her</inline>parliamentary career was a parliamentary career to which she did not come unprepared, because her first interest in politics, as I recall it, was as a secretary of the Prime Minister of the day, subsequently Lord Bruce of Melbourne. It was when she was working for the Prime Minister of Australia that I think she first felt this sense of destiny which she subsequently fulfilled by entering the Parliament. My personal interest in her political career was, of course, that I was the  chairman  of the selection committee of the Victorian division of the Liberal Party which in 1 949 selected <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Wedgwood,</inline> as she then was, to be a Liberal Party candidate for the Senate election of 1949.  Her  subsequent career in the Senate, I am sure, justified the faith that the Party put in her. It was justified also by the electoral support that she subsequently achieved during the years in which she remained in the Senate. </para>
          <para>As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> said, she had a long and honourable career in the Senate but, in my mind, she was distinguished for 2 outstanding qualities. First of all, she was a woman who understood parliamentary procedures. I say that in no term of deprecation, because a woman who comes into Parliament and finds herself confronted with standing orders which have been devised for the character and quality of men and the peculiarities which they exhibit to each other from time to time sometimes feels slightly ill at ease. But the late senator understood that perfectly well and when deputising for the  President  and when acting as Temporary  Chairman  of Committees she exhibited an understanding of parliamentary procedures and a firmness of grasp as to how the Senate should conduct itself. That is the first thing for which I remember her. </para>
          <para>The second thing for which I remember her is, I think, more important. She was able to combine 2 careers, which I am sure male senators would find it extraordinarily difficult to do. That is to say, she was a senator fulfilling and discharging the senatorial responsibilities that devolved upon her as a senator and at the same time she was still fulfilling the life of a devoted wife to a husband who was equally devoted to her, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poyser</inline> observed. I do not think that in my lifetime I have seen 2 people who were so devoted to each other. The first concern of each was for the other partner. This became increasingly true as the disabilities of war wounds pressed down upon Dame Ivy&#39;s husband, who has survived her. I shall remember her for those 2 outstanding qualities which she possessed. I think the more important one was the conjugal fidelity with which she obeyed the behest of married life. I do not wish to say any more except to support the observations and remarks that have been made by my Senate colleagues and to join with others in supporting the motion which has so kindly been presented to the Senate by the Government Leader. </para>

            <para>- I wish to pay my respect and to add my voice to the tributes that have been paid by honourable senators to the valuable work that was carried out by the late Dame Ivy Wedgwood as an Australian citizen and of course in particular as a member of this Senate. I came into the Senate in 1 96 1 after she had been here for 10 years or more. Despite the fact that I was a member of the Opposition and she was a member of the Government parties, we got to know one another very well in the ensuing 10 years in which I remained a member of the Opposition. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>She was, I think, one of the first women chairmen of committees appointed by the Australian Senate. She was a member of the Senate Select Committee on Health and Hospital Costs and was appointed by the members of that Committee as its  Chairman.  She was the  Chairman  of the Senate Standing Committee on Health and Welfare. Also she was appointed as a member of the joint committee that was established to inquire into the siting of a new and permanent Parliament House. Of all those committees of which she was a member I too was a member. Especially in her work as  Chairman  of the Senate Select Committee on Health and Hospital Costs 1 came to acquire the utmost respect for her sincerity, ability and dedication. </para>

I think it fair to say that when he was the Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister for Health a very long, drawn out and detailed debate took place in this Parliament on amendments to the National Health Act proposed by the then Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson led for the Government in that debate, I had the honour to lead for the Opposition, and I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline> Ivy Wedgwood played a very prominent part. I believe that her memory will be retained for ever by posterity not only for the work that she performed as a member of the Senate committees to which I have referred but also in respect of the national health legislation that subsequently was enacted by this Parliament. She had a tremendous respect for the underprivileged section of. the Australian community. I join with my colleagues in paying tribute to the enormously valuable work she did as an Australian citizen. </para>

            <para>-I should like to be associated with the sentiments that have been expressed with such respect and affection about my colleague, the late Dame Ivy Wedgwood. I have been fortunate to tread many of the paths that she trod in her political career and it is inspiring to me to hear the sentiments that have been expressed today by her colleagues on both sides of the House. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers)</inline> mentioned that she was active in the formation of the Liberal Party of Australia. She has written into the history of the Liberal Party and I think it will be recognised that she has written into the history of women in political activity in this country. She knew that women needed to be integrated into the political system if they were to have the influence that we believe Australian women should have in political life. It was that spirit of integration at the formation of the Liberal Party which was very much the mainspring of her activity throughout her long political career. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The women in Victoria benefited greatly from the activities of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline> Ivy in Canberra. They benefited particularly from the support which she gave to them in the party political organisation in our State and in other States throughout Australia. We have heard a great deal of her political service. I would like to place on record her long service as  President  of the Australian Women&#39;s Liberal Club, which was very active during her presidency. She gave tremendous support to the members of the Club. She had a long political life. It is one that we remember with gratitude. At this time of recalling her activity, I wish to share in the expressions of sympathy, respect and affection for her beloved husband, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jack</inline> Wedgwood. </para>

            <para>-It would be remiss of me if I did not take the opportunity on this occasion to associate my name with the clear, complete and I think most appropriate statements that have preceded mine. I do so because my friendship with Dame Ivy Wedgwood began with the original conference that constituted the Liberal Party of Australia, since when her earnest devotion to work has been the outstanding characteristic of her purpose.  Her  deserved pride in the achievements and career of her husband was an obvious indication of the spirit of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline> Ivy Wedgwood towards Jack to whom, joining with other honourable senators, I express my sympathy. </para>

            <para>-I think I have previously answered a question of this sort. Ever since, firstly, the decision of the United Nations last year to admit spokesmen for the Palestine Liberation Organisation to the United Nations and, secondly, the recognition that that organisation is regarded by most of the Arab countries  as their representative, the PLO has been admitted to various organisations. As I remember the matter- I do not have notes about it in front of me- at the International Labour Organisation Conference an amendment was proposed which would have sought to bring the PLO to admit that it believed in the existence of Israel. We voted for that amendment because it would be a great step forward if one could bring the PLO just to say that. That amendment failed and when it did fail we proceeded to vote for the substantive motion. </para>

The decision of the Tribunal to remain open is not a prejudgment on its part of anything that might be in the Budget. As I have said, it is a precaution on its part to deal with any difficulties which may confront companies. This step is a further indication of the importance which the Tribunal attaches to responding quickly to the needs of the community, particularly the business sector of the community, in the discharge of its responsibilities under the Prices Justification Act. </para>

            <para>-My question is directed to the Minister for Labor and Immigration. I refer to numerous statements by the Prime Minister, the latest in July this year, that unemployment was continuing to fall. Is it a fact that the unemployment figures for July showed the worst unemployment in this country since the depression and that at that stage 287 666 persons or 4.81 per cent of the Australian work force were unemployed? Does the Minister acknowledge that this is the responsibility of the Federal Government? Was the increase inevitable in the light of Government policies which have created severe depression in industry and business? Is the Prime Minister&#39;s assertion that unemployment was falling a credible statement? Is he to be believed in future? </para>

            <para>- If the honourable senator seeks to make the point that our economy is still in a state of serious recession he will certainly get no dissent from me. The fact that the Prime Minister expressed the belief that unemployment was falling when it was in fact falling for a couple of months was an expression of hope that the recession may have bottomed. It turns out that that was not the case. We do not do any service to our parties, to this Parliament or to our country by refusing to look these facts in the face. As to the suggestion that this number of unemployed is entirely the responsibility of this Government, I do not think that even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster,</inline> with his usual extravagant estimate of the responsibility for all things evil falling on the head of the Australian Labor Party, would seriously believe that. </para>

          <para>We are in the middle of a serious world recession. Although I do not shun for one moment the responsibility which falls on this Government for some of the mistakes that it has made, I suggest that if honourable senators looked at the matter seriously they would realise that, as they have obviously been told lately, if they were running the economy they could not expect any improvement in the near future. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> to examine the figures closely. If he does he will see some pall i a ting features. For instance, more than all of the increase in unemployment in Victoria was due to a building strike which was on at that time. Some 4800 building workers who were on strike and who went onto relief accounted for the increase in the unemployment figures in Victoria. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> and other honourable senators will be patient at least until 8 o&#39;clock tonight they will discover what we propose to do to cure the ills of our economy. </para>

            <para>-I did see the reports to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Devittt</inline> has referred and which unfortunately it seems were run across the whole newspaper chain in Australia. I am surprised at the carelessness with which these reports are given, because the figure for the superphosphate bounty was quoted at not less than $456m, when in fact it is about $60m. The Government has before it the Industries Assistance Commission&#39;s report on superphosphate which, I think, was circulated to all members of Parliament yesterday. This document will require some considerable study. There is a dissenting report by one of the commissioners, and obviously his views will need to be taken into account. However, no decision has been taken by the Government on either the majority recommendation or the minority recommendation of the Commission. </para>

            <para>- I have not seen the report to which the honourable senator refers but I can inform him that when I was the Minister for the Media and the Government acted on my recommendation to establish additional broadcasting channels for the Australian Broadcasting Commission in Sydney and in Melbourne- namely, by the establishment of 2JJ in Sydney and 3ZZ in Melbourne- Cabinet then determined that the way in which the stations would be operated and programmed would be a matter for the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Therefore, if the report to which the honourable senator has referred is correct, I would assume that the .commissioners of the Australian Broadcasting Commission might be giving consideration to changing the format of that station. Again I merely emphasise that I do not know whether they are considering it, but if consideration is being given to this matter I assume that it is being given by the commissioners of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. I think that I should refer the other matters raised in the honourable senator&#39;s question to my colleague the Minister for the Media for further amplification. </para>

I did not hear but I did read what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> had to say. I am afraid that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> may not have given very much encouragement to the assembled representatives of the petty bourgeoise who surrounded him in Parkes Place. Apparently he devoted himself very largely to the Australian Government Purchasing Commission rather than to the Australian Government Insurance Corporation, according to my information. He did nonetheless make some erroneous statements about the Australian Government Insurance Corporation Bill to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McAuliffe</inline> has so sagaciously drawn my attention. The Leader of the Opposition apparently said that the Australian Government Insurance Corporation would not be subject to the Trade Practices Act and would not be subject to the various insurance Acts. In fact it will be subject to all trade practices legislation and it will be subject to the insurance Acts and to the Life Insurance Act. It will be liable for all rates, levies and taxes which are imposed in all the States, unlike the Government insurance offices in some States which avoid paying the fire brigade charges and other charges which are imposed on private insurance companies in those States. Among those States I would include 2 States with Liberal governments. </para>

          <para>The other statement which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> made, that the Government had wide powers to determine what would be national interest insurance and that these powers would enable the Australian Government Insurance Corporation to compete unfairly with the private insurance companies, also was erroneous. The Government does not have these powers. The only way in which business which is unprofitable can be proclaimed as national interest insurance in which the Australian Government Insurance Corporation can undertake business is by way of regulation which can be disallowed by either House of the Parliament. So in fact both Houses of the Parliament, completely democratically, have the right to disallow any such proposal regarding the Australian Government Insurance Corporation. </para>

            <para>-The answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> &#39;s question is as follows: Yesterday the Minister for Environment announced the purchase of 1000 hectares of land at Eland a Plains adjacent to the proposed Coo loo la National Park in Queensland. Some years ago the Queensland Government promised this park to the people of Queensland, but it has yet to honour this promise. Now the Queensland Government proposes a small park of a size which is not acceptable. Accordingly we cannot assume that the Queensland Government will carry out its promises. Under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act which passed through this chamber recently the Australian Government is empowered to purchase such lands and to run parks as truly national parks. Recently the Australian Government bought some land at Nowra Point, New South Wales. This piece of Australian heritage is one of the key resting areas for migratory birds in eastern Australia. In both cases these parcels of land were threatened by development. It is a case of the intentions of the Australian Government being carried out. </para>

Certain matters obviously are pending decision by the Tribunal and already have been the subject of notifications, but it may well be that as a result of the Budget being introduced tonight further notification as to the possible effect of it on an individual company or companies might need to be given to the Tribunal. So that early notification can be given to the Tribunal, so that the Tribunal can give expeditious treatment to such notification and so that businesses will not be inconvenienced by having to wait a day or perhaps 2 days before being able to give further notification to the Tribunal, the Tribunal is making its officers available until 1 1 o&#39;clock tonight. </para>

            <para>- lt is customary and has been for many years for the International Wool Secretariat in London- the body concerned with the promotion of wool around the world- to afford technical and commercial assistance and advice to countries which have a developing wool and textile industry. The Soviet Union is one of our major customers and certainly the IWS has been giving technical and commercial advice to the Soviet Union for a number of years. There is nothing out of the ordinary in this. It is the practice of the IWS in respect of all countries importing wool and it is done, of course, with the complete knowledge and support of the Australian Wool Corporation. I can assure the honourable senator that no financial assistance is involved other than the cost to the IWS of conveying that technical and commercial advice to the Soviet Union. </para>

            <para>- I have no recollection of seeing the statements to which the honourable senator refers. Although there has been a falling off in the number of houses completed, my information is that approvals for housing have increased rapidly over the last month. My briefing notes advise me that the total number of housing loans approved to individuals by savings banks in May 1975 had declined for the third successive month since the record number of 12 115 established in February 1975. The May figure of 10 921 was 5 per cent below that for April. After the seasonal adjustment calculated within the Department, the fall was slightly less pronounced at 4 per cent. In seasonally adjusted terms, the trend in the total number of loans approved in recent months is shown in a table accompanying my notes. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>There was a marginal increase of 4 per cent in the number of loans approved for new housing, but the number of loans approved for used housing fell by 7 per cent, both figures being on a seasonally adjusted basis. Of the total number of loans approved, the proportion allocated to used housing declined to 71 per cent in May compared with 73 per cent in April. The value of loans approved to individuals in May was $183m compared with $195m in April. Of that amount $5.4m was for alterations and additions, compared with $2.2m a year ago. The number of loans approved by the States for the last 1 1 months compared with the number approved a year earlier is also shown in the figures. If the honourable senator is interested, the figures which show the fluctuation in loan approvals for housing purposes will be made available to him. </para>

            <para>-Senator Grimes might recall that in a statement I made on 3 1 July I said that the Australian Government noted with concern various reports that at the coming United Nations General Assembly meeting moves might be contemplated to expel or suspend Israel from membership of the United Nations. The Australian Government supports Israel&#39;s continuing membership of the United Nations and therefore would be strongly opposed to Israel&#39;s expulsion or suspension. Australia would accordingly oppose moves designed to exclude Israel from participating in the General Assembly or other United Nations bodies. The Australian Government is concerned that such moves could seriously limit the ability of the United Nations to play a constructive peace-keeping role in the Middle East. We believe they could also have repercussions for the future of the organisation as a whole. </para>

            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Durack</inline>&#39;s general question must be answered in this way: He knows that the Parliament passed the legislation which required the Post Office to be separated into 2 commissions. Those 2 commissions were to operate on a business basis- on a proper financial and management basis- and, after consideration of their operations, internal funding and so on, to propose a scale of tariffs to the Minister, who would then convey them to the Cabinet. The commissioners met me with their advisers and recommended a set of tariffs. In respect of one set of tariffs proposed- those relating to registered publications- I recommended a subsidy, but otherwise the recommendations were based on the principles propounded by the Vernon Commission. That is the way in which the commissions are required to operate and will operate in the future. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As the honourable senator knows, all the commissioners are experienced. The commissions embrace many practical businessmen. The chairmen of the commissions are experts in their fields. There was no reason why the Minister or the Government should not have accepted the tariffs proposed. If we had decided to leave the tariffs as they are at present, we would have had to subsidise the 2 commissions to a total amount of $348m. I suggest that no government would be prepared to do that. I recommended to the Cabinet, and the Cabinet accepted the recommendations, that the commissions should be reimbursed for the various pensioner subsidies that applied. That amounted to about $ 1 6.5m. </para>
          <para>In respect of the economic effects, I think most people know that the method of operation recommended by the Vernon Commission is the way the commissions are expected to operate. It is true that the general increases will be passed on down the line, as are most other increases which are necessary. The new approach breaks the tradition of paying the giant subsidies that were made to the old Australian Post Office which, as everybody knows and accepts, was too large and had inbuilt a number of general inefficiencies. Now the commissions are required, not only for the purposes of the Acts but also by the direction of the Government, to become more efficient. We hope that as a result of their efficiencies and the collaborative machinery which is now installed in the Acts they will be able to propose in the future tariffs which certainly will not be higher but which in many cases, according to the economic factors involved, will for comparative purposes be lower. </para>

              <para>- I am about to mention the figure in relation to average weekly earnings. I am trying to give as much information as possible. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> knows, I am circulating today some explanatory notes about the 2 businesses and tomorrow reports on the business and service outlook of the 2 commissions will be tabled. If one looks at the charges as compared with average weekly wages, one finds that they are not extraordinarily high. I should like to know whether any government would continue to subsidise these undertakings to the extent that Australian governments have done in the past. The new obligation imposed on the commissions was that they should be run as business enterprises and should manage their own affairs in accordance with the principles set out in the legislation. </para>

            <para>- I think honourable senators know that because of the proposed British use of the range it was agreed to place the range on a care and maintenance basis. However, at the recent direction of the Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Morrison,</inline> investigations are being conducted into the use of the range by the Armed Services. Included in these investigations are the possibility of its use by the Royal Australian Air Force for instrumented trials involving the Fill aircraft and by the Australian Army for armoured exercises involving the Leopard tank. At present the effect of the activities of the equipment on the environment is under expert investigation. A preliminary armoured corps exercise by South Australian units will take place shortly in order to assess whether it is practicable to plan on future operations of this nature. I can assure the honourable senator that the Minister for Defence is anxious to see these activities taking place and the use of Woomera to the greatest possible extent. </para>

            <para>- I did see the report and was rather disappointed that the Director of the Brotherhood of St Laurence should have made a statement which is, to say the least, lacking in that charity which one would expect from a charitable organisation. At no stage did the Director of the Brotherhood in any way attempt to find out from me whether in fact this was so. Nor, I understand, did he ask anybody else connected with the Department of Social Security. I am not quite sure what he means when he states, &#39;symptomatic of the Government&#39;s present mood&#39;. What he seems to be accusing us of here is playing deceit of some sort. The fact of the matter is that Professor Henderson and his Committee have completed their report. The report is being printed and it is hoped that it will be tabled next week. There has certainly been no collusion between me, Professor Henderson and the Government Printer, any two or more of those people or any others to prevent the tabling of the report on poverty this week. I must confess I am not entirely clear what would have been the advantage or disadvantage if it had been tabled this week. Apart from accusing us of being deceitful, I am not entirely apprised of the advantage that the Director of the Brotherhood of St Laurence is anticipating we would have gained from being deceitful. In short, the answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> &#39;s question is that our friend from the Brotherhood has his facts wrong. </para>

I have not yet discovered the report in my office, but I take it that it is now a public document. Is the Minister aware that more than 1000 employees of the fertiliser industry in Australia have been retrenched and that unless an adequate bounty is provided further unemployment will occur? Is he also aware that there are fertiliser factories in Australia which are inoperative at present and that many are working at a very low capacity? Can the Minister say when he intends to make a decision on this matter? Does the Minister intend to allow the industries concerned with superphosphate the opportunity to make further representations once they have been able to examine the report? </para>

            <para>-On the last part of the question by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop,</inline> any one of those industries would have been at liberty to make submissions to the Commission during its hearings. Once the report has been presented to the Government it is not customary for matters to be reopened for submissions unless the Government requests the Commission to do so. I am aware that many persons engaged in the manufacture of superphosphate are currently unemployed and that the manufacturing side of the industry is in a state of very serious recession, but it ought to be said, as I have said before, that this is not due to the phase out of the bounty last year. The bounty was worth $11.81 a tonne. At that time the average price around Australia to the average farmer was about $28 a tonne. It is now about $70 a tonne. That is not because of the phase out of the bounty but is simply because we have had to pay much higher prices for our phosphate rock, the raw material which we import from Nauru and Christmas Island. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>We are victims- I suppose that is a fair term to use- of the dramatic increase in the price of raw material. This is paralleled by the fact .that other people who buy our products from the land also had to pay dramatic increases in prices to us. That is the normal flow of world trade. That is the reason why there has been this very great downturn in demand for superphosphate. It would be wrong to suggest that the bounty itself has had no impact. Of course it has had an impact, but it now represents only one-sixth of the retail price to the farmer of phosphate whereas twelve to eighteen months ago it represented about 45 per cent. So, a quite new picture is presented. The other aspect of course is the question of our own phosphate deposits in Queensland. This is another matter but, nevertheless, it is related to this question. In answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop,</inline> I can say only that I would hope to see a Government decision on this matter within 3 weeks. </para>

            <para>- If I may I will give some general information first because not only is there the question of the advancement of Portuguese Timor but there is also the very critical situation that exists there at this moment. Australia is not a party principal to the decolonisation of Portuguese Timor but it is concerned that in that process the best interests of the people of the territory should be of paramount consideration, and Australia has always acted with that viewpoint in mind. The Government&#39;s policy on this point has been stated publicly on a number of occasions and is quite well known. Recent developments in Portuguese Timor are a matter of great concern to the Government and it is studying the situation with the greatest possible care and sympathy. Two officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs have visited Portuguese Timor over the past few days and their report will form an important element in the Government&#39;s assessment of the situation. Arrangements have been made to evacuate last night and today Australian citizens in the territory who wish to leave. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I do not believe that it would be helpful to comment further at this stage on what is obviously a delicate and difficult situation, beyond saying that it remains the Government&#39;s strong hope that the political forces in the territory can compose their differences to the extent that they can co-operate peacefully in its further decolonisation. For the immediate future there is clearly an urgent need for the Portuguese administration to reassert its control. The Australian Government is encouraged in this regard by the dialogue that Governor Tires has been able to establish with the UDT- the Timor Democratic Union- but not yet, it seems, with the leadership of the Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor- FRETILIN. Nevertheless, the Government hopes that the talks, now begun, will be carried forward when <inline font-weight="bold">Major Soares,</inline> a special emissary sent by  President  Costa Gomes, arrives in Dili, it is hoped in the next day or so. The Australian Ambassador in Lisbon has urged upon the Portuguese authorities the importance Australia attaches to Portugal reasserting its control over the territory. </para>
          <para>In answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihills</inline> specific question, as honourable senators know a conference was held in Macao which was boycotted by FRETILIN but which was attended by Apodeti and the UDT. From the time I first talked at the United Nations last year to the then Foreign Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Soares,</inline> and later to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Santos</inline> here, there has been a feeling amongst the Portuguese, which I think is quite sensible, of the need to keep this matter moving over a period of between four and five years. Their embryonic thoughts were not so much that there would be a plain vote by the people but that some sort of body would be formed, not a parliament but a constituent body, to give the 3 organisations that have arisen in Portuguese Timor some chance to develop, to get together, to rub the rough edges off one another and to move along to a position where they could finally decide what sort of situation they wanted- whether they wanted to be independent or to carry on as a colony of Portugal or indeed, as Apodeti wanted, to join with Indonesia. </para>
          <para>Those moves appear to be fractured at this stage, not only because of the situation in Portuguese Timor but also because of the very severe political manoeuvrings that are going on today in Portugal. I still think that that is the most sensible situation because, although some people in Deli are asking: &#39;Why do you not do as you did in Mozambique and hand over to one body&#39;, it would be a difficult job to decide which body. The situation in Mozambique was vastly different. There the FRELIMO had been fighting and working for many years, had controlled quite a lot of land and were experienced to the extent that they were able to take over. That sort of situation does not arise in Portuguese Timor where there are 3 embryonic forms of political parties. A very tense situation exists at the moment and, as I said, I think that the most effective solution is for the Portuguese to get back into control. We are not certain how much fighting is going on there. They should get that settled down and then rethink the whole situation. </para>

            <para>-I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Peacock</inline> made that allegation. The answer is that the Soviet Ambassador has issued a statement saying that the question of Soviet financial aid to Papua New Guinea was not specifically raised in the talks that he had in Port Moresby. According to Press reports, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Maori</inline> Kiki has stated that he regarded the Ambassador&#39;s remarks at the Press conference about the possibility of some Soviet aid being made available to Papua New Guinea as just an offer and that there were no plans to discuss the matter further. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Maori</inline> said that his talks with the Ambassador had been of a courtesy nature, &#39;just to say hullo to each other&#39;. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Maori</inline> is also reported as saying that his talks with the Soviet Ambassador came before and had no relationship to the Australian decision on aid to Papua New Guinea this year. </para>

            <para>- I think I may be able to answer the honourable senator&#39;s question. There have been some complaints about processed potatoes being imported into Australia to the detriment of the local potato industry. I remember that some 2 years ago, when I was the Acting Minister for Primary Industry, I received such a complaint from growers in Victoria. The entry of potatoes into Australia is controlled by quota or tariff restrictions if a question arises as to dumping on the Australian market. I believe that last year the problem reached its height as a result of a poor Australian crop in the 1974 season. My Department&#39;s inquiries have shown that potatoes were imported from New Zealand but not at dumping prices. Imports reached a peak of 3300 tonnes in January of this year. In June only 58 tonnes were imported. There was a further fall in July to 37 tonnes. There was no question that they were brought in at dumping prices. They seemed to be coming in at such times as the Australian product was in short supply. </para>

If there is any slight to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> as the only Aboriginal member of this Parliament, I think it is brought about by the Opposition which does not recognise the significance of the individual because the Opposition has appointed a legal man to represent Aboriginal people. The Government invited to the handing over of Hattie Creek those whom the Opposition has decided should represent the Aboriginal people- the shadow Minister, a past Minister, the Leader of the National Country Party in the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory and an Aboriginal member of that Assembly. So the prestige of which I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> is deserving should be recognised by the Opposition. It should not blame the Government. </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister for Repatriation and Compensation. In the light of the historic link between the repatriation structure and the Returned Services League, will the Minister give to the Senate an undertaking that no changes will take place in the Department, its status or structure before consultations are held with the RSL and other national ex-service organisations? Will the Minister not agree that the voice of the RSL should be heard on all committees relating to the welfare of ex-servicemen and women? </para>

            <para>- In regard to the latter part of the question, certainly I agree that the Returned Services League should be heard. I have the closest consultation with the RSL and with other ex-service organisations although naturally the RSL, as the biggest organisation, is the one with which I have the most dealings. I think there has been some concern in past years about the future of the repatriation system. It possibly occurred first when a Senate committee under the chairmanship of a Liberal senator, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline> Nancy Buttfield, brought down various recommendations which would have led to very substantial changes in the repatriation system. I think it continued when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Toose was appointed by the previous Government to inquire into the repatriation system. I believe the concern arose again when the Department of Repatriation was transformed into the Department of Repatriation and Compensation, and again when I was given the additional portfolio of Social Security. All of these matters have occasioned concern. I have given undertakings to the RSL and to the Australian Services Council, which represents most of the other veterans organisations, that no change in the system is proposed by us and that none will take place without consultation with them. If I may speak for myself, I do not believe there ought be any substantial change in the repatriation system. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Only last week I had the advantage of talking to the Canadian Minister for Veterans Affairs who was in Australia. As far as I am aware, the Canadian system of veteran benefits and administration is probably the system most closely approximating the Australian system. There had been moves in Canada, he informed me, by some people to attempt to tone down the activities of the Department of Veterans Affairs. There had been proposals that the Canadian veteran hospitals be transformed into general hospitals available to all people. Even in Canada, where this had been adopted as policy, only a relatively small number of hospitals had been so transformed. On our calculations, it does not seem that the maximum number of repatriation beneficiaries- that is excluding the possibility of any intervening war- will reach its peak until the year 1985. Obviously, and I think most importantly, there will be a special and continuing role for the Repatriation Department far into the foreseeable future. I have given assurances in that regard. The matter which is still pending is the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Toose. He has told me that his report will be available soon. I have told both the RSL and the Australian Services Council that they will have a copy of that report for at least 6 months so that they can make recommendations on it before any action would be considered by the Government in line with the recommendations of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Toose. </para>

            <para>During question time Senator Guilfoyle asked me whether it was the intention of the Prices Justification Tribunal to stay open this evening to receive new applications arising from matters the subject of the Budget to be introduced in the Parliament this evening, and whether approval would be given by the Tribunal forthwith as a result of any applications made to it. I told her that my understanding was that the Tribunal would be staying open in relation to applications which it had already received, which it had not yet disposed of and which might be affected by budgetary announcements. I have asked my office to get in touch with the Prices Justification Tribunal to see whether my understanding of the position was correct. I am led to believe that my understanding, as I related it to the Senate, may not have been correct and I may not have given the correct impression. I am now told that any  company in the category dealt with by the Tribunal which wishes to raise its prices must notify the Tribunal and cannot raise its prices until the Tribunal has completed its consideration of the matter. I have already given that information to the Senate. As a result of the Budget it is possible, however, that some companies will have to raise their prices tomorrow. For instance, if the Government were to raise the excise on beer with effect on Budget night, higher prices would have to be charged in the morning. The Tribunal is staying open tonight to deal immediately with any tax changes which will require immediate price changes. It will therefore be in a position to receive notifications and to make decisions on those notifications tonight. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr President,</inline>I understand that honourable senators have been provided with a list of recommendations of the Standing Orders Committee for amendments and additions to the Standing Orders. Honourable senators will recall that these matters were the subject of debate in the Senate last February. It was agreed that the recommendations should be adopted as interim standing orders on the understanding that the matters would be reviewed on the first sitting day after a period of 6 months had elapsed. This is the day on which reconsideration has to be given to these matters. With the concurrence of honourable senators I propose to put the question separately in regard to each of the 8 items that are shown on the list. I propose to move that the recommendations individually be agreed to. This will be done, as I have been reminded, in the Committee of the Whole. </para>

          <para class="block">That seems to me to be an imprecise and vague way of expressing an intention not to impede a committee&#39;s work. The words &#39;shall not attempt to interfere with the Committee&#39;s work&#39; could, I imagine, encompass a critical question. It would seem to me, under some construction of that phrase, that a critical question about a committee&#39;s work, or its intention or the path that it was following, could be answered simply by the  chairman  saying that the question interfered with the work of the committee. I know that this is a fairly small point. This would be one of the vaguest standing order references that I can remember.

              <para>-They would apply to questions on notice or without notice. Leave would have to be given by the Senate for a question to be asked without notice. I would assume that the sort of inquiry which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Steele</inline> Hall has raised would be taken into consideration by the Senate in determining whether leave were to be granted. In any event I think that it would help to remove a little of the difficulty that could emerge under what is proposed in paragraph (c); namely, that the  chairman  shall answer such questions only on the basis that he answers on behalf of the committee and not of himself. </para>

          <para>The composition of Senate committees represents a wide cross section of the political views of this Parliament. The concept of this provision was that rather than having the  chairman  of a committee expressing what might be his personal point of view, unless leave of the Senate were given the question should be placed upon notice so that the whole committee could direct its attention to the question. I do not know what interpretation might be placed on the words that questions &#39;shall not attempt to interfere with the Committee&#39;s work or anticipate its report&#39;. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Steele</inline> Hall apparently is concerned about some ambiguity that might appear to be in the words &#39;attempt to interfere with the Committee&#39;s work&#39;. My memory of the debate that took place in the Standing Orders Committee does not bring immediately to mind any discussion that took place on those particular words. Perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack could jog my memory if they can remember. I know that at the time it was a unanimous decision of the Committee and it was the decision of the Senate, in Committee, that we try the standing order out on an interim basis. </para>

              <para>- I cannot remember those words being debated. It may well have been <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> who was involved at the time. I can see that it would not be desirable for the Senate to interfere by way of a question with the work of a committee. That might be done by way of resolution when the committee&#39;s work can be discussed and debated in toto. To attempt by way of question to interfere with the work of a committee would be doing an injustice to the committee and to the Senate generally. I think that in anticipation of matters of this nature being raised this proposition probably was put on the basis that problems would be resolved by way of debate and not by way of question. </para>

            <para>- I am at a loss to recall the reasons for this provision. I think one has to go to the Standing Orders- to standing orders 98 and 99. Standing order 98 gives the right to ask questions. The sort of questions which can be asked should not contain arguments, inferences, imputations, epithets, ironical expressions, etc. I would imagine that the purpose of paragraph (b) in proposed standing order 98a is but a guide to the Presiding Officer as to whether to allow or disallow the question, as he would either allow or disallow a question under standing order 99. If, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poyser</inline> suggests, the words in paragraph (b) are enforced with the same rigidity and strictness as is standing order 99, 1 do not think any honourable senator is going to be terribly inhibited in any questions he asks. </para>

            <para>- I want to say a few words. I do not recall the discussion on 1 1 February. This proposition is something I would always oppose. What has been the principle and tradition of the Westminster system here when a division has been called for? The tradition is that the division is held. It is only quite recently that the question has been raised that the person who calls for the division has to be a member of the minority group involved in the vote. The value of being able to call for a division relates to the public record. A person may want to record the fact that when a certain question came before the House he voted for or against it. A person may be proud of his vote on that occasion. At present if I happened to be among the majority of opinion of the Senate on a particular issue a dispute could arise at a later date as to how I recorded my vote on that occasion. I have no proof other than perhaps in some records of the Senate. There is no indication in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of how I voted. It was for the sole purpose of meeting the situation when an issue was of such particular importance to an individual that he wanted how he voted or how someone else voted recorded that we had the right to call a division and so have a record of voting which could be produced to show the action of each individual in a particular division. I recall when it was necessary to have not fewer than 2 senators call for a division, but we then insisted on, the right to have it recorded if one wanted to oppose a motion. That meant that if I was in the minority but had some supporters of my viewpoint there was no way of getting my opposition recorded whereas if I was alone in my opposition to any measure I had a way of getting my opposition recorded. That is something that has not been abused and I think the right to have recorded how one votes or how somebody else votes on a particular question is one which should be preserved. </para>

            <para>- I am a member of the Standing Orders Committee which discussed this matter at some length. I fully support the recommendation. The situation is obvious when one thinks about it. How can persons protest against a decision which is in favour of them? This is in effect what we are doing by demanding the right to say to the  Chairman  that although he declared your vote to be correct he is incorrect. That is just what it means. I think that if any honourable senator rose to his feet immediatelY after any vote when no division had been taken, and said: &#39;I want my name recorded in Hansard as being in favour of or against that motion&#39;, he would not be denied that right. On many occasions this procedure has been used at meetings at which I have been present other than in this Parliament when there has been a majority of 300 to 20 on the voices and those 300 have used their voices to demand a division in order to flush out those who voted against the question. So it can be used for purposes other than the legitimate right of a person to cast a democratic vote. So in my view the Committee is correct in saying that the person who believes a call to be incorrect should be the only person able to call for a division. If the  Chairman  on a division on a particular clause says that the ayes have it, why should the ayes dispute it by demanding a division? It seems so incredibly wrong that I believe the Committee&#39;s recommendation for a new standing order is a perfectly correct one. </para>

            <para>- I thought when this was debated that it would be one of the questions I would oppose. Preservation of the right of a member who wants a public answer to his question because we are on the air at the time of answering or because he wants the answer known to those in the public gallery has some appeal to me. Since I have been in the Senate I have taken the position that we should not take any action in amending Standing Orders which takes a right away from honourable senators. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman,</inline> I recall that you were perhaps one of the most insistent honourable senators in having your questions on notice read and answered by the Minister in the Senate. What your reason may have been I do not know but obviously it had some significance and meant something to you. It is a right and a privilege which you have had. I cannot say that the procedure we are adopting has not caused inconvenience but it is doing away with one of the things that honourable senators had as a right. The individual senator is the one to decide whether he wants his question answered publicly. I would like it to be recorded that at least I am consistent in my attitude of opposing the taking away of his right from the individual senator. </para>

          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir KENNETH</inline>ANDERSON (New South Wales) (4.50)- I can appreciate what is being suggested here. We have followed the suggested procedure more recently and in the main it has proved to be satisfactory. The bugbear in the past has always been that the parliamentary proceedings are broadcast. In the case of the Senate the proceedings are broadcast on a Wednesday and on Tuesdays and Thursdays there is a rebroadcast of question time. The crunch always came when a senator insisted that the answer to his question on notice be read out. An abridged version was given, and this resulted in almost incoherence for the listener because the complete question was not always read. Then we got into a conditional situation, as I recall it, where the senator could insist on the answer being given. A message had then to be given to the  Clerk,  I think, in relation to the question and answer. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh.</inline> When I was a Minister sitting at the table I was often put in the situation of striving to get through the business when honourable senators were insisting upon answers to questions being read. The point that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> made consistently during his time in Opposition in this place- it never varied- was that questions which he felt important should be answered, particularly on broadcast days. Whilst I would be the first to admit that this new procedure which we have adopted has gone reasonably well, I just wonder whether there should not be at least some escape clause whereby in the ultimate an honourable senator, for the very reasons that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> mentioned, should have some right to insist upon not only the answer but also the question being read when the proceedings of the Senate are being broadcast. The form of the amendment is absolute. Whilst I would not go to the barricades in forcing a division on it, I think it is too absolute in its present form. </para>

              <para>-It is one of those difficult situations. I understand that the present procedure in relation to the presentation of petitions is that if the petition consists of more than 250 words the honourable senator presenting it has to get leave to have it read. I think leave has been granted almost daily without any hesitation, but one day some honourable senator is going to come along with a petition of a thousand words and he is not going to get leave to present it, and most likely he should not. The Senate, however, tends to be fairly sensible. I am only throwing up as a suggestion that proposed standing order 103 be commenced with the words &#39; Unless leave of the Senate is granted &#39;. </para>

            <para>- Rather than call for a division to record my vote as having opposed this proposal, I shall briefly voice my opposition. My opposition is in the same terms that 1 have always raised- that we here are seeking to take a right away from senators. Whilst I would agree that we should perhaps do so if some mischief called for remedial action, in my 1 3 years in the Senate very infrequently, if ever, have honourable senators taken up the hour and a half. Actually over this period speeches in the Senate have become shorter. Rarely does someone speak for an hour. I do not think there is any need to provide for a longer time, but a senator may have a case to make out and may need more than an hour to develop convincing argument which would justify his being given an extension of time by other senators. He has had that right thus far but now we are seeking to take it away. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The other point which concerns me is that a senator should be limited at all. The time which he is allotted includes the time occupied by questions raised, points of order raised or disagreements with the President&#39;s ruling. As we know, a lot of time can be taken up with various points of order which are raised from time to time and discussion on those points of order. </para>

              <para>-Yes. When we do not want to listen to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Marriott</inline> on a matter and he is limited to 20 minutes, we can reduce his time most effectively. I am sure that if we listened to him for the 20 minutes he would convince us, but we purposely deprive ourselves of his knowledge and the convincing arguments he wishes to develop by seeing that he does not get the opportunity to develop them. They are some of the situations that may arise from time to time. The rule that permits an extension of time has not been abused. Whilst I admit that the proposal for an hour with an extension of half an hour seems reasonable, it does place some limitation on the rights of back benchers. Accordingly, I record my opposition to this proposal. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir KENNETH</inline>ANDERSON (New South Wales) (5.7)- Others have been in this place longer than I have, but to my knowledge in the past 22 years no honourable senator has spoken for an hour and presumed to move for another half hour. I know that I am going to be told that existing standing order 40 7  a  contains the words &#39;any senator&#39;. But it has always been the tradition for a senator to seek out somebody else to move that he be given an extension of time. I think that in itself is a jolly good rule because it would be pretty grim if 59 of us &#39;had&#39; him and he were able to give himself another half an hour. I should like to see inserted a provision that an extension of half an hour be granted by leave. If we are to settle for an hour let us settle for the hour and grant the other half an hour perhaps in circumstances which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> has canvassed. We have lawyers here- God help us- and we have witnessed debates in which some lawyers and bush lawyers have taken up most of a senator&#39;s time on matters of procedure. </para>

What I am suggesting is that we should add to the proposed amendment a provision that a senator may seek an extra half hour by leave, as that is what we have always done. With good sense, we have managed to adjust the equities of the debate and, where such justice was required, speakers have received an extension of time. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- I have been listening to the debate on the Standing Orders with considerable fascination because this is likely to be the time in my life when I could easily talk for an hour and a half and then move for an extension of my time in which to speak. I will try to persuade myself not to do that. The Opposition is not attracted to the Purchasing Commission Bill. It sees it as a general arrangement to bring the private sector much more under total control than it now is. lt does not see that as desirable. The Opposition believes that this is a centralising function at a time when it does not think that is wise in the Australian democratic scene. The Opposition is a believer in the theory that the dispersion of power and authority in the current world and Australian scene is much more desirable than centralising power and authority. It will take me quite a long time to elaborate this point. I suggest to those honourable senators who feel that the matter is no longer interesting to them that they leave the chamber and go to sleep or have a cup of tea. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The first test to apply in relation to this measure is this: Is there any real efficiency to be gained by adopting the proposals contained in the Purchasing Commission Bill? Having studied this matter since 3 June 1975, 1 state that it is the Opposition &#39;s view that the creation, of such a Purchasing Commission will not necessarily promote efficiency. I say this because first of all the Bill interposes the Commission between the users and suppliers. The Opposition does not see that that will be a useful device. Clause 9 (2) of the Bill which is to be read in conjunction with the report of the Committee of Inquiry into Government Procurement Policy- the Scott report- gives to departments and authorities the power to retain their purchasing function up to the $5,000 threshold. Obviously, there will be duplication of effort and manpower in the departments under this proposal, if it were passed, because departments would still have some authority to do their own purchasing and would pass a lot of that authority away. </para>
          <para>There are certain cases where industries have only two or three suppliers, each of whom depends very largely on government for contracts. The centralised purchasing proposed here may end existing competition between them and it may establish monopolies in the supplier sense. From one&#39;s own commercial and industrial experience, one has learnt that in a world in which one tends to aggregate people together to become single buyers, in effect, one usually ends up with what I call a single seller situation. Out of such a situation, one very rarely sees any real economies in cost. There are some departures from the Scott report included in the Bill. Purchases by Australian Government authorities, agencies, boards and commissions were specifically excluded by recommendation 6 on page 81 of the Scott report. Of course, it is proposed that this be included in the Purchasing Commission&#39;s functions. Government authorities, in competition with private enterprise, may gain advantages in obtaining supplies. There are bulk buying discounts, opportunities above the norm, for the possibility of some form of coercion, if not express then explicit, in such a scene. </para>
          <para>Clause 41 of the Bill states that the Commission is not subject to taxation. Recommendation 31 of the Scott report stated that departments, authorities and agencies should pay import duty. The Special Minister of State <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Douglas McClelland)</inline> has not specified whether he considers such a duty to be a tax. In any case, exemption from sales tax gives Government authorities as such a substantial advantage in competition with the private sector. Under clause 37(3) the Minister has sole power to determine the composition of advisory committees. Compared with the recommendation of the Scott Committee, this is not satisfactory. If regard is had to what was recommended on pages 133 to 136 of the Scott Committee report, we would be able to identify the massive size of the total Australian Government buying position as expressed in the year 1972-73, which are the latest figures on record. At that time, the total value of purchases by the Australian Government was almost $ 1 3 billion dollars. It is my conclusion, after discussion with responsible people, that with price escalation, increasing movements by the Government into the private sector and more and more government control that we are talking about a Commission that of itself would currently have a buying power of about $20 billion if this Bill were to be passed. That is a tremendous amount of buying power to put in the hands of one single authority without any evidence of economy and efficiency and with considerable evidence of the possibility of duplication and some areas of inefficiency. </para>
          <para>I turn to clause 17 of the Bill which deals with the area of ministerial directives. In the view of the Opposition and those people to whom we have talked about this whole measure, that clause is far too wide. It can lead to the pursuit of purely political objectives in government purchases. There is no effective parliamentary control over such directives given from month to month. There is only a need to put them in the annual report. When I remind honourable senators that the Trans-Australiann Airlines annual report, due at the end of June and normally available about September, appeared in the Parliament about the following May they will see the possibilities for things to be long gone, beyond recovery, if an annual report is said to be the remedy for what might be called dangerous practice or unfair practice. It is possible that directives of that kind in a wise administration could include some ability to help and offset programs. These are always negotiable between one country and another. </para>
          <para>There is a need for an Australian content to be thought about. I cannot see any substantial reference to that in the Scott report, but if it is there I shall be glad to learn of it. I cannot see any preference to Australian goods and services. In the current manufacturing industry rundown it would be very valuable to see Australian governments as such trying to induce Australian purchases from Australian manufacturers as far as possible. There is a possibility in due course in a wise program of some ability to try to help in particular regions and perhaps some particular industries. As will be detected by my colleagues in the Senate I am trying to be fair about this measure while at the same time indicating our opposition to it. </para>
          <para>There are certain unacceptable areas in clause 1 7. They could be worker participation areas and other directives designed to achieve social and political ends. I have run out a few such possibilities. People might be directed purposely to involve themselves in urban and regional development in unwise propositions. Companies might be directed to have compulsory unionism otherwise they will have no government contracts. There could be measures about compensation and insurance being included if indeed a government of the Australian character became a government insurer. There could be clear directions on import policy running contrary to what might be the broad public intent. There could be arguments on environmental control. Industry restructuring could be argued via backdoor methods. These are some of the problems that one sees in clause 1 7. </para>
          <para>Clause 14 ( 10) provides for ministerial directives to be given to leaders of special research teams, but there is no provision whatever for Parliament to be informed about those particular directions. We find a great number of other clauses objectionable. I shall mention some. Clause 15 (2) gives the Minister a wider power to demand documents than the courts have. One is reminded in this circumstance of what a pity it was the Senate did not have such a power itself to demand some documents that it needed in the recent loans affair, it would have been most illuminating. We might have learned something accurate for a change instead of getting ourselves fobbed off. Clause 3 gives me some concern. It gives various definitions. Clause 3(1) describes an authority as a prescribed company being a company in which Australia has a controlling interest. This clause possibly could link the Purchasing Commission as proposed directly with, for example, the recent Government purchase of a pharmaceutical company, or with a company in the mining industry or proposed State trading corporation. This means the Commission could buy or dispose of goods on behalf of these companies and in effect become a trader or operator in the private sector. </para>
          <para>This Commission, as we see it, not only gives some power to be centralised buyers but also gives some substantial power to become centralised sellers and centralised market operators. Such described companies would enjoy an unfair advantage in the local market as purchases by the Commission are not subject to customs tariff or taxes under the Bill. Clause 3 defines &#39;goods&#39; as follows: </para>
          <list type="loweralpha">
            <item label="(a)">
              <para>stores within the meaning,of the Audit Act 1901-1973 and supplies within the meaning of the Treasury Regulations; </para>

              <para>ships, aircraft, vehicles, machinery and equipment; </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">Honourable senators must get an idea of the broad ambit that is proposed by this massive centralised government purchasing authority. A further definition relates to government bodies and provides: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Governmental body&#39; includes the Government of a State and a local governing body, but does not include a Department or an Authority. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is an assumption that the Commission would have some overriding ability to act as to State governments and local governing bodies. That, if it were true, would be a particularly strange position to have created. Clause 5 (e) refers to the right to acquire, hold, deal with and dispose of goods for other purposes of the Australian Government. What other purposes are we talking about? It seems to us that the Commission has an ability to become the buyer and seller of uranium, wool, wheat, coal or any of the massive bulk commodity mineral products produced in this country. Clause 6(b) enables the Commission to undertake research into the private sector- another intrusion that seems to be quite unnecessary. Clause 13 ( 1 ) (a) enables the views of the departments and authorities to prevail over those of the Commission in the purchase of goods, but does not do so for services and works. So, why the difference? It is unreasonable and unworkable to prevent a user department from suggesting the manner or source of procurement. </para>
          <para>After examining in some detail, again with people whom I hope would have a clear understanding of this measure, my definition of clause 17, which seems to me to be reliable, is thus: Tenders under this particular proposal, if it becomes law, would normally still be decided by the Commission without reference to the Government. But the Government has an overriding power to give directions to the Commission for tenders to be accepted or rejected. </para>
          <para>Honourable senators will gather from a careful study that we find this piece of legislation not necessary or wise. It has to us a few repugnant features. We believe, first of all, that it is unnecessary. We believe it interposes between users and suppliers. We believe in particular areas, such as the defence purchasing requirements, that it could be extremely dangerous. Other colleagues of mine have a particular interest in the defence procurement situation. On page 66 of the Scott report a large chapter deals with defence, but one particular sentence springs clearly to mind. It reads: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>This Committee- </para>
          </quote>
          <para>That is the Scott Committee-  gave the most careful consideration to the whole subject before it decided to recommend that the purchase of all defence requirements above the tender threshold- </para>
          <para class="block">That is $5,000-  should not be excluded from the scope of its recommendations. </para>
          <para class="block">In other words this operation will purchase the whole of the defence requirements, including destroyers, aircraft, weapons, tanks and what you will. </para>

              <para>- Only in the sense I was going to pick it up later but I do it now that they appear to have some kind of purchasing functions of their own. It did not seem to me, on explanation, to be truly satisfactory.

          <para>This piece of legislation has moved around a bit in the departmental scene. It has been owned by various people. It is now the child of the Department of Services and Property which has excluded itself from the Commission&#39;s ambit. We object to technical purchases. The objection is that technical purchases require direct consultation in our view between users and suppliers from tender to installation. For example, Qantas could be directed in regard to what aircraft to buy as could TAA. It is interesting that in discussion the current Minister for Transport, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jones,</inline> indicated that he believes that the A300B wide bodied jet is the most desirable aircraft to use in the Australian domestic system for the next stage of equipment. The airlines do not believe that at all. They believe something quite different. What would Qantas be directed to do? Would it be directed to buy or not to buy Concorde? How does all this work out? The Commission will interpose between the user departments, notwithstanding their size and the complexity of their problems, yet the Commission really will not have the knowledge which the departments have. We believe there will be delays resulting in user frustration and we believe there will be cost increases. </para>

              <para>- I have found the same situation in my life, senator. This is why I find this strange. We believe government trading authorities gain advantage in this measure over the private enterprise system. One is not hostile to having in the Australian scene situations in which there is a duopoly. The 2 airlines policy confirms that. There is a market economy arm of Ansett Airlines of Australia. That is a very great company. The Australian Airlines Commission operates in open competition with Ansett. They operate fairly with each other and share the business. This Bill would give an advantage to a government marketing authority or a government operating authority as against its counterpart in the market system. I think this is quite wrong. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Massive costs would be involved in this Commission. These sorts of things cannot be run for nothing. The best information one can get is that about 800 to 1000 people will be engaged in this exercise at stage one. In our view, there is clearly duplication of functions. The Opposition cannot see anywhere any economic feasibility studies properly carried out to show any cost benefit or total economic advantages. There is no obligation in anything that the Opposition can find on the Commission to be efficient. We think that the Minister would have too much power, and so would the Commission, and too little accountability. There is no mention in the Bill, or in the report, of national security considerations. It is very hard to find any reference to the total impact on the Australian economic scene, but at pages 47 and 48 of the Scott report an attempt is made to do some analytical work on the effect of the Government position on the total position. Table 1 shows as about 23 per cent the total public sector expenditure as a percentage of the total Australian expenditure for the year 1972-73. From that point, I think it would have advanced itself very considerably indeed. But it would be a modest claim to make that at least this Commission would have the effect of being a total purchasing body over something like 25 per cent of the total Australian area of expenditure by all governments and all bodies. </para>
          <para>On the other hand, as I said at the outset, one wishes to take a fairly broad view of this, and in examining the Scott report the Opposition did see some points of value. We think that the drawing up of a purchasing manual is a suggestion of merit. We think that establishing a register of non-standard specifications by government agencies is also worth consideration. We are not sure about the discontinuance of the need for deposits with tenders. It is a Scott report recommendation, but the Opposition cannot see that that would be quite as safe as it might be. We think that the proposition that the results of all tenders should be available to all tenderers, together with the reasons for the awarding of contracts, is a good proposition. We think that the amendment of Treasury regulation 553 (1) with respect to advertising has merit in it. </para>
          <para>We think that the requirement that payments by governments for goods and services should be in accord with accepted commercial practice is an extremely good measure. We think that at times when the Government is running out of money it has no right to fund its exercises by leaning on the people who are supplying, as it sometimes does. Stories have been circulated that people have had to wait 90 to 120 days for their money. That is something for which governments ought not to be responsible when they are operating in the commercial world in which they deal. The Opposition believes that tender specifications should be written in conformity with existing commercial standards. The Scott report indicates that; we think it is a suggestion of value. We think that there is strong merit in standardisation of documentation. We think that the process of inspection in departments might well stand a little updating. We are not very excited about the minimum value proposals. We believe that purchasing as such in Government departments as such as a function may stand a little updating in relation to general training and professional standards. We think there is a strong duty on governments, and indeed on everybody involved in government purchasing, to try to keep the business world informed as to forward programs and forward requirements. </para>
          <para>When the Opposition looked at all the ideas in the Scott report that seemed to it to have merit, none of them, not a single one, was necessary to be achieved by the creation of this Commission. They are all capable of achievement in existing departments and authorities. It is purely a matter of co-ordination and co-operation and understanding. Therefore, we can see no value in creating an extensive bureaucratic machine at this time. I think it will be clear to everybody that the Opposition has long held the view that the time has come to reduce inefficiency in government and government extravagance and waste, and the creation of this Commission seems to be a clear case of creating a further unnecessary device that really is not going to do anything useful or save any money. </para>
          <para>The sort of approach that the Opposition would take in government would be something like this: Each department would act independently under the guidelines and supervision of overall government policy. They would do their own purchasing and make their own arrangements on the broad basis of what a government&#39;s intent was. The Opposition would endeavour to improve the efficiency of what are called common user items by co-operation and coordination between the Stores and Tender Board, contract boards and the Department of Manufacturing Industry. Any recommendations in the Scott report that the Opposition thought were of value it would endeavour to pick up and use. We would like to see an advance in Public Service career opportunities in the procurement area and we would like to see people involved in government procurement programs and buying given training off time in private industry in an interchange. We would argue strongly for some lateral transfers, with people who are fairly young in the system and who have career promise, perhaps under 30 years of age, being given a period in a private enterprise area of magnitude, with some people in private enterprise coming into government to learn for a period. </para>
          <para>The Opposition argues strongly for greater understanding between the sectors- in the public sector in buying requirements in manufacturing industry and in the private sector in making requirements. We think that an interchange is needed between the personnel in both areas. We believe that government purchasing programs would stand reviewing at all times and ought to be standardised, and that there ought to be developed a continuing process of interchange, inspection and understanding. We would certainly abolish clearly ministerial directives to achieve social and other aims. We would regard this as a market place business operation, not to be interfered with for political reasons. We have a very clear view of getting service and the best value for the money spent, while ensuring that the need pattern in the requirements of Public Service departments is made known to the supplier so that he can understand that this is a long term need and not a one-off job. The Opposition also has the view that specific provisions made in this area should be clearly outlined, should be tabled in the Parliament and should be subject to parliamentary debate. We are not at all keen on giving commissions or Ministers untrammelled powers in this area. </para>
          <para>I have tried to be fair. I have pointed out that the Opposition sees massive dangers in this Bill. We think that it is not a wise measure. We cannot see that it has any real virtue at all. We think that any benefit that could come out of the approach of the Scott report could be far better achieved in existing departments through co-ordination and consultation, and by a better understanding between the private sector and the public sector through discussion and interchange and by making long term needs fairly clearly known. I suppose one could argue that the Bill might stand amendment. When we looked through this Bill we concluded that it was impossible for us to spend the time in amending it. Indeed, if it were amended satisfactorily there would be no Bill left because we would come back to what I said at the beginning. There is a need for consultation and communication and there is a need for coordination and understanding. This can be achieved now through the existing mechanisms by people working together. Therefore, in the Opposition&#39;s view, there is no need for the Commission and there is no need for the Bill. On the other hand, the Opposition believes that the Government has a responsibility. in the brief time that it has left to be the Government, to try to improve its processes in a more workmanlike style than it is currently demonstrating. If we can do anything at all to overcome the distress and disaster into which the Government has plunged the economy and the manufacturing industry the Opposition would certainly try to support that laudable aim. </para>

            <para>- I indicate on behalf of the National Country Party that we also oppose this Bill for the reasons given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton.</inline> We oppose it as being yet another socialistic measure to control private enterprise and interfere in the free enterprise system. Certainly there is a need to update and improve the present government purchasing system for the purposes of government requirements. There is possibly a need for some improvement in our assistance to private industry, but only in an advisory capacity. I cannot see any need at this stage to set up a great bureaucracy that is going to interfere with the normal market place, with the free enterprise system that we have enjoyed in this country. I cannot see that there is any possible need for that. All the Commission would do is centralise the bureaucracy that is trying to interfere between the purchaser and the supplier of goods. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As I see it, the Commission is not going to effect any great efficiency or any cost savings. In fact, the opposite could be the case. Let us face it, we have private industries which have operated competitively in all areas. That is how they survive. They have had to be efficient to survive. In most cases, they must have organised a pretty elaborate buying system, an efficient buying system, otherwise they would not be in business. To think that someone who is unproved in the business community can direct others on what they should purchase and on how they should purchase is contrary to all my concepts. I believe there is a need to improve purchasing within the departments. I also believe that the Department of Overseas Trade could be strengthened to assist export industries and manufacturers who are importing raw materials and goods to simplify the matter, if necessary by bulk purchasing a lot of things. Is this proposed commission to determine what goods are to be purchased without any prior trial? After all, each individual company and enterprise in private industry decides on its own what it will purchase, what manufactured goods it needs and what raw materials it needs for its manufacturing processes. If it purchases the wrong material or makes a mistake in that direction it suffers accordingly in the market place. </para>
          <para>What amazes me is that although the various departments- I think the Department of Defence was mentioned- must have their own experts to decide on their requirements, the departments will still need those experts if this commission is established. I could not imagine the personnel of this proposed great bureaucracy being able to determine what the Army and the Navy require better than the Army personnel and the Navy personnel could determine. One would still need the experts in a particular field to advise. If we go through the clauses of this Bill we realise the implications of the Bill. It is only another instrument in the socialisation of this nation. One can imagine that if the $4,000m loan deal had been negotiated and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Connor</inline> had been able, as he calls it, to buy back some of the farm- I see it as a mortgage on some of our national assets to the Arabs- we would have seen public enterprises all over this country in competition with our private industry and, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> pointed out, not subject to customs duty. </para>
          <para>Quite frankly I cannot see at this stage the necessity for this proposal. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> said, we could not amend this Bill because then there would not be any Bill at all. One could go through one clause after another and find items that are completely contrary to our philosophy. Therefore, I believe all that we as an Opposition can do is to throw out the Bill and to hope that at some stage the Government will come back with a proposition for improving purchasing arrangements within departments and, if necessary, setting up an advisory body for private industry. 1 will not go into all the details. I know that other speakers have special areas of concern. I just say on behalf of our Party that this is another socialistic measure to interfere with and control private industry. For that reason alone I will not support it. </para>

          <para>The Budget is presented at a time of high inflation and, by Australian standards, high unemployment. </para>

          <para>On balance unemployment in recent months and notwithstanding the rise in July has been fairly steady. The situation will be carefully watched. </para>
          <para>The public sector has played an important part so far in stimulating the movement towards recovery from the recession. Furthermore, the big increases in spending on the Government&#39;s programs in the past 2 years were needed to overcome decades of neglect. </para>
          <para>Because of the structure of our mixed economy, where three out of four jobs are in the private sector, there are firm limits on how far the public sector should be stimulated in this recovery phase. In framing the Budget, therefore, the Government has exercised the utmost restraint on its spending. </para>
          <para>The key-note of this Budget is consolidation and restraint, rather than further expansion of the public sector. </para>
          <para>On the economic front, inflation is this nation &#39;s most menacing enemy. The Government aims to curb it. Unless this aim is achieved, the nation&#39;s productive capacity will run down and job opportunities will diminish. </para>
          <para>The present level of unemployment is too high. If inflation is not controlled unemployment will get worse. </para>
          <para>THE BUDGET AND ECONOMIC POLICY</para>
        <para>Recent developments offer some hope that 1975-76 will be a better year than its predecessor. For that, steady and responsible economic policies are needed. </para>

Expenditures were projected to grow much more rapidly than revenues and the prospective deficit was nearly double that of 1974-75. Clearly, such a deficit could not be countenanced under the circumstances. </para>
        <para>In the context of an economy beginning to pick up, a deficit of the order initially projected would have been a prescription for accelerating inflation. Its acceptance would have been tantamount to abandoning concern with inflation, discarding the Government&#39;s wages policies, condemning the corporate sector to an attack upon its profitability and threatening the future jobs of thousands of Australians- all at a time when the first signs of improvement in most of those respects are beginning to appear. </para>
        <para>That simple Keynesian world in which some reduction in unemployment could, apparently, always be purchased at the cost of some more inflation no longer exists. Today, it is inflation itself which is the central policy problem. More inflation simply leads to more unemployment. </para>
        <para>Some might argue that a large deficit could be offset by a tough monetary policy- but this would mean greatly increased interest rates, disruption in financial markets, further depression of business confidence and serious company failures. That is an unacceptable option. </para>
        <para>An alternative approach, in its own way equally extreme, would have been to seek to pull down outlays sufficiently to bring the deficit well below that of 1974-75. That would have caused severe disruption to the economy. Economic recovery would almost certainly have halted. </para>
        <para>The prescription which this course would have entailed is just as unacceptable as the other prescription of letting inflation rip. The Government rejects a policy of deliberately creating massive unemployment and widespread business failures in order to stop inflation abruptly. </para>
        <para>The Government has therefore tried to find a middle way- a line along which sound and sustainable growth can be achieved while at the same time bringing inflation down gradually over perhaps two or three years. </para>
        <para>In the outcome, the Budget holds the share of Australian Government outlays in the total economy steady. Even to restrain that share from rising further has involved many painful decisions. </para>
        <para>It is a firm Budget in which the rate of growth in outlays has been halved as compared with last year. </para>
        <para>It is a Budget neither too lax, thereby inviting a renewed acceleration of inflation, nor too harsh, causing unconscionable loss of production and the human and social costs of massive unemployment. </para>
        <para>WAGES AND SALARIES</para>
        <para>The Budget is one major instrument of economic policy. Another major policy area concerns the growth in wages and salaries. </para>
        <para>If wages and salaries continue to outstrip productivity increases, the productive capacity of the economy will decline and everyone shall eventually be worse off. </para>
        <para>It is too early yet to determine whether wage indexation will succeed in dampening the recent wage-price spiral. The signs are mixed. The Government intends to do what it can to make indexation work. </para>
        <para>Meanwhile, however, it is clear that some wage and salary pressures are unrealistic and, when successful, harmful. It does employees generally no good to get higher and higher money incomes if the results are just higher prices, a severe squeeze on profits, a slump in new investment and a contraction of job opportunities. </para>
        <para>Wage and salary earners&#39; purchasing power is already being maintained through wage indexation and the indexation guidelines provide for increases to be sought on other specified grounds, including increases in productivity. To call as well for tax indexation, and at the same time expect the Government to provide better education, free medical services and so on which it can only do by increasing its claims upon our national resources- is to ask for the impossible. </para>
        <para>It is not possible to provide more and more government services or transfer payments from the Budget without ultimately having to pay for them through cutting back after-tax earnings via increased taxes. It is not possible to get quarts out of pint pots. </para>
        <para>In this Budget, the Government has exercised restraint. That restraint needs to be shared throughout the whole community. There must be a community will to combat inflation. There must be action to back up that will. </para>
        <para>REINING IN BUDGET OUTLAYS</para>
        <para>Last financial year, outlays increased very sharply- by 46 per cent. </para>
        <para>Whereas total Australian Government Budget outlays maintained a remarkably stable proportion of around 25 per cent of gross domestic product in the decade to 1973-74, in 1974-75 that proportion increased to 30.5 per cent. There was a number of special factors present in that outcome, including the need for some fiscal stimulus during the year. </para>
        <para>There is nothing sacrosanct about the particular public and private sector shares of GDP. But sharp movements in these shares can be disruptive. </para>
        <para>If Budget outlays this year were again to grow faster than total spending, a further decline in the private sector share of GDP would ensue. </para>
        <para class="block">That would mean an accelerated decline in investment and productivity as well as a further contraction in job opportunities. </para>
        <para>The Government is committed to the present mixed economy&#39; framework and wants to strengthen that framework. To reduce unemployment lastingly, recovery in the private sector is essential. </para>
        <para>Expenditure restraint in the Budget will lay the foundations for a desirable balance between the public and private sectors. </para>
        <para>Total outlays are now estimated to increase by 23 per cent in 1975-76, half the rate of increase of last year. Little change is expected in the proportion of Budget outlays to GDP. This offers a challenge to the private sector to respond with robust attitudes towards expansion which should serve well those who adopt them. </para>
        <para>Cutting back the increase in Budget outlays is not easy. Everyone favours expenditure restraint in the abstract; few favour it when it affects them personally. </para>
        <para>In approaching its task, the Government has distinguished between programs of utmost priority; programs where very rapid increases in recent years now permit some consolidation; and programs which might be deferred for a time. </para>
        <para>In all this the less well-off members of the community have been protected. Inevitably in the process, many desirable expenditures have been scaled down or postponed. This will concern and disappoint many. That is unfortunate, but in present circumstances it is also unavoidable. </para>
        <para>OUTLAYS</para>
        <para>Outlays in 1975-76 are estimated to total $2 1,915 man increase of 23 per cent over actual outlays last year. </para>
        <para>DEFENCE</para>
        <para>Defence expenditure in 1975-76 is estimated at $ 1,800.1m. </para>
        <para>Last year the Government approved the acquisition of a number of major items for the Services, including long-range maritime patrol aircraft, tanks and patrol frigates. Significantly greater expenditure will be incurred this year on capital equipment, improvements to defence installations and on housing for servicemen. </para>
        <para>EDUCATION</para>
        <para>In 1975-76, total outlays on education are estimated at $ 1,908m, an increase of $237m over last year. </para>
        <para>In the first full year of office of this Government, Australian Government expenditure on education almost doubled. Last year, it almost doubled again. This year, recurrent expenditure will be maintained at no less than the present real levels, but capital expenditure will be limited to essential projects. </para>
        <para>The remarkable quadrupling of the total education expenditure figures in just over two years has been only part of the record. Benefits in relation to the quality of education will continue to flow on a long-term basis from the machinery established, and the programs fostered by the Government. </para>
        <para>Care and Education of Young Children</para>
        <para>The Government is providing $74m in financial assistance to community organisations and to the States towards the care and education of young children. </para>
        <para>HEALTH</para>
          <para>Medibank</para>
        <para>Medibank was launched on 1 July last. $ 1,445m is included in the Budget for this program. </para>
        <para>This financial year, medical and optometric al benefits are estimated to cost $6 15m while the hospital side of Medibank is estimated to cost $822m. </para>
          <para>Community Health</para>
        <para>A sum of $65m is appropriated for services provided under the Community Health Program. </para>
          <para>Hospitals Development Program</para>
        <para>A further $ 108m will be made available to the States in 1 975-76 by way of capital assistance for the development of public hospitals and related health care facilities. </para>
        <para>The Australian Government will maintain its contribution at least at this level during each of the remaining 3 years of the program. </para>
          <para>Nursing Home Benefits</para>
        <para>It is proposed to increase the additional nursing home benefit in three States- New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia. These increases represent the first step towards a common nursing home benefit rate for all States. </para>
        <para>The effect of the increases will be that ordinary care patients in those States will receive a uniform total benefit of $66. 1 5 a week. Rates of benefit for ordinary care patients in other States, which are already higher, will be maintained at current levels. The supplementary intensive care benefit will be increased from $21 a week to $30.80 a week in all States. This benefit has remained unchanged since January 1969. </para>
        <para>The increases in both the additional and intensive care benefits will not apply to patients in Government nursing homes. </para>
        <para>These increases, estimated to cost $10m in 1975-76,- take effect from the first pension pay day in November. </para>
          <para>Medical Research</para>
        <para>The Government will increase by 39 per cent, to $24m, its support in the 1976-78 triennium for medical research under the auspices* of the National Health and Medical Research Council. Expenditure in 1975-76 is estimated at $4m. </para>
        <para>Additional payments totalling $lm will be made to the Florey and Walter and Eliza Hall research institutes. </para>
        <para>SOCIAL SECURITY AND WELFARE</para>
      <para>The Prime Minister has announced that the Government is to institute a review of Australia&#39;s income security system. </para>
          <para>Social Security Benefit Rates</para>
        <para>The standard rate of social service pensions and benefits will be increased in the spring of 1 975 by the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index between the December quarter 1974 and the June quarter 1975; and again in the autumn of 1976 by the increase in the Consumer Price Index between the June and December quarters of 1975. </para>
        <para>This will mean a first increase in the standard rate of $2.75 a week. The combined married rate will be increased by $4.50 a week so as to maintain the standard rate at 60 per cent of the combined married rate. These increases will become effective from the first pension pay day in November. </para>
        <para>The basic pension has increased by 80 per cent since the December quarter of 1972, well ahead of the rate of increase in average weekly earnings 56 per cent- and consumer prices- 41 per cent. The relative improvement compared to the average wage earner is even more pronounced in after-tax terms. Since the December quarter of 1972, the increase in take-home pay of the typical family man on average weekly earnings has been 50 per cent. </para>
        <para>The increases proposed will maintain the real purchasing power of those greatly increased pensions and are estimated to cost $233 million in 1975-76. </para>
        <para>There will be no change in the rate of unemployment and sickness benefit payable to persons under 18 years of age. </para>
        <para>The rates of additional pension and benefit payable for dependent children, including student children, are to be increased by 50 cents to $7.50 a week. </para>
        <para class="block">Abolition of the Means Test </para>
        <para>For budgetary reasons the Government will not be able to complete- the final stage of the abolition of the means test- for those aged 65 to 69 years- as quickly as it had hoped. Nonetheless it is intended to make as much further progress as economic circumstances allow. </para>
        <para>The Government has decided to abolish the means test for residentially qualified persons aged 69 years from 1 July 1976. The necessary legislation will be introduced in the autumn sittings. </para>
          <para>Repatriation Benefits</para>
        <para>Since coming to office the Government has improved repatriation benefits substantially. Legislation providing further improvements will be introduced in the current sittings and in Autumn 1976. </para>
          <para>Aboriginal Advancement</para>
        <para>The record level of expenditure on Aboriginal advancement achieved in 1974-75 will be exceeded in 1975-76; direct expenditure in 1975-76 is estimated at $192 million, compared with $158 million in 1974-75 and $98 million in </para>
        <para class="block">1973- 74. </para>

          <para>Welfare Housing</para>
        <para>In the light of the recovery in private housing now in train, advances totalling $364.6 million will be provided to the States for welfare housing purposes in 1975-76. Bearing in mind the $10.4 million advanced in June on the basis that it would be taken into account in this year&#39;s allocation, the Government is thus maintaining advances in 1975-76 at the greatly increased 1974- 75 level and well above the $218.6 million allocated in 1973-74. </para>
          <para>Australian Housing Corporation</para>
        <para>Responsibility for the Defence Service Homes scheme has been transferred to the newly proclaimed Australian Housing Corporation. An amount of $122.5 million will be available for Defence Service Homes advances in 1975-76. </para>
        <para>A further $20 million has been provided for the Corporation in 1975-76. Together with the $25 million remaining unspent from 1974-75, this will enable the Corporation to meet its administrative expenses and to undertake new programs in the housing field. </para>

          <para>Postal and Telecommunication Services</para>
        <para>Since 1 July 1975, the former functions of the Post Office have been undertaken by the Australian Postal Commission and the Australian Telecommunications Commission. </para>
        <para>Increased postal and telecommunication charges to operate from 1 September 1975 have already been announced. The increased charges are necessary to cover significant increases in the cost of providing services and to enable each Commission to comply with the requirement, under its constituting legislation, to cover its costs and finance at least 50 per cent of its capital expenditure from internal sources. </para>
        <para>The amount to be provided from the Budget to help finance the capital programs of the two Commissions comprises $14 million for the Postal Commission and $403 million for the Telecommunications Commission. </para>
        <para>If the increased charges were not applied, then the costs they were to cover would have to be covered in some other way. That is, the Government would either have to increase direct or indirect taxes, or add to the deficit by printing money. </para>
        <para>Alternatively, the Government could cut-back further on existing programs but it is clear that additional cut-backs would be extremely difficult to make. </para>
          <para>Air Transport</para>
        <para>It was announced in the 1973-74 Budget Speech that the Government proposed to increase the rate of recovery of the costs of providing and operating airport and airway facilities to 80 per cent within 5 years. It was then estimated that a recovery rate of 70 per cent should be reached in 1975-76. </para>
        <para>Despite increases in air navigation charges, very little progress has been made towards this objective. Currently about 55 per cent of costs are being recovered. </para>
        <para>The Government does not believe that the general taxpayer should continue to subsidise air services and proposes to achieve its objective of 80 per cent recovery by 1977-78. Action will be taken to increase the recovery rate to 70 per cent this year. </para>
          <para>Rail Transport</para>
        <para>An amount of $5 1.9 million is being provided to finance the new Australian National Railways Commission&#39;s 1975-76 capital works program, compared with expenditure of $14.6 million by the former Commonwealth Railways in 1974-75. This includes work on the railway between Tarcoola and Alice Springs, and on the Adelaide to Crystal Brook standard gauge line. It also includes funds for the Tasmanian railways and for the South Australian railways. </para>
        <para>A further $40 million is being provided to the Commission as a subsidy to cover its estimated losses in 1975-76; the Tasmanian and non metropolitan South Australian railways are expected to account for about 80 per cent of this loss. </para>

        <para>In present circumstances, no new projects are being approved. There remains, however, a large volume of commitments, in respect of which an amount of $135 million is included in the Budget. This will provide continuing employment on previously approved REDS projects for some time. </para>
          <para>Industrial Training</para>
        <para>The Government is allocating $88 million this financial year to its various manpower training programs, including Seats and support for apprenticeship training. </para>
          <para>Administrative Savings</para>
        <para>Stringent restraint has also been imposed on administrative expenditures. Overall, the provisions for administrative expenses for Departments and statutory authorities (other than business undertakings) financed from the Budget have been reduced by about 10 per cent. </para>
        <para>Particular examples of restraint include economy class domestic air travel for Members of Parliament and Government employees, restrictions on the use of Government cars, reductions in overseas travel, non-replacement of existing office furniture and fittings and restrictions on overtime working and engagement of consultants. </para>
        <para>It is estimated that these measures will produce savings totalling about $35 million in 1975-76. </para>
        <para>PAYMENTS TO OR FOR THE STATES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES AND NATURAL DISASTER RELIEF</para>
      <para>General Purpose Funds for the States </para>
      <para>At the Premiers&#39; Conference on 19 June 1975 the Australian Government undertook to improve the financial assistance grants arrangements with the States. </para>
      <para>It is estimated that the financial assistance grants payable to the States in 1975-76 under these new arrangements will total about $3, 185m, an increase of $81 lm or 34.2 per cent over the grants paid in 1974-75. </para>
      <para>In addition, the Government has accepted recommendations by the Grants Commission that special grants totalling $38.8m be paid to Queensland and South Australia in 1975-76. </para>
      <para>The Government also agreed in June to support a 1975-76 Loan Council program for State Government of $ 1,291m which, after adjustments are made for special factors, represents an increase of 20 per cent over the program for </para>
      <para class="block">1974- 75. </para>
          <para>Local Government Grants</para>
        <para>The Government has already announced its acceptance of the recommendations contained in the Grants Commission&#39;s second report on unconditional financial assistance for local government totalling $79.9m, or 42 per cent more than last year. </para>
          <para>Natural Disaster Relief</para>
        <para>It is presently estimated that expenditures by the Government on natural disaster relief in 1975- 76 will total $57.6m, of which $48. lm will be for relief measures arising out of the devastation of Darwin by Cyclone Tracy. </para>
        <para>Included in this latter amount are $33m for continuation of compensation payments to Darwin residents and $12m for the maintenance of various relief measures, including emergency accommodation and loans to small businesses. </para>
        <para>The Government has also established the Darwin Reconstruction Commission, and provided $99.7m for the Commission&#39;s construction program in 1975-76. </para>
        <para>RECEIPTS</para>
      <para>In deciding on revenue measures the Government took it as essential that there be some reduction in both personal and company income tax. At the same time it was judged necessary to reduce the potential deficit somewhat. </para>
      <para>Consequently, the Government has determined on a mix of tax measures, some of them increasing the revenue and some reducing it. Their net effect is to increase total tax revenue in 1975-76 by an estimated $207m. </para>
          <para>Beer</para>
        <para>It is proposed to increase the duty on beer immediately by the equivalent of 4 cents a 10 ounce glass. The estimated revenue yield in 1975-76 is $234m. </para>
          <para>Potable Spirits</para>
        <para>Duties on potable spirits have been increased considerably over recent years and the present scope for further increase is not great. It is proposed to increase the duty on potable spirits immediately by the equivalent of 1 cent a nip. It is also proposed to complete the third and last step in the phasing out of the differential between the rates of duty on brandy and other potable spirits. The estimated revenue yield of these measures in 1975-76 is $12m. </para>
          <para>Tobacco Products</para>
        <para>The duty on tobacco and cigarettes will be increased immediately by the equivalent of 6 cents an average packet of 20 cigarettes, with equivalent increases on other tobacco products. The estimated revenue yield in 1 975-76 is $75m. </para>
          <para>Crude Petroleum</para>
        <para class="block">The present price of domestically produced  crude oil is about one quarter of the landed price of imported crude. The low domestic price is not conductive to rational resource usage. Yet it does not necessarily follow that increases in the domestic price should be reflected fully in corresponding increases in prices to Australian producers: the rise in world oil prices has occurred largely because governments in OPEC and other producing countries have greatly increased their taxes on production. </para>
        <para>The indigenous crude oil absorption policy, which runs for a period of 10 years from 1 7 September 1970, provides for a review of price after 5 years. The Government is considering and will be announcing shortly the price arrangements which will apply from 1 7 September next. </para>
        <para>Meanwhile, the Government has decided to impose a levy of $2 per barrel on the production of crude oil, condensate and naturally occurring liquefied petroleum gas, with immediate effect. The levy will not fall on natural gas or refinery products although, of course, its price effects can be expected to spread through into the latter. </para>
        <para>The estimated revenue yield in 1975-76 is $280 million. </para>
        <para class="block">Export Duty on Coal </para>
        <para>Following the sharp rise in oil prices, coal prices have risen dramatically in the past two years, in many cases trebling. In consequence, very large windfall profits are currently being earned by the export sector of the coal industry. The Government considers it reasonable that part of these increased profits should be channelled to the community by means of an export duty. </para>
        <para>Price movements for various classes of coal have not been uniform but higher quality coking coals have experienced much greater price increases than other coals. It is therefore proposed to levy export duty of $6 per tonne on these high quality coking coals and $2 per tonne on other coals, with immediate effect. To protect buyers in respect of prices recently renegotiated, approval to export will be in terms of those prices and no consideration will be given to adjustment of prices to take account of the duty. </para>
        <para>The revenue yield from this duty in 1975-76 is estimated to be $ 120 million. </para>
          <para>Company Tax</para>
        <para>The Government has had before it the recommendations on business taxation contained in the Mathews Report on&#39;Inflation and Taxation&#39;. </para>
        <para>The first of the Mathews recommendations related to the valuation of most trading stocks for taxation purposes. Its primary purpose was to ease pressures on business liquidity in inflationary periods. </para>
        <para>After careful consideration we have decided that it is not at this time possible to act on this recommendation, partly because of its enormous revenue cost but also because of the complexity and difficulty involved in giving effect to the Committee&#39;s proposal to defer tax for individual firms on the basis of each individual firm&#39;s changing stock values. Very serious practical problems would also be created for both industry and the Taxation Office in implementing the Committee&#39;s suggestion that deferred tax be collected when stock values fall or when businesses change hands. It has not been possible to this time to resolve these difficulties. </para>
        <para>The Government shall, of course, keep the question of business profitability and liquidity under careful notice but, in all circumstances, it has turned to the other alternative in this area which was mentioned by the Mathews Committeenamely, a reduction in company tax. </para>
        <para>The Government has decided to adopt this alternative and proposes to reduce the general rate of company tax by 2.5 per cent to 42.5 per cent. The new rate will apply to 1974-75 income and will cost an estimated $120 million in 1975-76. </para>
        <para>It has also been decided to continue the system of doubled rates of depreciation beyond 30 June 1975 and extend it to all sectors of commerce and industry. The Government has taken note here of the Mathews Committee&#39;s advice that:- </para>
        <para>Accelerated depreciation and investment allowances are appropriate policy options for a government which wishes to influence the level or the pattern of private investment . . .&#39; </para>
        <para>The doubled rates of depreciation will be made applicable to all new plant other than motor cars and utility trucks, including plant used in industries such as transportation and construction that were excluded from the 1974-75 double &#39; depreciation provisions and from the investment allowances granted from time to time by the previous Government. The first cost to revenue of this proposal will fall in 1976-77 and will approximate $75 million. </para>
        <para>The decision to opt for double depreciation rather than the indexation of depreciation allowances as recommended in the Mathews Report reflected the Government&#39;s view that it was desirable to introduce immediately a clearly understood aid to business investment. The indexation recommendation would introduce some complex new elements into the depreciation provisions and there is a need for further study as to how a practicable and equitable scheme might be worked out. </para>
        <para>Meanwhile, the double depreciation provisions will without delay greatly help the business sector in the planning of its investment and cash flows. </para>
          <para>Personal Income Tax</para>
        <para>The Government has decided to introduce a radical new personal income tax system which involves fundamental reform of the tax system with one overwhelmingly important objective the achievement of a more equitable distribution of the tax burden. </para>
        <para>Under the new system nearly half a million existing taxpayers will be freed from tax entirely. Those earning least in the community will be exempted from personal tax. </para>
        <para>A very large number of taxpayers will benefit by the changes we are making. But what is of greatest satisfaction to the Government is the fact that those in most need will benefit substantially. </para>
        <para>The existing personal income tax system has persisted almost unchanged for over 2 decades and has about reached the end of its tether. </para>
        <para>Criticism of the present arrangements has rightly focussed upon the excessive marginal rates which are imposed upon taxpayers on average incomes. For example, a taxpayer on average weekly earnings with a dependent wife and two dependent children and average other deductions would lose 44 cents of each extra dollar of his pay in higher taxation if the present rates were maintained. If he had smaller deductions his marginal rate could be as high as 48 cents in the dollar. </para>
        <para>In deciding what to do about this state of affairs the Government had several choices. The Mathews report recommended that this year the Government introduce tax indexation or, alternatively, introduce a new tax schedule with a commitment to index it in future. The As prey report recommended that a quite different type of rate scale be introduced, with an initial marginal rate much higher than at present and with much lower marginal rates at intermediate ranges of income. </para>
        <para>So far as the rate scale is concerned, what is proposed is based on the As prey concept. But before going on, the Government&#39;s attitude to tax indexation should be explained. </para>
        <para>It would not be possible to introduce tax indexation this year because of the very great revenue cost. In any case, the present rate scale is wholly unsatisfactory as a basis for indexation. Consequently the Government is taking up the Mathews suggestion of introducing a new tax scale to apply this year. </para>
        <para>As for next year, no Government can commit itself to a precise measure a year hence when the revenue implications are so large but the circumstances of that future time are not foreseeable. However, in framing the 1976-77 Budget the Government will take full advantage of the greater flexibility- including greater flexibility in adjusting for price increases- which this year&#39;s reform of the tax system will offer. Indexing of the new scale will thus be available as an option next year. </para>
        <para>So far as this year is concerned, the new scale will actually reduce marginal tax rates of taxpayers on average weekly earnings by more than would be the case if the present scale were indexed. That is, what is proposed will produce a better result than tax indexation so far as the marginal &#39;tax bite &#39;is concerned. </para>
        <para>Turning now to the proposed new system, the As prey report drew attention to the low marginal rates of tax on low incomes and suggested that they be increased. It added: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The most important advantage of an initial step of some magnitude is not that it raises much tax from the taxpayers whose total income is confined within this step: it is rather that a sizeable minimum average rate is thereby struck for all higher incomes. Without a significant rate on the lower steps, much higher marginal rates than otherwise must be imposed further up the income scale . . . </para>
        </quote>
        <para>This approach, of course, involves raising more tax from so-called low income earners. Many such people depend solely on their own incomes and could hardly be expected to pay more tax. Certainly the Government does not expect them to do so. </para>
        <para>But many others in this income group are members of multi-income households who might be supposed, on general social grounds, to be capable of contributing further. </para>
        <para>The Government has therefore devised a system designed to retain the desirable features of the As prey suggestion but to exclude the undesirable income distribution features. </para>
        <para>The main features of the new system are now outlined. </para>
        <para>First, there will be a new and much simplified rate scale, with only seven steps instead of the present fourteen. The marginal rates will begin at 20 cents in the dollar on taxable incomes of up to $2,000 rising to 27 cents in the dollar on incomes from $2,000 to $5,000 and to 35 cents in the dollar on incomes from $5,000 to $10,000. </para>
        <para class="block">The marginal rates rise in four further steps to reach a maximum of 65 cents in the dollar at a taxable income of $25,000. </para>
        <para>On incomes from $6,000 to $25,000 marginal rates generally will fall, the greatest fall being in the $8,000-10,000 income range, where the drop is from 48 cents in the dollar to 35 cents in the dollar. </para>
        <para>Secondly, every individual taxpayer, whether or not he or she has dependants or spends on items which attract deductions, will receive a minimum concessional rebate of $540. This will protect low income earners from the impact of the higher marginal rates at low income levels. </para>
        <para>The minimum concessional rebate does this by, in effect, increasing the minimum taxable income from its present $1,041 to $2,520 per annum. The introduction of this rebate will make possible the elimination of the present age rebate and the new scheme provides for that. </para>
        <para>Thirdly, the present concessional allowances for dependants will be replaced by much more generous dependant&#39;s rebates. For a spouse the rebate will be $400; for children it will be $200 for the first child under 16 and student children redefined to include all children under 25 receiving full-time education, and $150 in respect of other children. </para>
        <para>There will be a separate rebate of $200, known as the sole parent rebate, for parents without partners, such as widows or widowers or unmarried persons, who have the sole responsibility for maintenance of dependent children. </para>
        <para>Fourthly, with certain exceptions, the existing concessional deductions for private expenditures will be converted to rebates calculated at 40 cents in the dollar of the amounts allowable under the present law. However, the minimum concessional rebate will be regarded as covering the first $540 of rebate claimable, other than for dependants. The effect of this will be that taxpayers whose reba table expenditures are less than $1,350 will not need to itemise them as they will be covered by the minimum concessional rebate. </para>
        <para>There will be certain exceptions to these rebate arrangements, as follows. </para>
        <para>The existing housing loan interest deductions scheme will remain in its present form; that is, allowable deductions as presently prescribed will reduce taxable income. </para>
        <para>The existing provisions for gifts to charities and school building funds will also remain unaltered. </para>
        <para>There will be separate zone allowance rebates over and above the $540 minimum concessional rebate for taxpayers in the prescribed zones. </para>
        <para>Finally, the allowable deduction for education expenses, now one of the concessional deductions to be converted to the rebate basis, will be increased from $ 1 50 to $250 per student child. </para>
        <para>It is not possible to outline all the benefits of the new tax system here. The main attractions, however, are as follows: </para>
        <para>Nearly 500 000 taxpayers will be freed from tax entirely; there will be a very big increase in minimum taxable incomes- for example, to $5,372 in the case of a taxpayer with a dependent wife and two dependent student children; there will be a very big drop in marginal rates of tax on incomes in the range into which most full-time employees fall; taxpayers with dependants are heavily favoured as compared with the present system, particularly in the lower income ranges. For example, in his statement announcing tax cuts last November, the Prime Minister gave as an illustration the taxpayer with a dependent wife and 2 dependent children earning $100 a week. If his other deductions were 10 per cent of his income his tax payable would have declined from $568 in 1 973-74 to $264 in 1974-75. Under the new arrangements such a taxpayer is freed from tax entirely. </para>
        <para>The Government believes that the new system is both more equitable and more adaptable for revenue raising and economic management purposes. </para>
        <para>Because of the extensive changes it entails, it will not be possible to have the proposed system in operation for Paye purposes until 1 January 1976. </para>
        <para>The cost to revenue of the new system cannot be as simply summarised as is usually the case. On a true &#39;full year&#39; basis, the cost to revenue will be $205m. </para>
        <para>However, an additional advantage of the new system to taxpayers is that it will permit a large reduction in the present degree of over deduction of PAYE tax instalments- and a consequential reduction in refunds which, this year, are estimated at $ 1,025m. That will assist the monetary authorities by reducing seasonal swings in revenue flows; it will also reduce the need for taxpayers to make, as it were, involuntary loans to the Government. </para>
        <para>The combined effect of these taxation measures and of the more accurate PAYE deductions which they make possible will be a substantial reduction in PAYE tax instalments for most taxpayers from the beginning of 1 976. The precise instalments to be applied will be determined in due course but for purposes of illustration, the rise in the take-home pay of a wage earner with a dependent wife and two children, and earning between $100 and $150 per week, will be well over $5 per week. There will be small rises- generally of less than $ 1 per week- in the PAYE instalment deductions of some taxpayers without dependants. </para>
        <para>The total estimated cost to revenue of the scheme in 1975-76 is $395 million, but of this, $365 million is attributable to the more accurate PAYE deductions which the new arrangements will permit. </para>
          <para>Property Income Surcharge</para>
        <para>It is proposed to abolish the property income surcharge with effect from this income year. There will be no cost to revenue in 1975-76; the cost in a full year will be $25 million. </para>
        <para>BUDGET OUTCOME</para>
      <para>In aggregate, Budget outlays are estimated to increase in 1 975-76 by $4,084 million or 22.9 per cent to $2 1,9 15 million. </para>
      <para>Receipts are estimated to increase by $3,852 million or 25.2 per cent to $ 1 9, 1 1 7 million. </para>
      <para>The estimated deficit is thus $2,798 million and the domestic deficit $2,068 million. </para>
        <para>THE POST-BUDGET ECONOMIC OUTLOOK</para>
      <para>Given the budgetary decisions, what is the economic outlook for the period ahead? </para>
      <para>Reflecting the policy decisions, government spending at all levels will show only modest real growth in 1975-76. </para>
      <para>With the exception of business investment expenditure, which remains the weakest area of prospective demand, other components of domestic spending should show a strengthening trend and prospects for exports are also reasonably good. Imports have been quite subdued but will probably pick up during the year. </para>
      <para>In recent months, consistent with the need to avoid sudden and disruptive changes in the monetary aggregates, the Reserve Bank has acted to gradually restrain the growth in bank lending and liquidity. Nonetheless the liquidity of the banking system should be sufficient to meet the basic immediate needs of the economy for finance without being fully accommodating to inflation. </para>
      <para>In this Budget fiscal policy has been brought into better balance with monetary policy; both ;have now appropriately shifted from earlier strong stimulus to postures of moderation. </para>
      <para>Against this background, real gross domestic product is forecast to increase by about 5 per cent in 1975-76, after falling by 2 per cent in 1974-75. Prospects for employment should improve, but the improvement is likely to be gradual. </para>
      <para>The course charted has its risks and the possibility of temporary reverses cannot be ruled out. But if there is an equal commitment in the community to play its part in steering the economy back to a firmer footing, it will be possible to overcome any such temporary problems. </para>
      <para> On the matter of prices, the increased duties on beer, tobacco and potable spirits will increase prices as stocks are worked off. There will also be price increases, which cannot be calculated with precision, resulting from the passing on of the crude petroleum levy into the prices of motor spirit and other products. The increased postal and telephone charges to come into operation from 1 September next will also add a little to the CPI in the December quarter. </para>
      <para>The Government is fully aware that, in itself, the effect on prices is unwelcome. What were the alternatives? </para>
      <para>One alternative would have been to let the deficit rise even further. That would have been more inflationary and would have thrown an undue burden onto monetary policy. </para>
      <para>Another alternative would have been to refrain both from raising these indirect taxes and from reducing company and personal income taxes. </para>
      <para>The Government considered that course equally untenable. </para>
      <para>In theory, another alternative would have been to cut our expenditures by a further $500m or $600m. That possibility was examined but the Government concluded that it was impracticable. </para>
      <para>In drawing attention to these price effects, it is the Government&#39;s firm view that, for the purposes of wage indexation, increases in prices resulting from tax measures of the sort indicated should be discounted. It would be self-defeating if the system of wage indexation were to attempt to insulate the community from tax measures designed to redistribute resources for the benefit of the community in the form of improved public facilities in fields such as education, health, welfare, personal benefits, urban improvement and so on. These improvements must be seen as a real improvement in people&#39;s living standards and are a non-money form of addition to their incomes. </para>
      <para>In its submissions in the recent wage indexation hearings before the Arbitration Commission the Government foreshadowed the likelihood that it would make submissions on this matter in future quarterly hearings. </para>
      <para>Notwithstanding these direct price effects of the indirect tax measures, the Government looks for a continuing downward shift in the underlying rate of inflation during 1975-76. It can hardly be more than a slow winding down within that time-frame; but our time-frame must extend beyond the immediate confines of this financial year. 1975-76 is therefore seen as a year of consolidation. Economic growth will only be restored by way of gradual policies firmly grounded upon an effective anti-inflationary foundation. </para>
        <para>CONCLUSION</para>
      <para>In this Budget the Government has endeavoured to give a lead to the community. </para>
      <para>If inflation is to be curbed there are no soft options- only a choice between more or less difficult ones. </para>
      <para>It is the Government&#39;s hope that with a community appreciation of the need for restraint, a real start can be made on getting inflation under control and further raising living standards for everybody. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Attorney-General. Are reports correct that officers of the Trade Practices Commission, aided by the Commonwealth Police, raided a businessman&#39;s home and business premises and seized documents last weekend? Is not such action contrary to the Trade Practices Act which gives no power to seize documents and gives no authority whatsoever to the police? If so, are not raids of this character and the seizure of documents typical of the notorious dictatorships of this world? Is the Government now accepting that in this country a person&#39;s property and privacy may be invaded to discover evidence with which to convict him? In view of the fact that citizens appear to have no redress to the courts against invasions of this character, will the Minister table in the Senate the documents under which this invasion of privacy took place? </para>

            <para>On 25 May 1975 officers of the Australia Police Force, accompanied by officers of the Trade Practices Commission, entered certain premises and seized documents believed to constitute evidence of offences against the Trade Practices Act 1974. The officers took this action pursuant to search&#39; warrants issued by a magistrate under section 10 of the Crimes Act 1914-1973 and the Chief Commissioner of the Australia Police is satisfied that they acted properly in all respects. Prosecution proceedings based in part on evidence obtained by the officers may shortly be instituted. Until prosecutions have been instituted it would be undesirable to table the warrants and thereby identify the persons whose premises were searched. </para>

            <para>- On 9 July 1975, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs a question comparing the conditions of entry of Australian Members of Parliament into Britain, and British Members of Parliament into Australia. The senator referred specifically to his experiences at Heathrow and the treatment accorded to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr John</inline> Stonehouse. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The treatment at the points of entry into each country is in effect identical. Since 1 March 1975, it has been a requirement of the United Kingdom authorities that all passengers passing through immigration control and not being holders of United Kingdom passports complete landing or embarkation cards at the point of entry or departure. Similarly, Australia does not exempt anyone from the requirement to complete incoming and outgoing passenger cards on arrival and departure. Exemptions which Australia has granted to Members of Commonwealth Parliaments who identify themselves as such are exemptions from the need to obtain visas for travel to Australia and entry permits on arrival here. Australian Members of Parliament travelling to Britain on visits need neither entry visas nor entry permits. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Stonehouse</inline> &#39;s treatment in Australia has been in accordance with the foregoing provisions. </para>

            <para>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Science. It refers to imported fruit juice concentrates which are contained in products labelled &#39;pure fruit juice processed daily from crushed fruit&#39; or in similar terms, implying that the contents consist solely of concentrated pure juice of fresh fruit. Will the Minister arrange for the Australian Government Analyst to run such tests as may be necessary to determine whether such products are true to label? </para>

          <quote>
            <para>The laboratories of the Department of Science and Consumer Affairs regularly analyse samples of imported fruit juice concentrate for the Department of Police and Customs. During the past twelve months only one sample was unsatisfactory. It appeared to have been artificially coloured and contained more citric acid than normal. </para>
            <para>I am advised that there are no mandatory standards for imported fruit juice concentrates. It would not be possible to determine by analysis whether fruit had been pressed daily; the presence of preservatives could be detected as could adulteration by the addition of substantial quantities of water. </para>

            <para>Yes. For some time the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Department of the Northern Territory have been negotiating with the Wave Hill Pastoral Company for the transfer to the Gurindji of that portion of Pastoral Lease 529 lying west of the Victoria River, comprising approximately 1250 square miles. This is the land over which the Gurindji have stated they have traditional interests. </para>
            <para>At discussions held in December, the transfer was agreed in principle and detailed negotiations undertaken to enable the transfer of the area west of the Victoria River to be effected on 16 August 1975. Initially the land will be held by the Aborigines under a pastoral lease issued under the Crown Lands Ordinance of the Northern Territory; following passage of the proposed Aboriginal Land (Northern Territory) Act, however, it is intended that the pastoral lease will be surrendered and the Gurindji will be given freehold title to the land in accordance with the recommendations of the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission. </para>
            <para>The Government will be seeking the passage of the Aboriginal Land (Northern Territory) Bill in the Budget session of Parliament; until the proposed Act is passed the land will be subject to the normal provision of a pastoral lease in the Northern Territory. In accordance with the recommendations of the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission, when the land becomes Aboriginal freehold, covenants and conditions will cease to apply. </para>
            <para>The Gurindji have said that they wish to develop the property at their own pace and the Government will consider provision of financial assistance as and when the Gurindji formulate proposals. Funds may be provided by way of either loan or direct grant, under various schemes administered by my Department and the Aboriginal Loans Commission for the development of economic enterprises, special employment projects, housing, community amenities, and other purposes. </para>
