                        <para>- Yesterday the Minister of Defence promised the Senate every information as to the intentions of the Government regarding proposed changes, if any, iu the regulations affecting absent voting. I wish to know whether he will now give the Senate an assurance that any proposed changes will be embodied in a regulation or regulations, and submitted to the Senate before the termination of the present session; and, secondly, that after such regulations have been dealt with here no further regulation concerning absent voting will be adopted until after the meeting of the next Parliament? </para>

                            <para>- I will answer the last question first. It would be obviously impossible to give the desired assurance, because it frequently happens that at quite a late moment the necessity for some other regulation makes itself apparent. I told the Senate, and I want to repeat the statement now, without reservation of any kind, that any important change which the Government contemplates, if it does do so, will be placed before the Senate, so that it can take any action which it may see fit. By that remark I mean this House and this session. </para>

                            <para>- The Senate can only deal with a regulation after it has been laid on the table. That enables an honorable senator to table a notice of motion to disallow the regulation, and give reasons for the disallowance. Do I understand the Minister to mean that he will give us an opportunity by laying any new regulations on the table of the Senate? </para>

                                    - Without any desire to harass the Leader of the Senate, I think that we ought to have a statement more explicit in regard to the suggested regulation. He has told us that before anything is done in the nature of framing a regulation concerning absent voters the Senate will be informed. What I think we ought to know is whether that information will be conveyed in such a way that we can deal with the regulation, and negative it if we think proper to do so?

                        <para>An aspect of the Tariff that has been mooted, and which will be brought before a subsequent meeting, is that of the duty on sugar, which is now &#163;6 per ton on cane-sugar, and &#163;10 per ton on beet-sugar. Whilst determined not to allow &#34;black&#34; grown sugar into the Commonwealth, the question has arisen whether a duty of &#163;5 per ton, instead of &#163;6, will not suffice for such a purpose..... If this is found to be the case, a reduction in the duty of &#163;1 per ton would mean the cheapening of living to the extent of nearly &#163;250,000 a year. . . .

                            <para>- That is the procedure that exists all over Australia today, and has existed for some time. I am not saying whether it is good, bad, or indifferent. Another point raised in yesterday&#39;s discussion was the size and character of the room or cell in which the lad was detained. I am informed that it is a room 9 ft. 3 in. by 9 ft. 3 in., by 9 feet high. I venture to say that many honorable senators have slept on occasion in smaller bedrooms than that. The lad gets one hour&#39;s exercise in the morning, and one in the afternoon. I can give particulars of the diet allowed, and am certain that no complaint can be made of it. Generally speaking, the boy has meat six days a week, oatmeal every day, potatoes and other vegetables every other day, and cheese on four days, with as much bread as he cares to have. </para>

There are two windows in the room in which he is confined, and the door is kept ajar all day and secured by a chain. The windows are not glazed, but covered with wire mesh. </para>

                        <para>It is quite impracticable to furnish this information. The rolls are kept at 1,052 centres throughout Australia, and are being altered from day to day by the addition of many thousands of names, and similarly by the removal of names under the ordinary processes of the Act as the result of transfer and change of enrolment, death, and objection. </para>
                        <para>The law permits any person who desires to do so to inspect the official roll kept by any registrar as altered from day to day at any time during official hours. Instructions have been issued to the registrars to allow any elector, on application, to view the lists of objections lodged. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>It should be understood that names are not being removed from the rolls on the ground of non-residence unless the officers have reason to believe, as the result of official inquiry, that the persons concerned have ceased to have their places of living within the electorate, and have ceased to live therein for a period of not less than one month, and then only after the provisions of the law in regard to the issue of notices have been duly complied with. If, after the posting of a notice of objection, it comes to the knowledge of the Divisional Returning Officer, either as the result of a reply to the objection, or otherwise, that the elector concerned has not in fact ceased to live in the electorate, he (the Divisional Returning Officer) is empowered to dismiss the objection. </para>

                                <para>- The Minister, in replying to my question, has said that the officials are of opinion that the posting of a placard intimating that the rolls now on exhibition are not final would lead to misunderstanding. Seeing that it will be a couple of months before the new rolls are printed, it may be assumed that nearly one-half of the electors of the Commonwealth will inspect the rolls on exhibition during that time, and they will not be in a position to know definitely whether their names will be on the rolls on the day of election or not. I think that some statement of the position should be posted up in the interests of all parties. </para>

I should like to know first of all whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> has placed himself in order. The honorable senator has now voluntarily given replies to questions previously asked. There is a certain stage of our proceedings set apart for notices of motion and questions, and for questions without notice. A certain stage arises when questions asked without notice must cease. Then we come to questions set down on the business-paper. Only questions on notice can then be asked, and those which arise out of the replies given to such questions. </para>

                                <para>- That is so. We -came to-day to the end of the questions on notice, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl,</inline> in courtesy to the Senate and honorable senators who have asked questions previously, volunteers information in reply to those questions. I do not recollect that the honorable senator asked the leave of the Senate to do so, and the questions do not appear on the business-paper. A question of order has already been raised as to whether a further question can now be asked arising out of the answer given to a question by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl.</inline> It is just as if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> was furnishing a statement to the Senate upon a series of matters that had previously arisen. I think the whole procedure is out of order. I do not wish, that any honorable senator should be deprived of information for which he has sought, but I think that in the interests of our own procedure, and of loyalty to our Standing Orders, we should follow some recognised practice. If this kind of thing is to be allowed to continue there is no knowing where it will end. It is significant that one of the papers circulated to honorable senators today is a report from the Standing Orders Committee. </para>

                                <para>- Strictly speaking, the whole procedure initiated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> is out of order. The honorable senator should have given his replies to the questions when notices of motion and questions were called on, at which stage it is permissible to ask questions without previous notice, and receive replies to them. However, I thought I was consulting the convenience of honorable senators in permitting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> to give his replies now to the questions which had been asked. It seemed to me to be a fairly convenient time for him to do so. Having permitted the honorable senator to take that course, I feel that I was equally justified in permitting honorable senators concerned to ask any legitimate questions properly arising out of the answers given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl.</inline> My own opinion is that, if it be confined strictly to that, no inconvenience will arise, whilst it may be conducive to the quick despatch of business. However, if our Standing Orders are to be strictly interpreted, I shall have no . option but to rule the whole proceedings out of order. </para>

                                <para>- May I, sir, be permitted to make a suggestion, through you, to the Vice-President of the Executive Council? I think that the information which is in the possession of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> is information which is not only of value to the Senate, but of interest to the country at large, and I would suggest, therefore, that he should take the usual course of asking leave to make a statement. At the same time, I would suggest to my fellow senators that, if they have any comments to make upon that statement, a convenient time to make them will be on the motion for the adjournment of the Senate. But I do hope that no attempt will be made to block the giving of information for which we are all anxiously looking. </para>

                            <para>The rolls are being reviewed under the ordinary provisions of the Act, and qualified persons and electors concerned are in the same position at present as at any other time since the preparation of the new roll in 1912: I am, &#39;therefore, strongly of opinion (and, I think, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Garran</inline> will concur) that it would be very unwise for the Administration to undertake the responsibility of leaving cards at houses where it is assumed persons qualified for enrolment or transfer are living. Such a course could not be uniformly and effectively followed throughout the Commonwealth, and would, moreover, create a false position, in that it would lead the persons concerned to believe that this duty devolved under the law upon the officers; and that, in the absence of official action, either now or hereafter, qualified persons would be absolved from complying with the requirements of the Act. </para>
                            <para>The officers have been instructed to make claim cards available to the public at all post-offices in the Commonwealth; and Divisional Returning Officers or Commonwealth Electoral Officers are always prepared to meet the requirements of political organizations requiring supplies. Every facility is afforded electors to enable them to secure enrolment, and no elector&#39;s name is removed from a roll at the instance of any person, otherwise than as the result of independent official inquiry, and then, of course, only under the usual statutory conditions. </para>

                    <para>. -  Revised Standing Orders have now been under the consideration of the Standing Orders Committee for three sessions, and, as the result of the work of that Committee, certain alterations have been suggested. I shall be very glad to explain each alteration proposed as it arises, and to give the reasons for it. The Standing Orders Committee have really attempted nothing new. The alterations suggested have been framed to meet difficulties which have already arisen in the Senate, and with a view to the smooth working of our Standing Orders and to facilitating the transaction of business. The first of the proposed amendments might very well be taken together, or they may be put singly, whichever of these courses suits the convenience of this Committee. They really relate to the same thing. Honorable senators &#34;will notice that it is proposed that the word &#34;writ,&#34; which at present appears in standing order number 1, paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g,</inline> shall be eliminated, and that the word &#34; certificate &#34; shall be substituted for it. The reason for this is that our Standing Orders provide that, after an election for this Chamber, the writ, with the certificate of election indorsed thereon, shall be returned to the Senate. Now, the fact is that the writs for Senate elections are issued by the State Governors, and not by any authority of the Commonwealth, and it has frequently happened that the State Governors have insisted upon their right to hold the writs, and have refused to return them to the Senate at all. They claim, and, I think, properly, that all that we are concerned with is to obtain the certificate of the election. The alterations contained in standing orders 1 and 2 are intended to overcome that difficulty, and will, I think, commend themselves to the good sense of the Committee. I might further explain that the amendments are entirely in accord with the Constitution, which provides for a certificate of election and not for the return of the writ. I move - </para>

                        <para>.- The object of this amendment is to bring our Standing Orders into conformity with the rules which govern this matter generally in every Parliament. It will be seen that the standing order can begot over at once if it is the desire of the Senate for a Committee to sit while the Senate is sitting. All that the Committee have to do is to apply for leave, and if leave is granted, it is all right. The general theory is that the duty of a senator is first to the Senate, and that he should not subordinate that duty to any lesser duty unless by leave of the Senate. I move - </para>

Sometimes we may not be sure that the call will reach an honorable senator, when we can be sure that it would reach him by hand. Hitherto there has been no alternative but to send the call through the post, but with this amendment there will be an alternative.

                <para>The purpose of this alteration is to remove any doubt as to when a message is received from the other House relating to a Bill. Last year there were certain honorable gentlemen who were rather nervous as to when certain Bills would be received by the Senate. Probably they had in their minds the test Bills, or the Constitution Alteration Bills. In order  to meet the objections then raised as to the vagueness of the standing order, this alteration is proposed, so that there can be no doubt as to when a Bill is received by the Senate. </para>

                    <para>. - It seems to me that we have not a proper safeguard, either at present or as is proposed, against an interruption. I believe that at any moment the proceedings may be interrupted by the  President  to read a message from the other House, and then the Leader of the Government generally moves that the Bill be read a first time. It would be wise, I think, if an opportunity were afforded to one honorable senator to object to that course if it was desirable that there should be time given. When a Bill is received by message from another place, it is the general custom for the Minister in charge of the Department affected by it to move the first reading immediately. This is generally regarded as a formal motion, but the fact that any honorable senator can call for a division on it shows that some honorable senators may consider it of value to them to have their names recorded as for or against the first reading. I would therefore suggest that as a Bill may come up unexpectedly by message and be read a first time, while some honorable senators are absent, provision should be made in the standing order to make the consideration of the message or the motion for the first reading an Order of the Day for some future time. </para>

Most honorable senators know what legislation is going on in another place, and, therefore, what Bills are likely to come up to this Chamber. It has been the invariable practice in all Parliaments to regard the first reading as formal, and even if a member were inadvertently&#39; absent his chances of criticising the Bill would not be seriously interfered with, because he could speak and vote on the second reading, committee stage, adoption of report, and third reading. </para>

It is intended, as soon as these amendments have been finally dealt with and adopted by the Senate, to have fresh reprints embodying all the amendments that have been made upon the Standing Orders, and avoiding interleafing and erasures. I hope that it will be some time before our Standing Orders will require further amendment. </para>

                <para class="block">It will be remembered by honorable senators that this Select Committee was appointed to inquire into the Teesdale Smith contract. The Committee has held two meetings. The usual application was made to the Department concerned for the papers and documents relating to this contract. It was ascertained by the secretary of the Select Committee that the best officer to summon for the purpose would.be <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Munro</inline> of the Railways Branch of the Home Affairs Department. The Home Affairs Department was communicated with, the suggestion was confirmed, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Munro</inline> was summoned to attend the Committee and furnish the papers and documents required. I understand that he was also communicated with by the secretary to the Committee, and intimated that the intention of the Department was to send the originals of documents with certified copies, which after inspection of the originals the members of the Committee might keep. When this officer came before the Committee in answer to the summons of the secretary he replied to a few questions, but when asked if he had brought the papers with him he said that they were in the custody of the Minister. He could give the Committee no further information. The Committee decided that as this obstacle was placed in the way of the inquiry it was of very little use for it to continue its work. When this motion was given notice of the Minister of Defence made an interjection to the effect that there was some misunderstanding. I believe that the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs has also this morning made a statement of a similar character. It must be admitted that owing to the complicated condition of some of the Government Departments, and to the Ministers supposed to be assisting the Minister of Home Affairs, it is very difficult for the secretary to the Select Committee to be absolutely certain to whom he should address communications. Without some clear understanding on the subject, if he addressed a communication to the Assistant Minister of </para>
                <para class="block">Home Affairs he might be informed by that honorable gentleman that although he was prepared to give evidence the papers asked for were in the custody of the Minister. The Minister might say that they were in the custody of the Vice-President of the Executive Council. If we are not to be treated in a straightforward manner it is better that we should discontinue the inquiry, but if a satisfactory explanation can be given, seeing that we have carried a motion asking the House of Representatives to grant leave to the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs to come before the Select Committee if he wishes, and that through him it will be possible to get the papers and documents called for, the course of action I should like to take, with the consent of the Senate, would be to withdraw the special report of the Select Committee and go on with the inquiry. </para>

                        <para>. - As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has intimated, when this matter was mentioned yesterday, I interjected that there was some misapprehension. I think it is possible to clear it up in a way that will be satisfactory to every member of the Senate. The honorable senator has quite correctly stated that the secretary of the Select Committee, or probably the members of the Committee themselves, having formed a conclusion that a particular officer of the Department was the one most familiar with the matters about which they desired to inquire, not only summoned him to appear before the Committee, but also summoned him to produce certain papers. When he presented himself, as he did in obedience to the summons, he intimated quite correctly that the papers were not in his charge, but were in the charge of the Minister. </para>

                            <para>- What the officer in question did I do not know, but if he led the secretary to the Select Committee to believe that it was within his competency to take papers out of the Department he did what was wrong. I think the Senate will see at once that an officer of the Department, who may be even a junior, has certainly no warrant for walking away with papers which are not within his custody. Somebody must be held responsible for the control of papers in a Department. When a Committee of the Senate has desired the attendance of a particular officer, the procedure that has usually been adopted - a procedure with which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie will be familiar - has been to summon him, and for him to respond to the summons. When papers have been required, the notification that those papers were required has been sent to the official head of the Department. </para>

                            <para>- The Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook.</inline> But my honorable friend need not suppose that any advantage will be taken of any uncertainty in his mind as to who is the head of that Department. I give him my assurance that if a request is made by the Committee, either to the Minister or Assistant Minister of Home Affairs, for the. production of papers, it will be honored. But it would be impossible to entertain for a moment the idea that an officer of that Department is free to walk out of it with any papers that he may think fit. In the present case, what happened was that the Select Committee - breaking away from the recognised practice, a practice which was followed in the case of the Chinn Committee - instead of summoning the officer separately, and then forwarding a notification to the Minister that certain papers were wanted, sent a notification to the officer - who is certainly not a junior, although he is not a senior officer - calling upon him to produce papers which were not in his custody. I would point out at once that the only reason why the Committee&#39;s request was not productive of the desired result was because that request was not submitted in the usual way. When I say that, I do not wish it to be understood that there is any matter of thin dignity involved. There is not. But when papers are sought from a public Department, the proper method to pursue is to send a request for their production to the Minister in charge of that Department. </para>

                            <para>- Fortunately the honorable senator has not the decision of the matter. The behaviour of the Government was not as straightforward and honest in the case of the Chinn Select Committee as it should have been when papers were called for, and I have a suspicion that the excuse which is now put forward in connexion with the Teesdale Smith Contract Select Committee is a mere afterthought. When the Chinn Committee requested the production of certain . papers, its members were told that those papers were required in the Department. That was a ridiculous statement, because, obviously, the Department had no business with them at that time. Their production was refused, and I can quite appreciate the feeling of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> &#39; when the Committee, of which he is  Chairman,  met with a similar refusal, because whatever may be said to the contrary, undoubtedly it was a refusal. If, by a mere oversight the Committee applied to the wrong party for the production of those papers, why was not the information conveyed to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> at once? Why was not the officer who was summoned able to say that the application should have gone through another channel? But no information of the kind was vouchsafed to the Committee beyond : the bald statement by the officer that he had not the papers in his custody. The time has arrived when the Senate should put a stop to this sort of thing. When the Chinn Select Committee was refused the production of papers for which it had a right to ask, and when the Government declined to provide funds to allow it to pursue its inquiries, a very dangerous precedent was created, and one which will not soon be forgotten in a free country like Australia. It was a scandalous procedure, seeing that the professional reputation of a man was at stake. </para>

                            <para>- I will not. dispute your ruling, sir, but I am sorry that YOU did not allow me a little more latitude. Had I been permitted a little&#39; more scope, I think I could have shown up the action of the Government in connexion with Select Committees appointed by this Senate in a very bad light indeed. As far as the Teesdale Smith Contract Select Committee is concerned, I have very grave doubts as to whether it will get the papers for which it asks. I think we shall find that many of those papers will be mutilated or presented in such a form that they will be of very little value indeed. As for getting at the truth while the present Government are in power, I have very little hope of that. </para>

I hope that the Committee will receive better treatment than was accorded to the Chinn Select Committee, but I very much question whether it will obtain the papers which it is seeking. It will probably be found that quite a number of those papers will be missing or mutilated or presented to it in some form in which they will be of very little value. </para>

If a mistake has been&#39; made by the Select Committee, it was a technical mistake and one which, if the Department of Home Affairs had exhibited any discretion or courtesy, would have been corrected long ago, in which case this special report would not have been presented. In future I hope that the Committee and the officers who are assisting it, will be so particular that there will be no possibility of any mistake of that description occurring again. In these circumstances I ask leave to withdraw the motion.
