                        <para>With regard to the accuracy or otherwise of the survey of the north-west coast of Western Australia, it is known that there must be large errors in the position of parts of the coastline of Australia, and any map issued can only supply the best information available at the date of issue. The trigonometrical survey of New South Wales disclosed errors as great as eight miles in the&#39; position of the coast-line, and it is understood that this is one of the reasons which actuated the Surveyors-General of Australia to recommend the carrying out of a geodetic survey of the coast-line. The question of the expediency of conducting such a. survey will, no doubt, be given careful consideration in the near future. </para>

                            <para>- I should like to preface my remarks by stating that, in the course of this inquiry, which created a considerable measure of interest, a number of exhibits were tendered to the Court. These are not included in the report itself, but have been placed on the Library, table for the use and information of honorable members who care to examine them. The seriousness of the matters referred to in the report, and the very general interest which it may be anticipated will be aroused by its publication, render it desirable that, -at the earliest possible moment, a statement should be made as to the action it is intended to take consequent upon the recent inquiry. Certain individuals being concerned, and certain matters calling for further inquiry, it might, perhaps, be regarded as more in conformity with official routine if I refrained from speaking until finality had been reached. Had the circumstances been other than they are, I should have adopted that course; but it must be remembered that we are dealing with a Citizen Army, and that&#39; the incidents of the Liverpool Camp concern, not only those who were present, but every member of the Citizen Force, and&#39; the many homes from which they are drawn No system or organization . can be made absolutely blunder-proof, nor is it always possible to ward off unpleasant consequences from those in no way responsible for the errors from which those consequences proceed.. But it is both possible and desirable to make it clear that these errors will not be regarded with indifference, but that, on the contrary, every effort will be made to prevent their repetition; and that, while the defence system . claims&#39; service from its young, citizens, it will be so administered as to insure a. ready, and sympathetic consideration of any well-founded complaints. The matters dealt with in the report can be placed under the following . four headings : -- (l),The action. of certain officers. </para>

                    </list>
                    <para>With regard to (1) it is only necessary to say that each officer concerned has been furnished with a copy of the report, and, upon receipt of any representations they may make, the several cases will be further considered. With regard to (2), a system of secret reports by which officers may be unjustly condemned and their whole military future blighted without the slightest opportunity for offering a word in their own defence, is so repugnant to any. conception of fair play that, apart from the disheartening effect such a system must have upon the Army, it is difficult to understand how its introduction was ever approved. The dangerous possibilities of this system were the more pronounced as, at the time of its adoption, the Inspector-General to whom the reports were forwarded was President of the Promotion Board. It is no exaggeration to say that  a  feeling of indignation and perturbation is very general among the large body of citizen officers as a result of the disclosures regarding these reports. I have decided that in future any individual adversely affected by a report shall be informed of its contents so far as they concern him, and be thus afforded opportunity for reply thereto. I believe this decision will receive general indorsement. Consequent on the reports which gained currency at the time of the Liverpool Camp a considerable measure of reproach has attached to the 14th Regiment. The inquiry proves this reproach to be unmerited, and this cannot too soon be officially announced. I have quite independent information confirming the statement in the report that &#34; a feeling of resentment and injustice &#34; has been generated both among the members of the 14th Regiment and throughout the districts from which its members are drawn. I sincerely hope one effect of this inquiry, and the action following upon it, will be to allay that feeling, and cause it to . give place to a loyal determination to respond to the efforts being made to relieve it of the heavy disabilities under which it has laboured. With regard to those matters which I have already referred to as  &#39; weaknesses and faults of administration,&#34; I only desire to say that these are now under consideration, and I anticipate being able, at no very distant date, to make a further statement in reference thereto. &#39; </para>

                                <para>- Then &#39;I am incorrectly informed by my responsible advisers. I am told that the. practice is that where a confidential report is made by a State Commandant or superior officer, and it reflects upon a junior officer, or upon an officer under . his command, that portion of the document is read over to him, and he therefore has an opportunity of putting his side of the case forward. The confidential reports to which I referred in connexion with the Inspector-General&#39;s office were more in the sense that an officer reported on had no knowledge that such a report was in existence. </para>

                            <para>- I am not quite clear as to how the Minister has answered my question. I do not understand the answer, and I hope that he does. About a fortnight ago a copy of an award by the  President  of the Arbitration Court in the linesmen&#39;s case was laid on the table of the Senate, and it provides that the award is to apply to the members of the claimant association. I desire to know if it is the intention of the Government to make the award payable to nonmembers of the association; and. if so, will it take the responsibility of seeing that nonmembers pay their fair proportion of the costs of such action ? </para>

He has referred to two of them now. The answer to his question is that the Government does not propose to discriminate in paying the wages under the award. </para>

                            <para>. - After the startling statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> during our last sitting, I thought the Honorary Minister would have come forward with a reply on behalf of the Government. Apparently the promises made by the members of the so-called Liberal party, when seeking the votes of the electors, are one thing, whilst their actions in Parliament are something very different. I have a vivid&#39; recollection of some of the cries raised at the last Federal elections. The people were told that the Labour party were responsible for the high, cost of living in Australia, and for the burden of taxation which pressed so heavily on the shoulders of its people. So far, no attempt has been made by the Government to carry out their promises to the electors to reduce the cost of living, and to remove the burden of taxation. We sometimes wonder how they can claim to be the great Liberal party of Australia. Is it because they are liberal to the people as a whole and liberal in the views they bold, or because they are liberal to themselves and to a particular section of the people? When we consider their deeds during the last twelve months in which they have held office, we are forced to conclude that they are indeed liberal to those who arc within the pale of the so-called Liberal party; but it cannot be claimed for them that they are liberal to any one outside that party. I noticed an advertisement recently published in the press calling for applications for the position of matron of the Port Darwin hospital in the Northern Territory. For this important position the so-called Liberal Government offered the princely salary of &#163;90 per annum. That is the remuneration they proposed for a woman who must have devoted years to the study of ner profession before she would be entitled to take up such a position. When the Government are prepared to treat women in that way, it is surprising to find that they are still supported by the Women&#39;s National League. They are prepared to give a salary of &#163;1,S00 per annum to the Chief Engineer of Commonwealth Railways, who is probably one of their own party, but they are not prepared to give more than &#163;90 per annum to a woman who is asked to fill an important position in the Northern Territory, where, we are informed, the conditions of life are bad and the cost of living is high. The electors were told that the Labour party were responsible for the high cost of living in 1913, and if that be so, I want to ask the members of the Government present, or their supporters, to say who is responsible for the high cost of living at the present time. If the Labour party were responsible in 1913, I claim that the present Government must be held responsible for the high cost of living in 1914. Honorable senators opposite cannot contend that the cost of living is lower to-day than it was in 1913, and that being so, I should like to know what legislation the Government have submitted, or are prepared to submit, to this Parliament, to reduce the cost of living. I see no mention in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech of any measure likely to have that effect. I have carefully read the various speeches made by Ministers - and they have made  a  great many at week-end meetings - but I have seen no mention in them of any legislation to reduce the cost of living. They have from time to time said, &#34; There is a Senate that refuses to pass any measures submitted by us.&#34; So far, no measure to reduce the cost of living has come before the Senate. The Government claim in another place to have a majority of one, and so are in a position to carry through that House any legislation they please, and have it sent on to the Senate. If they send to the Senate any legislation calculated to reduce the present high cost of living in Australia, it will receive the support of honorable senators on this side. Though the Government have offered only &#163;90 per annum for the position of matron of the hospital at Port Darwin, Ministers claim that they are treating the public servants throughout the States more liberally than did the Labour Government. The other day the Minister of Defence read in this Chamber a letter from some person whose name he refused to give. The honorable senator then introduced the custom of reading here letters written by persons who apparently are afraid or ashamed to sign their names to what they have written. I intend to read a letter, and I am prepared to give the name of the writer.  I  shall leave honorable senators to judge, after they have heard the letter read, whether the Government are treating the employes of the Commonwealth as white men working for an employer should be treated. I quote the following letter by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. 0.</inline> L. Gray, from the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of 27th April, 1914, on the subject of the treatment of men employed on the transcontinental railway: - </para>

                        <quote>
                            <para>In reference to the transcontinental railway, it is about time that the public knew some of the facts. It is said that day labour is proving itself a failure, but the position is that the day labour system is being deliberately strangled by the Government. At the Port Augusta end of the line, so far as conditions are concerned, absolute chaos exists. Private enterprise in the matter of stores has &#34; fallen down &#34; completely, and the workmen are living under the most deplorable conditions. </para>
                        </quote>
                        <para class="block">That is under the so-called Liberal Government. </para>
                        <para>One gang of over 40 men were left without bread or groceries for nearly ten days, and this out in a waterless wilderness, 83 miles from the nearest town. All along the line, in a greater or in a lesser degree, the same complaints are made. The men are suffering from hunger and privation, and large numbers are continually leaving for this cause. Repeated promises have been made that departmental stores would be improved, but conditions are, if anything, worse now than at any time since the line started. One storekeeper has a monopoly of the trade, and it is a matter of public gossip in Port Augusta that certain officials have a financial interest in the present arrangements. Whatever the cause may be, the results arc enough to ruin any enterprise, whether contract or otherwise. During the past few weeks a large number of new employes have been put on. With the usual blundering shortsightedness, that draws high salaries on this job, no tents or tent poles were available, and nearly 100 men are now living like dingoes under the shelter of the scanty saltbush, or coiled up in concrete pipes and other places to escape the elements. Some of these men have been sleeping on the ground and without tents for over three weeks, waiting for the Department to unwind its red tape. Just before the holidays the riding ganger at the head of the road sent for 60 men. When the men got on the works it was discovered that there were no shovels for them, and many of them had to tramp off the job. Some of the men were charged for riding back on the construction train to Port Augusta. For the convenience of the men and the protection of tradesmen and boardinghouse-keepers procuration orders were allowed right from the start of the job. Now, however, some four-guinea clerk has put his foot on the system, and large numbers of men without funds and without credit have been compelled to leave the works. Cash &#34; subs.&#34; are issued on occasion, when the timekeeper &#34; has time &#34; . and sufficient civility, but the men to- whom they are issued must cash them themselves, and in Port Augusta. A man on formation work was without funds, and worked for three days without food, or with such scraps or sufferance meals as he could get. He then drew a &#34; sub.&#34; to pay for his meals. As the &#34; sub.&#34; was only cashable in Port Augusta, and by himself, he lost three days&#39; work to get to the office and return, and was charged 5s.10d. by the Department for the return journey by the construction train. </para>
                        <para>The late Government gave the employes in Port Augusta free firewood, but now the order has gone forth that only &#34; the staff &#34; are to receive it. </para>
                        <para class="block">Here, again, is clear proof that the so-called Liberal party, who at the last elections declaimed so strongly against the doctrine of spoils to the victors, are prepared to give spoils to their supporters, and to their supporters only. The writer of this letter continues - </para>
                        <para>This represents a reduction in wages, but it applies only to the underpaid men at the bottom; the high-priced officials are still to get &#62; their wood free. These items, selected almost at random from a multitude of similar nature, are given as illustrations. A deliberate attempt is being made to goad the employe into reprisals and to strangle the day-labour system. This, at any rate, is my conviction. - Yours, &#38;c, </para>

                        <para>As I remarked previously, the author of that letter was not ashamed to append his signature to it, and consequently it should carry a good deal more weight than should the letter which was written to the Minister of Defence by a person who is evidently ashamed to allow his name to be mentioned in this Senate. So far as the trouble at the western end of the transcontinental railway is concerned, I do not intend at this stage to refer to it, beyond saying that I know negotiations are proceeding with a view to its settlement. In the circumstances I consider that I shall be acting wisely by refraining from discussing that strike, which we all hope will ere long be terminated, so that construction work at that end of the line may be resumed. Looking through the public press during the past few weeks, I have been particularly interested in the pre-election Senate ballot which has been conducted by the Liberal party. I have been specially impressed by the fact that amongst the candidates nominated for that pre-election was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Packer,</inline> who was at one time secretary of the Independent Workers Union. He was one of the gentlemen who was instrumental in the establishment of that organization - an organization which was undoubtedly formed for the purpose of strike breaking whenever it suited the employers to break strikes. It is well known that when there was a probability of a strike amongst the tramway employe&#39;s at Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Packer</inline> wrote to the directors of the Tramway Company, offering, in the event of trouble, to supply men to take the places of the strikers. It will be seen, therefore, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. &#34;Packer&#39;s</inline> organization was intended to be used for the purpose of strike breaking. But when a Labour Government were in office it was&#39; also designed to be a strike making union. Whenever it was considered that it would be favorable to the so-called Liberal party that a strike should occur in any part of the Commonwealth, this Independent Workers Union was to be the body which was to foment industrial trouble, and to prevent the wheels of industry from turning. It will be remembered that just before the last elections a strike took place at Port Darwin, and from information which I have received I am perfectly satisfied that that strike was organized and brought about by the members of this very union. In support of my statement, I propose to quote from a letter by a gentleman in the Northern Territory, who takes a keen interest in the affairs of that province of the Commonwealth. He deals, not only with the action of the Packer crowd in- initiating that strike for the purpose of assisting the so-called Liberal party, but he also deals with the fact- that the present Government have adopted the principle of spoils to the victors by seizing every opportunity to displace from employment those who are suspected of a desire to assist the Labour party. This gentleman says- - </para>

                            <para>Do nothing, <inline font-style="italic">laissez faire</inline> is the policy of the Ministry, either to pave the way for a coolie invasion or to render it impossible for officials with progressive views to carry on, and thus thwart the Labour policy of development. The crowd of so-called unionists who fought for the destruction of the Labour party in May last deserve no sympathy. But Australia, that has to bear the burden of an undeveloped north, is to be pitied. However, the blood is on- the heads and hands: of those electors, who voted&#39; for the present Cook- Kelly gang,, and of those self-styled unionists who fought their brethren at that time and were consoling themselves by cowardly and lying attacks of a general nature on the officials,- many of whom are the staunchest adherents of the workers&#39; cause in these wild, parts of the Australian domain.. Now things are settled down in Darwin. Packer&#39;s satellites left when they found the game was up, the bogus union was disbanded; and those workers who were most loud in &#39;their revolutionary tactics when Labour, was -in- power are now most abject in their crawl to private employees. Unfortunately for the progress of the&#39; Labour&#39; movement, too many workers will bluster&#34; and threaten when Labour- sways, the land, but when capitalism gets on top they areas meek as lambs. Were it not for this Labour would never be beaten. The Northern Territory has lost much, by the Darwin&#39; &#34; Packer Union&#39;&#34; strike, more by the change of. Government, The only people who have lost nothing ore the officials. Their salaries are untouched. </para>

                            <para>The reason for this is apparent. It is. the  avowed intention of the Government to treat all1 the&#39; officials&#39; with Labour views: as.- they treated Chinn, and to put good <inline font-style="italic">laissez faire</inline> Liberals in their places.

                                <para>- I admit that that is so, but there is a proper method of gaining the desired information in reference to it, and I think that the party with which I am associated is proceeding upon right lines to get all the information which the country should have on such an important question. So far, although many charges have been levelled against the Government, no real defence of their action has been put forward, with the exception of that urged by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> who adopted a more manly stand than did either the Prime Minister or the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs. The Minister of Defence stated that he was prepared to accept full responsibility for the letting of that contract. But unfortunately he is not the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs. Had he occupied that office I feel sure there would have been a Ministerial vacancy in the Department, because I do not believe that he would be a party, to doing what the Prime Minister and his lieutenant, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. -Kelly,</inline> have done, namely, attempt to shield themselves behind departmental officers. When anything is done in a Department to which blame is attachable, they tell us that their officials are responsible. Are they prepared to  say that- when anything good is done by the Department their officials are entitled to the whole credit? Oh, no. If credit is due to anybody they take the whole of it to themselves, but if any blame is to be apportioned it must be apportioned to the officials. . Now, the officers of the Department, are; not members of this Parliament; They have not been placed in their positions-, by the- electors, nor have the. electors any- power to remove them. The . officials- are responsible to the Government, who are their masters, and the Government must accept responsibility for any mistakes made by them, otherwise responsible government, in my opinion, becomes a thing of the past. On various occasions in this chamber the question of contract <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> day labour has been discussed. From evidence that has been gathered from all parts of the civilized world, it has been conclusively proved that not merely railway construction, but all great national works, can be carried out cheaper and b&#39;etter under the day-labour system than they can be under the contract system. About two years ago a debate upon this subject was initiated in the Senate by members of the then Opposition, who are to-day supporters of the Government, and on that occasion two questions principally were dealt with. One was the question of  undergrounding  telephone wires, and the other the building of Commonwealth offices. The then Minister of Home Affairs called for reports from the officials, and these were submitted to Parliament. It was generally admitted, not only by members, but by the general public, that it had been demonstrated beyond the shadow of a doubt that the works were carried out better and cheaper under the day-labour system than under the contract system. The Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of the 8th August, 1912, published the following in its leading columns: -  </para>

                            <para>It may be too much to say that these reports of responsible officers are the last word in the controversy between contract labour and day labour; but at least they show two things very essential to present circumstances. The first is that, provided supervision over manual workers as good as that maintained by contractors can be exercised by the State, the argument is all in favour of eliminating the contractor as a parasite and expensive middleman. The second is that in the present series of charges against &#34; the man on the job,&#34; against his gangers, overseers, inspectors, architects, and Ministerial heads, the allegations have been built up on, hearsay and gutter gossip, having political animosity for their root and origin. </para>
                            <para>I want honorable senators to mark those words uttered by the leading newspaper of Victoria, showing how the great so-called Liberal party of Australia had built up their charges. The words- are&#39; severe; but absolutely true: We regretted very much that the present Government found -it necessary to cancel the sleeper1 contract&#39; with the Western Australian Government, but are still in th&#39;e dark as to why they did it. They cannot say there was a scarcity of sleepers, because there is a large supply now at both ends of the line. They cannot say that any evidence has been advanced to show that the powellising process has not proved a success, because all the evidence obtained so far goes to prove that powellised timber will stand the ravages of white ants and dry-rot better than unpowellised, no matter what class of timber it may be. </para>

                                <para>- It was given by those who are not experts in timber. Those who ought to, and do, know something about timber have been unanimous in their evidence that the powellised karri sleeper was absolutely the best that could be used for railway purposes. I shall quote a few reports from those who have had something to do with the powellising process. The Government are making a great mistake in placing on the trans- Australian line any sleepers but powellised, whether karri or jarrah, because both, if untreated, are liable to be attacked by dry-rot or white ants. The powellising process was first gone into thoroughly in Western Australia by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Julius,</inline> the well-known timber expert. He described it as follows: - </para>
                            </talk.start>
                        </continue>
                        <para>The process, as briefly described hereafter; consists in replacing the sap in the green timber by sugar, with a small percentage of arsenic added if the timber is: to be rendered immune to attacks from white ants. (Timber so treated is claimed to be free from all risks of developing dry-rot, and that such is the case was briefly deduced from the recent tests of Western Australian timbers.) </para>
                        <para>He tested different timbers with the process, although he had only a primitive and temporary plant, and his report of&#39; these tests was - </para>
                        <para>Two karri sleepers that had been in service in a damp position for nineteen years showed many signs of dry-rot, yet still retained their hold upon the  dogspikes  to a degree quite sufficient to render them safe in the. road. </para>
                        <para>We know that most timbers have a tendency to shrink away from the dogspikes, and require to be continually watched. It is a point in favour of the karri timber that it does not shrink: away from the  dogspikes. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Julius</inline> further said - </para>
                        <para>Karri, whilst, in every other respect&#39; almost unequalled as - a sleeper timber, is prone to develop dry -rot ii used in damp ground. In regard to the development of dry-rot, it is established that the&#39; presence of the sap is the chief source of trouble . . . and such a process as now being experimented upon as promises not only to render the timber practically immune to dry-rot, but also to attacks from white ants, and should this prove successful . . . there is no doubt that karri will prove one of the most valuable timbers in the world. Karri is a most suitable timber for use as railway sleepers, as it holds the  dogspikes  firmly, no  reboring  being necessary; and the detrimental influences of dry-rot and white ants being removed by the powellising treatment, karri may be considered as the sleeper timber par excellence. </para>

                            <para>I find that the untreated karri is affected by dry-rot. These timber diseases seem to have travelled in a certain direction, as on one side and the end are the parts most affected. I found in many places along the side that the apparently affected area extends to a depth of |th of an inch. At these places the fibres in the karri had almost disappeared, having given place to a granular and friable mass, which could be readily removed with the finger-nail. It is impossible to say whether the rot has penetrated deeper. I have examined the powellised karri sleeper and find it free from the above disease. </para>

Is it because there happens to be a Labour Government in office in Western Australia, and they desire to injure it ? I would remind them that if they injure a Labour Government in that State, they injure the whole people of the State, because the whole of the people of Western Australia are shareholders in the Government mills erected to supply the sleepers for the trans-Australian railway. </para>

There is other evidence which leads us to believe that party bias alone caused them to cancel the contract. Two years ago <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hedges,</inline> when member for Fremantle, moved what was practically a no-confidence motion in another place because the Government were going to use powellised karri sleepers; but when he asked the people of Fremantle to re-elect him he lost his seat. Not being satisfied, he still desired to do something to damn the karri sleeper or to assist the Timber Combine, which, unfortunately, has control of nearly all the jarrah timber in the West. In 1906 a shed was erected on the Claremont show-ground, and twelve powellised Oregon timber posts and four unpowellised were used. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hedges,</inline> in his desire to secure evidence against the process, and, if possible, to poison the minds of the people against powellised karri, fossicked round the show-ground, found a piece of timber that had been attacked by white ants, gathered the remnants into a dish, and took them along to St. George&#39;s Terrace. When the Minister of Works in Western Australia heard of this, he caused a complete investigation to be made, and received several letters. One of these was written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> M. Ferguson, the contractor for the erection of the shed, to the Powellising Company. He said - </para>

                            <para>Referring to the building on the Claremont Show Ground erected by J. M. Ferguson Ltd., in 1906 - I remember deciding that we would use powellised Oregon uprights in the erection of the building. Twelve pieces of Oregon were handed to your men t&#39;o be powellised at once - my recollection of the matter is that these were put in the boiling tank on the top of a quantity of smaller timber, four more pieces of Oregon were required, but there was not time to wait for another boiling of the Powell process, and. these were treated with  Avenarius,  as Ferguson Ltd. were agents for this preparation. The whole of the erection of the building on the Show Ground Was done in a hurry, and I should not be surprised to learn that the powellising had been imperfectly done. </para>

                            apparently was not perfectly satisfied, and he thought it was probable that the powellising treatment had not been complete with respect to these timbers. But it will be found that, as regards the powellised timbers, the treatment was entirely successful. I have also a letter from

                            <para>I have much pleasure in confirming my conversation with you some days ago re the Oregon posts used by j. M. Ferguson Ltd. in the erection of the building on Claremont Show Ground in October, 190G. I remember clearly that it was intended that all the posts for the building were intended to be treated by the Powell process, but owing to the short time available to complete the building before the Show, it was impossible to put them all through the process. I remember distinctly that four of the posts could not be powellised, and, acting under instructions from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> M. Ferguson, I had the four posts coated with Avenarius before they were sent to the Show Ground. I was pt that time employed by J. M. Ferguson as yard foreman, and it was my work to see to the despatch of all orders, and consequently the despatch and particulars - of these posts came directly under my notice. I am prepared at any time to swear to the above statement. </para>

                                oregon posts in building Show Ground erected by J. M. Ferguson in October, 1900. I have pleasure in stating that I have thoroughly examined said posts and find as follows : - There are sixteen posts in said building and they go down about 3 feet 9 inches in the ground. I had all of these uncovered down to the bottom, and therefore was able to thoroughly examine same. Twelve of these posts were treated by the Powell wood process, and four were not put through said process. I found that the twelve posts that had been powellised were perfectly sound in every respect; there was no sign cf white ants or&#39; dry-rot; in fact, practically as good as the day they were put into the ground, whereas the other four posts were all badly attacked by white ants and dry-rot, one of same having been entirely eaten away underground.

                        <para class="block">These reports clearly disprove the statement that in different parts of Western Australia powellised timber has been attacked by white ants or dry-rot. They have tried powellised timbers, not only ia the south-west, but also in the northwest, and all the evidence adduced by those who know anything about the matter has demonstrated beyond the shadow of a doubt that such timbers will withstand either of these diseases. I had intended to quote some reports in connexion; with powellised karri timber that had been used in the north-west of Western Australia, but I will not weary the Senate. It is sufficient for me to state that, by its use in the construction or shearing sheds and hotels in Port Headland and other places in the north-west, it has been proved that powellised karri has for many years stood the ravages of white ants&#39; and dry-rot. I desire now to refer to a report which has been received from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. R.</inline> F. Trout, Imperial Forest Economist in India. He says - </para>

                            <para>Another untreated piece was recently placed with the powellised piece and is being rapidly destroyed. Similar tests in other parts of India confirm these results. A large number of powellised and untreated pieces of different Indian woods are now being laid down, but it will be some time before any results can be arrived at. Sleepers of various kinds of woods are also being tested on the railway in Burma. Messrs. McEenzie and Co., Bombay, in 1906, carried out tests on powellised wood to ascertain if it loses its antiseptic properties if exposed to the weather. Planks of Poon and Mango were subjected for four nights and days to steam forced on them by an exhaust pipe, then a stream of water was directed on them for four days, and then the wood was subjected to alternate rain and sunshine in the monsoon, and was finally cut up and placed in white ants&#39; nests in three different places along with untreated wood of the same species. The untreated pieces were quickly destroyed, while the powellised pieces remained untouched. </para>

                        <para class="block">In the face of all this evidence. I am quite satisfied that the Government will have to find a different plea for the cancellation of the sleeper contract, because the powellising process has been proved to be a success, not only in different parts of Australia, but apparently in different parts of the world. This, I remind honorable senators, is not a question that affects Western Australia alone, because any process that will have the effect of making room for the population that is much needed in this country, if we desire to adequately defend ourselves from foreign attack, will be beneficial, not merely to one State, but to the nation as a whole. The Scaddan Government desired to open up some of what is admittedly the best land in the whole of the Commonwealth for the purposes of closer settlement. It is a well-known fact that karri will not grow on any but the best country, and it was some of the best country in Western Australia that the Labour Government desired to open up by the establishment of mills and the supplying of sleepers for the transcontinental railway. I have not the slightest doubt but that in the long run the State will not be a loser, because karri is not only suitable for railway sleepers, but is undoubtedly the best timber that can be obtained for the building of waggons and coaches, and so on. It has been in use for a number of years, and as it gets better known throughout the Commonwealth, I am confident that it will be more used in coach and waggon building than any other timber that is used at present. </para>

                                <para>- I am surprised at the representatives or Victoria not putting up a better fight for the use of powellised timber, seeing that in this State there is a large quantity of very inferior timber, which requires to undergo some treatment before it is suitable for railway sleepers. It may be suitable for use in this city, because the smoke and the fog of Melbourne may powellise the wood sufficiently to prevent an attack by white ants, or anything else. But in any other part of the world I am afraid that it would not be a success unless it had undergone some treatment. I wish to refer briefly to the so-called test Bills which are mentioned in the opening Speech. The first one relates to preference to unionists. I take it that we shall have an opportunity of discussing the principle should the Bill come before the Senate during the session. So far as this party is concerned, I am quite satisfied&#34; that the time is opportune for a double dissolution. I believe that if this Parliament went to the country at the present time, not only would the Labour party come back with an increased majority in the Senate, but it would return with an increased majority in the other House. </para>

                                <para>- The reason why the people of the Colonies entered into Federation was because they recognised that the smaller States would be equally represented in the Upper House of the Parliament. If the present Government, carrying out their idea, should bring about a double dissolution on two insignificant Bills, what will it mean ? It will mean that the people of Australia when they entered into Federation were gulled. It will mean the absolute breaking down of our Federal system. If the Governor-General were to grant a double dissolution on two such insignificant measures, I for one should be prepared to advocate the abolition of the Senate, because I believe it would be rendered absolutely useless. A question was submitted to-day by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> to the Minister of Defence which has an important bearing on one of the so-called test Bills. The honorable senator wished to know whether the Government proposed to charge non-unionists in the Public Service concerned in the award of the Arbitration Court in the linemen&#39;s case with their share of the cost of securing that award, or proposed themselves to pay the cost of securing it. The non-unionists are apparently to be given the same wages as unionists under the award of the Court. The unionists are to be called upon to pay the whole of the costs of securing the award in addition to the expense in which they have been involved in building up their union. According to the present Government, the non-unionist, or the &#34;scab,&#34; to give him his proper name, is to be given the right to come in and receive the same wages as the unionist, although he has contributed nothing to the expense of bringing about the betterment of his conditions. The Labour party have for twenty years been doing their best to bring about industrial peace. No one recognises more fully than do the members of that party the disastrous effects of strikes in different parts of the Commonwealth. No one realizes more keenly that it is the workers., the wealth producers of the country, who have at all times been the losers when industrial strikes have taken place. Although the pioneers of the Labour movement have built up the industrial tribunals which have made it possible to keep the wheels of industry continually turning, apparently the protection of those tribunals is to be withdrawn from them. If the present Government take from the pioneers of the Labour movement the protection they have earned and deserved, I for one will be prepared to go upon the platform and say that arbitration has failed, and that we must return to the old method of the strike. If we should do so I am prepared to say that the workers will have more to gain by it- than the employers. I should like the members of the present Government, or their supporters, to put forward one logical reason why the men who have devoted so much of their time and money to the building up of industrial tribunals should not be protected and put upon an equal footing with those who have not had the manliness or the courage to join a union or to organize their fellow workers in the different industries of the Commonwealth. Honorable senators opposite do not understand what it means to a man to have to go to his boss morning after morning to beg of him the opportunity to work in order that he may earn sufficient to keep himself and his family. Apparently all that troubles honorable senators on the other side is how much dividend the workers can earn for them. I advise them to be very careful before going further in their efforts to break up trade unionism in this country. I advise them also to be very careful about further assisting their &#34; scab &#34; organization, the Independent Workers Union, or, as I understand it is now called, the Liberal Workers Union of Australia. When this test Bill comes before the Senate I hope that we. shall waste no time in discussing it. It attacks a very important principle for which we stand. It represents the thin end of the wedge which the party opposite would drive home if they could. We know that the present Government party if they had their way would carry out one of the promises they made to the electors. They would break down trade unionism altogether, and drag us back to the conditions of the old times when thousands of men carried their swags in the different States of Australia looking for a job for which they would get from 12s. to 15s. per week. I say that I am prepared to oppose the Bill referred to, notwithstanding the fact that it may only affect a few thousand out of the 5,000,000 inhabitants of the Commonwealth. Because I regard it as the thin end of the wedge, and believe that it attacks one of the principles of our party, I shall oppose it strongly. I come now to deal with the other so-called test Bill for the restoration of the postal vote. Every one will admit that the members of the Labour party have always declared that every person in Australia twenty-one years of age, and a natural born or naturalized British subject, should have the right to say who shall represent his interests in any Parliament in this country. We have gone further, and have said that every person should be given&#39; the opportunity to record his vote. This was proved when we submitted our amendment of the Electoral Act in 1912, and substituted the absentee vote for the postal vote. The fact that the introduction of the absentee vote gave thousands of electors throughout the Commonwealth the opportunity to record their votes who never previously could do so was clearly proved at the last Federal elections, because at those elections a greater percentage of the electors exercised the franchise than at any previous election held in the Commonwealth. The members of the present Government party have had a lot to say about the necessity of doing something for the pioneers of industry in the back country. They had a great deal more to say on the same subject before the 31st May last. But what are they going to do to give the pioneers of industry in the back country the right to say who shall represent their interests in the Federal Parliament? They propose to re-introduce the postal voting provisions which were in operation in 1910. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> who apparently is the only representative of the Government in the Senate at the present time- </para>

                                <para>- As the Vice-President of the Executive Council is otherwise engaged, I shall ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> whether the postal vote which the Government desire to re-introduce will give the pioneers of the mining, pastoral, and agricultural industries the opportunity to record their votes ? There is no answer. The honorable senator knows well if he has gone into the question that the re-introduction of the postal voting provisions will nob give these people an opportunity to record their votes for candidates for the Federal Parliament. When the Electoral Commission was sitting in Perth, the Chief Electoral Officer of Western Australia was asked by one of the members of the Commission how long it would take him to get into communication with his officers, say, at Wyndham, in the northwest of the State. He replied that it would take two months. If that be so, I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> to say how it will be possible for any elector in the north-west of Western Australia to record a vote by post under the provisions which were in operation in 1910 ? Under those provisions an elector desiring to vote by post was required to make an application to the Returning Officer of the chief polling place in his district for a postal vote. According to the Chief Electoral Officer of Western Australia, it would take two months for the applications from electors at Wyndham, Hall&#39;s Creek, and other places in the north-west of Western Australia, to go through from the chief polling place in the Dampier electorate, and postal ballot-papers to be forwarded to the electors. Before an elector could receive the postal ballot-paper for which he applied the election would be over, and his trouble would have gone for nothing- It should not be forgotten that electors desiring to vote by post under the provisions which the Government propose to re-introduce  would be required to go to a lot of trouble. In order to obtain a postal ballot-paper the elector must first go before an authorized witness to sign his application form. An authorized witness under the law is not procurable next door or across the street in the north-west of Western Australia, and many electors there who desired to exercise the right to vote by post would have to travel from 20 to 50 miles to reach an authorized witness. They would again have to take the trip when they received the postal ballot-paper before they could record their votes. I therefore claim that, so far as the pioneers of industry in the outlying districts are concerned, the postal vote proposed by the present Government would be an absolute farce. During last session honorable senators on this side submitted an amendment upon the Government measure, which would not only have given the pioneers of industry in the different States an opportunity to record their votes, but would have afforded a similar opportunity ito the sick and to those who might be travelling between the different States. If an election should take place during the next few months the Government will not be able to charge the Labour party with the responsibility if the sick people of Australia are unable to record their votes, because if they accepted the amendment we submitted last session every person in Australia might record a vote even if an election took place tomorrow. I shall take up the same attitude with respect to this measure that I took up when it was before us last session. As a party we are prepared to give everybody in the Commonwealth an opportunity to exercise the franchise. We have clearly demonstrated that in the past. There is one other matter to which I should like to refer, and that is the Commonwealth Savings Bank. During the last Federal elections our opponents criticised the Labour party very severely. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl,</inline> amongst others, referred to some of our legislation in very strong terms. He spoke of the Maternity Allowance Act as &#34; a low-down political dodge.&#34; If it be &#34;a low-down political dodge,&#34; I ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council why he, as one of the responsible Ministers of the Commonwealth, has not moved for its repeal? If it were such a distasteful measure to the Government prior to the last elections, surely they should give effect to their pledges on the hustings. During the recent campaign, the Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, in travelling through Western Australia, described the land tax as &#34; an unjust and inequitable tax,&#34; and &#34; an unfair burden on a small section of the people.&#34; Now, if it be &#34; an unjust and inequitable tax,&#34; and if it constitutes &#34; an unfair burden on a small section of the people,&#34; why have not the Government attempted to repeal it ? Surely a political party should endeavour to give effect to its policy. </para>

                                <para>- That is so; and I take it that they are only waiting until they can obtain a double dissolution to repeal the Maternity Allowance Act, the Land Tax Act, the Australian Notes Act, and the Commonwealth Bank Act - that is, if we may judge them by the words which they have uttered in this chamber and in another place during the past three years. Unfortunately, the Government appear to have no policy. I made that statement on the north-west coast of Western Australia some twelve months ago. At the end of the meeting which I was addressing, one of those present took exception to my statement. He said, &#34; I have the platform of the Liberal party here - a platform containing fourteen planks.&#34; I replied, &#34; I am very pleased to hear it. It is certainly news to me, and I give the gentleman a cordial invitation to come on the platform and read the fourteen planks of the Liberal party&#39;s programme.&#34; Thereupon the person who had objected to my statement said, &#34; Unfortunately, I have not the platform with me, but I will  send it along to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buzacott</inline> tomorrow morning.&#34; I may say that it has not yet reached me, and the accuracy of my statement that the Liberal party had no programme was proved conclusively by the fact that only twelve months ago they had to ask for a six-weeks&#39; adjournment of this Parliament to enable them to prepare a policy. </para>

                                <para>- But he also says that they are going to hide it for some time. It seems to be in process of incubation. So far as the Commonwealth Savings Bank is concerned, I consider that the late Government took up the right attitude when they brought forward the Commonwealth Bank Act. That has been conclusively proved by events since. I notice that the Premiers of some of the States are taking up a hostile attitude towards it, just as they did when &#34;it was introduced. But, although <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt,</inline> the Premier of Victoria, is apparently more hostile to the Commonwealth Savings Bank than is any other Premier, we must recollect that the people of Victoria, prior to the introduction of the Commonwealth Bank Act, had very few facilities indeed for depositing their savings. In proof of my statement I propose to read portion of a leading article which was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Age-</inline> of 5th September, 1912. At that time, the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> was a strong supporter of the present Liberal Government. I am pleased to notice that it has recently arrived at the conclusion at which the Labour party arrived some time ago, namely, that the Ministry were prepared to make a great number of promises prior to a general election - promises which they now find it very convenient to forget. It is all very well for their supporters to ask, &#34; Why did not the Labour party amend the Tariff during the three years that a- Labour Government were in office?&#34; That is the interjection with which our ears are always assailed by Ministerial supporters. But I would remind them that in 1910 the Labour party were returned to this Parliament pledged to the new Protection. From every platform from which I spoke during that campaign I made it clear that I would not vote for an increased measure of Protection unless an opportunity were afforded us of protecting, not merely the manufacturer and producer, but also the employe and consumer. It will be seen, therefore, that if we were to respect our platform pledges we could not re-open the Tariff during the three years that the Fisher Government held office. But had that Government been returned at the last general elections it was part of their policy to re-open the Tariff for the purpose of giving adequate encouragement to Australian production.  <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks.</inline> - The Labour party made that promise, and it has never broken one of its pledges. </para>

                                <para>- That is absolutely true. I was about to refer to an article which was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper in respect of the effect to which the establishment of the Commonwealth Savings Bank has had upon the Savings Bank of Victoria. This article was written whilst the Savings Bank Bill was before the Victorian Legislative Assembly. It says - </para>

                        </continue>
                        <para>The new Savings Bank Bill, which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> explained last night to the Assembly, is a measure that will deeply interest every thrifty Victorian citizen. . . . <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> attempted no concealment as to the genesis of the new departure. He feels that the status, and even the existence, of the States Savings Bank has been challenged by the rival Commonwealth establishment, and he is determined not to leave a, stone - unturned to prevent the citizens of Victoria deserting their own bank. Sympathy will naturally gravitate to so energetic and beneficently provident a reformer; but, at the same time, we must spare a kindly thought to his competitor. The Victorian Savings Bank is progressively and rapidly becoming one of the most liberal institutions of its kind in the world, but before the Federal Bank was definitely projected it slumbered for half a century. </para>
                        <para class="block">That last remark applies not only <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> Victoria, but to every State of the Commonwealth. Even if the Commonwealth Savings Bank were to suspend business operations tomorrow, the Labour party could claim that it has done good work in the different States. In conclusion, I wish to quote a paragraph by a leading writer on political economy, which, in ray opinion, very accurately describes the trade unionist, who, by his self-denying industry, has built up the tribunals throughout this Commonwealth which makes for industrial peace. He says - </para>
                        <para>Beneath things he seeks the law; he would know how the globe was forged, and the stars were hung, and trace to their sources the springs of life. And then, as the man develops his nobler nature, there arises the desire higher yet - the passion of passions, the hope of hopes - the desire that he, even he, may somehow aid in making life better and brighter, in destroying want and sin, sorrow and shame. He masters and curbs the animal; he turns his back upon the feast and renounces the .place of power; he leaves it to others to accumulate wealth, to gratify pleasant tastes, to bask themselves in the warm sunshine of the brief day. He works for those he never saw and never can see; for a fame, or it may be but for a scant justice, that can only come long after the clods have rattled upon his coffin lid. He toils in the advance, where it is cold, and there is little cheer from men, and the stones are sharp and the brambles thick. Amid the scoffs of the present and the sneers that stab like knives, he builds for the future; he cuts the trail that progressive humanity may hereafter broaden into a high-road. Into higher, grander spheres desire mounts and beckons, and a star that rises in the east leads him on. Lo ! the pulses of the man throb with the yearnings of the god - he would aid in the process of the suns ! </para>

                            <para>. - One would like on an occasion of this kind to be able to say a word or two in commendation of the programme which the Government have submitted to Parliament as an indication of what they would like to accomplish for the benefit of the Commonwealth during the current year. But, unfortunately, I cannot utter one single word of praise of anything they have put before the country through the Governor-General&#39;s Speech. On the contrary, there is room for condemnation in every clause of the ViceRegal utterance, and in every sentence relating to -the work which they intend asking us to perform during this session. I would also have liked to commend the mover and seconder of the motion - the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply. But, frankly, I am unable to do so. Usually it devolves upon the mover of that motion to say something that is almost outside the scope of the Governor-General&#39;s Speech. But on the present occasion <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Oakes</inline> simply uttered a tirade - of abuse against his political opponents - abuse which was neither justified, sensible, nor edifying, and . which barely escaped being unparliamentary. Small as are the number of Government supporters, it is time we heard from them some word of protest, justification, or explanation of the condemnation that has been heaped upon the Government by honorable senators on this side. Does not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> think that the serious charges made this week by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> merit a reply of some kind ? The whole Commonwealth is justified in believing that the exposures made by those two honorable senators are absolutely correct, and yet the Government have not a word to say in their own defence. I am sure that is the verdict of the Commonwealth concerning the present Administration, which came into office with such bright promises of reform and improvement. We heard yesterday a severe and critical condemnation of their action in connexion with the east-west railway. We have heard to-day, in a new form, from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buzacott,</inline> a condemnation of their action in regard to the powellised sleeper contract with the Government of Western Australia, but not a word of justification, excuse, or defence can the Government offer in either case. </para>

                                <para>- They cannot get them here at any time; but surely when charges of this description are levelled against the Government, the least they can do is to put up some semblance of a fight in their own defence, if they have anything at all to say. We are justified in believing, in the circumstances, that every charge made against the Government has been proved up to the hilt, because in this place, of all others, where the Government could defend themselves, they have not attempted in any way to do so. The two great national undertakings that have been touched by the Government have been practically wrecked by their want of capacity to deal with big questions. They have mishandled the construction of the transcontinental railway from the time they took it over. Yesterday I asked the Honorary Minister a question, based on a telegram sent to a well-known industrial organization, as to the alleged discharge of 200 men by the Government. Of course, we&#39; did not charge the Government with being responsible; but we wanted information, and the reply we got to-day from the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs, under whose control the work is, shows that he does . not know anything about the matter. It is trifling in the extreme to him and the Government that 200 men should be discharged from their work in an inhospitable region, to find their way back to civilization as best they can. It is a matter of absolute indifference to them. They know nothing whatever about it. </para>

                                <para>- I am grateful, to the Vice-President of the Executive Council for the reply he gave me; but it shows clearly that the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs does not know what is going on at the works. He says that a wire has been received from Adelaide which seems to show certain things. I contend that the Minister in charge of such an important work ought to be in a position to answer &#34;Yes&#34; or &#34;No&#34; to a question of that kind. He should be able to say that the men have been discharged, and why; or that they have not been discharged, and that the telegram which I handed to him yesterday is not true. It is surely not too much to ask the Government to be in a position, where such a great work as this is concerned, to say whether questions asked here are in accord with fact or not. </para>

                                <para>- It has been contended throughout by the Government and their supporters that, in dealing with this contract, time was all that mattered. I have shown that they have made a shocking mess of one large national work they have handled. We should have thought that this Government of all the talents would be able to deal, at any rate, reasonably well with a matter like the powellised sleeper contract; but that also has fallen through, the reason given for the cancellation of the contract being that the Western Australian Government failed to keep up the necessary supply. It is some months since that step was taken, and yet I think I am right in saying that the Government have not purchased a single sleeper since the contract was cancelled, up to the present day. Surely- the Western Australian Government, if they were six weeks or two months behind in their supplies, should have been given a chance of pulling up some of the arrears. </para>

                                <para>- The reason makes very little difference. Whether they cancelled it on the assumption that the State Government would fail to keep the arrangement, or on the assumption that it had already failed, the effect was precisely the same. The fact still remains that if the State Government had been allowed to go on they would have been in a position to supply us with sleepers before they were required. There was, therefore, no justification whatever for cancelling the agreement. The Government stand condemned throughout the Commonwealth for the absolute lack of ability they have displayed, or, indeed, for something worse, in this matter. We are told that the contract was cancelled because certain big contractors in Western Australia and other places have come along looking for some return for their support, financial and otherwise, of the present Government. We wonder whether this is true. We wonder whether the big contractor has actually applied the screw to Ministers. We would .like to know whether he has said to them, &#34; I have stuck to you for so long, it is now up to you to do something for me.&#34; There is the inference. We have heard a good deal about slandering the Commonwealth, and I am not going to make any charges against the Government, or any member of it. No member of this party has ever made charges of corruption in the way that Ministers have tried to make out. None of us has ever said, or even suggested, that Ministers have accepted bribes; but we do know that the big contractor, the big merchant, and the rest of them, are looking for some indirect benefit for the direct support they have given the Government and their supporters in the past. Let me examine the record of the Government during the time they have been in office. Not one of their promises to the people has been kept. They presented at the opening of last session a programme which was lengthy, but contained no measures of great importance. I am going to deal briefly with some of the main planks in their platform. </para>

I have charged the Government with doing nothing. I propose to show wherein they have failed, and, at the same time, to reply to the charges of blocking legislation levelled by the Vice-President of the Executive Council and his colleagues in all parts of Australia against this party. Any legislation of any consequence whatever to the people that we have been asked to pass has been passed in a very short space of time. No man can honestly charge the Senate with blocking anything that the Government have brought forward for the benefit of the community. </para>

                                <para>- No; but nevertheless they took a bigger window last year to hold their display than they have&#171; taken this year. In the very first paragraph of the opening Speech last year they told us that they were going to remove the restriction on public discussion, or, in other wards, to do away with the system that was very wisely introduced* by the Labour Government of compelling writers in newspapers to be reasonably honest. Dp to last year, no matter how untrue or scurrilous an article might be, no matter how it might attack a man&#39;s* private affairs or private life, a newspaper was permitted to publish the article, and so long as the writer was astute enough to evade the libel law the newspaper went scot-free, and, of course, damaged the person concerned very considerably. The Fisher Administration decided that if it was good enough for a man to write an article for a newspaper it ought to be good enough for him to sign his name to the article. Only the other day the manager of the Labour newspaper in Adelaide, to his credit be it said, went before the Electoral Commission to give evidence. When he was asked whether the restriction, so-called, was really a restriction, he answered, &#34; No.&#34;- He said that it did not interfere with the Labour newspaper in Adelaide in one iota; that they experienced no difficulty, hardship, or inconvenience; that for two or three months he contributed a column or two over his own name every morning, and found that the journal did not suffer in any form. We were told by the present Government last year that they intended to remove this restriction on public liberty. What have they done ? </para>

                                <para>- Exactly ; and it does not matter to any honest writer whether he is writing very severe criticism of a political organization or a politician. There is no earthly reason why we should not be subject to whatever amount of criticism may be considered necessary. We do not object to that at all. All that we ask is that a critic should have the courage to identify himself with his article, just the same as the person whom he is criticising has to be identified with it. We ask for fair play, nothing more and nothing less. But our honorable friends on the Treasury bench have not kept the promise they gave to the Conservative press in Australia. Surely the Conservative press, who raised all the hubbub about the provision for signed articles, had a right to expect that the Government would do something to remove the disability under which they are supposed to labour. Up to the present time, however, nothing has been done in this direction. I am rather surprised that the Conservative press, although they are supporting the present Administration, are not taking serious steps to ask when it is in tended to honour the blank cheque given to them. </para>

                                <para>- The <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> and other Conservative newspapers will agree absolutely to the members of the Labour party being &#34; gagged &#34; in this Parliament on every conceivable occasion, but they do not agree to what we have suggested, although our suggestion does not amount to the &#34; gag,&#34; or anything like it. All that we ask is that the writers for newspapers shall be honest in their dealings with the community, and sign their articles. Surely the press of Australia will not forget the unkept promises when the Government and their supporters are before the country at the next election. We were told, too, that the Government were going to introduce legislation to alter the Arbitration Act. How has that promise been dealt with ? True it is that early last session a Bill was prepared to deal with the question, but it was dropped in a very great hurry. The Government did not go very far in the matter; finding that they were dealing with an unpopular subject they dropped their attempt to interfere with the Arbitration Act, and presented the trivial Bill that we know now as a test Bill. Whilst they have not been plucky enough to interfere with the Arbitration Act in any form, I am sure that honorable senators were astounded this afternoon to hear, in reply to a question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> as to their intention regarding an arbitration award made for a section of the Post Office workers, that the Ministry had determined to flout the Arbitration Court. </para>

                                <para>- That is not the worst feature of this matter. I point out to my honorable friend that preference to non-unionists is bad enough. Preference to any person who has come under an award of the Arbitration Court would be bad enough, but I place on the Government of the Commonwealth the greater offence or crime of having deliberately decided to set aside a portion of an award made by the Arbitration Court. Now, under this award certain men were expressly excluded. It was not to apply to men who were not members of the appellant union. We were told by their representative here to-day that the Government intend to flout the award, and pay the men who were specially excluded by the  President  of the Court. </para>

                                <para>- That makes the position all the worse. A breach of an award is bad enough when it is committed by a private employer, and&#34; meets with our denunciation. Suppose that in the present case the workers had done something of that kind, would the Government and their supporters have applauded them here to-day? I venture to say that they would not be able to find words sufficiently strong in the English language to condemn a body who would be guilty of such a gross breach of an award. What- is going to be the consequence of the Government&#39;s decision ? Here is an award made by a tribunal established after many years of strenuous work by the workers, of the Commonwealth. Every leader in the industrial movement for years advised the workers to put their faith in an Arbitration Court, because a strike is a boomerang that comes back and hits the striker much more severely than it hits the employer. We told . the workers that if we could get a reasonable Arbitration Court their troubles would be at an end. The workers, to a large extent-, concurred in this view, and agreed to go. to the Arbitration Court, but now we find the Government of the Commonwealth flouting the institution which was created to some extent with the aid of their own supporters. We find the Government belittling the Court in the eyes of, not only the workers, but the whole community. This creates, I think, a very serious position indeed. At the present time the tramway men of Adelaide are labouring under very great difficulties as regards an award. Many of us were anxious to see an alteration made in the Arbitration Act that would prevent an employer from altering an order made under an award. We find that the management of the Adelaide tramways have taken the liberty of altering the conditions of their employes, despite the fact that there is an appeal before the Arbitration Court. We condemn the tramway management for their action in this matter, but we find that the action of the Commonwealth Government towards a section of their own employes is infinitely worse, and I am afraid that as a result of their decision-1 the Arbitration Court will suffer very&#34; much in the eyes of the whole community, particularly in the confidence of the workers after the reply that was given here to-day. </para>

                                <para>- Yes. &#34;Law and order &#34; is only to apply so far as the worker is concerned. The Government have a perfect right-, so they tell us, to break any law they please, but the worker must not break a law. Getting away from that question we were told that the Government were to set the Inter-State Commission at some useful work for the benefit, of Australia. I do not wish to find any fault with the work they are doing to-day, nor do I want to find any fault with the Commission. I am satisfied, that whatever work they may be engaged upon they will do it well. But I point out to the solitary, representative of the Government here this afternoon that the work which the Commission are doing is absolutely worthless, because I for one do not intend to take very much, if I take any, notice of the work they are doing in connexion with the Tariff. I know that it was within the obligations of the Commission that they might be called upon to do certain work in connexion with Tariff revision, but it was never intended that they should frame a Tariff for this or any. other Government. </para>

Composed of men holding quite contrary fiscal views the Government must have said, &#34; The Tariff is a dangerous thing for us to handle, and therefore we will hand it over to a non-political body, who will make an investigation.&#34; In the meantime, not only are we losing the benefit of the experience and the advice of the members of the Commission in matters dealing with Inter-State trade and commerce- </para>

                                <para>- The Government should not have referred the Tariff to the Inter-State Commission in the way they did. I said earlier in my speech that it was possible that the Commission might be called upon to do certain work in connexion with the Tariff. There is not the slightest doubt in my mind that these gentlemen have been handed the work to perform in order to escape the difficulty which was indicated when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> was asked to declare his policy. He said he would not declare his policy, because it might result in a split in the party. It was evidently considered that the Tariff might be the rock on which the Ministry would be wrecked, and the inquiry into it was therefore handed over to the InterState Commission, who should have been engaged in other work for the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>SenatorNEWLAND.- That is the worst feature about the matter. So far as we can learn, all the evidence which the Commission takes will be stored up in the brains of the gentlemen who are making the inquiry, and will not be available for Parliament, as it should be. If the Inter-State Commission had been set to work to carry out the duties for which it was primarily called into existence, it would have been unnecessary for the Prime Minister or the Treasurer to attend a gathering of the State Premiers, and ask what they ought to do in order to deal with certain matters concerning the States and the Commonwealth. </para>

                                <para>- That is so. We have to depend entirely on newspaper reports of the evidence taken by the Commission from day to day. In the circumstances, I have no doubt that many members of the Senate, and of another place, will decide to do as I intend to do in the matter, and will take little or no notice of the inquiry by the Inter-State Commission. We recognise that sooner or later the present Government or another will have to open up the question of the Tariff, and we shall then have an opportunity to do something practical. </para>

                                <para>- I think it will not. . We were told that in the meantime any anomalies discovered in the Tariff were to be dealt with. The anomalies of the Tariff are apparent to any man who is aware of the fact that many of our industries are languishing because of them. I am sure that the Vice-President&#39; of the Executive Council, as a Victorian, will agree with me that something should be done for the benefit of our languishing industries. A promise, to do something in the matter was made last session by the Government, who so far have done nothing but cast their responsibility upon the shoulders of three Commissioners who were appointed for a very different purpose. </para>

                                <para>- I care nothing for the Minister&#39;s reply. He knows where I am on the question of Free Trade <inline font-style="italic">verms</inline> Protection. But when the Labour party are charged with having .done nothing, those who make that charge should, in fairness to themselves, if they desire to be considered honorable men, tell the whole truth. They should be prepared to admit that the Fisher Government promised the people of Australia that they would not interfere with the Tariff unless they could secure an alteration of the Constitution which would enable them to give Protection to every one, and not to a particular section. The Fisher Government observed that promise from the day they took office till the day they left it. They made every possible effort to give effect to the promise. They asked the people of Australia to amend the Constitution to enable them to do what they desired to do, and the present Government and their supporters throughout Australia did their very best, and unfortunately succeeded, in preventing the Fisher Government interfering with the -Tariff in the way they desired. That is my reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> McColl&#39;s  interjection, and I am sorry that his colleague, the Minister of Defence, is not also present to hear it. We are told that the present Government are the friends of the farmers. I hold no political brief for the farming community or any other section. I have  very  little use for the politician who goes around - I was going to say crawling to the farmers, but I will not use that word- - </para>

                                <para>- I am afraid that the word the honorable senator suggests would not be considered parliamentary. I will say that I have no use for the politician who goes around patronising the farmer and telling him that he is the only friend the farmer has in politics, and that the Labour party are out to destroy him and his industry at every turn. What has been done by those gentlemen who profess to be the friends of the farmer? In paragraph 4 o&#39;f the Governor-General&#39;s Speech we were informed that the Government proposed to take advantage of the visit of the High Commissioner to discuss with him the possibility of opening up new markets in various parts of the world for the disposal of the farmer&#39;s produce, and that they were also going to establish closer relations between local producers and consumers in Great Britain. Has anything been done in that direction ? The farmers have been waiting anxiously for the fulfilment of the promise which the Government made to them. </para>

                                <para>- As my honorable friend reminds me, the Government have refused to permit men who know the farming industry in this country from A to Z to go abroad and help to open up markets in other parts of the world. The farmers are waiting for election day tq thank the Government and their supporters for the great efforts they have made to further the interests of the farming community. We were told that steps were being taken to deal with questions arising out of the agreement entered into with the authorities in the Old Country in 1909 on the subject of defence. All we know concerning that agreement, and what has- been done in connexion with it, is rather to the discredit of the Prime Minister than otherwise. He has been informed that he made a promise which he is not in a position to carry out. As a result, something approaching a snub has been administered to the honorable gentleman by the Home authorities. Here we have another instance of the failure of the Government to carry out their promises, even in connexion with so important a matter as the defence of the Commonwealth. There is another very important matter in connexion with which the people have been waiting to discover what the Government propose to do. It was the subject of another promise made to the electors at the last elections. The Government put it on their programme. It was another of the blank cheques which they handed to the people of Australia, and which they have neither the inclination nor the means to meet at the present time. J refer now to the promised scheme of national insurance, about which the Government and their supporters made so much noise at the last general elections. We were told that the wicked and iniquitous maternity grant of the Fisher Government, and a considerable portion of the amount paid for old-age pensions, were to go by the board. The electors were informed that this Government of giant intellects proposed to frame a measure providing for a scheme of national insurance on a contributory basis to cover sickness, accident, old-age pensions, widows&#39; pensions, and maternity allowances. </para>

I repeat that many members of the party to which he belongs made the statement I have mentioned. The Government scheme was to be substituted as a more equitable and just one to the people of Australia. Now they are ashamed of their words, and apparently desire to repudiate the scheme. Surely this is another blank cheque about which, not only the farmers, but the workers of Australia, will desire to ask some pertinent questions at the next elections. </para>

We were told, too, that something was to be done in the matter of the maternity allowance. We were assured that it would be limited to making proper provision for relief in necessitous cases. In other words, the Government were going to pauperize the mothers of Australia. </para>

                                <para>- By-and-by. The time is not yet opportune to give effect to any such proposals. We all recognise  the importance of the Northern Territory from the standpoint of maintaining the purity of our race, and also from a revenue-producing stand-point. Yet the so-called Liberal Government have done absolutely nothing to develop it. They promised to introduce important proposals for its development immediately. But what is their record? They have discharged half-a-dozen officials in the Territory who held very important positions there. They have thus saved about &#163;3,000 annually, and they have cancelled the appointment of a Commission which had been appointed to investigate certain matters connected with the development of the Territory. Instead of having done anything in the development of that country, the Government have done everything in their power to retard it. Last session a Bill was passed through this Chamber authorizing the construction of a short section of railway there. Since then we have been told by the Prime Minister and others that the Senate imposed impossible conditions in relation to that Bill. That statement was contrary to fact. The measure &#169;merged from this Chamber in a slightly improved form. But nothing has been done by the Ministry in regard to that matter. They have merely discharged half-a-dozen officers, and recalled a Commission which was taking evidence in the Territory. </para>

                                <para>- Some of them were not Labour men, I understand. But while certain of those officers have been transferred to important positions elsewhere, others have not. We have heard a lot about one gentleman, whose presence in the Territory was absolutely necessary if settlement was to be encouraged there. I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryland.</inline> I never saw him in my life, but I know that there was no position there more important than that of the Director of Lands.  His  was the last office which should have been abolished. I understand that the duties of his position are now being discharged by two or three clerks. We are sure to develop the Northern Territory very rapidly indeed under these conditions. The members of the Northern Territory Railways and Development Commission, who were appointed to investigate, amongst other things, the question of railway routes, have been hurriedly recalled. Their work has been brought to an abrupt end, and to-day, from one end of the Territory to the other, nothing is being done to encourage its development. We were also assured by the Government that a Land Ordinance was to be passed, repealing the Ordinance that was enacted at the instance of the Fisher Government, The present Ministry are great believers in a. policy which permits of the aggregation of large estates. The Fisher Ministry framed a policy of land settlement for the Territory, which they believed to be a sound one, and their successors have promised to repeal it. Why have they not done so, and thus given the American Beef Trust and the land boodler  an opportunity of collaring the whole of that area? </para>

                                <para>- I have read it very carefully, andIamfamiliarwith its provisions. In my judgment it is more calculated to prevent the accumulation of large estates than any other Ordinance with which I am acquainted. I have already dealt with the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway, and I merely wish to add to what 1 have previously said that it must be a bitter disappointment to every section of the community to find the Government dilly-dallying with the work of construction. They do not appear to know their own minds. They originally declared that they were going to do away with the day-labour system, and to &#39;substitute for it the contract system. They led us to believe that they would Have the line almost constructed within a fortnight. The fact is that they are afraid to give effect to their own views. They have not sufficient faith in their own policy. The result is that the construction of this line is being shamefully delayed. The uniform railway gauge is another question that we were told was going to be finally and definitely settled, but the Government seem to have no fixed policy in regard to it. The Senate gave them permission to construct the railway from Pine Creek to Katherine River on almost any gauge they liked; but instead of having any policy of their own on the question of the uniformity of gauge in Australia, the Government have gone to the State Premiers for one. The railway engineers have made joint recommendations in the matter, and yet the Government have not definitely made up their minds what the future gauge shall be, or on whom the cost will fall, or what proportion the Commonwealth and States will bear. There can be no question of greater importance to the future of Australia, and every day&#39;s delay in its settlement will add tremendously to the ultimate cost.I have my own idea as to what the gauge should be, but I am much more concerned about our having a uniform gauge throughout the continent. The Government propose to seek a Conference with the State Premiers on the question. They delegate the Tariff to the InterState Commission, and the railway gauge problem to the Premiers&#39; Conference. In this way they hand over work which they ought to shoulder to persons who are practically irresponsible, so far as this </para>

                                <para>- South Australia&#39;s demands, . from a South Australian stand-point, seem very reasonable. The same may be said in the case of Victoria and . New South Wales. In this Parliament we should look at the question from a national, and not a parochial, stand-point. I hope that when the agreement comes before us, the honorable senator and his colleagues will look at it from the stand-point of the Commonwealth, and not of any individual State. </para>

We were promised that a Supply and Tender Board would be appointed by the Government, and we have been told by supporters of the Government outside that the Senate refused to agree to its appointment. That is another of those half-truths that are much more unsatisfactory than a whole lie. We all know how the question came up last session. No sensible member of Parliament would allow such an important matter as the appointment of a Supply and Tender Board to be tacked on as an amendment of the Audit Act. Let the </para>

They have no right to go about the country denouncing the Labour party for refusing to agree to appoint a Supply and Tender Board, when the question never came before them in a proper form. The Prime Minister recently visited Mount Gambier,. and there made statements to which I wish to refer. By the way, he went to South Australia previous to the last election. He spoke in Adelaide, and as the result of his visit the Labour party gained a few thousand votes. He is the best organizer we could Have. He went to Port Pirie, and as the result we gained 600 or 700 votes. I am confident that the result of his visit to Mount Gambier will be a great addition to the strength of the Labour vote there. When there, he said that the Government had introduced certain Bills, including the Norfolk Island Bill, the Pine Creek to Katherine River Railway Bill, the Bureau of Agriculture Bill, and a Bill to provide for the appointment of a Supply and Tender Board. I have shown that such a Bill was never introduced into the Senate at all. Ministers know, as well as I do, how little blame can be laid at the door of this&#39; party for the hanging up of the Agricultural Bureau Bill. </para>

                                <para>- I hope that the appointment of the board will never go through in such a form. It should be done by a separate measure, and not by means of a side wind. The Prime Minister said that a Bill to provide for the appointment of a Supply and Tender Board was introduced, and I am showing that no such measure ever came before us.. He said - </para>

The Government refused to grant the necessary money to carry on the inquiry, but at Mount Gambier the Prime Minister very carefully refrained from making any reference to his misdeeds in that regard. Later he said - </para>

This is another instance of where half of the truth is told. The members of the Labour parity are here to see that such legislation passes the Senate as will be a benefit to the country, and that the subjects therein dealt with shall receive fair treatment. That was all that&#39; the members of the Senate did as far as  those  Bills were concerned. Continuing, the Prime Minister said - </para>

                        <para class="block">I think that the Prime Minister in his youth must have read a large number of Deadwood Dicks, because he is very fond of using language such as is found in the greenbacks. He has said that the Labour party are like a tiger, or a man in a dark alley with a knife, an assassin waiting to pounce upon any unwary Liberal as he went by, and, as I said, the kindergarten Minister has referred to the members of our party as panthers who have once tasted blood, and are anxious to get their fangs into the Liberal party again, so that they may repeat the process. That is a sample of the actions of the Prime Minister and the speeches delivered by himself and his supporters when they go into the outlying , districts of the country. He did not, however, have things all his own way at Mount Gambier. It is worth while to read a short extract to show what the local newspaper thought of the reception given to him.

I think it is necessary sometimes that we should review the past in order that we may gain some experience and knowledge to enable us to avoid pitfalls in our future peregrinations and to do better. I do not intend to  deal at any great length with the programme which has been submitted to the Parliament this session. It is even more lean and hungry than the last one. In paragraph 2 we are told by His Excellency that his Advisers did not consider a prolonged recess advisable, and. that they had called Parliament together with the idea of considering the best means of expediting the despatch of urgent public business. What an extraordinary method of giving urgent despatch to public business! We have been sitting for over two months, and how much public business has been done? </para>

I ask the honorable senator, in all seriousness, whether he blames the members of the Opposition for, if he likes the phrase better, the lack of expedition that has been given to public business since Parliament was convened. I contend that the Government themselves, and not the Opposition, are responsible for the delay. The Bill that is causing this obstruction, the Minister knows as well as we do, is not going to make one iota of difference to a living soul on this continent. It will neither imprison a man nor release a man from prison. It will not help the farmer, or the worker, or a man in any other section of the community. </para>

                                <para>- Some members of the Liberal party are resurrecting that old chestnut, but it will not serve. The point I want to make is that whilst the Government are blaming the Labour party for this obstruction, they are advising that party to allow this Bill to go through. What is the opposition here? If the Bill were .going to affect in any degree any section of the community, the Government might have some justification for proceeding with it, but, as I said, the work which the Bill is supposed to do has already been done. It will be. done no better by .its passage. Why, then, should . the Government continue to neglect to give to this Parliament and, if they like, to this party, some useful work to do in the interests of the Commonwealth? The electors will not hold the Government guiltless in this matter. They recognise that the party on this side are here for certain purposes. They recognise that while the Government are here to initiate legislation, the Opposition are here to do their best to perfect such legislation, and not to bring any forward. We find, however, that two or three notices of motion have been given here. Some members of the Labour party have become so sick and tired of the inertia of the Government that they are introducing business of their own, simply because Ministers will not do so. There is the reply to the statement of the Minister that we are delaying business in any shape or form. I do not propose to refer to the two test Bills, because we may have an opportunity of doing so later. </para>

                        <para class="block">In the opening Speech we are told that these two measures &#34; failed to pass,&#34; but that is hardly a correct statement. We know perfectly well that one measure did &#39; pass in a much- improved form, and that was the Bill for the restoration of the postal vote. It was amended in a direction that secured to every person in the Commonwealth the right &#39;to vote. If the Government refuse to accept our amendment, they will have to put up with the consequences at the hands of the people when they go to the country on this or any other question. Our good old friend, the railway gauge, is brought forward again. This old garment has been turned upside down and is again displayed in the window for the admiration of all who may be pleased to gaze upon it. But we have got a step forward. After the State Premiers have dealt with this question, the Government intend to refer it to the Inter-State Commission. By the time the Commission have dealt with the Tariff - two, three, or four years hence - the question of railway gauges will be handed over to three men who have absolutely no knowledge of railway matters - good, bad, or indifferent. Of course, the intention1 again is to take the responsibility off the shoulders of the Government. Surely on such an important question as the work of the Inter-State Commission the Government should have a policy of their own. Surely they ought to have a lead to give to the Parliament and the country as to what they intend to do with the question of railway gauges, and that, too, at the earliest possible moment. We find that the report of the Northern Territory Commission has been received. Necessarily the report must have been considerably curtailed, because the Commission were withdrawn long before their work was anything like completed. The statement is dangled before our eyes that it is the intention of the Government to place before Parliament those comprehensive proposals which they were supposed to bring forward last session for the development of the Territory. We have not heard a word yet as to what the developments are to be, or the slightest indication as to what form they are likely to take, and, of course, we await with very much interest the proposals themselves. </para>

                                <para>- Honorable senators on this side are not responsible for the lack of a policy in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech. We have been able to deal only with the paltry excuses offered by those who have been set up as apologists for the Government. We were asked why the Labour Government, or any other Government, should arrogate to themselves the power to say that any section of the community should be denied employment which was given to another section? If a Government cannot arrogate to themselves such a right, what authority can ? I was under the impression that Governments are charged with the administration of affairs. The Labour Government had as much right to arrogate to themselves the power to give preference to unionists as the present Government have to presume to take that concession away from them. If, in this matter, there has been a fault on one side, the fault has been as great, and, in my opinion, greater, on the other side. It has been shown in the course of this debate that unionists have a good right to ask for some privilege in the matter of employment. But for the existence of the unions, and the work they are doing, we should not have the peaceful conditions industrially that we have in Australia to-day. It has been by the action of the unions that industrial difficulties have been brought before Arbitration Courts, Wages Boards, and similar tribunals, and have been settled without recourse to the old and barbarous method qf the strike. For that reason, if for no other, the Government of the country would be justified in giving the men who have been responsible for this condition of affairs some form of preference. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Oakes</inline> referred to the Caucus of the Labour party as an institution which throttles the members of the party, and does not permit them to have a thought or an opinion of their own. I think that the honorable senator must have been speaking from knowledge of his own Caucus, and not from any knowledge he possesses of the work of the Caucus of the Labour party. Outside the platform of the Labour .party, every member of that party has a great deal more freedom of thought and action than have members of the party opposite. If the supporters of the Government enjoyed the liberty exercised by members of the Labour party, they would not continue to support them. In another place members of the Labour party have been accused of very grievous crimes. I do not wish to refer to the remarks made there, except to give them a general denial. It has been said that if the present Government have not done more than they have done, it is because of their political limitations, but last session we saw that the Government recognised no political limitations. They did not hesitate to strain the Standing Orders in every conceivable way in order to force their measures through another place. When they commanded a subservient majority of one in another place, the Government had no right to complain of political limitations. It has also been said that the Senate closed its doors at the behest of the Labour Caucus. What are the facts? The Senate closed&#39; its doors  at the request of the Minister of  Defence, who is the Leader of the Government in this Chamber. The doors of the Senate were closed because- the Government refused to transact any business. There is not a member of the party on this side who was not prepared to come here every day during the time the doors of the Senate were closed, if there had been any business introduced by the Government. Ministers refused to answer questions,&#39; or to give honorable senators any information, and it was at their suggestion and request that the doors of the Senate were closed for three weeks, and not at the behest of the Labour Caucus. A reason for the inaction of the Government so foreign to the truth has never previously been given in any Chamber. Much has been said about the slanders&#39; that have been uttered. It has become quite a stock phrase to say that certain persons have been guilty of slandering the Commonwealth. But if anything of that kind has been done, it has not been by members of the Labour party. From the day of the opening of this Parliament the people of Australia have been frequently slandered. It has been said that thousands of them voted who had no right to vote. We have been told that the electors of the Commonwealth were so lost to all sense of political morality and honesty that they went to the poll in thousands when they had no right to vote, and that some even came out of their graves to record votes. It is needless to say that the inference was that those improperly recorded votes were cast for the Labour party. If that is not a slander on the people of Australia, I do not know what is. The statement was challenged as soon as it was made, and it has been continually challenged. A Royal Commission has been appointed to inquire into these allegations of electoral irregularities, but up to the present it has found out practically nothing. </para>

                                <para>- The Minister of Defence, like a drowning man, clutches at any straw to justify the statements that have been made. It is true that I asked for leniency for three men who were fined &#163;8 16s. each in a Court in South Australia. One case was that of a young man, who was twenty-one years of age before the election day, though he had not reached that age when he made his application to be enrolled. The other was the case of a new arrival. Ministers like to take new arrivals under their wing. They are far more precious in their eyes than are those who have borne the heat and burden of the day in Australia. </para>

                                <para>- It is necessary that some one should take up his case when the man is persecuted as well as prosecuted. This man made an application for enrolment when he had. been five months and nineteen days in Australia, instead of six months, as required&#39; by the law. He had been six months in the Commonwealth before the day of the election, but he did not record a vote. I have asked that leniency should be shown in that case. If the man were a murderer I should be justified in asking for leniency; but this man quite unwittingly committed an offence against the Electoral Act. We have a law to punish men if they do not see that they are enrolled, and these men, in their anxiety to dodge that law, violated&#39; another. I have asked that the fines imposed in these cases should be reconsidered, especially in view of the fact that fines of not half the amount were imposed elsewhere for similar offences. </para>

If Ministers had said that a few men had&#34; managed to get their names on to the rolls before they were qualified, that would have been a very different charge from the one which they have made against the electors of Australia. We were told by a member of the Government who is, if not a trustee, at least a director, of the Commonwealth Bank, that it had gone to the bad to the extent of &#163;56,000. It was found, upon investigation, that the honorable senator was out by &#163;10,000; but that is a mere nothing to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl.</inline> We have heard no word of qualification or excuse for this charge, although it is known that the initial expenditure in connexion with the establishment of the Bank had to be debited to the first year&#39;s operations. </para>

I assert that the Bight Honorable Andrew Fisher, who ventures to go about Australia spreading abroad these vile insinuations against the public credit and honour of his opponents, is the man who, or whose Government, is responsible for, first of all, introducing into Australian public life the spoils system of the United States. I have said it before, and I shall say it many times again, because it is true. . . . The man. who is responsible for the introduction into this country of the Tammany methods, above all others, is the Leader of the Opposition, who is ap- -  parently  willing to bind these broken fetters that the United States of America are casting aside round the clean young limbs of Australia. </para>

                                <para>- The  Hon.  W. H. Irvine, the Attorney-General of the present Government. Having called attention to these statements which have been made with the idea of belittling the people of Australia&#39; as electors, and as shareholders in the Commonwealth Bank, I feel that I can safely leave their authors to be dealt with by the electors. I now wish to say a few words in connexion with the action of the Government in endeavouring to hand over the public works of Australia to the tender mercies of .the contractor. Many instances have been quoted, both in this Chamber and in another place, for the purpose of proving the superiority of the day-labour system over the contract system. But in this connexion I desire to refer to a report which was issued quite recently by the Engineer-in-Chief of the Western Australian railways regarding the relative cost of railway construction under these two systems. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rolland,</inline> in his report to the Government of Western Australia, says - </para>

                            <para>A greater mileage has been constructed under contract than by day labour. It further demonstrates that the average cost per mile of railway has been cheaper by day labour, viz., under contract, &#163;2,012; by departmental daw labour. &#163;1,814; difference, &#163;198.  </para>

                            <para>Eliminating this, in order to give a perfectly fair comparison, the rate per mile under contract comes out at &#163;1,865. It should also he noted that included in the above figures are three especially expensive lines built by day labour, viz., Naraling-Yuna, rate per mile, &#163;3,710; Upper Darling Range railway extension, rate per mile, &#163;3,363; Northampton- Ajana, rate per mile, &#163;2,858. Deducting these, the average cost per mile by day labour for 44.6.8 miles works out at &#163;1,680, compared with &#163;1,865 per mile for 513.5 miles&#39; constructed under contract, showing a difference in favour of day labour construction of &#163;185 per mile. </para>

                        <para class="block">In every instance in which a comparison has been made between the day-labour and the contract systems in the carrying out of public works, that comparison has been in favour of day labour. Only the other day an answer was given to a question put in this Parliament regarding the laying of certain conduits at Ballarat. The cost under the contract system was &#163;2,485 10s. 5d., while under that of day labour it was &#163;1,716 9s. Hd., a difference in favour of day labour of &#163;712. In other words, there was a saving in favour of day labour of practically one-third. </para>

                                <para>- How the contractor would live is no very serious concern of honorable senators upon this side of the Chamber. We are anxious that the community shall receive the benefit of the profits which are at present finding their way into the pockets of the contractors. I mentioned a little while ago that a suggestion has been made that the constitution of the Senate should be altered. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Oakes</inline> told us that such a thing had not been suggested. I wish to read a short extract from the report of a meeting held at Narracoorte, in South Australia, in order to prove my contention. It is as follows - </para>

                            <para>A meeting of the committee of the Naracoorte branch of the Liberal Union was attended by the Premier (the  Hon.  A. H. Peake).. It was decided to recommend to the district gathering that the State should be_ divided into districts for the purpose of electing senators, that the Senate should go to the country when there was an election for the House of Representatives, and that an effort should be made to inculcate in the public mind the necessity for restoring the functions of the Senate as a States House, as contemplated in the Constitution. </para>

                        <para class="block">That is not the only instance in which the suggestion has been made that each State should be divided into six districts, and that one senator should be elected for each of those districts. The same idea was debated by the framers of our Constitution, but it did not receive serious consideration at their hands. It has remained for the present so-called Liberal Government to suggest that this Senate should be prostituted for political purposes, that each State should be divided! into six electoral divisions, and that the representation of the States should be spoiled for purely party purposes. To effect this object does not require any amendment of the Constitution. It will only be necessary for the Liberal party to come back with a majority in both Houses of this Parliament. If they can do that they will immediately proceed to carve up the States into electoral divisions for the Senate, just as the Premier of Victoria and the Premier of South Australia attempted to gerrymander the electorates a little while ago so that a majority might be obtained by his party for all time. I have no desire to weary honorable senators, but I would like to read one more brief extract. The Government promised that, if returned with a majority, they would seek to do something to reduce the cost of living. When we ask them now what they have done, we are met with the parrot-like cry that the cost pf living is going up in New South Wales, although a Labour Government is. in power there. If that is so, why do not the Federal Government, which so largely represents New South Wales, step in to bring about a reduction, seeing that they had so much to say about it before r Up to the present, when we have contended that the operations of the different trusts, combines, and honorable understandings were responsible for the increased cost of living, the members of the Government have pooh-poohed the idea. They have always said there were no trusts or combines in Australia - </para>

                                <para>- That is exactly the point. It shows how close the lawyers&#39; union is. If a navvy went from Adelaide to Broken Hill, he would get a union ticket, transferring him from one union to the other, without difficulty. That is the whole difference. The lawyers&#39; union is much more restrictive than any industrial organization in any part of the Commonwealth, and most effective preference to unionists exists in connexion with it. </para>

I do not object to the lawyers having their union, but I do ask that the 8s. a day navvy should have the same privilege as the hundred guinea a day lawyer gets. . We were told at the last elections by the Fusion party that there were no trusts or combines in Australia, or that, if there were, they were not injurious. We were assured a little while ago that there were a few about, but that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Groom</inline> had them under his close observation, with the result that an announcement was made the other day that it was the intention of the Government to bring in a Bill dealing with them. This is very interesting in the light of what was said twelve months ago. It only proves what we have said all along. We are now told that the excessive price of meat is due, not to the existence of trusts, but to a shortage in our stock.

                        <para class="block">What, then, becomes of the argument about the shortage of stock? Queensland is the State in which the bulk of our meat is raised, and if it can show such increases in one year, we must look to some other cause for the increase in the price of meat. We are forced to the conclusion that the Beef Trust has got a foothold in Australia, and is operating here to the detriment of the consumers of meat, and it is only a matter of a few years before it will be operating to the detriment of the growers of meat, as it has done in America and the Argentine. We can lay the responsibility for this state of affairs at the door of the present Government and their supporters, because it was they who prevented the necessary alterations of the Constitution. Even <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Irvine</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn</inline> have admitted that the Commonwealth requires larger powers to deal with this question. </para>

I was not a member at the time the works were erected. But the statement of any honorable senator that it is necessary for a man coming to this country and wishing to erect a building to go to the Government, and ask for permission to do so, is so ridiculous on the face of it that it does not require any contradiction. It is an absolutely stupid statement for any one to make. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable senator is repeating a statement which - I do not want to say anything which is rude or offensive - is absolutely nonsensical, because no permission could have been withheld. Seeing that permission could not be withheld from a man to erect a factory, what* is the use of prating that permission to the Meat Trust was given ? If any men comply with the regulations under the Factories Act in a State, they can build as they please, and no power on earth can . prevent them from doing so. As regards the constitutional position, I listened with a great amount of interest and admiration to the speech delivered here last week by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> I think it has somewhat shaken the dry bones of the Government to learn that in forcing a fight between the Houses on a trivial matter, constitutionally they are altogether in the wrong. In conclusion, I desire to get a few words into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> in order to bring the statement of the constitutional position up to date. I intend to refer to a statement made in the Senate by a gentleman who occupied a very prominent part in Australian politics prior to Federation ; a gentleman who played a very important part, indeed, in the deliberations that led up to the establishment of the Federation ; a gentleman who was one of the most trusted members of the Federal Convention, and who afterwards became first a member of the Senate and then a member of the High Court Bench. I refer to the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor.</inline> A speech he delivered &#39;in the Senate on 22nd May, 1901, bears the impress of very careful thought. At that time he had come almost fresh from the debates in the Convention, and was therefore in a position to know what was in the minds of the gentlemen who were responsible for the framing of the Constitution. He was a member of the first Commonwealth Government, and very early in the history of this Parliament he gave the country the benefit of his knowledge on the constitutional difficulties that might be raised between the two branches of the Legislature. I think it wise that his very excellent statement of fact should be reprinted in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> in order to bring our knowledge on the constitutional point up to date. I regret that I shall have to read a somewhat lengthy quotation. I have read this portion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Connor&#39;s</inline> speech very carefully several times. I endeavoured to extract certain portions which would give the meaning of the statement he made in those days. But I found that it was impossible to do that effectively. Therefore I am compelled to read the whole of his utterance bearing on the constitutional question. At page 118 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for 1901, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Connor</inline> is reported as follows: - </para>

                            ;I quite assent to that position, and I feel quite certain that throughout Australia generally it is recognised that this House is  co-equal  with the other House in every respect, except to the extent of those limitations which are necessary to enable the machinery of government to be carried  on.  The only difference that has been made in the powers of the two Houses is the difference which ia absolutely essential for the carrying on of responsible government. Inasmuch as the essence of responsible government is the power of the purse, the initiation of expenditure, it is in the House of Representatives that that power has been placed; it is in the House of Representatives that taxation is initiated, and can he amended. In those respects the power of this House is curtailed; but in every other respect it is  co-equal,  and I hope it will always assert itself to be co-equal with the representative House. Holding that view, it is the intention of the Government to introduce as many measures as possible into this House, in order to have the principles discussed, the details settled, and to have a great deal of the useful work of legislation done in this House while Bills are being similarly treated in the House of Representatives. We hope in that way that not only will, the Senate find abundant and useful occupation, but that time will be saved by work being carried  on  simultaneously in both Houses. I have no fear  on  the score of there being any difficulty in carrying out this policy, as suggested by

                            Neild. I am well aware that the provision with regard to dead-locks applies only to legislation which is initiated in the other House. The limitation was expressly placed there for the reason that the dead-look provision was inserted  only  for the purpose of preventing the continuation  (if  disputes which would stop the moving of the machinery of government, and inasmuch as those disputes can only arise where money is involved, it was thought-

                            ; I think the honorable member will see that what I am saying is perfectly correct, if he will wait for one moment. Inasmuch as those disputes are ouly likely to be of such a nature as to stop the working of the machinery, of the Commonwealth in cases where money is involved, it was thought that it was only in those kinds of cases that it was necessary to have this mechanical provision, if I may so call it, for bringing dead-locks to an end. 1 heard an interjection just now from

                            in contradiction  of  the position I have taken up. I quite assent that there may be most important disputes arising between the two Houses upon social questions, Upon questions of the deepest- importance to the whole of Australia. Those questions may be settled, or may not be settled, the Houses  may  dispute over them, but, dispute as they like, the payment of the expenditure of the Commonwealth will go on; the collection of the revenue of the Commonwealth will&#39; continue; the financial policy of the Commonwealth will be carried out. It is only where you have measures involving the financial policy of the Commonwealth, measures upon which the raising of the revenue of the Commonwealth depend - it is only in those cases that you will have that kind of block to the carrying on of all Commonwealth business, which is to be avoided, and which we think can only be avoided by the adoption of the measures provided for in what has been called the deadlock clause of the Constitution. I do not wish to pursue that subject any further. I have only mentioned it now because I desire at once to allay any apprehension that there may be in the minds of honorable members that any course we take in regard to the introduction of measures in this House is likely to be attended with any such difficulty.

                            went on to indicate that the Senate should take care to initiate such measures as would not lead to a dead-lock. In this speech, as in the speech made by

                            the other day, it is made perfectly clear by

                            coming fresh from the deliberations of the Convention, that it was never suggested that a dispute should be raised between the two Chambers on any industrial or social question. The possibility of such a thing was confined absolutely to. any financial obstruction that might be placed in the way of another House by this Chamber. This goes further to prove that the Bills with which we shall have to deal in the very near future are only designed for the sake of creating a dispute. They are brought in, not because of any constitutional crisis, but merely in order that one political party may receive some advantage over another section of politics.

I tell him that he and his colleagues are the offenders on this occasion, and not the members of the Labour party. The Government are deliberately introducing the measures with the intention of extending their own political influence, and nob with the idea of smoothing the way for  legislation which would unquestionably be for the benefit of the whole community. I lay this charge at the door of the Government, and I am confident that what We say here, although it may nob have much effect upon them, will have a very considerable effect when they go to the poll, and the effect will be felt in the ballot-box. </para>
