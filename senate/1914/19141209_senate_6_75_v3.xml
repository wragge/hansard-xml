        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PEARCE</inline>(Western Australia - Minister of Defence) &#91;3.1&#93;.  -  I ask permission to move a motion without notice in connexion with the death of the  Hon.  J. A. Arthur. </para>

        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PEARCE.</inline>- I move - </para>
      <para>(1) That this Senate places upon record its high appreciation of the great public services  of  the late  Hon.  John Andrew Arthur, Minister of State for External Affairs, and tenders its sincere sympathy to the bereaved widow and)  family of an eminent citizen, whose untimely decease is a great loss to the Commonwealth. </para>
      <para>(2) That the  President  be requested to convey  the foregoing  resolution  to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Arthur.</inline></para>
      <para>I submit the motion with sincere regret. The deceased gentleman was quite &#39;  a  young man, having only reached the age of thirty-nine years. He had the promise of a brilliant career as a legislator, and had already attained a very high place in his profession. His life was  a  busy one. He filled it with energy and industry, and, in doing so, he made -  a  name for himself, not only in the legal profession, but in the public life of Australia. I am sure that the whole of the Senate will place on record this motion with all sincerity, because we realize that in the young citizen who has been taken away from us the Parliament has lost  a  very valuable member, and the Commonwealth a valuable citizen. </para>
      <para>
        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MILLEN</inline>(New South Wales) &#91;3.4&#93;. - I desire to associate myself- with the motion by formally seconding it.I had not the opportunity of more than a. formal acquaintance with the deceased! gentleman, but, in common with the&#39; other members of this Chamber, I <inline font-style="italic">had&#39;.</inline> ample opportunity of judging as to the* position which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Arthur</inline> had acquired&#34;&#39; in the ranks of parliamentarians, and of that brighter future which seemed indicated as belonging to him had he been spared. We, of course, lament the loss of a political comrade, but much more than that I venture to say that we must express our regret when at any time a man who has not yet reached the prime of life is suddenly called from a useful life of considerable industry - summoned away when he was barely on the threshold of what promised to be a career of both, usefulness to his country and honour to himself. In addition to expressing our regret at the untimely death of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Arthur,</inline> this motion, I think, very properly tenders, on behalf of this branch of the Parliament, our sincere sympathy with the inmates of the home now clouded with grief. We can do but little to remove that  sorrow,  but it is possible, and I am sure it is the hope of honorable senators in assenting to the motion, that the expressions which we place on record may  do  something to turn away the sharp edge, of a loss which we recognise is irreparable. </para>
      <para>
        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator LYNCH</inline>(Western Australia) &#91;3.5&#93;. - If I may be permitted, as one who made the acquaintance of the deceased some time ago, and also his people, I would like to add a few words to the expressions of regret which have been uttered. When death comes at any time, it gives a very stern reminder of the insecurity of life, but when it lays its hand upon one of such exceptional promise as the deceased gentleman, it appeals with tenfold force to our sense of sorrow. In the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Arthur,</inline> the loss is no ordinary one for this Parliament and for the people of the Commonwealth, especially so when we recall his militant career. He started in a very humble way without any social distinction&#39;, and certainly with no advantage of family fortune, and by sheer dint of the fine mental gifts he possessed, coupled with boundless energy and will, he reached the very pinnacle of success. It is doubly sad to think that at this particular time, when he was about to  enjoy  the highest gift that could be bestowed upon him by his fellow-citizens, his career should be cut short so arbitrarily. I can only express, with the speakers who preceded me, my deep sense of sorrow at the loss we have sustained, and in saying that I hope that Almighty God will be compassionate on the soul that has gone, and comfort his sorely afflicted wife and children, I believe  that I am expressing the heart-felt  hope  of  this  branch of the Federal Parliament. </para>
