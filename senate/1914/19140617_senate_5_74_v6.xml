                        <para>While most grateful for tha kindness which both I and my men received from almost every one, I cannot help feeling resentful at the treatment meted out by the officer at the gate of the fort to the five sailors who escaped in the &#34; pram,&#34; and were trying to make their way to that refuge of sailors - the lighthouse. </para>
                        <para>When they reached the fort one of the  men was  clad only in a singlet and underpants, while the others had no coats, and all were wet, shivering, and almost physically exhausted. The gate was opened when they knocked, but the officer, finding that he could not understand their speech, apparently took  no  note cf their forlorn condition, and after making some curt remark, closed the door in their faces, and they had to seek the chill shelter  of  a shed on the pier. Surely that officer should have had sufficient acumen to realize tha&#39;t foreigners in that condition had been wrecked, and failing that, kindness  of  heart should have impelled him to report their condition to a superior officer. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator was good enough to show the circular to me previous to the meeting of the Senate. The police neither take names off the roll nor put them on. They simply report to the Electoral Officer, who makes inquiry as to whether the name should come off the roll, and, after making that due inquiry, performs his duty in regard to the matter. This is just on a par with a number of statements which are going about the country, and which it is, perhaps, believed reflect on the Government, but which do not. They reflect on the Electoral Office and on the officers. </para>

                        <para>It is the duty of the Divisional Returning Officer and each Registrar under the provisions of section 69 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act to lodge or make an objection, in writing, setting forth the grounds of such objection in respect of any name which he has reason to believe ought not to be retained on the roll. </para>
                        <para>The Divisional Returning Officers and Registrars throughout the Commonwealth are fully and plainly instructed in regard to their duties, and specially directed that, where information reaches them otherwise than from official sources, they are to make independent official inquiries through the police or postal officials before taking any action whatever in regard to the lodging of objections on the ground of non-residence or otherwise, and generally to exercise the greatest care in the discharge of their duties. </para>
                        <para>When an officer, acting in pursuance of the requirements of section69 of the Aet, lodges an objection with the Divisional Returning Officer it is the duty of the Divisional Returning Officer (unless he is satisfied that thu ground of objection stated is not a good one) to forthwith give notice of the objection to the person objected to by posting it to the last known place of abode of such person, or, if that is not known, then to the place of living appearing on the roll. The notification of objection sets fortli the ground on -which the objection is founded, and invites a reply from the person objected to within twenty days of the posting of the notice. If the person objected to fails to reply within twenty days, or furnishes a reply which indicates to the Divisional Returning Officer that the ground of objection is a good one, the Divisional Returning Officer may determine the objection against him; but if he replies and satisfies the Divisional Returning Officer that the objection is not a good one, or it comes to the knowledge of the Divisional Returning Officer from any other source that the objection is not a good one, it is the duty of the officer to dismiss the objection and forthwith advise the elector. </para>
                        <para>Objections on the ground of non-residence become necessary when electors cease to have their places of living in the divisions for which they are enrolled, and fail to take action in due course to claim transfer of enrolment, as required by law, or leave the Commonwealth. The Electoral Registrars and Divisional Returning Officers have no incentive to improperly lodge objections. They are fully safeguarded against, party political  influence.  Every  effort  is made to safeguard electors against improper objections, and it is unthinkable that any Electoral Registrar or Divisional Returning Officer would inquire into the political views of an elector, or knowingly lodge an objection which he did not believe to bc good under the law. Acting on the best official information available, officers will occasionally make mistakes when dealing with large bodies of electors continually moving from place to place, or correspondence will be wrongly delivered. This occurs under every electoral system; but whore mistakes ave discovered as the result of replies to notifications issued to electors, or information received from any responsible persons, it may bo taken that the Divisional Returning Officers are always ready and anxious to protect the electors concerned from the consequences of such mistakes. The central administration is always prepared to investigate and dual with any cases of alleged carelessness or neglect on the part of officers; but much time would be saved and inconvenience to electors avoided by their replying (whore reply is necessary) to notifications issued by the officers acting in the discharge of their duties. </para>

I am sure that the people would be very glad to be relieved one way or another. I think it is the very least they can expect from the Government, in view of the fact that this matter has been before the Minister for six months. </para>

Is he also aware that with regard to the statement that the door was left ajar and merely fastened with a chain to keep it from  being  quite open, the chain was not fixed or the door kept ajar until after I had raised the question in the Senate ?

                            <para>- Order ! The practice of quoting from newspapers is distinctly contrary to Standing Orders. No honorable senator is entitled to quote from newspapers, in asking questions, unless he is prepared to vouch for their accuracy. The rules of practice and procedure are direct and emphatic on that point. I have allowed quotations to be made hitherto for convenience, so that honorable senators  might  question Ministers about the exact details of matters which they wished to bring under notice, but the practice has been growing so much that I am afraid I shall not be justified in allowing it to continue at such great length. An honorable senator may direct attention to the leading facts reviewed in an article, and ask for information in that way, but to quote the whole of an article as has been done in the past is distinctly contrary to the usual practice, and I am afraid I shall have to curtail the privilege which honorable senators have enjoyed, unless the Senate sees proper to alter the Standing Orders in that direction. </para>

                            <para>But carrying out sound Liberal policy many outlays have been made from revenue that would in ordinary circumstances have been charged to loans which, while weighing heavily on the immediate Budget, will in future tell in favour of succeeding Treasurers, and prove to the benefit of the country at large. It is, for instance, pleasing to learn that the land which has been acquired by the Federal Government for rifle ranges has been bought out of current revenue instead of out of borrowed money, upon which posterity would have had to pay interest for all time. This is sound policy so far as it goes, and should be persevered in. </para>

                    <para class="block">We have reason to believe that the Government may accede to the request of the Shipping Combine for an increase. It is rumoured amongst business people in Tasmania, that in the near future we shall be subjected to very heavy fares and freights on our sole line of communication with the mainland, because, as an insular State, we depend entirely on sea transport. Here is a paragraph which appeared in the Launceston <inline font-style="italic">Examiner</inline> of Saturday, 30th May; and when I mention that this is a leading Fusion newspaper in the north of Tasmania, it will be seen that the information comes from a friend of the Government - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The references in the Senate to the matter of steam-ship fares, as reported in yesterday&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Examiner,</inline> naturally came in for a fair share of local attention. The means and the cost of transport between Tasmania and the mainland are a subject of prime importance to the people of this State. The interest consequently is easily understood. </para>
                        <para>Although no information of a definite character is yet locally available, there is reason to believe&#39; that before long there may be an increase in the fares and freights between the ports of Tasmania and those of the mainland...... The new Tasmanian mail contract was mentioned in the Senate on Thursday. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> inquiring whether any provision was made in it to safeguard citizens against any increase of fares. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> asked that notice be given. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>That is his usual course. </para>
                    <para>Locally it is understood that the new contract contains a provision that there shall be no increase unless it has the approval of the Postmaster-General; but, it is pointed out on behalf of the companies, that if they can prove to the Postmaster-General that their expenses have been heavily increased, and particularly when that has been done by one of the Commonwealth&#39;s own Courts, it is very reasonable to suppose that he would allow such extra charges as might be shown to be required to give the contractors a fair profit. So far, the announced increase applies only to the mainland coastal trade, but it will be a pleasant surprise if Tasmania escapes. Up to the present <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crumond,</inline> the local manager of the Union Co., has not been advised of any contemplated alteration. The local manager of the Huddart Parker Steam-ship Company Ltd.  (Hon. J. W. Evans)  left yesterday on a visit to Melbourne. He goes on the company&#39;s business, and will be absent a fortnight. </para>
                    <para>That goes to show that there is a distinct impression in the minds of the best informed people in Tasmania that in the near future an increase will be asked for and granted by the Government. The Vice-President of the Executive Council, in speaking on the Address-in-Reply, made some reference to this matter. He said, amongst other things, that he had looked through the freights and the fares obtaining between the mainland and Tasmania, and thought that they were on a par with, and in some cases lower than, those existing between other States. He made that statement, which I contradicted at the time. </para>
                    <para>I propose to show now how ill-informed the Government are. I intend to quote the fares and some of the freights and prove, not by a mere bald statement, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl&#39;s</inline> information, whether intentional or not, was decidedly misleading. Eirst, let me take the fares between Tasmania and the mainland, and compare them with the fares existing between the other States, and that is the only fair way of comparison. On the Melbourne to Sydney trade there is a heavy volume of traffic, and that cannot be alleged to be the reason for the cheap fares maintained between those ports. For a distance of 564 miles, the first-class return is &#163;4 4s., and the second-class return, &#163;2 12s. 6d. ; the former working out at7/8d. per mile. On the Melbourne to Adelaide trade, the volume of traffic is also heavy; for a distance of 508 miles the first-class return fare is &#163;4 4s., and the second-class return, &#163;2 12s. 6d., working out at1d. per mile. Let us now look at the fare between Burnie and Melbourne, a distance of 215 miles. The deck cabin fare is &#163;3 2s. 6d. ; first-class return, &#163;2 12s. 6d.; steerage or second-class return, &#163;1 12s. 6d., that is1¾d. per mile for a deck cabin, or1&#189;d. per mile for an ordinary first-class fare. And I will give some more figures to show how Tasmania is being penalized. I admit that the greater volume of the traffic between the mainland and Tasmania goes from Launceston to Melbourne. On this route, a distance of 277 miles, the deck cabin fare is &#163;3 2s. 6d. ; first class return, &#163;2 12s. 6d. ; the second-class return &#163;1 12s. 6d., working out at1&#188;d. per mile, which is considerably over the fares between South Australia and Victoria, and between Victoria and New South Wales. Now, let me take the Melbourne-Hobart route and see how unreliable was the information furnished to the Senate by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl.</inline> For a distance of 457 miles, the first-class return is &#163;4 8s., and second-class return &#163;2 15s., which works out at1&#189;d. per mile. There, again, considerably higher fares are charged than those pertaining between other States. The only cheap fares we have in Tasmania is where the volume of tourist traffic is relatively small. Between Sydney and Hobart, a distance of 623 miles - the route that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> was very careful to quote - the first-class return fare is &#163;4 8s., which works out at 7/8d. per mile. This fare is on a par with the fares prevailing between the other States, and it is the only one that is. On the other three routes the rates are from 50 to 75 per cent. more than the rates pertaining for the two larger States. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. The shipping combines have to meet the competition of outside vessels, which they have not to do on the north-west coast of Tasmania. When I was last dealing with this matter an honorable senator interjected about a comparison with railway freights. A first-class return ticket by the Sydney express for a distance of 1,153 miles costs &#163;6, working out at13/8d. per mile, so that the railway fares are very little higher than the steamer fares between Tasmania and the mainland. And railway fares, it is generally acknowledged, should be higher than water fares. So much for fares. </para>

                    <para>Let me now deal with the freights, as I want to show how unreliable the Minister&#39;s information is. From </para>
                    <para class="block">Devonport, the principal port on the north-west coast of Tasmania, the freight on chaff to Newcastle, a three days&#39; journey, is 23s. 6d. a&#39; ton, while the freight on chaff from Adelaide to Newcastle, a four days&#39; journey, is &#163;1 a ton - that is, 3s. 6d. cheaper. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> told the Senate that the freights and fares to and from Tasmania are on a par with those obtaining between other States. From Devonport to Sydney the freight on chaff is 18s. per ton, as against 12s. 6d. a ton from Adelaide to Sydney. These freights are not much on a par, but the freight from Devonport is 50 per cent, higher than the freight from Adelaide to Sydney. If we take a different route from Hobart to Sydney and Brisbane, we shall find that freight at the rate of 17s. 6d. per ton  is charged on Tasmanian fruits between Sydney and Brisbane, whilst the boats bring back Queensland fruit from Brisbane to Sydney at a freight rate of 9s. 9d. per ton. It is clear from these figures that Tasmanian fruit-growers and producers are being highly penalized by the shipping companies. We now have a cool proposition put forward that, with the consent of the Postmaster-General, the shipping monopoly conducting the trade with Tasmania may be allowed to again increase their fares. </para>
                    <para>I shall deal briefly with the profits made by these people. The statement is made that, owing to the increased wages we are called upon to give waterside workers, it is necessary that they should increase freights and fares. The Union Steamship Company, which is about forty years old, two years ago made their shareholders a present of 200 shares, besides paying them a dividend. They watered their stock to the extent of 200 shares. </para>

The year before last Huddart Parker and Company asked for &#163;250,000 in the shape of new shares, and they received almost at once offers amounting in value to &#163;2,500,000. One big business man in Tasmania told me that in the first week he made an application for 2,000 shares, and could not get a single share. I propose to quote from an interesting circular by Joseph Palmer and Sons, of Sydney, who, I believe, send the circular regularly to honorable senators.

Last year the profit, after paying dividend on preference shares, was about &#163;125,000, or equal to 50 per cent, on the ordinary shares. The dividend was 20 per cent., but it is expected that 25 per cent, will be paid this year; if so, the yield will be 6J per cent, at present, and there is talk of a new issue of shares on liberal terms to ordinary shareholders. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. In spite of this, we have a proposition from the company that they should be allowed to increase the rates charged by them. They are throwing out a gentle feeler to discover what the present Government are prepared to do for them. They fear the result of the elections, and are more than frightened of the Labour party. They realize that this is the time to squeeze the Government, because they feel that if the Labour party are returned to power, an honest attempt will be made to deal with them, and even the present contract may be dealt with.&#39; The companies are, therefore, now approaching the Government to see whether they will be allowed to increase their fares, and still further exploit the travelling public of Tasmania and the Commonwealth generally. </para>

If they had remained in power I have no doubt that those steamers would be now &#62;building on the stocks. When the present Government go out of office, and that will be before very long, an attempt will be made to establish a &#34;Commonwealth&#34; line of steamers, and to relieve us from the contract by which we have been bound to the heels of the shipping companies for the next seven years. </para>

                    <para>In view of the fact that a rise in fares and freights has taken place all over Australia, and that even now they are lower than the rates prevailing between the mainland and Tasmania, I ask every representative of Tasmania in the Senate to support me in asking the Leader of the Government in this Chamber to give an assurance that no further increase of fares and freights between the mainland and Tasmania will be permitted by the Postmaster-General. That is a fair request to make, and I should be lacking in my duty to the people of Tasmania if I failed to make it. I hope that the re- &#176; quest will be put before the Cabinet as early as possible, so that before the Senate is dissolved we may have a distinct promise that the company will not be permitted to rob the people any more than they are doing at the present time. </para>
                    <para>I can assure honorable senators that residents of Tasmania and others having to travel between the mainland and Tasmania continually complain of the heavy fares and freights they are charged. Travellers between Launceston and the mainland protest every time we cross the Strait against the company extorting from them &#163;2 12s. 6d. for a first class fare for a ferry service over a comparatively short distance. I hope that before the matter is finally disposed of by the Senate the representative of the Government in this Chamber will promise to give it careful and prompt consideration with a view to protecting; the interests of the people of Tasmania ? </para>

                        <para>.- This is an important matter from the Tasmanian point of view, but I think that all that need be said upon it has been very well said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready.</inline> As the interests of Tasmanian producers are at stake, the discussion should be removed entirely from all party considerations. This,, is an occasion on which Tasmanian representatives might very well combine to protect the interests of that State. It is no exaggeration to say that the fares at present demanded by the shipping companies from persons travelling between the mainland and Tasmania are such as to insure to the combine a very substantial return upon their outlay. No increase in the fares should be sanctioned by the present Government upon any consideration. An increase in freights is a very serious matter indeed for the fruit producers of Tasmania. If freights continue to increase, it will shortly be almost impossible for Tasmanian producers to compete in the markets of the mainland. The potato-growing industry is extending in Northern Tasmania, and it is known that fruit production is a most important industry of the southern part of Tasmania. Unless the various shipping companies are checked by Parliament the time will shortly arrive when it will become altogether unprofitable for producers in Tasmania to engage in the apple-growing or potato-growing industries. The matter is one which greatly concerns commercial interests in Tasmania also. People interested are beginning to ask themselves whether we have not reached the time when they will be no longer justified in passing on the added expense of conducting business to the consumers. We find it at present sufficiently difficult to retain our native population in Tasmania, and the action of the shipping companies in making these regular demands for increased fares and freights is adding to that difficulty, and makes it almost impossible for us to secure population from the mainland States. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so to some extent, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> will see that the cost of the transit of produce may be such as to make it unprofitable for people to engage in the producing industries. Gold is very valuable, but its value may be largely eaten up by the cost of production and transit. At one time we used to send chaff from Tasmania to Sydney for11s. per ton, now our producers have to pay a freight of 18s. per ton. The freight upon potatoes to Sydney used to be 10s. per ton, to-day it is 16s. per ton. Consequently the producers are beginning to ask themselves how much longer they are to be penalized in order that increased dividends may be found for the shipping companies and the Shipping Combine. I join with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> in expressking the hope that the Government will scrutinize very carefully the claims which the Shipping Combine are now put ing forward as a reason why, under the Tasmanian mail contract agreement, they should be allowed to increase the presents, fares and freights between Tasmania and the mainland. I have no desire to discuss the question of the advisableness of establishing a Commonwealth-owned line of steamers between Australia and the State which I represent. My views on that subject are well known. It is a matter for regret, and it is a disaster from the standpoint of the people of Tasmania, that the present Government have not established such a service. Whilst the representatives of the island State have not objected to the eastern States and Western Australia being linked up by a railway which will cost many millions of pounds, whilst we have not acted in a parochial spirit in regard to that great national undertaking, we do hold that a proper recognition of the Federal compact involves the establishment of communication between Tasmania and the other States by a Commonwealthowned line of steamers. </para>

                        <para>, - I was absent from the Chamber when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> submitted this motion. At the time I was engaged upon the work  of  a Select Committee of the Senate of which I am a member. It is not my intention  to  address myself to the motion at any length. But I am personally interested in it for this reason : Some little time ago when the present Government were negotiating with the contractors for a new mail contract between Tasmania and the mainland a considerable amount of opposition was exhibited by my honorable colleagues to any contract being entered into for a lengthy term. Whilst the negotiations were pending it occurred  to  me that it would be very advantageous if that contract contained a provision which would enable the Postmaster-General to veto any proposed increase in fares or  freights during its continuance. Accordingly I communicated with the Postmaster-General pointing out to him that it was desirable that the contract should contain a clause of that character. I am pleased to say that very shortly afterwards I received a cable from the Postmaster-General in which he informed me that the contract would contain such a provision. </para>

                            <para>- That is another matter entirely. The provision in the contract applies only to an increase in the fares and freights. The Government have no power to decrease them. I was  Chairman  of a Select Committee, which some time ago investigated the whole question, and which inquired into the matter of une fares and freights between Tasmania and the mainland as compared with those which obtain both in Australia and elsewhere. That, however, has no bearing upon the subject which is now under consideration. The Government cannot increase the existing fares and freights, but they can prevent an increase of them, and I am sure that any . Government which may be in power, before sanctioning au increase, will have full regard to the whole of the circumstances of the case. For communication with the mainland, Tasmania is entirely dependent upon a steam-ship service. There is no prospect of getting a tunnel under the Strait, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has suggested, and there is no prospect of a bridge being built over it. &#34;Under these circumstances, it is abundantly evident that any proposal to impose an additional charge upon the people of Tasmania, who desire to get into closer communication with their fellow Australians on the mainland, will be most carefully scrutinized. </para>

                            <para>- Indeed, I do. So far as I can gather, the present Government are hand-and-glove with all the shipping companies, and with every other combine. In fact, they depend upon private enterprise for their very existence. I believe that their party funds are  largely  supplemented from that quarter. Indeed, I am credibly informed that a proportion of the profits made by large combines is placed to the credit of the Liberal political funds in Australia. We have here a system somewhat akin to that which obtains in the Old Country. There, when a particular political party desires funds, when it finds the war chest getting low, it sells a title, or a number of titles, and gets money from that source. Here, the companies contribute in payment for benefits conferred, and in the hope of rewards to come. This arrangement is all very fine and profitable for the companies on the one hand, and for the Government on the other. The companies are making enormous profits - profits which are not legitimate at all. </para>

                            <para>- I do not wonder at it. If one looks at the rates which this particular company charges, he will see they are extortionate. I really cannot understand how any industry is able to prosper under such conditions. As is very well known, the shipping companies are having a real royal time of it. They are not only paying large dividends, but they are continually watering their stock. If any honorable senator will take the trouble to investigate the affairs of the Union Steam-ship Company, of the Howard Smith Company, of the Huddart Parker Company, or any other  shipping company trading either in the Commonwealth of New Zealand, he will find that what I have said is true. I believe that Capital is as much entitled to a fair reward as is Labour. Under our existing system, the use of private capital is necessary, and its possessors are entitled to a fair return for their outlay. But there is a wide difference between a fair and an exorbitant return. There is a profit which is fair and ample, and which is sufficient to enable the shipping companies to carry on their businesses comfortably. On the other hand, there is a profit which is altogether too great, and one which in time becomes so enormous that these companies are compelled to resort to the device known as &#34; watering,&#34; so as to conceal their real profits. In some instances to which reference has been made, companies are earning as much as  30  per cent. profit on their original capital. That means that a little over every three years their capital is renewed. But in order to hide their enormous profits they are obliged to water their stock. Consequently they have to present their shareholders with a large number of shares, either for a very small consideration, or for no consideration at all, so that the apparent return of the companies is not more than  6  or  7  per cent. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Oakes</inline> has ever fired in the stoke-hole of a ship. If he had, he would not say that the wages received by these men are more than they ought to get. Apparently, there is very little on any subject that the honorable senator docs not know, but this is one matter into which he has, apparently, omitted to inquire. I would suggest that, in order to enlarge his knowledge, and qualify him more effectively for the position of senator in the next Parliament, he should take work as a stoker for a few months. He could then come into this chamber and talk about the high wages paid to these men.I was trying, when side-tracked, to imagine the condition of the people under the present system. Everybody knows that the people of Tasmania are in a very bad condition socially. The supreme test of the well-being of any country is whether the population is increasing or decreasing. When we learn that the population of Ireland has decreased by  50  per cent, during the last fifty years, we naturally come to the conclusion that Ireland has been very badly governed, and that her people are very ill-off. I merely mention that to illustrate the commonly accepted axiom that when a country is prosperous people not only stay in it, but grow and multiply. If, on the other hand, a country is not prosperous, people leave it. Tasmania is not only not adding to her population, but is not keeping her natural increase. For every child born in Tasmania an able-bodied man or woman leaves the island. It might be imagined that Tasmania was a country of naturally poor resources, and that, therefore, people were compelled to leave it; but that is not the case. It is a country of very great natural resources. It has comparatively large areas of agricultural and pastoral land; it has a great deal of mineral country, and resources of water-power which are unequalled in the Commonwealth. Its natural position in the Commonwealth, under good government, would be very high. Its present position, under bad government, is the lowest that can be found. </para>

                            <para>- The Labour party went down to come up again, as the honorable senator will find to his surprise and chagrin before many months are over. It went down only in another place, but even there the Government&#39;s miserable majority of one is very little to boast about. When I think of the twenty-nine Labour senators who sit here, and the seven Liberals who do not sit opposite, I feel proud of the Democracy of Australia. I believe that, in the near future, there will be a handsome majority on our side in another place. We do not want there such a large majority as we have here, but we do want a majority sufficiently large to enable us to do something to help the producers. I was pointing out the difficulties under which the people of Tasmania labour owing, in a large measure, to the ravages of the Shipping Combine. I understand that some time ago an inquiry took place into the fares and freights between Tasmania and Australia and Tasmania and the Old Country. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> Finlayson, who was connected with a large engineering firm in Devonport, gave the following evidence :  - </para>

                        <para>.- I had hoped that the Minister would make a fuller and more satisfactory reply. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> brought the motion forward as a matter of great moment to the citizens of Tasmania, and asked for the co-operation of both sides of the Chamber in order that no injustice should be done to them. I go further, and say that it is a matter of moment to every citizen of Australia. Tasmania, unfortunately, is not a self-supporting State. It depends more than any other State on the tourist traffic from the mainland, and if the number of tourists is restricted by oppressive fares charged by the combination at present in existence with the consent of the Government, the matter becomes of serious moment, not only to Tasmania, but also to thousands of people in different States who periodically make for the island State to recuperate. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> speaks as a responsible Minister in this chamber, his statements are likely to carry more weight than if he spoke as an ordinary member. The other day he said he had gone into <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready&#39;s</inline> allegations that the freights and fares between Tasmania and the mainland were excessive. He said, &#34; I have had an opportunity of going through the freights, and I think they are reasonable. In some cases they are on a par with, and in some case lower than, freights to other States.&#34; That statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> McColl&#39;s  is incorrect. Recently, a commission agent named B. T. Clemons, who does a very large business at Devonport, gave some evidence before a Select Committee which was appointed by the Tasmanian Assembly to inquire into the effect of freights between Tasmania and the mainland on business men and business generally - </para>

                        <para>Will you institute any comparison? - To give you one clear  instance,  the freight from Devonport to Newcastle on chaff is 23s. 6d. a ton, and from Adelaide to Newcastle it is only &#163;1. lt is a four-days&#39; journey from Adelaide to Newcastle, steaming all the time, and yet the freight is less than from here; consequently our quotations have to be from 5s. to 7s. under the mainland price to get the business. </para>

                    <para class="block">A difference of one day in the steaming, but a difference of 3s. 6d, a ton in the freight ! When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> went into this matter, did he see the evidence which was tendered by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clemons,</inline> and if he did, I am sure that he did an injustice to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> and to the traders of Tasmania when he said, as a responsible Minister, that the freights and fares to Tasmania are on a par and in many cases less than those between other States. It is characteristic of a shipping combine that every time they get an opportunity to increase fares and freights they do it, and ofttimes do it without the slightest justification. </para>

When the small-pox scare was on in New South Wales the shipping companies increased their fares and freights, and when questioned on the subject by the merchants they replied that they were doing it in consequence of the small-pox in Sydney effecting their business.

                        <para>Merchants and manufacturers are complaining of a further increase in Inter-State freights by the steam-ship companies. In the past the practice has been to make small advances of 5 per cent, or less, but this latest jump is one of 15 per cent., making a total of 20 per cent, in the last six months. Business men  regard  the increase with alarm, and state that it will seriously affect the Inter-State trade. Even if it does not lead to the curtailment of imports and exports, it will necessitate higher prices being charged for goods, with a corresponding upward tendency in the cost of living. </para>

                        <para>This will mean a large addition to our expenditure, but what are we to do? The companies have the monopoly of the Inter-State trade, and appear to have an &#34; understanding &#34; regarding freights and fares which does away with competition. Therefore we are wholly in their hands. We recognise that during the last few years they have been compelled to pay large increases in wages to their crews, but an Increase of 5 per cent, was made to cover that. However, as they have seen fit to charge en additional 20 per cent, for the carriage of goods, we must pay it, and pass the increase on to the public. </para>

                    <para class="block">A Melbourne merchant said that the shipping companies, in consequence of awards made by the Federal Arbitration Court and other industrial tribunals, were forced to increase the freights and fares by 5 per cent. In consequence of improved industrial conditions 20 per cent, has been passed on to the consumers, and this Melbourne merchant says that this was done because the shippers and consumers of Australia are wholly in the hands of a huge shipping combination ; that competition has been entirely eliminated. It is the opinion of other merchants, and it is the opinion of every Labour man in every part of Australia, that, although our friends say that there is no monopoly in the shipping business to-day, it is an absolute fact that competition does not exist as we understand competition. In the days that have gone there was competition between shipping companies, and very acute competition indeed; but throughout Australia to-day, although on paper it would appear that there are in existence individual shipping companies, they are one and the same institution. The fares and the freights are the same with respect to all shipping companies, and it is commonly stated that there is an arrangement between them with respect to the profits which do not go altogether into the coffers of particular companies. They have an arrangement amongst themselves which makes them nothing short of one of the biggest combinations we have in the whole of Australia. This is a very serious matter indeed, because what is being attempted in respect to the Tasmanian Shipping Combine might, should the present Government come back to power, which is not likely, be repeated in regard to other shipping companies. Surely <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> does not want notice of such a motion as this to be able to tell us what the intentions of the Government are! The Tasmanian mail contract specially provides that there shall be no increase in fares and freights unless with the consent of the Postmaster-General. It ought to be an easy matter for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl,</inline> representing the Postmaster-General here, to get in touch with him and give an assurance that the Government do not intend to accede to any demand made by the steam-ship companies. I think it is up to him to do that in justice to Tasmania, and to the State which I happen to be representing. </para>

                        <para>. - It has been truly stated that this is a matter of importance not only to Tasmania, but to all residents on the mainland, no matter in which State they may live. Of course, it is of greater importance to Tasmania than to other States, because Tasmania is shut off from the mainland by water, and is completely dependent upon the working of the Shipping Combine for its means of water communication with the mainland. While all the residents of the Commonwealth are to some extent affected by the high passenger fares ruling, and would be, of . course, affected even more by an increase in the fares, it is the producers of Tasmania who are more directly concerned, owing to the fact that they have no other means of getting that produce to the mainland market than the ships belonging to the combine. In four at least of the other States in the Union there is railway communication linking up at least some portion of the States. Right from far north in Queensland down to Victoria, and into at least a portion of South Australia, there is direct railway communication, so that there is competition for passenger traffic between the railways and the steamers. But in Tasmania there is absolutely no competition, and no means of getting any competition, because the whole of the shipping trade with the mainland is in the hands of a combine. It was officially recognised as a combine by the Government in accepting a tender for the carriage of mails between Tasmania and the mainland - that is, a joint tender from the Huddart Parker Shipping Company and the Union Steamship Company. Prior to the acceptance of this contract, Tasmania was paying; &#163;13,000 a year for the carriage of mails. When the combine were asked to improve the then existing service, and it was a very defective one indeed, they said that they would do so if &#163;2,000 a year extra was paid for the carriage of mails. The price of mail carriage was raised from &#163;13,000 to &#163;15,000, and to that extent the Commonwealth Government control the conditions of the contract, which runs for seven years from the date of acceptance.* The improved service will not come into operation until next year. Although it is unthinkable that the clause in the contract for which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> claims credit should be broken even with the consent of the Postmaster-General in any circumstances, certainly it is even more unthinkable, if that was possible, that any increase in fares and freights should be sanctioned by the Postmaster-General until such time as we got an improved service. We do not know when we are likely to get the improved service, and the increased price is the condition for supplying the improved service. If the companies approach the Postmaster-General to obtain his consent to an increase of fares and freights, the Minister should not listen to such a request for a moment. He should say, &#34; If you do not like the contract, ask us to release you from it. Do not ask us to sanction the breaking of a clause in the agreement which says that you shall not increase fares and freights.&#34; It is all nonsense for the companies to maintain that they are justified in seeking the sanction of the Postmaster-General to increase fares and freights because of any recent awards of the Arbitration Court, because any increase in the working expenses of the shipping companies . brought about by awards of the Arbitration Court was anticipated before those awards were made. There have been two or three separate increases in fares and freights within the last year or two. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has stated, the shipping companies made the dislocation and decreases of trade due to the outbreak of small-pox in Sydney the excuse for a 15 per cent, rise in fares and freights throughout Australia. When trade assumed its normal proportions, the companies did not say to their customers, &#34; Now that trade lias assumed its normal proportions, we propose to reduce fares and freights by 15 per cent.&#34; The 15 per cent, increase remains, and it was in addition to an increase of, I think, 5 per cent, which was made some time previously. Tha Postmaster-General may very well meet any request that he should sanction an increase of fares and freights by telling the shipping companies, &#34;You are doing very well. Although the award of the Arbitration Court may have added to the expense of conducting your business, it was -anticipated by increases in fares and freights made before it was given.&#34; The State of Tasmania is specially concerned in this matter. In the mainland States, with the exception of Western Australia, the shipping companies are brought into some competition with the railways. Even in the case of Western Australia, the Inter-State shipping companies have some competition with the ocean-going steamers for the passenger traffic, although I believe there is an &#34;honorable understanding&#34; between them to maintain passenger fares at a certain rate. In view of the position which Tasmania occupies, no Postmaster-General would be justified for a moment in sanctioning an increase of fares and freights. Immediately he is requested to do so by the company, he should say, &#34;&#34;If you do not like your contract, apply to the Government to have it annulled. We shall not sanction the breaking of the clause in the agreement preventing you from raising fares and freights.&#34; This would put the Government in a position to call for fresh tenders for the mail service, and it would also give them an opportunity <inline font-style="italic">io</inline> substitute a line of Commonwealthowned steamers for those run by the Shipping Combine. Public opinion is rapidly changing on this question, and I am satisfied that a Commonwealth-owned line of steamers will in the near future be regarded as an absolute necessity. I make bold to say that if the electors of Tasmania were polled to-morrow on the subject an overwhelming majority of them would be found to be in favour of a Commonwealth-owned line of steamers trading between Tasmania and the mainland. The Minister representing the Postmaster-General was not in a position to give some information which was asked for to-day, but before Parliament is dissolved we should have an announcement from the Government that the Postmaster-General will not in any circumstances sanction a request from the shipping companies carrying out this contract to be allowed to&#34; increase their fares and freights. </para>

                        <para>. - I support the action of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> in moving the adjournment of the Senate to call attention to this matter, because while it may be said to be a Tasmanian matter, it is one with which the Commonwealth has to deal, and in all matters of that kind the affairs of one State are the affairs of all. There is a reason why I take a special interest in this subject. During the first Parliament of the Commonwealth, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> moved for a Select Committee to consider the question of communication between Tasmania and the mainland, and I had the honour to be a member of that Committee. We made certain recommendations which afterwards bore fruit, and resulted in the <inline font-style="italic">Loongana</inline> being placed on this trade route. That arrangement is beginning to show decided signs of wear. One of the weaknesses of the position is that there is no competition. That is admitted on all hands. Honorable senators on this side representing . Tasmania gave the Government fair warning of the difficulties they would get into in dealing with this question. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> was responsible for the clause in the contract agreement which prevents the shipping companies raising fares and freights. It was most unjust to give the credit for that to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating.</inline> I am going to show that it was unjust. I have here the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for last session, when the contract was under consideration. I can only find one place in the volume where <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> touches the question at all. At page 14 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for 1913 the honorable senator spoke on the subject; but he never mentioned the question of fares and freights. The only thing he referred to was the substitution of another steamer of the <inline font-style="italic">Loongana</inline> typo for the <inline font-style="italic">Rotomahana.</inline> It will be found throughout the volume that Senators O&#39;Keefe, Ready, and Long, before the agreement was entered into, warned the Government of the position in which Tasmania would be placed under it. I find, at page 622, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> raised this very question. Referring to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> he said - </para>

                        <para>He knows that quite recently an intimation appeared in the press of Australia that the fares of the steam-ship companies throughout the Commonwealth, with the exception of Tasmania, were increased. 15 per cent. The increase was to apply to every other route except the Tasmanian passenger trade. If we, by means of our mail contract, give the shipping companies the right for seven years to impose what fares, freights, restrictions, and conditions on Tasmania as they liked, clearly we shall have the Tasmanian fares and freights increased at perhaps a greater ratio in the near future. It is clearly courting the inevitable if we give them a contract. </para>

It was never raised by him at all. It was raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready,</inline> and in sufficient time before the signing of the contract to have the question of restrictions and conditions looked into. I have not had time to go through all the speeches on the subject that were made last session; but I know that Senators O&#39;Keefe and Long delivered speeches on the same lines as those delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready.</inline> In the circumstances, the </para>
                    <para>Government cannot say that they were not warned of the position likely to arise. When they included this provision in the contract what did they mean by it? Did they mean that all that the companies would have to do would be to say that, owing to an increase in wages, they proposed to put up fares and freights 20 per cent., 10 per cent., or 5 per cent., and that the Postmaster-General would automatically increase them accordingly ? But he is under no obligation whatever to do so. If that provision means anything at all, it means that the Postmaster-General is the sole arbiter in this matter. The question which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> put to the Vice-President of the Executive Council was a very simple one, and one that he ought to have been able to answer merely by exchanging a note with the Postmaster-General in another place. He simply had to inquire of that gentleman, &#34; Are you going to grant the request of the Union Steam-ship Company?&#34; We know perfectly well that the reason urged in support of that request is that the wages of the wharf labourers have been increased. </para>

                            <para>- The Postmaster-General knows whether any move has been made in that direction, and could therefore have easily supplied the Vice-President of the Executive Council with the necessary information. We have to recollect that the subsidy which is paid to this company was not fixed by competition. No tenders were called, the company merely intimated the amount which they required to provide a mail service to Tasmania, and their claim was granted by the Ministry, in spite of the protests of a majority of the representatives of that State, who objected to the Commonwealth being tied to such an agreement for a number of years. Tasmanian senators are merely doing their duty to the State which they represent in bringing this matter forward. They are protecting the interests of the producers there. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has now returned to the chamber, I propose to repeat the statement which I made during his absence. I hold in my hand a volume of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for last session, from a perusal of which it will be seen that only on one occasion did the honorable senator raise the question of a mail service to Tasmania, when, on page 14, he referred to the desirableness of substituting another <inline font-style="italic">Loongana</inline> for the <inline font-style="italic">Rotomahana.</inline> But Senators Long, O&#39;Keefe, and Ready repeatedly raised the question of the wisdom of inserting in the conditions of the contract some such restriction as that which has been mentioned in regard to fares and freights. </para>

Having entered into this contract - which I do not think is a good one - it is the duty of the present Postmaster-General to prevent the raising of these fares and freights, unless it can be absolutely proved that the service is being run at a loss.

                        <para>. - I share the view which has been expressed by several honorable senators that this is a matter which affects the mainland, although it does so in a less degree than it affects Tasmania. The series of questions which were asked from time to time by the representatives of Tasmania when the negotiations for the contract were pending shows the keen interest which was taken in this matter at the time. That interest, while it is naturally more pronounced in the case of Tasmanians, is, to some extent, shared by the public on the mainland. On several occasions I have had the pleasure of visiting Tasmania, and I was not slow to recognise the expensive nature of the travelling between that State and Australia. But our chief interest in this matter lies in the fact that the Government may enter into similar contracts in regard to very much larger services than that immediately under notice. The plea, which is raised by honorable senators upon the Government side of the chamber, such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Oakes,</inline> is that wage considerations are a justification for an increase in existing freights and fares. </para>

                            <para>- I will deal with that matter presently in my own way. But I would point out that the habit of attributing the rise in prices to an increase of wages reverses the actual process of affairs. It is the continued increase in prices which compels the workers to demand higher wages to meet the exploitation to which they are subjected. Instead. of increased wages necessitating increased prices, the very reverse is the case. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Oakes</inline> asks for* enlightenment - and the Lord knows he requires it badly enough - I invite him to reflect carefully upon the remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> in framing their indictment against this company. They pointed to the enormous dividends paid on the subscribed capital of the company, and the way in which these companies cover up their actual profits by watering their stock. That is the method which is usually adopted to conceal illicit gains, and it is also used as a justification for further extortionate demands. I do not know to what extent the law can prevent it ; but I contend that, in a case of this kind - if the general companies law cannot be amended to meet it - it is the manifest duty of the Government, and of the Postmaster-General in particular, to ascertain the actual position of the company concerned, what is its nominal capital, what dividends it is paying upon its watered stock, and what is its actually subscribed capital. That is the way in which this matter should be approached. Time after time in our Arbitration Court we have been told that wages  cannot be increased because an industry is not paying. But, unless the  President  of the Court has power to look into the assets and liabilities of the employers concerned, he cannot justly deal with that phase of the matter. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Oakes</inline> is one of those little-minded men who imagine they can score a point by quoting the real or imaginary remarks of union secretaries. Surely he can rise above such petty considerations. I am not aware that any member of the Labour party has ever claimed that union secretaries are so infallible that we should accept their <inline font-style="italic">ipse dixit.</inline> Consequently, what any union secretary may have said has nothing whatever to do with this question. It is quite true that in many instances increases of wages are passed on to the public. But when a firm or a company states that its increased prices are the result of the payment of higher wages granted under an award of the Arbitration Court, it almost invariably happens that that firm or company is paying an increase in wages of perhaps 1 per cent., whilst charging the public an increase of 15 or 20 per cent. Instead of being content merely to recoup itself for any additional cost consequent upon a higher wages sheet it makes that cost a pretext for the most extortionate demands. If this particular shipping company is going to demand that it shall be permitted to charge higher freights and fares to and from Tasmania on the ground that an award of the Arbitration Court has recently increased the wages of a certain section of the workers in the shipping industry, we have a right to demand from it a clear and explicit statement, backed up by proof, as to what additional percentage of cost is involved in the working of its line of steamers consequent upon those increased wages. Because an increase of wages may have increased the cost of the service to an infinitesimal degree the company should not be granted permission to make any increase in fares and freights that it chooses. Unfortunately we have in power a Government whose members are only too eager to go in for contract work of any kind whenever they have an opportunity of doing so. They are only too anxious to oblige their friends who contribute to the expenses of running their party. Consequently we can find no real remedy for the existing state of things until we have displaced from office a Government who are practically committed to this sort of conduct. It is not as individuals that I blame them. As men they may have all the virtues of the saints of old. But inasmuch as they are allied to the party which is founded upon &#34; boodle &#34; and corruption they must inevitably obey the commands of their masters or lose their support. </para>

                            <para>- The Government are themselves indulging in political placards by helping these firms to look forward to increased profits in the future, knowing that they themselves will share in those profits. They know that they can run their campaigns, and get temporary command of the reins of government in the States or the Commonwealth, only by means of the enormous funds which they are able to expend in falsifying the position of the political problems of the country, and inducing the ignorant or illiterate to take them at their own face value. I am confident that if it were not for the command of. funds corning from such bodies as the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, the Shipping Monopoly, and the Coal Combine, they would not secure 10 per cent. of the adherents that they succeed in returning to this Parliament under existing conditions. The only way in which we can prevent this kind of nefarious and dangerous contract being entered into in the future is by getting rid of the party which is so prone to indulge in them. </para>

                        <para>. - I regret that owing to being a new member I am not altogether familiar with the history of this national movement to afford not only better means of communication between Tasmania and the mainland, but also greater and more reasonable inter-communication between the various States. We who come from Queensland know that this is not an unfamiliar cry up there. For years many of the industries of our State have been curtailed by the operations of the Shipping Combine. I should like Tasmanian senators to understand that theirs is not the only State affected by the great curse of shipping monopoly. It operates throughout the whole of Australia with very serious results. It was for this reason that the Labour party resolved in convention some years ago, after serious discussion, to attempt to put an end to this state of things by establishing a Commonwealth -owned line of steamers. That appears to be the only solution of the difficulty. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator is referring to the State-owned railways, but two wrongs do not make a right. While, of course, Victoria and Tasmania are closely associated in trade and shipping matters, Queensland also is very much interested in the question. Hundreds of tourists are only too delighted every year to take the opportunity to leave Queensland for Tasmania, and the great majority of them go there to spend money. At the same time they naturally object to paying extortionate fares for so short a journey. For many years the Tasmanian trip has been the subject of much discussion in Queensland. The class of steamers provided is entirely out of touch with modern requirements. In the year that the Government have been in office they might have given the people of Tasmania a good deal more consideration, both from a passenger traffic and freight traffic point of view, than they have done. </para>

I trust that one result of the action taken by our colleagues from Tasmania will be that in the course of a very few months, when we have a Government in office pledged to the proposal I am referring to, the determination of the Hobart Labour Conference will be respected, and Ministers will see the wisdom, for the sake of the producers and the people on the mainland, of giving effect to the wishes of honorable gentlemen who have so frequently and ably upheld the best interests of Tasmania. </para>

                        <para>. - Considering the interests involved in a motion of this kind, I am sure that no honorable senator can say that there has been any waste of time. When we look at the representation of Tasmania in the Senate, we find that the members of one section have been persistent, consistent, and determined in their efforts that the claims of that State should be adequately put before this Parliament. To my mind, they have exemplified the importunate widow in the parable; they have done all they possibly could do to induce Parliament to confer justice and right on the small State of Tasmania. Of course, as regards its representation by the Government supporters, that is not in question, because the very action of the Government is an exemplification of their efforts in that direction. If the Government have made a good bargain in connexion with this mail contract, their supporters deserve credit. But if it can be shown that the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department has made a very in different bargain, honorable senators on this side have every right to credit for its exposure. That is as far as I would go in connexion with the representation of Tasmania at the present time. But when we come to consider the policy advocated by the Labour party when it occupied the Government benches, and the policy that was put before Australia with respect to questions of this kind, I think that public attention ought to be again called to the attitude of the present Opposition. </para>

                            <para>- Many of the representatives of Tasmania have talked glibly, but when a crucial test came they were found wanting with respect to the policy of the late Government. If that policy had been carried into effect, no doubt at the present time there would have been Commonwealth steamers running to Tasmania, or if not running, they would be on the stocks preparatory to a contingency of that description. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator is only going by the report on the dockyard. I am sure, sir, that if I were to enter into a discussion with respect to that report on a motion of this kind you would call me to order. But I would like to tell the honorable senator, through you. that there is a very great probability that a different complexion could be put on that report if men who know something about the matter had an opportunity of expressing their opinions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Oakes</inline> is always opposed to day labour: in fact, he is always opposed to anything of a progressive character. He has always been a Conservative to the backbone, and it would require an earthquake to make an alteration in his political opinions. I hope that the election which is looming in the very near future will be a substitute for an earthquake,  and if it does not alter his opinions it will alter his position. Whether vessels for carrying mails between the mainland and Tasmania were built by day labour or by contract, they would be in existence, or in course of construction, at the present time had the Fisher Government remained in office, and the people of Australia would not be under the control of a shipping monopoly. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Oakes</inline> understand that position? </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; but the Conservative blood in the honorable senator&#39;s veins prevents him from supporting anything of a progressive character. If, as I have said, these steamers were either running or in the course of construction, and the Labour Government were still in possession of the Treasury bench, no doubt they would have adopted means and methods for carrying out the mail communication until an effective service was established by the Commonwealth. What are the great complaints of the Tasmanian representatives. Their first complaint is that the amount agreed to be paid to the Commonwealth for the carriage of mails is excessive. The next complaint is that, as regards the public of Tasmania, adequate provision was not made for their protection in connexion with freights and fares. </para>

                            <para>- When I am directing attention to Tasmania, every honorable senator, of course, should understand that it is the communication between that State and the Commonwealth which is under consideration. It is not only the benefit or the detriment that may accrue to Tasmania, but the influence that a contract of this kind may have on the rest of Australia, that we have to consider. We must look at this question from all points of view? I solemnly maintain that, as far as this contract is concerned, neither from a postal point of view nor from a public point of view, as affecting Tasmania, Victoria, or any other part of the Commonwealth, have the best interests of the public been duly considered. To my mind, for many purposes we are paying far more than we ought to be paying. </para>

                            <para>- Then Tasmania is bound to make more progress in the future than it has done in the past. I have read, or have had read to me, the history of Tasmania from its foundation, and I have in mind several of the causes why the progress of Tasmania has been retarded. I recognise that in that little island there are still many difficulties to be surmounted before it can become as progressive as the Democrats who reside there would like it to be. If the manufacturing and producing industries of the mainland and Tasmania increase simultaneously, there is bound to be an extensive trade developed between the mainland and Tasmania. Sufficient consideration has not been given to the commercial interests of Tasmania and the mainland. Sufficient interest has not in my opinion been taken in an important feature of Tasmania&#39;s trade. No one who visits Tasmania will deny that there are many interesting features of the island which ought to be known to every one in the Commonwealth. There is no more beautiful tourist resort, and on that account the passenger fares between the mainland and Tasmania should receive consideration in the making of any contracts for the carriage of mails between the mainland and Tasmania. There are those who in the past have been pessimistic enough to say that if we establish a line of Commonwealth steamers trading between the mainland and Tasmania we should have to meet the opposition of the existing shipping  or  companies, monopoly, and honorable understanding, and that the Commonwealth Government could never stand against opposition of that description. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> should like to ask those who make this statement, who will benefit by such opposition ? The Commonwealth might establish a line of mail steamers not only  between Melbourne and Launceston, but also between Sydney and Hobart. </para>

                        O&#39;LOGHLIN (South Australia) &#91;5.58&#93;.  -  As several honorable senators have pointed out, the matter under discussion is one which does not affect Tasmania alone. The little island is the general summer resort of tourists from all parts of Australia. The famous apple trip, for instance, has become quite an institution. Apart from general trade, those interested in the tourist traffic are concerned in preventing the raising of fares and freights between the mainland and Tasmania. There is a provision in the contract with the .steam -ship companies that there shall be no increase in fares and freights unless a case is made out for such increase to the satisfaction of the Postmaster-General. I compliment the representatives of Tasmania upon having secured the insertion of such a provision in the contract. In other States, Fusion Governments have not been so solicitous for the welfare of the public as to provide such a safeguard in contracts with shipping companies for the carriage of mails. There are steamers carrying mails across Spencer&#39;s and St. Vincent&#39;s Gulf in South Australia, but the State Government has made no provision to prevent the shipping companies running those steamers charging . whatever fares and freights they please.

                            <para>.- 1 think that is very likely. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> quoted figures to show that fares and freights in the Tasmanian trade are very much higher than in the trade on the coast and the mainland, but in the Gulf trade in South Australia between isolated places the rates charged are much higher than even the exorbitant rates charged in the Tasmanian trade. A man has to pay a passenger fare of &#163;1 for a little trip of three or four hours crossing from Wallaroo to Cowell, a distance of 40 or 50 miles. The rates charged in connexion with many ports in St. Vincent&#39;s Gulf are exorbitant, because the shipping companies have no competition. The Liberal Governments, who ruled Tasmania for many years, never had the foresight to propose such a provision against the charging of exorbitant rates by shipping companies carrying South Australian mails, as is very properly included in the mail contract with the Union Steam-ship Company, as the result mainly of the persistent efforts of honorable senators on this side. I feel sure that the result of this debate will be put to the Government, and the Postmaster-General in particular, on their guard against permitting any increase in fares or freights in the service between the mainland and Tasmania without due consideration. When the matter was being discussed last year, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> made a short speech, from which it would appear that he almost foresaw the difficulties that might arise in connexion with the contract, and he particularly warned the Government concerning them. I find that at page 1533 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for last year he is reported to have said - </para>

                        <para>Even at the eleventh hour I desire to appeal to the Minister representing the Postmaster-General to afford the Senate and the other House an opportunity of discussing the proposed agreement which, I understand, is to be entered into between the Commonwealth and the Union Steam-ship Company and Huddart Parker and Company in reference to the carriage of Tasmanian mails. It is stated that the agreement is to operate for five years. I think it would be only fair, not only to Tasmania, which is vitally interested, but also to the Commonwealth generally, that we should have an opportunity of insuring that reasonable freights and passenger fares are provided for. </para>

                    <para class="block">That is the danger with which, according to the speeches of several honorable senators on this side, we are threatened at present. Judging by the Tasmanian and Melbourne press - and they are generally &#34;in the know&#34; - there is a design to increase freights and passenger fares, and it behoves those interested in the traffic to see that this design is frustrated by directing early and particular attention to the proposal, so that they may be met and defeated. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> further said - </para>

I hope that the warning which has been given to the Government of the design which the shipping companies apparently have to increase fares and freights will be brought under the notice of the Postmaster-General in order that he may be prepared to go into the matter thoroughly before he allows any alteration of the fares and freights provided for in the contract. </para>

On the Sydney side, we felt that although we might lose some revenue, which might be devoted to encouraging our own producers, the Tasmanian producers should have free access to our markets in Sydney, and in other parts of New South Wales. We gave this advantage to the producers of Tasmania before it was brought about as the result of Federation. We have to ask ourselves now whether all that we did is to go for nothing because a shipping combine chooses to increase fares and freights to such an extent as to take us as far back as we should have been if we had in New South Wales adopted the blind system of attempting to keep trade for ourselves by imposing burdens upon the production of the other States. Any obstacle to trade which imposes a penalty on seller or buyer should be removed. Thanks to the efforts of Senators Ready, Long, O&#39;Keefe, and others who assisted them in the matter, a provision was introduced into the contract with the Union Steam-ship Company to prevent any increase in freights and fares without the consent of the Government. That precaution was taken in framing the contract, and the Government are in a position, under the provision referred to, to conserve the producing interests of Tasmania, and the interests of consumers in the Commonwealth, by declining to permit exorbitant fares and freights to be charged. Tasmania is becoming the summer resort of people from every part of the Commonwealth. Thousands of people, who enjoy the more comfortable winter climate of New South Wales, visit Tasmania to enjoy the salubrious summer climate of that island. </para>

                            <para>- Not only do they justly complain, but when we point out to our political opponents that the Beef Trust, which has worked such havoc in America - which has doubled the price of meat in Chicago during the past few years - threatens to act in a similar fashion in the Commonwealth, they exclaim, &#34; Oh, we are perfectly safe. We control our railways over which the commodities in which the trust is interested will have to be transported.&#34; But in the present instance I would remind my honorable friends that a steam-ship company absolutely controls communication between Tasmania and the mainland. When we speak of the Beef Trust most of us imagine that that corporation deals only with beef, mutton, and pork; but when we read about the operations of the trust in America we learn that the fruit-growers there are up against all the illegal charges which it can force upon them. For instance, a car containing fruit, and running from California for a distance of, say, 800 miles, will have to pay $80 or $90 for icing charges. These are the illegal charges levied by the trust, which increase the cost of fruit to the consumer. I have not the slightest doubt that the same practice will be resorted to between Tasmania and Australia unless the Government take action. In the next Parliament we know that Tasmania will occupy an entirely different position from that which it occupies in this Parliament. Hitherto it has spoken in this Senate with a voice equal to that of any other State; but in view of the recent decision of the Governor-General we are up against the fact that after the coming election, so far as State representation is concerned, we can say good-bye to it. The two big States of the Commonwealth, from the stand-point of population, will control this Parliament after the next election. I hope that they will control it through a party which will have some consideration for the smaller States. Indeed, I hope that even in the dying hours of this Parliament the present Government will bring their influence to bear on the shipping companies with a view, not only of preventing any further increase in freights and fares, but of obtaining a reduction in the exorbitant rates which are already being charged. </para>

But that does not necessarily imply that it will sell more cheaply. The honorable senator, however, at once assumes that it does. No danger need be apprehended from this combine if it does not possess an influence which it ought not to wield. If the Union Steam-ship Company seeks to increase fares and freights between Tasmania and the mainland, wo shall not only have to enact laws to prevent it doing so, but we shall have to prevent it subsidizing political parties, no matter under what name they may trade. </para>

                        <para>. - I desire to say a few words before withdrawing this motion. I think that much good will result from the discussion which has taken place this afternoon, and from a thorough ventilation of the subject-matter of my motion, which, though it is of less importance to the other States, is of primary importance to Tasmania. So far, we have had nothing from any Minister in this Chamber beyond the promise of the Vice-President of the Executive Council that he will look into the matter and advise the Postmaster-General of the statements which have been made here. It is remarkable how my honorable friends opposite always deny the existence of a shipping combine. The Vice-President of the Executive Council, in reply to a question which I put to him upon this subject, implied that there is no such thing as a shipping combine in the Commonwealth. Now he must know better than that. </para>

                            <para>- We have shown that this arrangement is detrimental to the best interests of Australia, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Oakes</inline> cannot deny it. He has nothing to say in reply to our statements that the depredations of this shipping company should be effectively checked. I do not think it is a good thing for the reputation of the Senate that Ministers should rise in their places and solemnly put before it statements which are inaccurate and misleading. The Vice-President of the Executive Council stated that he had compared the freights and fares charged by this company with those charged by other companies, and had found very little difference between them. I ask him to put those freights and fares, before us, so as to allow us to institute a comparison. The fact is -that on most of the produce shipped the freights to Tasmania are higher than they are elsewhere. Take, for example, potatoes, which form the staple product of Tasmania. The freight on potatoes during the past few years has jumped from 9s. to lis. per ton - a serious and heavy tax on the potato-growers of the north coast of that State. On leather, another of our secondary products, freights have increased 50 per cent, in the last few years; while on wool, flour, and general merchandise freights have generally risen. Ask the opinion of any gentleman prominent in the mercantile world about the Shipping Combine, and he will tell you that very often the shipping people will not even take their stuff. Sometimes they take it into their head not to load it, particularly bulky stuff, calmly telling the merchants, &#34;We will ship it when we like, and not when you like.&#34; Almost daily complaints are made in mercantile circles in Tasmania regarding the loss, delay, hindrance, and general inconvenience caused by the tactics of the combine. During a previous speech <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Oakes,</inline> by interjection, asked why we did not prevent the Orient Steam -ship Company from competing with Australian steam-ships. </para>

                            <para>- No; we have a perfect &#34;right to ask oversea companies to comply with the conditions which we at tempt to make the Australian shipping companies observe. I fail to see why we should give any preference to black labour crews. Our Australian mercantile marine is sufficient for Australia, and the fact that it is managed at present for the benefit of the companies and not for the people does not alter the ethics of the question. The great Liberal party advocated a reduction in the cost of living. It must be patent to every honorable senator that freights and fares when&#34; increased immediately increase the cost of marketable articles, because the extra charge is at once added. </para>

                            <para>- When the waterside workers or the seamen&#39;s union or the stewards organization or any other industrial body connected with shipping desires an increase in wages it is forced to appeal to an Arbitration Court. Its members cannot get it summarily at any time or under any conditions. Nearly all these bodies are federated industrial unions, and are therefore unable to strike in order to obtain better conditions. The only method they can adopt is to cite a case for arbitration. That is the reasonable and practical course usually followed by an industrial union. It has not only to wait and waive its right to strike, but often has to take exactly what the Judge or the Court cares to give it. It is not the dictator of its own terms.

                    <para>The newspapers of the Commonwealth raised a great outcry when the waterside workers demanded better pay and better conditions. It was an awful thing, and we read striking headlines in the press about it. It was going to. strike at our commerce and shipping, and therefore it was objected to, and the men were called unreasonable and unfair. It was only owing to the efforts of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes, Mr. Laird</inline> Smith, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> and other leading members of this political party that the union did not strike. This party saved the strike, urging the adoption of the method of submitting the case to a tribunal. Our friends on the other side approve of that, and yet on the other hand we have a combine, not of the many, but of the few, who are interested in shipping companies, able at any time and in almost any circumstances to stick up the whole  of the trade and commerce of Australia, and demand, practically at the point of the bayonet, higher freights and fares from every person who uses theirvessels. </para>
                    <para>As I am reminded by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> they can rob the community, and no appeal can be made against their decision. That is what has happened in the case that has been so fully debated this afternoon. A combine of the few is able to exploit the people. There are no conditions. They do not have to submit their case to any tribunal. They say the freights shall be so-and-so, and they are so-and-so. The newspapers do not object. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Oakes</inline> and his colleagues do not object. Only the worker is objected to when he demands a living wage for his toil. The rich man or corporation can ask for anything at any time, and the party opposite are silent. </para>
                    <para>This motion will probably have done good. It has hung out the danger signal to the shipping companies. It has exposed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl&#39;s</inline> a misleading statements. It has drawn attention to the attempt of the combine to further exploit the people, and I hope the Government will recognise that the Senate has made an emphatic protest against the danger impending in Tasmania. I beg leave to withdraw the motion. </para>

Whenever we have had to resort to the suspension of the Standing Orders on account of the action of the Government we have been perfectly justified in doing so, and when the necessity arises we shall never hesitate to take whatever action we deem to be to the advantage of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>. - I second the motion. The statement is being made in interested quarters that this party is repeatedly taking business out of the hands of the Government in this Chamber. It is singular that it never struck our critics in that way until the Labour party were in a majority in the Second Chamber. Let us look at the history of the State Parliaments. The Legislative Council of Victoria does not even recognise the Government. After the Government has appointed its Minister, its members meet at the commencement of the session and choose an unofficial leader, and nothing can be done in that Chamber without his consent. The Leader of the Government in the Council must approach him to ask how the business is to be arranged, and when adjournments are to be moved. He can dictate to the Government how the business shall be brought before that body. It is the same in many other Legislative Councils in Australia. There is another point that has not been considered by our critics. It has a distinctive place in the Constitution. Is it to give up that position because it finds itself with a majority of its members in Opposition, and a minority of them on the Government benches? The Leader of the Government here has stated plainly, and without equivocation, that they have no intention of bringing business before the Chamber; he made that statement, not once, but several times. Is the Senate, elected by the adults of Australia, because a minority of seven of its members say, &#34; We will do no business,&#34; to surrender or resign the pretence of being a legislative body? I ask our critics just to think of what the Constitution is, and the relative position of the two Houses, and to remember that the Senate has the right of originating legislation. Every private senator has the right to bring forward measures. If a private senator has promised his electors that he will bring forward Bills, there is no power in the Chamber which can prevent him from taking that course. Our very Standing Orders are so framed as to give him an opportunity of carrying out his promise to his constituents. I hope that our  critics in the press and in Parliament, who so glibly talk of the Opposition taking the business out of the hands of the Government, will give the matter more consideration in the future, and remember that we are simply doing a duty in endeavouring to the best of our ability, in pursuance of the Standing Orders, to give effect to what we believe they sent us here to do. I second the motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders, because in doing so I believe that we are only performing our duty to the electors. </para>

                        <para>- In view of this explanation I need not pursue the matter further. Certainly nothing which I have said was intended, and I hope has not been taken, as in any way a reflection or a criticism on the action of the Senate represented by the motion to which I have referred. Whatever view I may take as to its expediency, or its desirability, is one thing; but I in no sense challenged the right of the Senate to take the action it did on that day. Having said that much, I want to make a passing reference to the extraordinary proposition put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> I listened to it with a great deal of surprise, not unmixed with pleasure. He came forward and drew some consolation and some justification for the action taken from time to time by the Senate because the Legislative Councils of the States have done the same thing. If he is going to liken the Senate to a Legislative Council, which he clearly is doing when he draws a parallel between its action and that of this Chamber, I venture to say that he will find very little support from those who understand what the Senate is in the Federal Constitution. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator likes to think so, I am not going to waste time by discussing a proposition so obvious. I have not affirmed that there is a parallel between the two bodies, but am pointing out that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has urged that the Senate was justified in doing what it has done because Legislative Councils have done it. Yet time and again he has denounced Legislative Councils for venturing to do what they have done, for pretending to interpose between  the Government of the day speaking with the authority due to the fact that it is the representative of the majority of the people; he has denounced the Legislative Councils in no unmeasured terms, and now he comes here and says to the Senate, &#34; You are entitled to do what you have done because those august bodies, the Legislative Councils, have done it.&#34; If there is an argument in that, it is to be followed by this one: If the Legislative Councils were wrong in what they did, and if they ought to have their powers in that direction clipped, does the honorable senator mean to say that there is some necessity for dealing with the Senate in the same fashion? </para>

                <para class="block">On Friday, 5th June, the Prime Minister made the following announcement in the House of Representatives :  - &#34; A day or two ago I tendered certain advice to His Excellency the Governor-General, which he has been pleased to accept, and I have to announce to the House that His Excellency has decided to dissolve simultaneously both Houses of the </para>
                <para>Parliament so soon as the ordinary provision has been made for the conduct of the Public Service during the time of the election,&#34; and the Representative of the Government in this Chamber on the same day repeated in substance the above statement. </para>
                <para>Subsequently the Prime Minister read a statement to the House of Representatives setting forth the substance of his interview with Your  Excellency.  The Prime Minister explained that the exact terms of his conversation and Your Excellency&#39;s reply thereto were set forth in this statement. The Prime Minister did not supply the House with the reasons advanced by him which induced Your  Excellency  to accept his advice and grant a simultaneous dissolution of both Houses. </para>
                <para>On behalf of his party, the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives requested - and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, made a similar request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> Representative of the Government in this House - that these reasons, together with all communications between Your  Excellency  and the Prime Minister and any other of Your Excellency&#39;sAdvisers relating to the provisions of section 57 of the Constitution and any action to be taken thereunder, should be made available. But this the Prime Minister refused to do, on the ground that all communications between the Prime Minister and the Representative of the Crown were and ought to be confidential. </para>
                <para>With this view we do not agree. The Prime Minister&#39;s contention is not supported by facts. For in this, as well as in other of the self-governing Dominions, such communications have frequently been made public; and we respectfully submit a like course should bc followed in the present case. </para>
                <para>In support of this request we beg to direct Your Excellency&#39;s attention to the cases set forth in New Zealand Parliamentary Papers 1877- A. 7, 1878- A. 1, p. 3; A. 2, p. 14; <inline font-style="italic">New Zealand Cassette</inline> 1878, pp.911-14; Rusden, <inline font-style="italic">New Zealand,</inline> iii. 278 <inline font-style="italic">seq.</inline> And also to the following: - </para>
                <para>In 1896, the Governor-General of Canada addressed a minute to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Tupper upon the position in which the general elections had placed his Government, and this as well as the Further correspondence between the Prime Minister and the Governor-General was made public. </para>
                <para>In1888, the Government of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> McIlwraith (Queensland) became involved in a difference with the Governor of Queensland on what the latter termed &#34;the question whether the Royal Prerogative is to be exercised by the Governor or by the Colonial Secretary for the time being.&#34; It involved the resignation of the Ministry, and all correspondence was placed before Parliament. </para>
                <para>In 1904, in Tasmania, the correspondence between the Premier and the Acting Governor, arising out of a request for a dissolution hy the Premier and the reply of the Acting Governor, who went very fully into the reasons which actuated him in refusing to grant a dissolution, were published. Similarly in 1009, the communications between <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Earle,</inline> the Premier, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Harry</inline> Barron, Governor of Tasmania, were published. </para>
                <para class="block">In 1907, in Western Australia, the reasons for dissolving the Upper House were embodied in the Governor&#39;s Speech, in which the members of the Lower House were informed of His Excellency&#39;s intention, and relieved temporarily from their duties by prorogation in order that the elections for the Council might take place. </para>
                <para class="block">We desire to particularly direct Your Excellency&#39;s attention to a long memorandum by the late Governor of Victoria <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir T.

                <para>We respectfully submit that these cases, which could be added to without difficulty, bear directly upon the point we desire to make, viz., that there is no rule, as the Prime Minister suggested, which makes communications between the head of the Government and the representative of the Crown confidential; but that, on the contrary, whenever any matter qf constitutional importance or of interest to the people is at stake, publicity is the rule rather than the exception. </para>
                <para>The present decision to dissolve simultaneously both Houses of the Parliament, wo respectfully venture to contend, has created a situation in which matters of such grave constitutional and public interest are involved as to justify the publication of the reasons given to Your Excellency in support of the advice tendered by the Prime Minister, on which Your Excellency has been pleased to dissolve simultaneously both Houses of the Parliament, and all correspondence relating thereto - including that relating to section 57 of the Constitution - between Your Excellency and Your Excellency&#39;s Advisers. </para>

                    <para>The decision of Your Excellency appears to be fatal to the principles upon which the Senate has hitherto acted, which, we submit, are in strict accordance with a truly Federal interpretation of the Constitution.

These powers were given to the Senate in order that they might bc used; but if a Senate may not reject or even amend any Bill because a Government chooses to call it a &#34; test &#34;Bill, although such Bill contains no vital principle or gives effect to no reform, the powers of the Senate are reduced to a nullity. We submit that no constitutional sanction can be found for that view, which is repugnant to one of the fundamental bases of the Constitution, viz., a Legislature of two Houses, clothed with equal powers, one representing the people as such, the other representing the States. </para>
            <para class="block">And we respectfully submit that the dissolution of the Senate ought not to follow upon the mere legitimate exercise of its functions under the Constitution, but only upon such action as makes responsible government impossible, <inline font-style="italic">e.g.,</inline> the rejection of a measure embodying a principle of vital importance necessary in the public interest, creating an actual legislative dead-lock and preventing legislation upon which the Ministry was returned to power.

            <para class="block">The measure upon which the Prime Minister advised Your Excellency to grant a simultaneous dissolution of both Houses is one which, in our opinion, the Senate had constitutional authority to reject, and was amply justified in rejecting. Its passage is not necessary to give effect to the policy of the Government, because the Government has already given effect to the principle contained therein, and by administrative act prohibited preference to persons employed in the service of the Commonwealth. If the Bill became law, no change would be effected. How then can the rejection of such a measure affect the policy of the Government as declared to the electors at the last election, and create a deadlock within the meaning of section 57 of the Constitution? </para>

                        <para>- I feel that this is a matter which ought not to be treated lightly, and I am addressing myself to it seriously. The quite unusual action which has been taken here this evening must be regarded as an effort to involve  His Excellency  the Governor-General in matters which ought to be limited to, and which, as a matter of fact, are the subject of, party controversy. Hitherto, quite irrespective of the heat of party conflict, either in the Federal or State arena, there has always been one objective which all parties have steadily kept in view. That has been a recognition of the desirableness of maintaining inviolate that neutral ground upon which both parties can approach the representative of  His  Majesty. </para>

                    <para>.- I think that the words of wisdom which have fallen from the lips of the Minister of Defence should have been addressed to his own Government twelve months ago, when they deliberately proposed to introduce into Parliament a test question, the ultimate result of which would inevitably be to make the King&#39;s representative in Australia the storm centre in a dispute between unionists and non-unionists. As far back as December last I pointed out from the public platform the lack of statesmanship exhibited by the Government in the course which they were deliberately following in seeking to draw into their ranks a new force to assist them in the person of the representative of the King in this Commonwealth. What is the position in reference to this address? No attempt is being made to make  His Excellency  a storm centre. On the contrary, the Senate proposes to respectfully approach  His Excellency  with a request for the reasons submitted to him in support of the Government claim for a double dissolution - reasons which the Ministry have refused to make public. Surely the Senate has a right to ask for information which any self-respecting Government would have placed before the people of the Commonwealth. Surely there can be nothing wrong in this Chamber approaching the Governor-General through those avenues which will always be open to it, and to the people outside. To the statement that we are attempting to make  His Excellency  a storm centre, I reply that all the suspicion surrounding the request of the </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Government for a dissolution of both Houses of this Parliament ought to be cleared away by making public the reasons advanced by them in support of that request. As a matter of fact, there could be only one constitutional reason given to the King&#39;s representative as to why he should dissolve the Senate simultaneously with the House of Representatives, because there is only one method provided by the Constitution in which this Senate can be dissolved. If the members of the Government in this Chamber decided to stand on their heads on the table of the Senate every day that it met - if they chose to follow the most erratic course - the Constitution does not provide that the Governor-General should grant a double dissolution of this Parliament. But it does provide one method by which the Senate can be dissolved simultaneously with another place. No reason should have been advanced why  His Excellency  should dissolve both Houses other than that provided in the Constitution. If any other reason was given by the Government, the Senate and the people should know it. I challenge the Minister of Defence to say whether the conditions set out in section 57 of the Constitution were the only reasons presented to the Governor-General by the Ministry in support of their claim for a double dissolution. If he will not say that they were the only reasons, the conspiracy of silence on the part of the Government leads us to suspect that other reasons were placed before the King&#39;s representative. The action of the Senate in presenting a respectfully worded address to  His Excellency  cannot be taken exception to. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Oakes</inline> interjected some time ago that this is the first occasion on which such a step has been taken. </para>

                        <para>- I would point out to the honorable senator that, so far as our Constitution is concerned, we are making history rapidly. This is the first time that the Constitution has been tested in this direction. What good reason can be advanced by the Government for refusing to place  His Excellency  right outside the storm centre by frankly declaring, &#34; Here is all that transpired between  His  Majesty&#39;s representative and  His  Majesty&#39;s Government &#34; ? That could be done to-morrow, or at any moment. We know perfectly well, not only that correspondence between various Governments and Governors has been made public, but that correspondence between the Imperial Government and the King himself has been clamoured for time after time, and that whenever it has been thought advisable so to do that correspondence has been produced, if only in deference to the common sense of the nation. The hint thrown out by the Minister of Defence that the presentation of a respectfully worded address to  His Excellency  the Governor-General is an attempt to involve  His  Majesty&#39;s representative as the storm centre in the fierce party struggle which will take place during the next few weeks was utterly uncalled for. It appears to me that the Government have walked into the position in which they now find themselves like blind men. </para>

When it is proposed to present a respectfully worded address to  His Excellency  the Governor-General, we find a Minister endeavouring to shelter himself behind the plea that its adoption will make  His Excellency  a storm centre in this matter. The Ministry cannot shirk their responsibility for having deliberately created the present position. </para>

                <para>SenatorGARDINER. - We are moving along with the deliberate pace of men who have always known the direction in which they are going. We know exactly the goal to which we are marching, and we have been marching towards it ever since we entered this Parliament. I rose simply for the purpose of recording ray protest against the attempt of the Leader of this Senate to shift the responsibility which rests upon his own shoulders and those of the Government. The Opposition are taking what is obviously the right course by seeking to remove the King&#39;s representative in the forthcoming contest from even the shadow of a suspicion, by having the whole of the facts connected with the request of the Ministry for a double dissolution placed before us by  His Excellency  himself. If there be nothing to hide, what wrong can be done by allowing us to see the whole of the correspondence? I am sure there is nothing the Governor-General would desire to cover up, but there may be something the Government have put forward that it would not pay them to have dragged into the storm centre of a keenly contested party fight. If there is anything that they are afraid to have placed before the country, we can understand their actions; but, if they permit the two Houses to go into a fierce party contest without the King&#39;s representative being cleared from the suspicions even of the most wicked-minded, they will be deliberately doing an injury to the people of the Commonwealth, and to that gentleman himself. </para>

                    <para>. - I share with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> the desire that the Governor-General should not be made a storm centre in this fight, but probably from a very different motive. I do not wish him to be made a storm centre, because the electors do not appoint him, and we want the storm centre to come about the ears of those who are responsible for the present situation - the Government themselves. I differ from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> when he says that this action of the Senate will bring the Governor-General into the conflict. The honorable senator&#39;s acute mind is working a little too quickly. This action of ours was made certain when the Government refused to place the papers on the tables of the two Houses. If the Government refuse to make the correspondence public, as has been done in all. other cases when it has been asked for, they must take the responsibility of compelling this Chamber to go further. There are two parties to this action - the Government and the Governor-General. The Governor-General is acting constitutionally when he takes the advice of his responsible advisers, but the House has a right to know what advice was given to him. So far, we have not been given a full statement of the matter, and we have a right to ask what reasons were given to him for putting section 57 of the Constitution into operation. We advance the further claim that, not only the House, but the people, are interested in the question. The Constitution is an instrument forged by them, and adopted by them for a deliberate purpose. They are now told that it has been found unworkable, that a state of deadlock has been created, and that a drastic and revolutionary course has been adopted under one of the sections of the Constitution in order to make it workable. That being told to the people, the reasons for which that section has been brought into operation are all important. Those reasons may disclose the necessity for an amendment of the section. It  is quite possible that, if they were tabled, the people would say, &#34; When we forged that weapon, we did not expect or intend it to have that effect, and some amendment of it has been shown to be necessary.&#34; Looking at the matter in that light, we see how enormously important it is that the reasons which the Government have put forward, and any conditions which the Governor-General attached to his reply, should be made public. For all we know, he may have attached a condition. If so, have we not a right to know it? Have not the people a right to know it? Will it not be all important to Constitution makers of the future ? Will it not be important when we come to consider the question of recasting or remoulding the Constitution? Yet the people are to be denied it; the Parliament is to be denied it. They are to grope in the dark, and not to know what the Government had in their minds when they took this course, or what  His  Majesty&#39;s representative had in his mind when he accepted the advice tendered to him. The responsibility for this action lies at the door of the Government for refusing to disclose their reasons, and it is they who can now be charged with having shifted the storm centre from themselves on to the shoulders of the Governor-General. They can take the responsibility off the Governor-General to-night by simply tabling their reasons. If they wish, however, to escape the responsibility, they can shelter themselves behind the Governor-General. They can throw on him the responsibility of giving a refusal or consent to this Address. </para>

                <para>But  our duty to this Parliament, to the Constitution, and to the electors is plain. It is to use every legitimate means to see that the people know why section  57  was put into operation on account of the measure through which the so-called dead-lock was created, the reasons given for it, and any condition or qualification which the Governor-General made when he agreed to put the section into operation. </para>

                    <para>-3J.- Another sound reason why we are justified in asking for the publication of the whole of this correspondence is that if the decision of the Governor-General is to be taken as a precedent, it is well that the whole of the circumstances surrounding it should be known. The demand for these reasons is unprecedented, says <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Oakes.</inline> It has never been done before, says <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen.</inline> As a matter of fact it is not unprecedented, but if it were our reply might well be that the present position is unprecedented. If the foundations of future Government action are being laid by this precedent, surely the people who are higher than any Government, and in this matter I can say without disrespect higher than the King&#39;s representative, have every right to know the grounds on which such a vital decision has been arrived at. I do not think the small States would have entered the Federation had it been intended that section  57  should be operated in this way. It may be that the reasons when disclosed will show that it was quite right that the section should be used in this fashion, or they may disclose the opposite. The mock heroics of the Leader of the Government when he tries with his well-known acuteness to place the responsibility on the Opposition in this Chamber will, I think, be assessed at their true value by the people, who will put the blame in the right quarter. If the Governor-General is being made a storm centre in this crisis, the public will know where to place the responsibility for it. The Government would only have been acting in accordance with the precedents quoted in the Address if they had given the documents in full to this House and another place when first asked. Those of us who are taking this stand know full well what we are doing. I am quite willing to face the whole of the electors on this matter, for I feel sure that they believe that the documents are their property, and not the property of any Government or Opposition, and should no longer be kept secret for any purely party considerations. It is absurd to say that the Senate, which was deliberately placed in the Constitution as the guardian of the States, particularly the smaller States, which is elected on the broadest possible franchise, and eleven of whose members were sent back here last May representing this party, with only seven representing the other party, should tamely and calmly submit to have its rights abrogated and annulled without knowing the reasons. No one will venture to say that the rights of the Senate have not been annulled if this is to be a precedent in future disputes of the same kind, where no question of great public importance is involved. As a leading Liberal journal said to-day, if  His  Excellency&#39;s decision is to be taken as a precedent, the Senate might as well be swept out of existence. </para>

                        <para>- There is one page in the reasons given in the Address which completely demolishes the honorable senator&#39;s assertion. It is clearly shown that eighteen measures were passed through the other Chamber, and assented to without amendment by the Senate. There were three other measures passed through the other Chamber and amended here; two of these were laid aside because the other place did not agree to our amendments. Only two were rejected, one of which was a so-called test Bill. When the people get these facts before them, they will see the hollowness and hypocrisy of the cry that this party has been obstructing the business of the country. What business of any importance to the country will the Leader of the Government dare to say .was brought before the Senate last session?  His Excellency  may not have been told of these things before. It must not be&#34; forgotten that he only arrived a few days before he was asked to decide upon this important  crisis. No one who knows all the circumstances that have transpired since the Government took office in May last will say that the Government have brought forward any important business. </para>

                        <para>- The country will know that the Government never attempted to do any business, and never intended to do any when it took office. They took office with the determination to prevent this Parliament from doing business. Their one and only intention when they took office on the casting vote of the  Speaker  was that the Parliament should do no business during its tenure of office, and to push forward with the sole object of bringing about a dissolution of both Houses. They may have thought that they were acting within their rights and doing the right thing from a party stand-point, but it is hypocritical on their part to raise the cry that the Opposition have blocked their attempts to do business. The country must know that the Government never put forward any legitimate business with the exception of a few small Bill3, and every one of them was assented to, without amendment, by the Senate, with the exception of two which were laid aside by the Government because they did not agree with our amendments, and one which was laid aside, not for that reason, but because I understand it was their intention to bring it forward in another way. If it can be said that that is obstructing the business of the country we might as well write into the Constitution a provision that the Senate shall do everything which the House of Representatives says it shall do; that it shall not dot au &#34; i &#34; or cross a &#34;t&#34;; that it shall have absolutely no power. If that is to be the position of this Chamber, the sooner the people of Australia know it the better, and the sooner the Senate is swept away the better. This is not a fight between party and party. This struggle should be ranked high above any party. This is a crisis in which the powers and rights of the Senate under the Constitution are involved, and nobody can get away from that fact. The mock heroics of the Leader of the Senate in trying to create sympathy for himself and his party by saying that we want to drag  His Excellency  into the storm centre will be assessed at their true value in Australia. I hope that the Senate will pass this Address to  His Excellency  for still another reason. In view of what has been printed in the newspapers during the last few days, we must believe that it is not at  His  Excellency&#39;s request, or by his desire, that the reasons for granting the double dissolution have not been given to the public. It will be remembered that a statement appeared in the press that it had been agreed between Lord Frederick Blackwood, private secretary to the Governor-General, and the Government that the communications were to be held to be confidential, and should not be published.

                        <para>- If the Governor-General has been dragged into this dispute, it is not by the Opposition, but by the Government. There is the position. Why does the Government refuse this request on the part of the Opposition ? I am sure that we here are not the only people in Australia who desire the publication of the documents. I am certain that the electors are just as anxious and as desirous of having an opportunity to peruse them as we could possibly be. Have we the right to see the reasons? Is government in Australia to be conducted on Star Chamber principles ? This incident reminds me very forcibly of something which occurred several years ago, when the famous Fusion agreement was arrived at; when the meetings were held in secret, when all the documents in connexion with the matter were burned, when even the blotters were burned, and every vestige of evidence that could be of use to show how the Fusionists came to the particular decision they did was got rid of. We remember the resentment with which the people of Australia viewed their action, and I venture to say that the people of Australia will resent the action of the present Government. A Government which is afraid to publish documents on a most important question is one which is not deserving of the confidence of a civilized people. We are not living, surely, in Russia or in India or in some country governed by despotic and irresponsible people ! It appears to me that the Government have grossly mistaken the temper of the Australian people. Our institutions are founded on liberty. But what does liberty mean? It means that every act of government must be made public to the people. That is the true foundation of democratic government, and our friends over there, who pose as the only Democrats in existence, violate the very first principle of democratic government. I am glad that they have done it. &#34; The Lord has delivered them into our hands.&#34; I am delighted at their stupidity, but I am also amazed at it. I am filled with wonder that men who are stupid ever reached the position which they have attained. I am certain that this last and unpardonable blunder of theirs will meet with the reward it deserves at the hands of the community. Now, to go a little further : The Leader of the &#34;Senate apparently knows very little about the theory of constitutional government. Does he know that the humblest citizen has in the last resort the right of appeal to the Throne? What are we to do in the Senate in the interests of the people of Australia? It is not for ourselves that we are asking for these papers, but for the people of Australia. We had an election twelve months ago, when the people of the Commonwealth were called upon to spend a great deal of money, and to waste a great deal of energy in going to the polls and carrying on the various activities of a general election, and in twelve months&#39; time they are to be called upon again to spend a very large amount of cash, and to go through the same electoral exercises, but they are not to know the reason why. On the last occasion Parliament was dissolved by effluxion of time. On this occasion it is to be dissolved on the mandate of the Governor-General acting through the Government, and for reasons which they refuse to disclose. A more disgraceful exhibition of so-called constitutional government has never been made, to my knowledge, in any country. We have the right undoubtedly to go to the Governor-General. Is it our duty to do so? Having failed to drag this information out of the Government, are we justified in going farther? I hold that we are, in the interests of the people. I do not know what the Governor-General will do; probably he will act again on the advice of his advisers, and, if he does that, I think it will bring us to this conclusion, that not only is the Senate, as some people are saying; now useless, but that the Governor-General is  useless. Why have him at all? Why spend &#163;20,000 a year on a Governor-General if he merely records the advice of his advisers? I would do the work myself for a twentieth part of the money, and do it just as well as  His Excellency  is doing it; so that the whole thing seems to resolve itself into a sublime farce, which might well be made the subject of comic opera. I think that we are not only justified in going to the Governor-General, seeing that the Government refuse the information we desire, but we are bound, in the interests of the people of Australia, to. do so. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know anything about that. If the Governor-General refuses the information, we shall have to consider what step next to take. In the meantime we are doing, not only what we are entitled to do, but what we are bound to do in the interests of the people of Australia. I believe that the Governor-General will give the information. I do not know whether the papers will be valuable or not; but, in any case, in a crisis such as the present undoubtedly is, I think it is of the highest importance that all the reasons which animated, not only the Government in asking for a double dissolution, but the Governor-General in granting the request ought to be published. We know that there were documents passing. We read in. the newspapers day after day that the Attorney-General was burning the midnight oil and turning out reams of reasons for the Governor-General to grant a double dissolution. We want to know the reasons, and so do the public. The public ought to know them. They paid the Attorney-General for drawing up the reasons, and it is the public&#39;s business. They have to pay the piper, and they should have every item of information it is possible to give them. I support the presentation of the Address, and I protest against the charge made against the Opposition of bringing the Governor-General into the storm centre of political discussion. If he is in the storm centre, it is the Government who are to blame. </para>

                    <para>.- In common with other honorable senators on this side, I wish to extend my sincere sympathy to the representatives of the Government in the Senate. I feel that a Government who will adopt such tactics and will withhold the reasons they gave for asking for a double dissolution, and will shelter themselves behind the Governor-General, are much in need of sympathy; they are more in need of condemnation, and most in need of the punishment which surely awaits them at the coming elections. The double dissolution had hardly been announced before the official organ of the Fusion party in the Federal Parliament sought to make use of the Governor-General by publishing the statement that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Irvine,</inline> the Attorney-General, and Lord Blackwood, the Private Secretary of the Governor-General, had made an agreement that the documents concerning the double dissolution should not be made available to any one. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> may dignify the party by describing them as Liberals, but I think my appellation &#34; Fusionists &#34; is the more correct one. Thus early in the dispute the Governor-General was brought into it. In the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper of the 8th June, the Private Secretary to  His Excellency  the Governor-General made the statement that no such agreement had been entered into, as was alleged, between Lord Blackwood and the Attorney-General for withholding the documents. The conduct of the Government in this matter has all along the line been positively indecent. We want to know exactly where they stand in relation to the present crisis. If their advice to the Governor-General was sound and constitutional, they have no reason to. be ashamed of it, and should be prepared to make it available to the public at the earliest moment. They should do that, as <inline font-weight="bold">.Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> has pointed out, in fairness to the Governor-General, who has just arrived amongst us from the Old </para>

If the Government were alive to their responsibilities in this connexion, they would free the Governor-General from any possibility of inclusion in the coming party struggle. At the present time people are saying that the Governor-General has acted improperly in deciding to dissolve both Houses of this Parliament simultaneously. We, of course, say that His Excellency was constitutionally bound to accept the advice tendered him by his responsible advisers. We believe that he has so acted. I think that he has been misled by the Government. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; I say, without any qualification whatever, that I believe the Government of the day have deliberately misled the Governor-General into taking the action which has brought about the present crisis. I say that because I have some knowledge of the tactics of the present Administration. A Government that would continue to occupy the Treasury bench, and attempt to direct the affairs of this country under the conditions which have characterized their occupancy of office during the last fifteen months, are capable of misleading the Governor-General or any one else. The Governor-General has already announced, through his Private Secretary, Lord Blackwood, that he did not make arrangements with the Government to keep these documents secret. I am confident, therefore, that he will have no objection to their publication. He will be prepared to allow the people to see for themselves the precise conditions upon which the simultaneous dissolution is to be brought about. Ho will be prepared to give them an opportunity to judge the merits or demerits of the case, and they will mete out to the Government the punishment they richly deserve for misleading the. Governor-General into what I believe is a huge constitutional blunder. I have no doubt that the Prime Minister and his right-hand man, the Attorney-General, in their interview with  His Excellency  assured him that both parties in the Federal Parliament were satisfied that the present position was unworkable, that the constitution of parties made it impossible for the work of the country to be carried on, and that both parties were satisfied also that the only solution of the political difficulties was a simultaneous dissolution of both Houses. Possibly the Governor-General replied to the effect, &#34; If both parties take the view you have placed before me, and you can assure me that you can obtain the necessary Supply to carry you over the period covered by a general election, then I shall dissolve both Houses.&#34; That would be a perfectly proper view of the matter for the Governor-General to take, assuming that such advice as I have suggested was tendered to him. If advice of that kind has not been tendered to the Governor-General, what has the Government to fear? I suppose they would not mind making public the reasons which the Prime Minister tendered to the Governor-General in support of his request for a double dissolution after Parliament is dissolved. But Parliament is not likely to be dissolved this week, and by the end of the week the Governor-General will be in a position to make his reply to the Address to be presented to him upon the resolution passed by the Senate this evening. Possibly that reply will enable all the facts connected with the Prime Minister&#39;s application for a double dissolution, and the absolute terms of  His  Excellency&#39;s answer to the request, to be placed before the people of Australia. </para>

If any party is responsible for the Governor-General being the storm centre it is the Government party. Did not the members of the Government party, through their leading politicians and their scurrilous press, try from the moment the test Bills were mentioned to induce the people of Australia to believe that a double dissolution would be granted ? From their platforms, and in their press, they made no secret of their anticipation of what the Governor-General would do. </para>

                        <para>- As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> has said, they practically instructed the Governor-General from their platforms, and through their press, that they expected him to grant a dissolution of both Houses. They went further, and when Lord Denman resigned, it was openly stated in the Conservative press, of Queensland, at all events, that a change was desired, inasmuch as Lord Denman was, to some extent, compromised by his previous association with a Labour Cabinet. What did that mean if it did not mean that these men desired, if they could do it - I do not say that they could - to exercise influence upon the present Governor-General. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> did not wish to drag the Governor-General into the arena of politics, he would not have made the meagre statement which he did make to the House of Representatives when telling the members of that House that he had the double dissolution in his pocket. The statement he made on that important occasion was so meagre that he was obliged himself to admit that he was wrong. That is proved by the fact that a few days later he had to amplify the statement, and instruct the representative of the Government in the Senate to make the fuller statement here. In the very near&#39; future, the public of Australia will be called upon to decide grave issues. The Government and the Opposition will be placed on their trial, and the people should be given an opportunity to record their verdict. A very important feature of the trial will be the evidence on which the people will be called upon to decide, and a most important portion of that evidence is to be kept from the people if the Government refuse to let them know the reasons which they submitted to the Governor-General in asking for a double dissolution, and the full text of  His  Excellency&#39;s reply. It is quite possible that the Government deliberately set themselves out to mislead the Governor-General in order that they might succeed in the object they had in view, and secure a double dissolution. This would not be the first time that such a thing was done in the history of Australia. In 1877, the </para>

                <para>Fysh Ministry, on being defeated in Tasmania, went to the then Governor, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Weld, and asked for a double dissolution.&#39; A big rumpus was raised over the dissolution, which he granted, and eventually a memorandum setting forth the reasons upon which he acted was placed before the Tasmanian Parliament, and the House gave it as its opinion that the statements upon which the dissolution was founded were inaccurate, and that consequently the dissolution was entirely wrong. It is quite conceivable that the present Government have done likewise - that they have misled the Governor-General. This is a very serious situation. The decision of  His Excellency  to grant a double dissolution transcends in importance any interpretation which has yet been given to the Constitution, even by the High Court. The rights of all the smaller States have been swept away - rights which were guaranteed as a special inducement to them to enter the Federation, and without which they would never have entered it. The status of the Senate has been lowered, and the whole Federal character of our Constitution has been changed by that decision. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. Is it not right, therefore, that we should be made acquainted with the reasons why this great change has been brought about ? The people will have to approve or disapprove of the advice tendered by the Government to  His Excellency,  and they should be afforded an opportunity of arriving at a decision upon it. They cannot do that if the evidence is withheld from them. The Ministry must be ashamed of the advice which they tendered to the Governor-General, or they would not be afraid to let the people know exactly what it was. I submit that government should not be carried on in this Star Chamber fashion. To-day, thanks to the Labour party, the very humblest citizen at the forthcoming election will have an opportunity to express his view upon this issue. But in order that a just decision may be arrived at, the reasons presented to the Governor-General in favour of a double dissolution should be made public. If the Government desire to release  His Excellency  from this dispute, they have it in their power to do so. The Leader of the Opposition will have no objection to with- drawing the Address if ths Minister of Defence will  release the Governor-General from his present position by offering to place the whole correspondence between the Government and His Majesty&#39;s representative on the table of the Senate. </para>

                    <para>. - It is a pity that the Government party in this Chamber is not larger, as it is somewhat monotonous to address only one or two honorable senators. Personally I am glad that this Address has been brought forward. I am surprised that the Leader of the Government it i the Senate should have spoken in a shocked and reverent voice of the possibility of  His Excellency  the Governor-General being dragged into the impending conflict. It has been said by previous speakers that the Government alone are responsible for that. I wish to say that the factors which have brought about the present situation were bound to produce a storm. Personally I am not particular where the storm centre is so long as I am near to it. It is time that we did have a storm, because it will clear the political atmosphere. I repeat that I do not care who is the storm centre. I do not know that anybody occupies such a deified position that he should be entirely free from the troubles which affect others. I want the people of the Commonwealth to know who are responsible for the Star Chamber methods of the present Government. As soon as I heard the Prime Minister refuse to disclose the reasons submitted to  His Excellency  the Governor-General in support of the Ministerial request for a double dissolution, I remarked that his action was entirely opposed to the essential principle of Democracy, namely, that publicity should be given to all public actions in order that the people might be able to pronounce judgment. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Oakes,</inline> who has not the courage to defend the position taken up by his chief, contents himself with making puerile interjections, I would remind him that his statement that reasons were not made public when Labour Ministers advised a dissolution of Parliament is quite beside the question, and is probably on a level with his intellectual attainments in other directions. I am not surprised that he does not understand the difference between the cases he has cited and the present position. </para>

                        <para>- I am quite willing to act as the honorable senator&#39;s mentor. The difference is that where a dissolution was not granted the public could not be interested in the reasons advanced iu favour of it. The reasons which have produced the most serious crisis that has arisen in the history of this Parliament are immeasurably more important than are reasons which produced an entirely negative result. But, as a matter of fact, I am not aware that in the one case those reasons were asked for, whereas in the present instance they have been asked for. My contention is that it is opposed to the basic principle of Democracy that we should be governed by Star Chamber methods. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Oakes</inline> asks what we shall do, if, resenting as we do the action of the Government, we meet with a similar refusal at the hands of the Governor-General, my reply is that it will be time enough for us to deal with troubles when we meet them. We are speaking on behalf of the electors of this country - on behalf of the sovereign people who are greater than honorable senators, greater than Governors-General, greater even than Kings - the people who elect this Parliament, and who have a right to know how it acts. When they decide that they will know what is being done, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Oakes</inline> may make his  mind easy that they will find the means to accomplish their desire. I have no apprehension as to what will be the result of the presentation of this Address. But if it be not effective we shall know what to do. This, however, is not the time to canvass the methods which will be employed. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Oakes</inline> talks about those who demanded a division on the so-called test measure - the Government Preference Prohibition Bill - and secured its rejection, urging objections as to what has since transpired, I would point out that he has been persistently making known in his own sorrowful tones his deep regret at the result. He has constantly regretted that his recent entry into this Chamber is likely to  be of such short duration. I think that, embodied in this Address, are all sufficient reasons why the Governor-General should accede to our petition. I believe that it will be one of the historic documents of this Parliament to which future parliamentarians will look back with feelings with pride as marking an attempt to secure to them that knowledge which is theirs by right. Who are the members of this Government that they should arrogate to themselves the right to cloak their nefarious conduct under the guise of confidential conversations with  His Excellency  the Governor-General? One of my colleagues said just now that it was quite conceivable that the Government may have attempted to mislead  His Excellency.  I go further than that. Knowing some of the gentlemen who comprise the Ministry as well as I do, I say that it is almost inconceivable that they have not endeavoured to mislead him. They would be acting quite contrary to their inmost natures, and in opposition to their whole political careers, if they did not attempt to do so. Failing that candour which we have a right to expect amongst the leaders of a great party, we have no option but to approach the Governor-General with a view to ascertaining whether he will be more amenable than the Government to reason and common sense. </para>

                            <para>- I would point out to the honorable senator that the treaty may be seen in the Parliamentary Library attached to this building. To table it here merely for the purpose of again having it printed would incur quite unnecessary expense. It is already a public document, and is obtainable in the Library a few yards distant from this chamber. </para>

                        O&#39;LOGHLIN (South Australia) &#91;9.59&#93;.- The Minister of Defence told the Senate distinctly and emphatically that nothing would be done with regard to any proposed new regulations dealing with absent voting until both Houses were informed. We have had no information on the matter; yet I find, from this evening&#39;s
                        <inline font-style="italic">Herald,</inline>
                        that a regulation has been formulated with directions as to how absent voting is to be conducted in the future. If the statement as published in the Herald is correct, a grave injustice will be done to members of the Railway Department, commercial travellers, and others who leave their cities early in the morning, and are away for, perhaps, a week. The statement published in the
                        <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline>
                        is as follows :  -

                        <para>The new regulation confines the privilege of absent voting to those who have not been within a mile of a polling booth in their own subdivision on polling day. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>The polling begins at 8 o&#39;clock in the morning, and any one who has to leave by an early train prior to that hour may have been within a mile of a polling booth in his subdivision on that day ; and, therefore, according to the regulation, will be debarred from voting altogether. If the words &#34;within the hours of polling &#34; were put in, it might meet the difficulty. But even that would not remove it entirely, because some people might have to leave close to the hour of 8 o&#39;clock, even within polling hours, without having time to register their votes. In view of the Minister&#39;s previous promise, he ought to tell us what the new regulation means, and whether a correct version of it has been published. </para>

                        <para>.  - I wish to bring forward a matter in connexion with electoral procedure. I know nothing about the facts, except as they &#39;are sent to me by a correspondent in New South Wales. He says that a police constable has recently been round his district collecting names for the State roll, and, in conjunction with it, carried a copy of the Federal roll. In enrolling people for the State, he gave them a receipt, as is customary under the State law; but in connexion with the Federal roll he initialed the names of those who were rightfully there. Whenever he did not see a man who was supposed to live in a particular place, lie did not initial his name. He told this elector that the names of those whom he did not find at home, and, therefore, did not initial, would be objected to, and struck off. It i3 all very well for the Minister in charge of the Electoral Branch, either off his own bat or by quoting what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oldham,</inline> the Chief Electoral Officer, says, to tell us that every effort will be made to give every elector an opportunity to record his vote; but the innumerable instances that are cropping up in every State showing the tricks and devices that are being resorted to, and that have never happened before in the history of the Commonwealth, go to prove that either the Electoral Branch is in a peculiarly chaotic condition, or that the Ministry are making efforts, as I believe they are, to unfairly disfranchise Labour voters. I cannot get away from that conclusion, because never in the history of the Commonwealth has there been such a perfect consensus of opinion as to the way in which men are being struck off ; and, almost invariably, they are Labour supporters or sympathizers. Some emphatic utterance is required from the Senate to deal effectively with this state of things. I should like to know whether any constable, acting on behalf of the Commonwealth Electoral Office, has the power even to threaten men, because they do not happen to be at home at the particular hour when he calls, with objection and the chance of being struck off the rolls. It is scandalous that such a threat should be made by anybody employed by the Department. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable senator likes to think so, I am happy, and he is contented. There is something rotten in the state of Denmark, or there would not be this flood of complaints. I believe some dirty work is being done by the Government, and I have the frankness and candour to tell them so. If not, they should be able to disprove it. It is clear that something nefarious is going on, and the suspicions are not confined to myself. I do not vouch for the actual contents &#39;of the letter, but I vouch for the fact that the writer is a good, straight, honorable man, and, therefore. I have every reason to believe that his statements are true. There must be something very fishy going on to justify these continual complaints. Evidently a movement has been set .on foot by some one, and whether the Minister in charge of the Department knows nothing about it, or the organizations at the back of the party opposite are responsible for the dirty work that is going on, an honest effort should be made to see that it is stopped. If not, we shall have every reason to suspect their <inline font-style="italic">iona fides.</inline></para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Loghlin</inline> has done me a slight injustice. The purpose of the question, which I answered on a previous occasion, was to draw from me a statement that the Senate would be informed before it broke up of any new regulation framed to deal with absent voting, so that it would be in a position to take any action it thought fit in regard thereto. The fact that any regulation published to-day will be tabled to-morrow, and it will be within the competency of the Senate to disallow it, is the best possible proof of the intention of the Government to carry out the assurance I gave that no surprise would be sprung upon the Senate. Honorable senators clearly understood that no action would be taken after the session had closed. </para>

                            <para>- I am not responsible for that. The regulation meets exactly the objection which the honorable senator raised in the Chamber. It was found in the last election that congestion took place at certain polling booths, and it was thought not an unfair thing, not only in the interests of those absent voters who wished to vote there, but also in the interests of residents in the locality, that some restriction should be placed upon those who for no sound reason sought to use a polling booth other than their own. Therefore, this new regulation provides that before any one is entitled to vote as an absent voter - that is, outside his own subdivision - he must be in a position to say that he has not been there during the polling hours. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator will see that the original proposition, which received, so I was informed, the approval of the Leader of the Labour party, was a prohibition against any one voting as an absent voter who had been in his subdivision between polling hours. The only alteration made is to say, &#34; Within a mile of the subdivision,&#34; which enlarges the boundaries within which he may roam. </para>

                            <para>- The regulation does give a man a larger area to roam over, and therefore is more liberal than the old one. It is a little unfortunate that a statement should be made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> in that way. I venture to express the opinion that when the effect of the alteration is thoroughly understood there will be no re-affirmation such as that made by the honorable senator just now. I cannot say that I was surprised at the action of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> but it is a little extraordinary that he should come here and say it is clear that nefarious practices are going on. He made that statement simply because he held in his hand a letter, for the accuracy of which he would not vouch. To-day we had some examples of the kind of statements that are brought here and put forward as if they were proofs. Take the two statements which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> gave with the utmost confidence to the Senate. </para>

As far as they have made definite statements, and we have been able to inquire into them, they have been refuted. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell,</inline> for instance, gave the names of two electoral registrars who he said he knew had refused to receive objections to enrolment from representatives of the Labour organization, whilst they were receiving similar objections from the representatives of the Liberal organization. To that definite statement the two officials gave an emphatic denial. </para>

Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell&#39;s</inline> statement was that he had received objections from the Liberals whilst refusing them from Labour.

Let me take another statement which can be clearly refuted by a reference to public records. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russellsaid</inline> that at Swan Hill, with a population of 2,000 people, no fewer than 500 objections to enrolment had been lodged. That is the kind of statement which has been thrown broadcast about this country. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and I know what the honorable senator is giving it for. It is made clear against the honorable senator and others that they are throwing these statements about in order to impress the public mind with the idea that something wrong is going on. The facts are not only that the population of Swan Hill is not 2,000, but that there were no fewer than 3,364 enrolments. Therefore, it can be taken for granted that the population of the place is more than double 2,000. . Yet, in spite of that fact, the number of objections lodged was 164. That is a sample of the gross exaggerations which honorable senators opposite are proposing to throw about this country as facts- as evidence of some corrupt practice on the part of the Government? </para>
