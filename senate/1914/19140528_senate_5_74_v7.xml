                        <para>- Yesterday I asked the Minister representing the Minister of Home Affairs whether a certain decision was due to the fact that the Assistant Minister of Homo Affairs had decided to cancel the agreement to give <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith a further contract from the 122-mile peg to the 129-mile peg, and the reply was, " The Minister made no such agreement with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith." I now ask if it is not a fact that the Minister put the rubber stamp to an agreement promising <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith a further contract if the first contract was satisfactorily carried out? </para>

He took the recommendation as applying to the section from 92 to 106 miles. He remembers that the recommendation in question was handed to the Minister shortly after he and the others arrived, and that after reading it the Minister asked the Engineer-in-Chief whether he had satisfied himself as to the rates asked for being if anything slightly less than the rates paid by the Government of South Australia to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith for similar work, and that on receipt of the Engineer- inChief's assurance of this fact, I stamped my approval on the papers.

                            <para>. - It is some time since the Senate was addressed by an honorable senator from this side, but, owing to the paucity of our numbers, and the fact that we are three short on the Government side, we may be excused for not having sooner addressed ourselves to the motion. Before proceeding with what I wish to say upon the motion, I should like to thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> -on behalf of the Government, for so kindly sending a letter of condolence to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barker</inline> in connexion with his recent bereavement. I have myself experienced a similar bereavement, and am therefore in a position to keenly sympathize with the honorable senator. I think it is very pathetic to men like the honorable senator and myself, who started very humbly in life, with the advantage of some one to help us to bear the heat and burden of the day, to rear our children, aud to assist us through all our needs, that our helper should be taken away when life had become brighter, and there seemed to be a happy future before us. I desire to express the condolences of the Government to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barker,</inline> and to again thank you, sir, for your kind action. The speeches which have been delivered on this motion have been very uniform in character. We have not had very much to encourage us, as the speeches have simply been fault finding from beginning to end. The Government and their supporters represent a small minority in the Senate, and, on this account, have been made the subject of pity and derision. We do not seek the pity of honorable senators opposite, and we do not trouble about their derision. To listen to some of the things which have been said, one would think that we have no right to be on this side of the Chamber, that we are usurpers and interlopers; but, as a matter of fact, we are here by the will of the people. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> a little time ago, submitted some figures to the Chamber, and admitted that a majority of Liberal votes are represented in the Senate, though there is a considerable majority of Labour senators in this Chamber. . The honorable senator contended, however, that the party on his side have a majority in the country, because members of that party represent a majority of the votes polled for the House of Representatives. At the last general elections there were 1,900,369 votes polled for the House of Representatives. Of that number, 936,950 were Liberal votes, and 956,546 Labour votes, while there were 6,873 Independent votes. In the first figures there are not included the votes for the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne and for Miss Goldstein. It is well known that very many Liberal votes we're recorded for <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne which would not in any case have gone to a Labour candidate. There is little doubt that the bulk of Miss Goldstein's votes were Labour votes; but there were still a sprinkling of Liberals amongst those who voted for her. I calculate that of the Independent votes recorded there would be 5,796 Liberal votes and 1,077 Labour votes. This would mean that for the </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para class="block">House of Representatives 942,746 Liberal votes were recorded and 957,623 Labour votes, a difference of 14,877 votes in favour of the Labour party. The circumstances of elections for this House and the House of Representatives vary considerably, and, after all, it is the voting for the Senate that is the true criterion of the way in which parties stand in the country. There is no doubt that there was some extraordinary voting for Senate candidates at the last elections, and when this is taken into account, with the great disparity between the numbers returned for either party, it is clear that there is something very defective, in an electoral system which permits of such results. For the Senate there were no uncontested seats, and the Liberal votes recorded numbered 2,840,420; Labour votes, 2,802,529; a difference of 37,891. We have to add to the Liberal votes 25,528 recorded for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Renwick,</inline> 18,556 recorded for <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Josiah</inline> Symon, and 4,615 recorded for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cameron.</inline> This will make the Liberal figures 2,889,119. We can add to the Labour votes those recorded for the Socialist or Independent candidates of New South Wales - Moroney, Batho, and Ostler - numbering 60,549. That would make the total votes recorded for Labour 2,863,078, a minority in the Senate voting of 26,041. So that we are here by a majority of the Liberal voters of Australia. There is no doubt that the voting was extraordinary. In Victoria, for instance, I think there was a difference of only some 7,000 votes between the first and the fifth on the poll. I was myself not far behind the leading candidate's votes. Though the strength of the parties was so nearly equal in the country, there is a very great difference in the numbers by which we are respectively represented in the Senate. That leads me to say that the present representation of parties in the Senate is not at all a true reflection of public opinion, and, in the circumstances, it is not unreasonable to ask that the Senate should be sent back to the country to obtain from the electors some more definite result. We have had a large number of speeches which, as I have said, were not calculated to allay political feeling, but rather to stir it up. There has been a good deal of vituperation, misrepresentation and abuse of the Government by honorable senators opposite, with the exception only of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>
                        <para class="block">Pearce, who made a courteous speech, of which we could not complain, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin,</inline> who was more than courteous, who debated the motion in a gentlemanly manner, for which I thank him. Let me say that the bitter speeches that have been made, so far from doing the speakers or the party they represent any good, must have a tendency to defeat the ends for which they were delivered. I do not think the most pronounced partisan outside will believe that Ministers are such a foolish, useless, degraded band of men as we have been depicted to be in this Chamber. We have been told by the Leader of the Opposition that we are prepared to eat dirt in order to retain office. It looks to me as if honorable senators opposite are quite willing to throw mud in order to secure office. We have been charged with grovelling to the State Premiers, and of course on the principle of "like leader like men," the rank and file have followed in the same strain. I hope to show that this criticism is unmerited, that we are prepared to submit ourselves again to the people, and to abide by their verdict. Not only have political charges been made against us, but personal charges of dishonour, of untruthfulness, and of want of patriotism have been made against me. The Leader of the Opposition in another place recently travelled through this continent, and repeated the statements which had  been made against me here, though </para>
                        <para>Jio  did not repeat them correctly. Other members of this Parliament have gone through the country, and have practically made the same charges. It is not pleasant for me to deal with matters personal to myself, but seeing that these accusations have been spread broadcast throughout Australia, it is incumbent upon me to do so, and to set things in their proper light. Over and over again, both in this chamber and outside of it, I have been charged with having made certain statements at Fitzroy." In some cases those statements have been quoted correctly, but in others they have not. I propose to read the statements so that no doubt may exist as to what I  really  did say. I said at Fitzroy that - </para>

                        <para class="block">Queensland, 17,000 in South Australia, 11,000 in Western Australia, and 7,000 in Tasmania. How was that ? The worst of it was that a lot of people voted twice. They had even resurrected the dead to vote. The Ministry was trying to get to the bottom of it, but it was found that while the parties which passed the Electoral Act and were responsible for the conduct of the elections had left as many doors open as possible for wrong-doing, they had practically shut every door* which would enable the mischief to be traced to its source. </para>
                        <para class="block">That is the statement which I made at Fitzroy, and I stand by every word of it to-day. </para>

                                <para>- I repeat that statement to-day. In the first place I said that there had been an inflation of the rolls. The accuracy of my statement was denied. But I have here a return to the order of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> which shows that on the 31st May last there were 184,216 more names upon the roll than were eligible to be there. That is a very great disparity, but when we consider that there were tens of thousands of names not on the rolls at all - names which ought to have been there - the disparity becomes very much greater. My statement, therefore, is absolutely borne out by the official figures which have been laid before this Chamber. I said, also, that a lot of people' had voted twice. Inquiry has been made into this allegation, and it has been ascertained that there were quite a number of duplications of votes - cases of electors whose names were marked on the lists of certified voters as having voted more than once as ordinary voters and absent voters. The total of these is 5,760. We have been assured that a lot of these duplications were the result of mistakes. Some of them may have been. But there cannot have been a very large number which can honestly be attributed to wrong marking. These duplications, we are told, do not represent much in a large country like Australia, which possesses so many polling places. But when we recollect that the fate of the last election turned upon 330 votes in the Hume electorate it will be seen that the figures I have given are of immense importance. I would further point out that information has been obtained by the Electoral Commission - especially in Queensland - which amply confirms the accuracy of my statements.

                            <para>The last new print of rolls was in December. The roll put out in December contained 1,000 less names than the roll used on election day. The purging of the rolls had practically only gone on since the beginning of this year. He saw hundreds of claims that were signed by the witness and not the claimant. There were 211 persons to his knowledge who claimed to be on the roll whose names were not there, though they had received cards acknowledging their claims. In his investigations he had found illegal practices, such as one person applying for enrolment under two different names. He had also found that some persons had applied for enrolment, giving a place of residence, and, on inquiry, it was found that they did not live at those places at all. He had only known of two prosecutions in Queensland, one for obtaining enrolment under the age of twenty-one years and the other for signing the whole of the applications of a family for enrolment. He had directed the attention of the electoral officer to the irregularities he had discovered. There were 1,200 names on the Mackay subdivision roll that should not be there. If the card system were kept up to date there would be no duplication. The District Returning Officer at Oxley was responsible for allowing the names of dead people to remain on the roll. Witness told <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Allars,</inline> the Commonwealth Electoral Officer, and he said that there was no time to take the names off, and the roll went to the printers. Since the 1912 printed roll was issued witness had taken off 5,000 names that had no right to be there. He did not believe that there was  an  organized attempt at double voting at the last election. Tally slips were not allowed to be sent from the polling booth to the committee rooms. </para>

I wish to say that he did not make an inquiry of that character at all. He was sent to Ballarat to ascertain whether thirty-five persons whose names appeared on the roll actually existed. He learned that they did. Subsequently, when he was before the Electoral Commission, he was asked whether his inquiries had gone further, and he replied that they had not.

                                <para>- They have been given to me as the names of the same persons. Of course, I do not say that these persons voted twice. I merely say that their names appeared on two rolls, which they ought not to have done, if the :rolls had been properly cleansed. When :a strict inquiry was subsequently made into the conduct of the election at Ballarat by the defeated candidate, it was found that there had been 230 cases of duplication there. Out of this number 115 were duplicate votes, which had been polled at Ballarat. Had there been a  sufficient  number to cover the minority in which the defeated candidate found himself, he could have gone to the Court of Disputed Returns, and probably have -succeeded in upsetting the election. There was not a sufficient number, however, and, consequently, he had to abide by the result. The number of absent votes polled at the last election - 198,373 in all - was extraordinary. At Perth there were no fewer than 6,568 such votes recorded. Now, Perth is not a large place, and it does seem extraordinary that such a number of absent votes should have been polled there. All these figures go. to show that my statements, at Fitzroy were not highly coloured in any way, but are absolutely borne out by facts. Since then I have been supplied with the names of four or five persons who are dead, but who were personated at the last election. The initials of one of them is F. P., of Kyneton, the  number  on the roll of another one a,t Ballarat East is 4877, that of a third at Ballarat West is 3470, another at Lal Lal 570, and that of another at Mount Pleasant is 267. </para>

                                <para>- I did not. I said ""they" resurrected them. As a matter of fact, the remark was made in a jocular manner, and if such a mountain had not been made of it by honorable senators opposite, I would have passed it by without further notice. I did not say who resurrected them. As regards the doors  being  thrown open for wrong-doing, I say that the system of absent voting made it possible to personate absent persons. As a result of the absent vote, the polling places throughout Australia were congested, so that the electors in other portions of the polling booths did not get the attention which they required. A person travelling through the States could, if he chose to commit- a breach of the law, enroll in each State, and cast a vote for each State, without any possibility of being found out. There might be ian Intra-State check, because in Victoria, for instance, we have the card, index, with the names of all who are on the roll in this State; but to secure an Inter-State check - that is, the checking of names across the borders - is almost impossible. Every one must remember the outcry that was raised at the time. The press rang with it for two or three weeks; it was difficult to prove that these things had happened, but enough has been discovered to show that abuses did exist. When we remember that the official return gave 73.66 per cent, of the electors enrolled voting, even if we take off the rolls the 184,000 names in excess, we must see that there must have been of actual voters an even larger percentage than 73.66 per cent. It will be remembered that a circular was sent out stating that under no consideration were station managers, owners, or overseers to be employed in any way in regard to an election. That was not a right thing to do, and was an insult to a most respectable class. We hope to bring about an improvement in electoral matters. I have been placed in charge of electoral affairs, and in carrying out the duties of my office I shall not seek to obtain any party advantage whatever. I simply seek to see that every one who should be on the roll ison it, and that every one who should not be on it is off it. Seventy Divisional Returning Officers have been appointed, who will also take up the duties of registrars. I do not know one of these men, even by sight, either in Victoria or in any other State, and I have not interfered in their appointment, which has been made, by the Public Service Commissioner. Another charge that has been made against me is that I referred to the Commonwealth Bank in a way that I had no right to do. I have yet to learn that a Minister of the Crown cannot refer to and criticise the bank. It is a fair subject for criticism; it is the people's bank, and the people have to be behind it. If mistakes are made, or if shortages occur, the people have to find them. What stands behind the bank is the taxing power of the Government and the land of the country, and I am perfectly justified in referring to it so long as I say what is true about it. The Leader of the Opposition took me severely to task about referring to this question at all. He said that I had made statements which were not correct in saying there was a debit of over £56,000. I think the words I used were "over £50,000." At any rate, that is the information I had at the time. The honorable member said that the day before I spoke a balance-sheet had been sent to the Treasury, showing that a small profit had been made. These things do not go round to Ministers, as those who have been Ministers know very well. They may lie ali the Treasury for months,  and other members of the Government would know nothing about them unless a special copy was sent to them. The information that was public at the time showed that the statement I made was correct. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> at the Melbourne Town Hall, said the Ministry were biting and snarling and jeering at the bank. That is not the case. They are not carrying on against the bank in that fashion. At the same time, they have a right to make remarks about it. The attitude of Liberals towards the bank, from first to last, has been that .they desired to see it on a sound basis, to see a truly national bank, doing all Government business, but not interfering very much with the other banks. It was not started, however, with a desire to have a truly national bank. It was started in an endeavour to destroy the other banks, in which the savings of the people were - in which the money that was to keep widows and orphans had probably been invested. A manifesto, published in 1910 by the Labour party, containing the portraits of the three Senate candidates, included the following striking passage, showing the real intention behind the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank: - </para>

                            <para>Banking is one of the frauds by which Capitalism bleeds the people. There are twenty-one privately-owned banks in the Commonwealth, which virtually control the industry and commerce of Australia, and make £1,500,000 a year profit out of their operations. The Labour proposal is not to nationalize the existing banks, but to establish a Commonwealth Bank, with unlimited powers, which will have a branch in every considerable centre in Australia, and will enter into competition with the company-owned banks. The proposed bank would be one of the strongest in the world, and would, of course, manage the Public Debt of the Commonwealth. The gradual extinction, without compensation, of the present banks would follow as a matter of course. </para>

                        <para class="block">The latest return shows that the loss on the operations of the bank to 31st December last was £45,098. We were told on many platforms that it made a profit of about £1,500 last year, but those who made that statement did not say that the old loss remained, minus that amount. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> spoke at Bendigo, people in the audience assured me that they went away with the impression that the bank had overtaken its debit, and was £1,500 in credit. That was the impression created at every meeting, whereas, as a matter of fact, the bank had only reduced its debit of £45,000 odd by that £1,500.  When I made my statement about the loss made by the bank, the latest published balance-sheet that I had seen showed that there was a loss of £45,000 or £46,000, and between £6,000 and £7,000 owing to the Post Office, making a total debit of between £53,000 and £54,000. That is not the full total either, because we find that the establishment of the bank caused a loss to the Commonwealth of money which was being paid by the States for the use of the Post Office Savings Banks to the extent of £34,137 a year. Previous to the establishment of the bank the money paid by the Commonwealth for exchange on cheques was 'a comparatively small amount, but on the Estimates this year a sum of £8,000 is put down to cover exchange on cheques. On inquiry, I learned that previously some exchange was payable, but that considerably over half that amount would be required to pay exchange which would not have had to be paid but for the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank. </para>

                                <para>- I do not think the Commonwealth gets it. The Commonwealth has to pay it, because other banks which did not charge exchange before now do so. There was also a loss of £85,000 to the States by the establishment of the note issue and the consequent abolition of the note tax. While we all wish the bank well - and I believe the Government, in placing the proposal it has before the Premiers' Conference, is going on sound lines and seeking to make the bank fulfil the functions that it ought to fulfil as a. truly national bank - there is no need for us to mix the Savings Bank business up with ordinary business. It is too much to put the control of six and a half millions of money into the hands of one man without any committee or board to counsel or guide him. The country is responsible, and there ought to be some board of advice, council or committee, associated with the governor in the management of the bank. We were promised that the bank was going to make money cheap and plentiful; but since the note issue was sent out, money has hardened, not entirely, but partly, for that reason. It is harder to-day than it was before the bank started. I do not blame the governor for doing a safe business. He is there to do it, and he should run no risks. He is making a small profit, and I hope he will still further overtake the first loss; but if the proposals made to the State Premiers are carried out, the bank will be in a still stronger position; it will secure the confidence of the public, stand behind the other banks in times of stress and strain, and make the financial position of Australia very much better than it is to-day. We are scoffed at to-day because the States would not hand over to the Commonwealth Savings Bank the money now in the State Savings Banks. If the money in the State Savings Banks had not been well used, there might be some reason for making a change; but in all the States it has been put under the management of splendid business men, and been excellently used to aid in developing the country. There was no reason whatever to start, a Commonwealth Savings Bank, and still less reason to take the money out of the State Savings Banks, and hand it over to an institution  under one  man, whose management the States knew nothing whatever about, with all the uncertainty that must follow from that state of affairs. It was under good investment in the hands of capable men, and they were wise to keep it there. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> at Ringwood, made certain other remarks. He said no man or woman should be without a chance of earning a living. He must surely be a humorist, and must have forgotten how many people he and his party are throwing out of a living now because they will not work with them. He ought to remember a few of these things. He referred also to the fact that children were in tears because they could not get the necessary school, books, and said we ought to find meals for school children. </para>

                        <para class="block">He did not reckon that free education, kindergarten, and universities would cost, on the lines he suggested, some £6,000,000 or £7,000,000 a year. He did not tell the people that. It is a slander and slur on our educational system to say that our people cannot find the small amount necessary for school books, and that children require to be fed at the expense of the State. There may be a few children who are needy, but we could not make a distinction between them and the others. If we did, we should be accused of pauperizing them. It is not right that our people should be branded by the leader of one of the great political parties in this country as being too poor to provide food or books for their children. The honorable member's concern for the producer was very great. He was going to provide nationalized ships to take their produce to England, but, at that very time, their produce was being held up at railway stations, and was called " black," and they could not get a return of money to pay their way. But not a word was said by the honorable member to bring about a better condition of things in that regard. Another subject on which I have been challenged is the maternity bonus. I said at the time, and I repeat it to-day, that the bringing in of that measure was a political trick. It certainly had a humanitarian colour, but I believe that one of the main reasons for its introduction, was an endeavour to influence voters at the ensuing election. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> says he does not desire to reflect on those who disapprove of it. Why, then, does he do so? He condemned the clergy for denouncing it; yet the leaders of every church without exception denounced, not the help to the women, but the manner in which that help was given. Our friends are very fond of this vicarious philanthropy, scattering about money that they have not to find themselves ; but if it is to be done, it ought to be done in a proper way. We did not condemn the helping of women, but we condemned the manner in which that help was given. We condemned the disregard of experience, the unwillingness to co-operate with the States, and the contempt that was practically shown to those who had given years of service in an endeavour to assist those whom the bonus was intended to benefit. The scheme was crude, costly, and unscientific. No doubt it has done some good, but was not there a better way in which much less money could have done very much more good than that scheme did ? It did not bring about the results anticipated; it did not even return the party to power, tempting as the bait seemed to be to put before the people. A still more important phase of the question is this: We were told - I think <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> himself said it at Ringwood - that the bonus was going to save infantile life. Has there been a decrease iii the mortality of infants since it came into operation? It came into force in October, 1912. It is costing at present £650,000 a year. At 3^ per cent, that would equal a capital of £18,000,000. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> last night taunted us with grudging the poor woman a "fiver." We do not grudge her a " fiver " or a " tenner," or whatever amount is required, but we want to see the money spent in a right and proper way. It was said that the bonus would save infant life, but since then the death rate of infants has increased. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. J.</inline> W. Barrett lately published a pamphlet headed <inline font-style="italic">Necessity for the Practical Application, of Available Knowledge,"</inline> and the first illustration was with regard to babies. He showed the great mortality there was in the first year of life, and that the cause of that mortality was ignorance, inexperience, and careless-: ness. He stated that in Victoria and New South Wales the mortality of infants in twelve months was about 9,000. No one is shocked at it, yet he says that there is an enormous loss of infant life. In 1901 the mortality of infants in the Commonwealth was 103.61 per 1,000. In 1911 it was 68.4.9 per 1,000; while in 1913 - that was a considerable time after the Maternity Allowance Act had come into operation - it had increased to 72.21 per 1,000. Has the bonus saved infant life? Is it doing the duty which was expected of it; and if it is not, is it not time to reconsider the whole question, and make the system more practicable and humane in its operation than it is? The Fisher Government were not without an example at that time. Had they not been so keen to get political kudos, they might have looked not very far afield and found a very much better system. In New Zealand the mortality rate within the last few years has been brought down from 70 or 80 to 51 per 1,000. In the Australian capitals to-day it is from 72 to 81 per 1,000. In New Zealand it. runs from 35 to 60.. -In Dunedin, from 1904 to 1912,. the infant mortality was brought down, from 93 to 38 per 1,000, the world's record. How is that marvellous result, achieved? It is not effected by climate because New Zealand is in practically the same latitude as is the Commonwealth from Sydney down to Hobart. The reason for the decrease in the birth-rate was that, a Midwife's Act was brought in, and a maternity home established, Where the mother receives advice and subsequent care. Education is given; practical knowledge as to the care and bringing up of: children is imparted. In 1907, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr.. Trouby</inline> King commenced a society called the Health of Women and Children. Society. The object was the care of infant life before and after birth. The society taught practical eugenics. Lord Plunkett, Governor of New Zealand, with his lady, made a touching appeal to the people, and the consequence was that they responded. Nurses were taken in. hand and trained in the best methods of the nursing, feeding, and care of children. The society provided for all classes free of charge, high and low ; no matter who required their services they went to them. The society has been maintained by subscriptions outside, and Government aid. The Government gives 24s. for every 20s. subscribed, and the subsidy it pays amounts to £2 per birth. The nurses are carried free on the railways, and the Government subsidy  amounts, on the whole, to £2'perbirth. In Australia, in 1911 the birthrate was 122.193 per 1,000; in 1913 it. was 135.714. The deaths in 1913 numbered 9,800; while in 1911 the number was 8,369. In 1913 the death-rate was- 72.21 per 1,000; and in 1911, 68.49, showing an increase of- 3.72 in 1913. If we had taken a system such as that, and reduced our death-rate of infants in twelve months 50 per 1,000, we could, have saved during last year 3,150 babies.. If we had perfected the system still more,, and brought it down to the Dunedin rate,: we would save, at the present birth-rate, 4,670 infants who are now sacrificed. While the present system goes on, the infants will continue to be sacrificed.. These results show that the maternity bonus, intended to do good, is not doing; the good which it ought to do, and that' the system requires to-be reconsidered, and" something better brought into operation- </para>

                            <para class="block">What would it mean to Australia to save the lives which are now going down into the grave? Certainly a large increase of population. There would be an additional advantage. We would popularize childbearing, which is now denied by many persons who ought to be doing their duty, because the risk of losing a child would be so much less than it is. Our birth-rate has been falling off since 1890. If the birth rate of that year had. been kept up last year, we should have had 157,072 births instead of 122,193. . This subject presents a goal' for statesmen to aim at - a goal for the highest endeavour of all public men. It is not a party question, but one which should be taken into serious consideration. We on this side are asked, " If you do not like the bonus, why do you not abolish it?" We are taunted on every platform with this cry, " Why do you not abolish the bonus?" We admit it does some good. We cannot abolish this thing; it would be cruelty to abolish it right away; but I submit that the matter ought to be reconsidered, that the cost might be very much less, and the benefits obtained very much greater. Until we get a better way, we will keep the system as it is; but we will get that better way sooner or later, and bring the people to realize that, it is the better way, and to act with us. I do believe that the authors of the baby bonus will yet be ashamed of it, not for having brought it in, but for the manner in which it was brought in, and the little good that it has done. We are told, too, that we have no right to co-operate with the States. We are blamed for going into council with them. Why did we federate ? Was not the object to work in with the States for the mutual good of Australia - to work in our sphere and to let the States work in their sphere, to rely on mutual help and co-operation for the good of all the people? Yet we are told that we should not go near the States. When the Premiers' Conference was held at Hobart, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> went over there in a lordly, patronizing way, and would scarcely say anything to the Premiers. The conferences were all failures until the last <inline font-style="italic">one,</inline> and now. we have a. system of cordial co-operation. I believe that the best results will spring from these conferences. We are charged' with an attempt to destroy the States by reason of the measures which are to be brought in. There is so stronger Federalist than. I am. I absolutely believe in the equal representation of the States in the Senate, and would fight to the death against any attempt to change that system. It is said in one case that we are endeavouring to destroy the States, and in the other case that the States are dominating us. Which statement is correct? The most glaring attempt to destroy the States was made by the referenda to the people on two occasions. Had those proposed alterations of the Constitution been carried, they would have absolutely led to "Unification, to the destruction of the States. The party which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> leads have been against Federation from the first. In season and out ' of season they have tried to cripple it. As regards the referenda, the trade and commerce proposal would have destroyed the States' control over internal trade. The railway proposal would have robbed the States of their control of the railways. The States would have had nothing to do but to find the cost of working and to, pay the interest on the enormous sum which the lines have cost, £250,000,000 or £260,000,000, leaving the actual working control of the lines to the Commonwealth. The fourth proposal would have deprived the States of their control of the corporations ; the fifth 'proposal would have empowered the Commonwealth to control any business which the Parliament might choose to call a monopoly; while the sixth proposal would have given the consideration of all labour matters to the Federal authorities. The party who submitted these referenda and are bringing them forward again, have charged us with destroying State rights when they must know in their hearts that, if 'their proposals were carried at a referendum, it would only be a very short time before the States went out of existence, and we became a unified Australia, or the State Parliaments very little better than glorified municipal councils. I feel sure that every one who wishes Australia well ought to be glad to see the spirit displayed at the Premiers' Conference. Fifty-four subjects were discussed, there, and of this number twelve were of the very first importance. In three cases, we are duplicating expense. We are making the people pay a lot of money, the expenditure of which could be avoided. As regards the question of electoral reform, why should, we have two sets of officers, and two sets, orolls, when we have the. same people on practically the same franchise? Again, there is the question of land valuation. Dealing with the same land, and the same people on the land, we have two sets of officers taking separate valuations at a double cost. In the case of the Savings Banks, we have two sets of banks taking care of the money for the same people. We are duplicating that cost. Why can we not agree to work in harmony, and unify these particular questions. Then, too, there is the question of the transferred properties. Is it not time that this question was settled ? It has been hanging in the balance ever since Federation. Immigration is another important question. It is in a most unsatisfactory position. I do not say that the States' systems are perfect, because I think that they are very far from perfect; but there ought to be no question about the Commonwealth and the States combining to bring about a better method. Again, there is the question of a uniform railway, gauge. Was not that a fair matter on which to consult the States? We can do nothing without their consent. They own the railways, and are responsible for the money. The complicated position which this question of a uniform gauge occupies to-day has largely arisen from a particular gauge being rushed on the country by the late Labour Government. Instead of having due inquiry made to determine the best gauge, our predecessors rushed one gauge upon us, I suppose for party purposes, and refused to listen to the suggestion that further inquiry should be made. We cannot bring in a uniform gauge without the consent of the States. Some of the States will not move in this direction until they have an inquiry made as to which is the best  gauge. True, it is, that inquiries have been made. Certain conferences have been held by commissioners and by engineers, perhaps, who never were on an engine. I would sooner take the opinion of a man who had driven on the New South Wales, Victorian, and Queensland lines than the opinion of any of these commissioners. The class of men I refer to know which is the best gauge. They know which is the safest gauge, and which will carry the most traffic. It is not a question of opinion ; it is a question of scientific inquiry, and no solution of this problem can be come to unless the States agree to it. The question of the best gauge is still unsettled. The rail- way leagues in other parts of the world claim that a wider gauge is necessary.. I know that, when he was travelling a&gt; year or two ago, the Premier of Victoria consulted the leading authorities in Canada and England, and they said, " If we had to start railway construction again, it would probably not be a 5-ft. 3-ih. gauge which we would adopt, but a 6-ft. gauge. Another question of great importance to our producers is the bulk handling of wheat. The Commonwealth will have to co-operate with the States, because we have control of the export trade. Was not that a fair subject for discussion at the Premier's Conference? Then there is the question of the transfer of the State debts. A transfer has been ordered by the people, but nothing has yet been done to bring about a settlement. To frame a uniform company law we need State cooperation and reconcilement. There is one other question, probably, which in importance to the future of Australia, transcends all others, and that is the question of the Murray River. This, I hold, is the greatest asset of Australia. The question of the use of these waters has been discussed for the last twenty-five years, but we were no nearer a solution than we were at the beginning until the present Government took the matter in hand. It is more a question for the States than for the Commonwealth to deal with. When they settle the details, we can ask this Parliament to give that assistance which, we think, ought to be given. I have been somewhat surprised at representatives from South Australia carping and cavilling at the Government for bringing this question forward and saying that we have no policy. Our policy is to help. Our policy was put in a concrete form by the offer of £1,000,000, if the States came to an agreement, towards the cost of the locking of the river. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> was the only representative of South Australia who gave the Government credit for the very valuable action they had taken in regard to this matter. Let us understand what this question really means to Australia. It is desirable not that the few to whom I am speaking here, but the people of Australia should realize its importance. For the purpose of irrigation, there is no finer water-way in the world than is the Murray River. It is 1,500 miles from the mouth to Albury. Its potentialities  are enormous. Its wealth producing capacity is almost beyond calculation. Its waters could provide sustenance and homes for millions. In 1903 there was a petition from the Riverina and northern Victoria, asking that the question should be considered. In 1904 I brought the matter before the House of Representatives, and urged that joint action should be taken. The need of the north is water, and we have to build this nation up on land, water, and people. We have recklessly parted with our lands, we are not getting the people we require, and we allow water to flow in sinful waste to the sea. What might be done with this water. 'A cubic foot of water per second, continually flowing, will irrigate 54 acres. At Albury, the highest flow of the Murray River is 264,000,000,000 cubic feet per annum, the lowest 91,000,000,000, and the mean flow 144,000,000,000 cubic feet per annum. The highest flow would be sufficient to cover 4,600,000 acres 12 inches deep, and the lowest flow sufficient to cover 1,516,000 acres 12 inches deep. At Morgan the volume of the stream is immensely increased ; the highest flow there is 971,000,000,000 cubic feet per annum, the lowest 318,000,000,000 cubic feet, and the mean flow 455,000,000,000 cubic feet per annum. The highest flow at this point would cover 16,000,000 acres 12 inches deep, and the lowest 5,300,000 acres 12 inches deep on a basis of 60,000 cubic feet to the acre. A depth of 12 inches represents 45,000 cubic feet, leaving 15,000 cubic feet for waste. As to the value of the water, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilcox</inline> has estimated that 1,000,000,000 cubic feet of water is worth £30,000 in Egypt. In Italy, a cubic foot per second is valued at from £500 to £1,600; in France, at from £500 to £2,500; and in America, from £800 to £8,000, according to the locality and the purpose to be served. The people of other countries are making full use of this great gift of Providence, while we are neglecting it year after year. What does the settlement of this great question mean? It means, first of all,, the permanency of present settlement, and then an increase of population on the soundest and best lines that will not compete in any way with city workers. It means an enormous increase of work for workers, and work like this does not end with the doing of it, because when it is done it means multiplied work for the future, and it means an enormous increase of production, and cheaper and good food for the people. The Australian Natives Association in Victoria have given a great deal of attention to this subject, and I trust they will continue their exertions until the question has been satisfactorily settled. The apportionment of the water is a matter which must be settled by the States interested. We cannot interfere with that. If there is to be an agreement arrived at, there must be give and take and a harmonious spirit displayed between the representatives of the States. I have not gone into the details of the subject, as I have not had time to do so. The present Government have brought the States together in connexion with this matter, and for the first time have had an agreement signed, and a prospect of having it carried into operation. I think that they are entitled to some credit for that. I wish now to touch upon another question which is assuming very large dimensions in the public mind at the present time. It is the question of the American Beef Trust. It was brought before the Premiers' Conference, and the representatives of each State agreed to prosecute inquiries and secure all the information possible on the question. The Commonwealth Government took action at once to carry out their part of the contract, and have appointed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Street to make an investigation. The cry of the trusts is one of the things which the Labour party practically exist upon. They told us that we were flooded with trusts and combines in Australia. Yet, while they were in office, though they knew that there were some twenty-six so-called trusts and combines which had been referred to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr., now Mr. Justice,</inline> Powers, who was then Crown Solicitor of the Commonwealth, he reported that there was not one of them doing anything whatever in contravention of the law. Some action was taken in respect of two of these so-called trusts. ' Action was taken, first of all, by the Liberal party to inquire into the working of the Coal Vend, but the inquiry came to nothing. Then there was some action taken to deal with the Sugar Combine, and the Sugar Commission, which, like Balaam, was sent out to curse, came back to bless, and reported dead against the nationalization of the industry. . The Commission reported that the system adopted by the Sugar </para>

We are told that the Beef Trust is here, and is dangerous. How did it come here? Who were in power when it came here ? It came here when the last Government was in power, in 1912. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor</inline> knew that it was here, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> knew it also. The representatives of the trust came to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor</inline> to secure his approval to put up premises which I am told are to cost about £750,000.

The late Government knew all these things, and yet did nothing, though no amendment of the Constitution was needed to enable them to do something.

They did not even ask what these people proposed to do, and how they proposed to carry on their business. The.

                                <para>- Some members of the Labour party in another place say that the Beef Trust will be the finest thing for the country, whilst others say that it is going to. be. a. menace. Which statement is correct ? The trust is receiving  a  lot of attention at present, and may lead  to trouble. How far it is responsible for the high cost of meat remains to be seen. One very striking phase of the question demanding the serious attention of the Governments of the Commonwealth and of the States is that, while the number of our people is increasing, our stock are not increasing in proportion, and the export of our stock and meat is very largely increasing. We reached the highest number of sheep in this country in 1890, when we had 97,881,221, and the highest number of cattle in 1895, when we had 11,767,488. The figures for succeeding years are most interesting. In 1897 we had 10,832,457 head of cattle, or 22.99 per head of our population, which was then 3,617,783. In 1902, the drought year, the number of cattle in the country went down to 7,062,742, or 1.82 per head of the population. In 1907 the number had risen again to 10,128,486, or 2.43 per head of the population. In 1912 the number was 11,577,259, or 2.44 per head of our population. The figures are relatively much the same for sheep. In 1897 we had 82,643,578 sheep; in 1902, 53,668,347; in 1907, 87,650,263; and in 1912, 83,263,686. Of pigs, the number has remained about the same between the years 1897 and 1912, although the population increased from 3,617,783 in 1897 to 4,733,359 in 1912. Our stock did not increase in the same ratio to supply food for the increase of population. Another important question to be considered is the increase in the volume of our exports of stock and meat. In 1902 we exported cattle to the number of 4,489; in 1912, 16,083. Of sheep, we exported in 1902, 24,296; and in 1912, 34,113. The figures of our export trade in meat are still more striking. In 1902 our export of beef reached 72,453,248 lbs. ; in 1907 it was 52,050,592 lbs. ; in 1912, 142,210,076 lbs. ; and in 1913, 218,918,606 lbs. Of mutton we exported in 1902, 44,105,600 lbs.; in 1907, 109,227,757 lbs.; in 1912, 115,371,981 lbs.; in 1913, 204,931,783 lbs. We exported in tinned meats in 1902 to the extent of 21,989,644 lbs.; in 1907, 8,220,972 lbs. ; in 1912, 34,187,389 lbs. ; and in 1913, 52,150,183 lbs. Of other meats our exports were in 1907, 414,090 lbs. ; in 1912, 3,250,753 lbs. ; and in 1913, 3,071,748 lbs. In view of these figures, the question is of the greatest importance, and requires careful attention if we are not to be brought face to face with very serious problems indeed. It is our duty to find out the cause of the trouble and the remedy for it. This is a question in which we are all interested, and it should not be viewed as a party question. The present Government have acted promptly, and have appointed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Street to conduct an inquiry, primarily into the operations of the Beef Trust, and subsequently in other ways, and to report as soon as possible. I may be told that to meet the difficulty we could put an export tax on meat, but I am dead against that. I do not believe in coming between the producer and his market. Some members of the Labour arty have nibbled at this proposal, but ave been afraid to bite. They have talked of it for some time, and it has recently been openly advocated in another place. But if we attempt to tax the farmers' exports, we may look out for trouble. </para>

We are only cultivating a portion of our wheat area. In Australia we have 310,000,000 acres with a 10-inch rainfall during the growing season - a rainfall sufficient, with cultivation, to mature a crop. Out of that area we are cultivating only 9,000,000 acres, and the farmers to-day are abandoning the growing of wheat in favour of grazing. </para>

                                <para>- The farmers today can get 15s. each for four months' lambs, and before long I believe they will get 20s. When they resort to grazing they have an easier life and less worry than they experience when they are growing wheat. I believe that cheap meat and the cheap loaf in this country have gone for a considerable time. I wish now to deal with the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway. It has been stated in this Chamber that the Government are wrecking that enterprise. But is it so? The late Government controlled this work for 284 days, and the present Ministry have controlled it for 331 days. During the 284 days that the Fisher Government were in office they laid down 18 miles 63 chains of line, whereas the present Government during their 331 days of office have laid 153 miles 7 chains. The present Government have employed twice the number of men, and have done eight times the amount of work. Under the Fisher Government, plate-laying proceeded at the rate of 15.11 days per mile, the surveying at 3.302 days per mile, the clearing at 5.79 days per mile, and the earthworks at 7.704 days per mile. Under the Cook Ministry plate-laying is proceeding at the rate of 2.16 days per mile; the surveying at 1.18 miles per day; the clearing at 2.32 days per mile, and the earthworks at 2.24 days per mile. In view of these figures, how can it be said, that we are not expediting the construction of the line, or that we are wasting the money of the public? We have been fissured that private contractors are paying higher rates to their employes than are the Government. Very hard things were said of the Ministry last night in this connexion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. But we must recollect that if we increase the rate of wages in one part of the country we shall have to increase it in another part. Wc must also remember that work under private contractors is task work. The Prime Minister has made a fair offer to the men, viz., to allow this unfortunate dispute to be settled by arbitration. A good deal has been said about the relative merits of the contract and day-labour systems. The Government have been strongly criticised because on shows, within some cases estimates and in contract to the day-labour system. My own opinion is that we might well paraphrase a couplet by Pope, and say - </para>

                                <para>- I withdraw the statement. I come now to the Queensland proposition. I say that unless we know the actual conditions which obtain in different places, the statements which have been made here by way of comparing the day-labour and contract systems have no relevance whatever. Moreover, what is termed day labour in Queensland is really a mixture of the day-labour and contract systems - as has been explained by the Engineer-in-Chief of the Commonwealth, who has just come from that State. </para>

                                <para>- There is something of that kind; otherwise, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> is not telling the truth . Now , I have had sent to me a statement from New South Wales, and I am told that all the figures in it are official. It is a list of some twenty-one or twenty-two different works, comprising the erection of car-sheds, bridges, post-offices, court-houses, residences, public schools, lockup-keepers' quarters, and railways, together with the construction of water supply works, and cottages. It shows, with in some cases estimates and in other instances actual tenders, a total amount of £351,297. These works were carried out by day labour at a cost of £484,518 - a difference in favour of the contract system of £133,221. Then I might point to the Orbost line, the construction of which has been dragging on for three or four years. Had that undertaking been built by contract it would have been completed long ago. The farmers have been waiting for it for two years beyond the period when it should have been constructed. I say that it is difficult to lay down an absolute rule in respect of the day-labour and contract systems. But do my honorable friends opposite always practise what they preach ? If they require a job to be done, do they always get it done by day labour? I think if they had a work which was going to cost them a thousand pounds or two, they would want to get a price for it. I have been told that, not long ago, a Labour member in another State was going to build a rather nice house. A friend of his inquired of him, " I suppose you are going to build it with day labour?"  His  reply was, "No. I am not such a fool; I am going to get it built by contract." </para>

                                <para>- No. I repeat that it is impossible to lay down an absolute rule as to which system is preferable. In some cases, day labour is best, and in other instances the contract system is to be preferred. I wish now to refer to another matter of which we have heard a good deal in this chamber, namely, the sleeper contract. It was initiated in an atmosphere of mysterious secrecy. No information could be obtained about it. To all inquiries we got the answer, "You will know all about it after the contract has been signed." The contract was bungled, both in the drafting of it, and also in its execution. The Western Australian Government sent in a tender on the 23rd April, 1912. The Fisher Ministry took five months to consider it. They accepted it on the 6th August of the same year. The first delivery of sleepers should have taken place in June, 1913, but the date was extended to November of the same year. The present Government then called attention to the urgency which existed for the supply of the sleepers. A little later they stated that a further extension of time could not be granted, and a cancellation, of the contract would follow failure to supply. No sleepers were supplied, and the contract was cancelled. The statement was made a night or two ago in this chamber that not a sleeper had been purchased by the Government since the cancellation of the contract. </para>

                                <para>- There were penalties provided, but no deposits were paid. Hence, when the contract failed, there was nothing to draw upon. We were informed the other evening that not a single sleeper had been purchased by the Government since the cancellation of the contract, and that, as a matter of fact, there were sufficient sleepers at both ends of the transcontinental line to permit of construction proceeding for months. It was further stated that the contract was cancelled because a Labour Government were in power in Western Australia. Nothing could be farther from the truth. But the needs of the line must be supplied. When it was seen that the contract would fall through, steps were taken to enter into another 'contract for the supply of 300,000 sleepers. It seems as if my honorable friends opposite desire to make this railway a sort of field in which experiments can be tried at the expense of the Commonwealth. At the present time there is a Commission investigating the process of powellising, which was to be applied to the sleepers under the contract with the Western Australian Government, and in a short time I hope we shall have its report before us. I may mention that there are some interesting figures in connexion with the contract and day-labour systems contained in a report which I have received from the Northern Territory. There are two items in it which can be compared. One relates to the employment of the forest devil and the other to hand-grubbing. Clearing with a forest devil under contract cost £5 15s. per acre, whereas with a forest devil by day labour it cost £11 10s. 6d. per acre. Fencing of exactly the same character was also carried out by day labour and contract. Under day labour it cost from £57 to £42 per mile, whereas under contract it cost from £29 to. £25. These figures cannot be ignored; they are official, and can be vouched for. </para>

                                <para>- There was no compulsion whatever. That is the way the Labour party try to take the credit away from others. They claim everything for themselves, and when they are given the actual facts they say, " Oh, it was done under compulsion ! " The measure was passed by the Senate on June 4, 1908, and assented to on June 10 of the same year. At that time it was well known that, owing to the operation of the Braddon section, the Commonwealth was straitened for money. While the Act was assented to on the date mentioned, payments did not commence until 1st July, 1909. Invalid pensions were prevented from being paid owing to financial stringency, and their proclamation was delayed. The first payment took place during the term of office of the Fisher Government, who had ample money available, owing to the operation of the Braddon section coming to an end. The £450,000 deficit, which has been thrown in the teeth of Liberals all over the country as being a deficit left by the Liberal Government, was caused mainly through putting money aside to provide for the payment of old-age pensions. One would think that old-age pensions were never paid until they were paid in the Commonwealth. As a matter of fact, they were paid in three States for some years before.. The first Government in Australia to lay before the people proposals for paying old-age pensions was the McLean Government in Victoria, the Attorney-General of which was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Irvine,</inline> who is now said to be out to destroy old-age pensions. To. say that the Liberals are going to destroy their own handiwork is to make a. base and slanderous insinuation. It is a. contemptible thing to play on the fears of these old people, for a party advantage,, by telling them that their bread and butter "will be taken away from them if a certain party come into power. Very unjust attacks are being made on the Government, both inside and outside Parliament, on the question of the revision, of the Tariff. There was a general consensus of opinion after the last revision of the Tariff took place that never again would we have such an unseemly scramble for duties. Duties were put on in an absolutely unscientific fashion, without information, and without regard to whether they were required or not. Parties all round expressed the opinion that, before any further revision of the Tariff took place, there should be an inquiry by a non-political, disinterested board. </para>

                                <para>- Any inquiry .must, to a certain extent, be lengthy, because an enormous number of interests have to be dealt with, and a great number of people must be given a hearing. No pro-; per recommendation can be made simply on what is said in one State, and as there were as many applications from New South Wales as from Victoria, it would not have been right to make a recommendation after hearing only Victorian witnesses. I am not going to say anything about the Labour Government not carrying out Tariff revision. We have had quite enough of that sort of talk; let us make the best of things as they are. They know they got into office through promising to revise the Tariff, and they know that they did not do it. At the last election, a sort of death-bed repentance took place, and they promised to inquire into the question of Tariff revision if they .did not carry the referendum. Their plea was, " We want the new Protection, protecting manufacturer, worker, and consumer." It was extraordinarily interesting to see how the question of new Protection was taken up by Free Traders everywhere. They welcomed it, "because they saw in it something that would shelve true Protection for a long time. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid, and a number of others, were, consequently, strongly in favour of it. It certainly answered the purposes of the Labour party admirably. It gave them three years of office with nothing done, although they had ample time, opportunities, and a majority to do it. It is generally understood that the matter was the subject of a very serious discussion in the Labour Caucus. It is said outside that " no Tariff revision " was only carried there by one vote. One or two members, such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell, Senator Givens,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> battled manfully; but the Caucus decided against them, and they had to follow. The Cook Government have been perfectly honest and straightforward right through with regard to this question. In their manifesto they stated - </para>

A great deal of preliminary work had to be done in securing offices, organizing the office, drawing up regulations, getting officers, and preparing schedules. The public had to be advised as to procedure. Temporary offices had to be used, and the permanent offices were entered on the 11th December, 1913. Meanwhile, the Commissioners inspected factories and manufacturing processes in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, and South Australia. The public sittings began on 12th January, 1914. The Commissioners sat on each working day, except Saturdays, from 10.30 a.m. to 4 p.m., taking evidence almost continuously. When not taking evidence, they were collating and collaborating the evidence and exhibits. I do not- think any body of men could have done the work more- conscientiously or expeditiously than the present Commissioners . have done. </para>

It might have been wiser to take the evidence fully. At the same time, they have their notes, and for whatever recommendations they make, they will have to advance reasons which will appeal to Parliament as sound. I do not know that many people read these reports when they are printed. As a matter of fact, in past Tariff revisions, very little notice has been taken of reports. . No fewer than 469 subjects have been sent in for consideration from different States, and the witnesses examined number 340. Tasmania was visited; and on 11th May, sittings began in Sydney, as the Commissioners did not think it right to bring in recommendations without affording persons in New South Wales a chance to give evidence. The Government have not been lax or remiss on this question. They have pressed the Commission to try to give them a list of anomalies that require to be rectified, and of cases where suffering has been caused through the want of increased duties. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable senator had better ask his friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington.</inline> Of course I can understand that to an Opposition who are desirous of blocking the business of the country and talking <inline font-style="italic">ad libitum,</inline> the Tariff would be a splendid subject to get before them. It would play into their hands well, but that is not the reason why the Tariff is kept back. We are simply waiting upon the Commission who are working with all due diligence; we hope that they will be able to report at an early date. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> asked last night " Why do not the Government bring in a Tariff"? It is not a very easy matter to frame a Tariff, as we have to study all parties who are interested. It is a matter requiring time and care in order to deal justly with all interests. We hope that when a Tariff is submitted it will be one which will last and will be of very great benefit. In his speech <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready,</inline> who, I am sorry to see, is not in the chamber, made certain charges against the Government. He denominated a certain paper as a " pimp." I am not concerned with the language he used; that is a matter for himself - .1 matter of taste. </para>

The offence of this newspaper, as far as he was concerned, was that it did not support him. Had it done so, of course it would have done everything which was good.  His  charge was that the Government had taken 5,000 copies of the newspaper and had given a penny more per copy than the published price. It was a special issue which was brought out. Perhaps I had better read the explanation which I have received from the Secretary to the Department, and which will place the Senate in possession of the facts. The explanation reads - </para>

The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Batchelor</inline> gave the first order, in 1910. It has been found, to be a useful and effective publication, and the bulk of the copies purchased by us have been posted direct to the homes of farmers either in Great Britain or America. </para>
                            <para>This year we purchased 5,000 copies at £30' per 1,000, or a little over 7d. per copy. Of this number 3,000 copies were posted direct to farmers in America, as special efforts are being made to attract suitable settlers for the: irrigation areas in New South Wales and Victoria. The balance - 2,000 copies - were distributed in equal numbers by the Government agents of New South Wales and Victoria in San Francisco. </para>

                                I believe, desires to know why the Government paid 7d. per copy for a. publication sold for 6d. per copy in Australia,, especially as the matter is almost the same in the "ordinary" and "Commonwealth" issues, and the Government is so largs a purchaser.

                        <para>The reason why 7d. per copy is paid when the ordinary issue is sold for 6d. is this : Although the matter in the ordinary issue is used for the Commonwealth issue, the matter for that particular issue is, to a large extent, specially prepared, and it is profusely illustrated. It is the Commonwealth order that makes this possible. </para>

                            <para>We are given a good issue for circulation abroad - an issue which costs more than the ordinary one in normal circumstances would cost - but it is, of course,, quite true that the publishers use that specially prepared and well illustrated matter fbr their ordinary issue. If the publishers did not do this they could not afford to sell us copies at anything like 7d. per copy. It is also quite certain that the Department could not compile and issue a publication of the same size and style for so low a figure as £30 per thousand for 5,000 copies. </para>
                            <para>So it is thought that we obtained a useful advertising publication at a reasonable price. The publishers also place at the Department's disposal their list of American farmers' names and addresses, which they have collected at their own expense. We, as has been said, had 3,000 copies posted direct to farmers, and there is no doubt that there is no better method of reaching the class we are looking for. </para>
                            <para>I might add that the matter was fully discussed with thu publishers of the <inline font-style="italic">Fruit World</inline> at the time, and no better terms could be arranged. </para>
                            <para>I have not had the benefit of reading <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready's</inline> remarks, but will do so as soon aa <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> is available. </para>

                        <para class="block">I believe that it is possible to issue a special number of a periodical or journal for profit up to a certain point, but the money to produce the profit has to come from advertisements and subscriptions. If the proprietors go beyond that point and issue a larger number it is done at a loss. That is the statement made in regard to the cost of this publication. I have gone through a copy, and I must say that it is a very fine publication. The illustrations are splendid. I think that there could be no better advertising medium or nothing more attractive to catch the attention of growers and orchardists in other countries. The amount paid for the copies is paltry ; it is scarcely worth while to squabble about a few pounds. </para>

He said that higher freights are paid to Tasmania than to other parts of the Commonwealth. Now freights everywhere depend upon the volume of traffic. If the traffic is low and the passengers are few, then, of course, the freights increase. The more back cargo there is, the lower are the charges. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> contradicted <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> when he made a remark. He said that the freights here are the lowest in the world. </para>

In some cases they are on a par with, and in other cases lower than, the freights to other States. The honorable senator was very sore because this Government did not start a nationalized line of steamers. I think that after the experience of Western Australia this Government would have deserved to be run out had they done such a foolish" thing.

                            <para>A few big owners used to control the cattle trade and had squeezed the smaller men out of shipping space and market. In short, there was a beef ring which operated to the detriment of the producer at the' one end and the consumer at the other end. The Government decided that the only way to compete successfully against the ring was to step in with State-owned steamers to carry the stock from the pastoral areas in the north-west down to the metropolis. </para>

                        <para class="block">What has been the result of this venture ? Has it been an encouragement to start a nationalized line of steamers? The State Government bought three steamers, at a total cost of £67,000. The result of the first year's operations, ending 30th June, 1913, was a loss of £26,000; the revenue being £60,000, and the expenditure £86,000. To this amount must be added depreciation on the vessels and interest on capital expended, and it has been estimated by competent men that it would not be excessive to put the amount at from 10 to 15 per cent. per annum, as the vessels were old, totalling £14,000. It will be seen that the working of this venture for one year has cost the people of the State £40,000. </para>

                                <para>- A Royal Commission was appointed to inquire into the working of the vessels, which was dropped when half-way through, and the Government, in despair, has now handed over the control of the vessels to the Harbor Trust. The whole enterprise has been costly and useless. On the one hand, the small farmers and the growers of cattle have not benefited in. the slightest degree, and, on the other, the consumer has not obtained meat at any cheaper rate than before. The vessels have been a failure in the two objects for which the service was inaugurated. It only shows that prices are regulated by laws of supply and demand, and cannot be adjusted by any system of nationalization or Government control. With regard to the Teesdale Smith contract, of which we have heard a great deal, I do not propose to speak at any length. I imagine that the contract will be inquired into by the Royal Commission that is to be appointed, and that it will get at the truth, which is what we want to elicit. Exaggerated statements have been made, and unworthy charges have been levelled against the Government. It has been said to us, "What did Teesdale Smith give you?" " How much did the Government get out of the contract?" What about side-door influence and back-door influence?" All sorts of infamous charges have been made by the Leader of the Opposition in another place and honorable members generally. </para>

                                <para>- It seems to me that if it were not for the Teesdale Smith contract, the Beef Trust, and electoral matters, our honorable friends opposite would be absolutely "gravelled" to find anything to talk about. The crowning iniquity of the Government, apparently, is that they did not call for tenders for the contract let to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith. It did not matter what they paid for the job if they called for tenders. If they had done that, nothing would have been said about the matter. Did the last Government  always call for tenders? It is fitting that accusers should come into Court with clean hands. Let us see what the last Government did. There is a certain company here known as the Victorian Powellising Company, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gorton</inline> is the manager, or, at all events, he was the man with whom the late Government did business. The company was asked to tender for a lot of mountain ash and messmate sleepers. On 26th November, 1912, they were asked to submit a tender. They were again asked to tender in January of the following year. On the 7th January they offered to supply the sleepers at 7s. lid., but agreed to accept 7s. 6d. On the 26th March they were advised that their tender was accepted for 100,000 sleepers at £37,500. The agreement was settled on the 9th April, 1913. No tenders were called for this contract; no deposit was paid, and no penalties were provided for in the agreement. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gorton</inline> asked for no deposit to be demanded, or, at most, for £200, but no deposit was made. When our honorable friends say that tenders should have been called for the contract let to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith, I ask why the Labour Government did not call for tenders for this sleeper contract. It was found later that the sleepers Were not satisfactory, and in October, 1913, six months after the contract was let, it was annulled. I am sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> is not present. He has recently been making a great deal of fuss about calling for tenders for the supply of Tasmanian sleepers. Let me inform him that at the time when this agreement was fixed up with the Victorian Powellising Company for the supply of sleepers of -mountain ash. and messmate, which are about the worst timbers that could be used for sleepers, the Huon Company of Tasmania tendered for a quantity of Tasmanian .sleepers, and deposited £500. with their tender. Later on the same company tendered for 300,000 Tasmanian sleepers, and deposited another £500. Neither of their tenders was accepted, and it was six months and twelve months later before the deposits were returned. Where was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> at that time? Why was the honorable senator not fighting for his State when this sort of thing was going on under the Government he was supporting? There was another contract entered into with the Western </para>

                                <para>- It is absolutely true. The Post and Telegraph Department had a sworn declaration to that effect, or I should not have mentioned it. The statement has been repeatedly made that since the present Government came into office they have done nothing whatever. I propose to mention a few things that they have done. No Ministers could have been more unremitting in their attention to the work of their Departments than have been members of the present Government. They have worked early and late, and have given honest administration. </para>

                                <para>- The figures indicate an aggregate loss in connexion with these proposals. There is one important thing which we have done in the Northern Territory. We have abandoned the Government laundry. We have retired some unnecessary officials who were being paid £2,600 per annum, and have distributed their duties amongst other officers. We have called for tenders for rails and sleepers for the Pine Creek to Katherine River railway, and expect that operations will be commenced on that line in a short time. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth,</inline> the Administrator of the Northern Territory, has been in Melbourne for some months in consultation with the Minister of External Affairs, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn</inline> has prepared a scheme of works and settlement for the Northern Territory which he is awaiting an opportunity to place before Parliament. In Papua the External Affairs Department has obtained a report on wharf extension, which is now under consideration, and the railway line from Port Moresby to Astrolabe has now been surveyed. We were successful in getting <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> to represent Australia at the Panama Exhibition. I am sure we are all glad that we have been able to secure the services of such an able and distinguished man. In the Department of Home Affairs a good deal of work has been done. To begin with, we have abolished preference to unionists in Government employment, and we are employing contract labour where it is more suitable than day labour. We have appointed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> as Engineer-in-Chief of Commonwealth railways. We are rearranging our electoral system, and we have appointed permanent Divisional Returning Officers. This step was taken on my initiative, and I think all parties will be satisfied with it. The revision of the rolls is now proceeding in each State. At the Federal Capital the Government found a rather serious state of affairs when they came into office. They found that the design of the Capital had been varied considerably by the departmental officers. As a matter of fact, Ministers found that, from some aspects, very little of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin's</inline> plan was left. This circumstance was brought under the notice of the late Government in a letter addressed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> O'Malley on the 30th November last year.

He is now here under an arrangement which is very favorable to the Commonwealth. The writer of the letter which I have just read was one of the arbitrators in the matter of the designs for the Capital, who deemed it his duty to warn the Government of the way in which things were going. In the Department of Trade and Customs we have appointed the Inter-State Commission and staff. We have collected £150,000 by way of sugar bounty, which, owing to the remissness of our predecessors, was not collected by them, and which they have endeavoured to make it appeal we desired to present to our friends - an infamous suggestion. </para>

                            <para>- It has been said. Every penny of that money has been collected. We collected £150,000 which was outstanding owing to the ineffective legislation enacted at the instance of the Fisher Government. We had the smallpox epidemic to cope with immediately after coming into office, and I think that the Prime Minister deserves every credit for the firm stand he took on that occasion in quarantining his own city. We have appointed a Director of Lighthouses and part of his staff. We have taken over 118 existing lights; arranged for the erection of 74 new lights during the next six years, 13 of which are now under way. </para>

But, in one breath, we have been told by my honorable friends opposite that the Government Preference Prohibition Bill is too paltry to consider, whilst iri the next we have been assured that it is important enough to block the whole business of the country. Which of these two statements is correct? What question was responsible for the turnover of thirteen seats at the last election? </para>

                                <para>- If any questions were responsible for the turnover of those thirteen seats, they were, preference to unionists in the Government service and the abolition of the postal vote. The public were shocked by the fact that public money should be spent in Government employment only to benefit a certain class. Nothing shocked the people more than that, and nothing contributed more to the loss of those thirteen seats by the Labour party than it did. There has been an attempt to make it appear that the Government are opposed to all combinations of workers. As a matter of fact, we are not. We recognise that there must be combinations. But those combinations should be on proper lines. The very fact that the Arbitration Court had granted preference to unionists only in one instance - n very exceptional one - ought to have been a warning to the late Government not to grant such a preference. The present Government are in favour of unions, but we are not in favour of the tyranny which would deprive men of work and women and children of their bread, because of their refusal to hold certain political views. The abolition of the postal vote was also a factor in the defeat of my honorable friends opposite at the last election. The 30,000 persons who were thus deprived of their birth-right were indignant about it. The talk of corruption and wrong-doing is absurd. Only one case has been cited in this connexion - a case in the western district of this State - and it has done duty so long that its influence has worn out. In conclusion, I wish to say that the record of the Government administratively cannot be seriously challenged. Its legislative record is not so good, but that is not the fault of Ministers. It is the fault of those who have attempted too successfully to block the business of the country. For fully three months after this Parliament met it was faced in another Chamber with the bitterest opposition. Not until patience had been exhausted on the day on which the funeral of an ex-member was to take place, when an attempt was made to take the business out of the hands of the Government, was a determination arrived at to apply the closure. At that time the people were beginning to inquire, "When is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> going to take some action?" It is not the fault of the Government that more legislation has not been enacted, but of those who have at: tempted to block the transaction of public business. What they accomplished last session they have endeavoured to accomplish this. The Government can go to the country with a clean record, and with the knowledge that they have done their best in administration and legislation. </para>

To-day he got up, after having apologized for that statement- </para>

                                <para>- The Vice-President of the Executive Council would not withdraw anything unless he was absolutely certain that he had made a mistake. When he withdrew his statement, therefore, he, in a measure, apologized for having -wrongly put the position, and for having slandered the citizens of Australia. After having withdrawn the statement, he has the cold-blooded audacity to get up in this chamber to-day and justify it. He says, in effect, '"After constituting myself a sort of Sherlock Holmes, after having ferreted and fossicked out every nook and corner of the Electoral Department, after having had a hundred and one opportunities of ascertaining whether I was correct or incorrect in 'making that statement, I will now give members of the Senate the result of my efforts since I have been in charge of the Electoral Department." He said, " I have proved that the dead were resurrected." "By' whom?" <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> asked. The honorable senator said " They " had resurrected the dead. He ought to have the manliness to admit that by " They " he meant the Labour party. He says that one dead man was resurrected at Kyneton, another at Lal Lal, and another at Ballarat.- Australia is a big place, and if three dead men's names were voted on, will the honorable senator tell the Senate that the Labour party or their supporters were responsible for the personation ? He should have the manliness and courage to give the House the names which he has in his possession in those three cases. There are quite a number of names on the different rolls of the Commonwealth exactly alike, both as to Christian and surnames, and with almost identical addresses, and one can quite believe that, throughout the whole of Australia, the names of three dead men were voted on. Will the honorable senator give me the names of the three cases he mentioned? If they did happen, do they constitute a greater irregularity in proportion than has happened at any previous election in the Commonwealth? I think the honorable senator, in endeavour.ing to cover up his tracks, has only got himself further into the mud. He will find it very difficult to extricate himself from the unfortunate position in which he placed himself at the famous meeting held at Fitzroy just after the last election. He also said that the Socialistic enterprises undertaken by different State Governments had proved financial losses. That is absolutely incorrect. There are many Socialistic enterprises run by Governments in different parts of Australia that are huge successes, both financially and in every other way. The honorable senator made a special reference to the steamship service established by the Scaddan Government, stating that it had resulted in a loss of £40,000. </para>

                                <para>- It is not. It is absolutely incorrect. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> is one of the most extraordinary men who ever occupied a position in public life in the Commonwealth. Either he makes statements that he knows to be incorrect, or he makes them in ignorance. If the former, he ought to be ashamed of himself, and, if the latter, he is to be pitied. The loss on the Western Australian steam -ship service to date is only £19,354 7s. lid. It must be remembered that it was established to open up and develop a certain portion of Western Australia. It was an absolute necessity in the interests of that part of the country. Will the honorable senator say that no Government enterprise ought to be undertaken unless it is self-supporting ? If that is so, I can follow him. What, then, becomes of everything that the Commonwealth and the States have undertaken ? Would any State be developed as it is today if the Government in power at any particular time had laid down as its policy that no railway should be built unless it was self-supporting from the commencement? The honorable senator would be the last, man in Victoria to advocate such a policy. The Government of Western Australia not only did something that met with the approbation of all the supporters of the Scaddan Government, but it will be information to the honorable senator to know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> J. Holmes, who was recently returned as a Liberal representative to the Western Australian Upper House, won his election mainly on his advocacy of the continuance of the State steam-ship service. He had no possible chance of winning the election as a Liberal unless he warmly advocated the continuance of the service established by the Scaddan Government. The honorable senator also said that the Western Australian Government had not reduced the price of meat. That is absolutely incorrect. I happened to be in Western Australia at the beginning of the year, and, although my visit was a short one, I made the closest and strictest inquiries with regard to the establishment of that service, and the effect it had had on the price of meat in the West. It is an indisputable fact that, immediately the service was established, or about to be established, and the Government were assured that they could get cattle from certain stations, the price of meat in Perth, and other parts of Western Australia, came down by id. per pound, when it was going up in the eastern States; and, immediately the Scaddan Government established retail butchers' shops, following on the establishment of the steam-ship service, meat came down another Id. a pound, although it was still going up in the other States - making a difference of 2d. per pound on all meat purchased by every consumer in almost every part of the State. </para>

                                <para>- That does not affect the question. The fact remains that it went down 2d. a pound as the result of the establishment of those Government services, reaching absolutely the lowest price at which it had been retailed to the consumers of Western Australia almost ever since the State had had responsible government; but that is not all. The Government have reduced passenger fares by 25 per cent., and have provided a regular line of communication in the north-west trade. Every man of common sense in the State warmly supports the service, and I am satisfied that if a poll of the adult residents of Western Australia were taken, they would show a thumping majority for its continuance, because it has been a signal success, and has cheapened the price of meat so greatly. </para>

                        <para>When Parliament was called together last year, one of the lengthiest paragraphs in the Ministerial policy statement was paragraph 3. It was lengthy because important. The Government, being fresh from the electors, knew that the people were eager for a declaration from them as to their attitude in respect to the Tariff. Twelve months have passed since then. Parliament has been called together again, and we have before us another Ministerial statement; but the matter which received such prominence last year is to-day covered by the shortest and smallest paragraph. Also, instead of being paragraph No. 3, it is paragraph No. 13. Last year, it was referred to in these terms - </para>

                                <para>- It is perfectly true, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> said, that we had a comprehensive policy - a policy which before the elections were decided in 1910 we had pledged ourselves to carry into effect, provided that the party came back with a majority in each House. We introduced measures into both Chambers on the lines of our policy, and passed them. We put up a record which, in my opinion, both for quantity and quality is unparalleled in the history of this Parliament, and unparalleled, too, in the history of any other Parliament in the world. Many statements have been made that we did not carry out the promises we gave in respect to Protection. It has been stated by the Leader of the Senate and by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> that the Labour party did nothing in respect to Protection during the time they were in office. The Fisher Government did all that they promised to do. In 1910 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> made a speech in Melbourne, and he also delivered speeches in the other State capitals. What did he say to the people on behalf of the Labour party? </para>

                                <para>- We assured the electors that if they said " yes " to our proposals we would give the Australian manufacturers the Australian market, and also extend to Australian workmen and workwomen the best possible industrial conditions. We gave them this further assurance, that we would prevent a continuance of the exploitation of the consumers then going on. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> has interjected, notwithstanding these assurances on the part of  he Fisher Government, the majority of the citizens of Australia turned down our propositions. While we were in office we were not idle. I ask any fair-minded man sitting on the other side to say whether it would have been possible for us to have the Tariff ripped up, lock, stock, and barrel, and passed to the satisfaction of the Australian community, iri addition to the work we had performed, and in the face of the referenda? </para>

                                <para>- The majority of the electors, by a very small margin, placed their confidence in those who are mow sitting on the Ministerial benches. A remark made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> this afternoon will live and keep. He said that if the Government had introduced Tariff reform during this or the last session of Parliament, it would have given the Labour members an opportunity of talking <inline font-style="italic">ad libitum,</inline> and would have blocked the business of the country. Therefore, according to the honorable senator, Tariff reform is not the business of the country. I think that the average intelligent citizen is more seriously concerned about the establishment of Australian industries and the giving of employment to Australians, than they are about that piece of piffle known as the Government Preference Prohibition Bill, a measure for which there is no warrant, because that which Ministers propose to do by law has already been done by an administrative Act. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> made the statement here to-day that it would have been blocking the business of the country if the Government had introduced a measure of Tariff reform. </para>

                                <para>- Never mind; I know what the honorable senator said. He need not try to " crayfish " out of what he did say. Suppose that this Free Trade Cabinet all at once became converts to Protection, and were successful in giving adequate Protection to Australian manufacturers in another place, and that their measure reached this Chamber. What sort of a reception will a Protectionist Tariff receive at the hands of the high priests of Free Trade on the bench opposite ? Senators Millen, Oakes, and Gould won their elections in New South Wales in May last mainly by reason of their violent opposition to a Protectionist Tariff. </para>

I have read much literature that was published in connexion with the elections that were decided in May of last year, and I know that the electors of New South Wales were implored to vote for Senators Millen, Oakes, and Gould, in order to reduce the high cost of living, which they were informed was due to Customs taxation. </para>

                                <para>- The votes given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> on the Tariff speak for themselves, and show that he was a better Protectionist than many who proclaim themselves to be Protectionists. There are three honorable senators on the other side who are out-and-out Free Traders, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> makes the fourth out of the seven. Then we have <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl,</inline> who is a half-and-half Protectionist. I do not know the fiscal faith of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap,</inline> but some one has said that the honorable senator is a fiscal atheist. There is, then, only <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> to be accounted for, and I believe he could be relied upon to vote for Protectionist duties. Four of the seven have declared themselves violently hostile to a Protectionist Tariff. There is one doubtful Protectionist in the person of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl.</inline> I have no doubt that the honorable senator would support Protectionist duties for metropolitan industries, but the rural inhabitants looking to him for Protection would find him a Free Trader. There are, then, only two or three honorable senators opposite upon whom the Government would have to depend for the passage of a Protectionist Tariff through this Chamber. In the circumstances, how, in the name of all that is good, the people of Australia could have been so blind as they showed themselves to be at the last elections passes my comprehension. </para>

Supposing that later on the Government do introduce a Tariff Bill proposing the imposition of higher duties, who will carry it in this Chamber? It must be carried by honorable senators on this side who are genuine Protectionists. </para>

No member of the party would have the slightest chance of winning a seat in Victoria - Federal, State, or municipal - if he was not prepared to support the Protectionist policy of the State. </para>

I venture to say that we lost Corio, Indi, and, probably, Corangamite because of the vitriolic attacks made by the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> on the members of our party who previously represented those constituencies, on the ground that they had gone back on their Protectionist principles. They had done nothing of the kind. The present Government are in power mainly as a result of the efforts of the newspapers supporting them. The official organ of Liberalism in this State, the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> is a Free Trade newspaper, whilst the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> professes to be a Protectionist newspaper. </para>

Although the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> professes to be a Protectionist newspaper, it "belted" our party hip and thigh, and gave support to wishy-washy Protectionists. What did the gentleman who now represents that constituency say? He said that the woollen mills, the rope works, the engineering works, the salt works, and the timber mills were all struggling because they were insufficiently protected, and there were hundreds of men out of work. He gave this pledge to the electors of Corio, and, without a shadow of a doubt, it won him the seat - </para>

The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> told the electors of Indi that if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ahern</inline> were elected, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parker</inline> Moloney rejected, the result would be that industries would spring up on the King River and the Ovens River like mushrooms, during a night. If honorable senators go through the Indi electorate to-day they will find hundreds of electors who were deluded by the promises which were made to them and the assurances which the so-called Protectionist newspaper, the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> gave them, that if they voted for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ahern</inline> Protection would be all right. The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> finds out to-day that Protection is not all right, and that they should never have deserted the party that has always been faithful to the Protectionist policy of this country. When it is said that the Labour Government did nothing during the time they were in office, the statement is incorrect, because we did much. I propose to read a statement of what we did, in order that the people of Australia may know the facts. It may be somewhat tedious for honorable senators to listen to it, but I intend to read the statement all the same, that I may get it into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I ask honorable senators to do me the special favour not to interject while I am reading it, in order that it may appear in tabulated form, so that the readers of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> may be able to see at a glance what we did during our term of office for the industries of Australia, in addition to the record we put up in connexion with national undertakings. </para>

I propose to read a list of the items which are dealt with in the Customs Tariff Acts of 1910 and 1911. They are as follow: - </para>

                        <para class="block">That long list is, I think, an answer to honorable senators opposite, who have declared many times that the Fisher Government did nothing in the interests of the manufacturers of Australia, and that by no action taken by them was the Protectionist policy of the country advanced. I say that we did much to further the Protectionist interest in Australia. The present Government, in their Ministerial statement of policy last year, committed themselves to a declaration that - i </para>

                        <para class="block">The people of Australia naturally believed that they would act up to that promise. They have now been in office for twelve months, and will any man say that our present Tariff is so perfect - if it is, it is a great compliment to the Fisher Administration - that it contains no anomalies? On the other hand, if anomalies do exist in it, why have not the Government introduced a Tariff Anomalies Bill? They would find no stronger supporters of any proposal for the rectification of such anomalies than honorable senators upon this side of the chamber. They say that they have' referred the matter to the Inter-State Commission. That is a wonderful institution. I noticed the other day that the Premiers had a conference and decided to refer the break of gauge question to the Inter-State Commission. It has been at work for nearly twelve months, and up to the present we have had no public communication from it. The Prime Minister says we must not hurry it or interfere with it. Is it above Parliament and above the people? </para>
                        <para class="block">I understood that the people were" supreme, and that Parliament was above any institution it created. The Commission is not likely, unless asked to get a move on, to present any report for a considerable time, and the people are expected to remain silent while this inactivity continues. Who are its members? I am not going to find fault with them as citizens, but I have my doubts about the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Commission from a Protectionist point of view. The  chairman  is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Piddington,</inline> and I have heard it said that he is a single taxer. He has a perfect right to his .fiscal opinions,  but, if that is so, he cannot honestly have very much sympathy with the Protectionist policy of Australia. I believe <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lockyer</inline> to be a sound Protectionist, but I have very grave doubts about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swinburne</inline> being a Protectionist. I believe .him to be a Revenue Tariffist.  It is a very funny thing that, at the time of the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swinburne,</inline> there was trouble up at the State House. The so-called Liberal party were in the danger zone; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swinburne</inline> was the man of the hour, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> made tracks from the Commonwealth buildings to the State Parliament building to interview him at this crisis. It has been said that the so-called Liberal party of Victoria wanted to get rid of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swinburne</inline> because he was dangerous to them, and there was every reason to believe that at that particular time, if the Watt Government had been up-ended, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swinburne</inline> would have been the man to take up the reins. The Inter-State Commission is now travelling from one end of Australia to the other, no doubt doing its work well as a Commission; but are the manufacturers and the industries of Australia going to suffer by excessive importations while it drags along at a snail's pace? If it was asked by the Government to get a move on, and present a progress report, I warrant that it would soon forward a progress report, particularly with respect to the anomalies in the existing Tariff; but the Government are indisposed to do anything of the kind. </para>

                            made a serious remark this afternoon regarding the erection of meat works at Brisbane by a company said to be identical with the American Meat Trust. He said he was very glad that a Liberal Government was not in power when the application for permission to erect these works was made. Does he mean that if a Liberal Government had been in office they would have refused the desired permission? That is a plain, straightforward question. The honorable senator remains silent because he has no answer to it. The Government know that they could not refuse such an application from a company so long as it complied with the State laws with regard to sanitation and building conditions generally.

                            was at that time Minister of Trade and Customs. During his term of office he received many applications from different parts of Australia for the erection of cool-storage establishments. Probably one of the last to make application was this company. He could not refuse the application, and there is no power in the Constitution to enable this or any other Government to prevent even a branch of the Beef Trust starting in one State in Australia.

                        <para>The Prime Minister has said that this is to be a short session. He says it is being held for the one purpose of bringing about a double dissolution. The Prime Minister has said to the friends and supporters of the Government - by these he probably means the trusts and combines and all the other monopolistic institutions in Australia - "Get ready; there will be an early appeal to the people, and we will take our own time." I thought we were working under a written Constitution, and that the King's representative had something to say as to whether there should or should not be a single or double dissolution. In attempting to influence and coerce the Governor-General into interpreting the Constitution in their way only, the Government are playing with fire. The Constitution is the result of serious and careful consideration on the part of the delegates to the Federal Convention, and there would have been no Federation if the smaller States had not been given a guarantee of protection by way of equal representation in the Senate. They would never have come into the Federation had it not been for that promise. But the present Government say in effect, "Although you are in the Federation, we will bring about a double dissolution on questions which are not important, because the Constitution provides for a double dissolution in the event of certain things happening, and, with a double dissolution, we are hopeful of altering the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Senate." Does any honorable senator in his sane moments believe 'that 'the  Government can increase its number in this Chamber from seven to nineteen ? Does the Government believe that it can wipe out, by a double dissolution, its minority of twenty-two here? If it does it is safe to say that in another place, where the Labour party is in a minority of one, it will be able to turn that minority into, at least, a majority of one. Holding that belief, and stretching one's imagination to suppose, although the thing is unthinkable, that the Labour party. would find itself in a minority in this Chamber, there must, after the first' appeal, be another double dissolution, because the Government would be in a minority here. According to the doctrine laid down by the present Government, every time a Ministry is in a minority here, there must of necessity be a double dissolution. If that is the correct reading of the Constitution, the smaller States were lured into the Federation under false pretences, because once that precedent is established the representation of the smaller States disappears for all time, the Federation becomes a farce, and the Senate Chamber may as well be forthwith shut up. Where, then, does the protection to the smaller States come in? It absolutely disappears for all time. In my judgment, the framers of the Constitution never had such an idea in their heads, or the people of Australia either, that because there should be a difference, not between Houses, but between parties, the party in power could send both Houses to the country. Why does the Government want a double dissolution? Does it want a double dissolution merely for the sake of wanting it, or does it want a double dissolution because it says that the Constitution lays it down that it can be had? </para>

If that is the reading of the Constitution it might as well be torn up, the shutters put up in front of this building, and the States told that they were induced to come into the Federation under false pretences. </para>

Why is it unworkable? Is it unworkable because it has failed to pass the Tariff ? No. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> said to-day that if a Tariff had been introduced it would be blocking the business of the country, so that, according to the honorable senator, the people of the country are not concerned about the Tariff, but are concerned about a midget measure that the man in the street laughs at, the so-called abolition of preference to unionists. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Irvine,</inline> the Attorney-General, said - </para>

Who in the name of heaven ever suggested that we should go on that alone? The notion is preposterous, and how it should have got into the brains of people I cannot understand. I think it would be absolute folly for us to go to the country on such questions as these. </para>

                                <para>- This attitude on the part of the Government is an extraordinary one. It has had ample opportunity to introduce legislation which would have been beneficial to Australia had it felt so disposed. It is perfectly true that the Government introduced a Bill in another place to amend the Electoral Act, but there was so much limelight shed on that iniquitous measure that the Government was shamed into withdrawing it because one of its provisions meant the abolition of the secrecy of the ballot for which men sacrificed their lives and their liberties in days gone by; a provision that every person's ballot-paper had to be numbered, and every person who was possessed of a ballot-paper had to attach his signature. The Government know that there was no more chance of that Bill being carried than there is of any member of it flying into heaven. Consequently the Government withdrew the Bill, and introduced this midget measure known as the Government Preference Prohibition Bill. The time of this country has been wasted on something which, since the day the Government came into power, has not affected a man, woman, or child in the community. </para>

It is the first I have heard of the matter, but I would not be surprised at anything being done by members of the Cabinet, because it is well known that they have no time for legitimate unionism. They are in office because of the financial and political support accorded to them from time to time by big employers who have financed their organization, who believe in freedom of contract, and have no time for legitimate unionism. The Government said it was going to amend the Arbitration Act, so as to prevent the rural workers from having access to the Federal Arbitration Court. Why should these men be treated differently from any other class of workers ? Why should we differentiate in our treatment of the worker between the town and the country ? </para>

That is what Ministers say now, but was ever a voice raised by any honorable senator opposite in favour of organization amongst the rural workers until the Fisher Government made it possible for that class to have the same advantages in regard to arbitration as the city and town workers have ? There was never a whisper prior to that time that the rural workers ought to have these rights. Although the Government are trying to placate their friends in the country, the country people can see the writing on the wall.

Seeing that arbitration is inevitable, your executive urges upon all delegates and all local district councils to prepare for an arbitration contest. Hitherto we have been able to take a stand on the assertion that no dispute existed as between us and our employes, but it would be suicidal tactics to presume that a dispute is impossible, or even unlikely.

The rural workers, if working under a Wages Board determination of which they did not approve, might, if they felt strong enough, seize the psychological moment to strike, and a strike at such a time might mean the ruin of the farmer, and might be the means of putting him off his land. But if the rural workers and their employes are registered under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, -and an award is made by the Court, it will be binding upon the rural workers and on their employers, the producers, and in the event of such an award being broken those responsible for breaking it may be penalized. </para>

                                <para>- I do not intend to occupy any more of the time of the Senate on this motion. I feel that the present Government have been in possession of the Treasury bench far too long. Taking the membership of the two Houses together, the Government are in a big minority. The people of Australia expressed themselves through the ballot-box as in favour of the Labour party. By a strange paradox, although the Labour party have a majority of votes and a majority of members in this Parliament, they find themselves in Opposition, and the party that obtained a minority of votes, and has a minority of representation in this Parliament, occupies the Treasury bench. During the time the Government have been in office they have not made one legitimate effort to carry any measure of legislation that would be helpful to Australia. The two trumpery Bills they have introduced for the set purpose will, I feel sure, return upon them like a boomerang, because the people are sick and tired of their shadow sparring and sham fighting. If they had introduced something of a substantial character, of which the Labour party might be able to approve, or even something to which we might take strong exception, there might be some justification for their continued existence. But the fact that they have been in office for twelve months without doing anything to advance the interests of the people of Australia affords indisputable proof that they really ought to throw up the sponge. They have done nothing, and they <inline font-style="italic">ian</inline> do nothing. They talk about a double dissolution, but they have not a thousand to one chance of getting a double dissolution. The people are sick and tired of them, and the sooner the inevitable takes place - and that is, an early appeal to the electors by the members of another place - the better it will be for Australia. I am satisfied that an appeal to the electors will result in the return of a substantial majority of Labour members to another place, and with the majority which the Labour party have in the Senate, Australia will be safe in their hands, and progress will be possible. </para>

                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline>
                            indulged in a tirade against the Commonwealth Government as constituted to-day. The honorable senator has contended that the party to which 'he belongs have the confidence of the people, and the Government party have not their confidence. The only reply that need be given to that contention is a statement of the fact that the Liberal Government are in power to-day, and have been in power for the last twelve months. They were returned to power because
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline>
                            the Leader of the last Government, stated that he found that he was in a minority, and unable to carry on the business of the country.
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline>
                            has said that a majority of the electors recorded their votes for representatives of the Labour party. That may be so in regard to the House of Representatives, but it is not so in respect cf the Senate. The anomaly in this Chamber is that, while only seven out of eighteen seats contested at the last elections were won by Government supporters, they represent a considerable majority of the electors of the country. It is well that honorable senators who talk a good deal about one vote one value, should bear in mind that the majority of the voters of Australia are behind the present Government.
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline>
                            has said that he believes it would be a good thing to send the members of another place to the country, because he considers that the Labour party would come back with a majority; but he very prudently adds, " We do not wish to see the Senate, where Labour is so strongly entrenched as it is to-day, sent to the country." The Labour party have in this Chamber a majority of four to one. Honorable senators must realize that, under' our Constitution, the other Chamber is regarded as the people's House ; and but for that it would not be possible for the present Government to continue in office for a day. They are in an insecure position by reason of their lack of power in the Senate; and if it can be shown that government is impossible under existing circumstances, it is a fair thing, if the Constitution can be utilized for the purpose, to utilize it in such a way as to bring the position of affairs prominently before the Governor-General, with whatever advice the Cabinet may see fit to tender him, and then let him form his own conclusions as to the action he should take.
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline>
                            in dealing with this matter, spoke very strongly of the powers which might be exercised by the Governor-General. I am not going to dispute the powers possessed by the Governor-General in deciding to grant or withhold a dissolution of Parliament in any circumstances at the request of any Government.
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline>
                            in referring to the intention of the members of the Federal Convention in framing section 57 of the Constitution, providing for a double dissolution in certain cases, interpreted the section in a very restrictive way, and I entirely dissent from his conclusions. It is a well-known rule in the interpretation of Statutes that an Act must be read as a whole, and an endeavour made to harmonize differences appearing in the various sections. It is laid down clearly in the text-books that where there is any doubt or difficulty in the interpretation of the Statutes the most liberal construction is to be adopted. The weakness of the speech made by
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline>
                            lies in the fact that the honorable senator attempted to impose restrictions upon the Constitution which are not manifest, and which, I contend, cannot fairly be read into it. He took up the position that the section dealing with a double dissolution is applicable to financial provisions, and those alone. He argues that only upon financial matters the other Chamber is the superior authority. Honorable senators are aware that there is a manifest endeavour in the Constitution to give the two Houses of the Federal Parliament coequal powers in most matters. The members of the Federal Convention, while desiring to maintain the dominance of the House of Representatives in financial matters, were very careful to build up a strong Senate for the representation of the States in this Parliament. How has that been done? First of all, certain Bills must be introduced in another place after a message.

Having dealt with the general powers of Parliament, the framers -of our Constitution had to specify the way in which a certain limited number of matters should be dealt with. By all the rules of construction in regard to Statutes, it is perfectly clear that section 57 must be held to be applicable to all matters coming before Parliament for consideration. It has been urged that finance is at the root of responsible government. I admit that it is. But will honorable senators tell me that, in respect of any great matter of vital principle which was rejected by the Senate after having been approved by the other branch of the Legislature, it would be impossible to secure a double dissolution? Take, for example, the question of whether preference should be granted to unionists. Let us assume that the Liberal party in another place passed a measure declaring that no such preference should be granted under any conceivable circumstances. </para>

                                <para>- Or let us assume that the House of Representatives was very strongly in favour of a scheme to promote immigration - a scheme which the Senate considered would be detrimental to the best interests of this country. Would not the difference between the two Houses be on a vital matter of principle, and do honorable senators opposite contend that it would be impossible to bring about a double dissolution in that event? The other branch of the Legislature might very well say that a certain system of immigration was a proper one to adopt, and this Chamber might not agree with it. For example, it would be possible for, say, the White Australia policy to be at stake. </para>

                                <para>- And honorable senators opposite ought to recognise it. In an ordinary case of the defeat of a Government, the Governor-General has to exercise his own discretion as to whether their request for a single dissolution shall be granted. I am willing to concede that in the case of a request for a double dissolution, the position of the Governor-General would be just as strong. But he has to be guided by the circumstances surrounding each case, and one of his peculiar functions is to afford Parliament every opportunity of performing the work which it was elected to perform. </para>

If Parliament is to remain in its present condition, and the Government are to possess a majority of only one, they know that none of their legislation dealing with matters of Liberal policy will have a chance of passing through this Chamber. But my honorable friends opposite say, " Why not let members of the House of Representatives alone go to the country?" If that were done, and the Cook Government succeeded in securing a majority elsewhere, is it not clear that Labour would still occupy an entrenched position in this Chamber? In such circumstances, Ministers would be just as powerless as they are to-day. We are told that the Labour party is willing to help the Government if the latter will introduce non-party measures. That is to say, Ministers are invited to transform Parliament into a debating Chamber, and to sav to their opponents, " We want to pass such-and-such a measure; will you permit us to do so?" I admit that the Government of the day could bring forward matters of that kind, but the great party which stands  behind the Government in the country would turn round on them, and say, " You had not the courage of your convictions. You remained in power for three years for the sake of the emoluments of office, and had not the courage to test your position before the people." If a dissolution of the other Chamber were secured, and the Labour party won, well and good. They would have their working majority in both Houses; but if the Government succeeded, they would have a working majority in the other place and be in a minority here, so that the very position that we are in to-day would recur. </para>

After a general election, in respect of the Lower House, the Government would be in exactly the same position as they are in to-day, and it would then be necessary either to have a mark-time period, during which none but administrative business would be done, or non-contentious or unimportant measures passed, until a general election took place-- </para>

It is quite possible that a similar state of affairs might occur again, even after a double dissolution, but then we should have the assurance that every possible means had been taken to bring both Chambers into a working condition. </para>

                                <para>- We retained our three seats, and there was a difference of between 40,000 and 50,000 votes between our lowest candidate and the Labour party's highest. In the case of the House of  Representatives  we wrested five seats from the Labour party, and the Fisher Government, which had previously had a majority of ten or eleven, came back in a minority of one. A great deal has been said about the duties of the Governor-General if a double dissolution is asked for. If it is asked for he will be called upon to consider, not merely the bare question of the Government Preference Prohibition Bill, but the power of Parliament, as at present constituted, to work. </para>

                                <para>- It is common sense. I dare say honorable senators opposite will laugh to acorn the idea of bringing common sense to bear on this question, but the Governor-General's duty is to see as far as he can that Parliament is a workable body, and that the people have a chance of making it so. As it stands to-day, it is absolutely unworkable, unless it is going to descend to the position of an ordinary debating society and discuss matters about which there is no party complexion whatever. We want to show that we have the people behind us, and are armed with a determination to pass into law the planks of our policy if we can only get their help. We are accused of doing nothing with regard to the Tariff. During the last election campaign I told the people that we had fought against a Protective Tariff in this Chamber, but recognised that we had been beaten two or three times, and that the people themselves had spoken in favour of a Protective policy. The question of Free Trade was not a burning question at the last election. We were prepared to leave things as they were. </para>

                            <para>Thers were many deputations with the object of rectifying various anomalies which have arisen under the Tariff. I have prepared a schedule of these anomalies ; and, after submitting it to the Committee, will, before I sit down, move that it take the place, so far as it goes, of the Tariff which has been in operation until to-day. Many honorable members, I have no doubt, will be disappointed because particular items in which they are, perhaps, interested, are not included. I may say at the outset, however, that this rectification of anomalies is not regarded by the Cabinet as Tariff revision. </para>
                            <para>I believe the bulk of the people of Australia are Protectionists, because they believe that the conditions existing in Australia are superior to those existing in the countries which compete with us by sending their goods here. That is why this Parliament has placed <inline font-style="italic">ad valorem,</inline> or fixed duties, upon a number of articles; and it is to insure the workers their share of that increased Protection that the Cabinet have arrived at the decision that there shall not be any Tariff revision before the referenda, although the anomalies in existence shall be, as far as possible, rectified. </para>

                            <para>In the Governor-General's Speech at the commencement of the present session, a promise was made that a Bill for the rectification of Tariff anomalies would be introduced during the session. In fulfilment of that promise, I have much pleasure in moving the second reading of this Bill. Honorable senators are fully aware that there is a considerable difference between Tariff anomalies and Tariff revision. The questions are separate and distinct. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable senator has placed himself on the horns of a dilemma. He first told the country that the Fisher Government wanted the referendum passed before they dealt with the Tariff except to rectify anomalies. He now says that they were false to their promise in that regard, and did bring in a Bill to increase duties. I have not had an opportunity of looking up the debate of 1911. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> made the statement I have quoted regarding the introduction of increased duties in the event of the loss of the Referendum Bill, he thought it would help the Victorian Protectionists among his party; but some of them said that his pronouncement was not in accord with the policy as laid down by the Caucus, which seems to be all powerful in these matters. Therefore, there is very little to be considered in that regard. Exception has also been taken to the Government calling upon the Inter-State Commission to deal with Tariff matters. Why was a Bill introduced to appoint that Commission, and why were powers given to the Commissioners if it was not intended that they should be used? </para>

It may also inquire into matters affecting prices of commodities, profits of trade and manufacture, wages, and social and industrial conditions, and any other matter that may be referred to it by either House of the Parliament for investigation.

It was, therefore, a wise and statesmanlike act to appoint a non-political body to investigate Tariff matters, not with the intention of strangling this Parliament, but with the intention of placing before it authoritatively reasons why certain changes should be made, whether by the increasing or the reducing of duties, the freeing of articles from duty, or the putting of duties on articles previously free. </para>

                                <para>- Lobbying cannot be carried on with the same effect as previously, because a non-political body will have investigated the working of the Tariff. If members in either Chamber were so recreant to the duties that they are called upon to perform as to reject the results of the fullest inquiry, they should not be in Parliament. </para>

A little time ago <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> took some exception to the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Inter-State Commission, but I do not know that there is any reason for that. The  chairman  was selected by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> and his colleagues in the last Ministry as a suitable man for a position on the High Court Bench, not simply because of his knowledge of law, but because also of the confidence which the people generally have in his uprightness of character and independence of judgment. </para>

                                <para>.- I do not know. When the Labour party formed its coalition or combination, it carefully left the Tariff an open question, so that each individual member might exercise his own judgment. Even when it closed up its ranks and formed a Government which lasted three years, it said, " New Protection is the thing which we are going to give, and we shall not propose a Protective Tariff until by referendum we have been given the necessary powers." Can we be surprised at that? Exception has been taken to the constitution of the present Government, but I ask, was not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> a Free Trader? Did he not in his early days in this Chamber make one of the strongest speeches in favour of Free Trade? Did he not point out how the workmen would suffer if high protective duties were imposed here? There was not a more prominent Free Trader in the Parliament of New South Wales in his day than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> the Attorney-General of the Fisher Government. When <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid was at the head of affairs in New South Wales he would never hear of any opposition being offered to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> because of his strong Free Trade proclivities and opinions. So it was that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> worked on, and got elected to this Parliament. So well were he and his friends able to manage the party that they staved off the Tariff question by saying, "If we do anything at all we must give equal opportunities to the consumer, the manufacturer, and the worker." Then take <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas.</inline> He was another strong Free Trader in the New South Wales Parliament. In the Fisher Ministry there were, therefore, three strong Free Traders. When I look round the chamber now, I see other men who are still, I believe, Free Traders. Several members of the Labour party are strong Free Traders to-day. </para>

                                <para>- Exactly. Honorable senators cannot take exception to the present Government on the ground that some of its Ministers are Free Traders. When a matter of policy has been determined by the country, it is assumed that every Government will accept that determination; unless, of course, some great change comes about which proves that the decision of the country was wrong, and that the situation has altered. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable senator harps on that; but, during three years of office, he did nothing to correct Tariff anomalies. The present Government have been in office for only twelve months. It has not had majorities to assist to pass legislation, yet the honorable senator asks why does it not introduce a Tariff? Why does it not do this, that, and the other? The first thing that the Government had to do was to see if it could clear the Augean stable of its predecessors. It found certain things requiring alteration, and honorable senators have tried to belittle measures which it has brought forward, the Postal Vote Restoration Bill, and the Government Preference Prohibition Bill. They say that these- measures are a mere nothing. One honorable senator said that the latter Bill is " piffle." </para>

                                <para>- What is the meaning of the fight in the other Chamber, week after week, if the Bill is " piffle " ? The Opposition has fought the Bill as hard as it could, in the belief that underlying it was the whole question of preference to unionists. The Bill deals with a state of affairs which I say is corrupt, politically, and which arose under the control of the preceding Government. That  Govent,ment  said, by Executive minute, that no man should have employment in the Commonwealth Service unless he was a unionist, and that, should it be necessary to reduce the number of hands, the non-unionists were to go first. It was time that action was taken to reverse that decision. No matter how strongly a unionist may be entitled to preference in ordinary circumstances, a Minister is called upon to act as a trustee for. not one section, but for every section of the community. All the people contribute to the revenue of the country. Al] are interested in its prosperity. There should be no ban or hindrance to prevent any man from getting Government employment on the ground that he is a unionist or a non-unionist. The Government is treating all men on a plane of equality in this regard. What was done under the Fisher Government was done by an Executive minute, but if the present Government went out of office tomorrow, and our friends opposite came into power, the latter would have the right, if they saw fit, to go back to what I regard as the very bad system of giving preference to unionists in Government employment. </para>

                                <para>- What nonsense! The Teesdale Smith contract has been the great subject upon which an attempt has been made to rally the opponents of the Government. They have tried the Government on this question, and the Government have been victorious. My friends will say that it was a party vote. I recognise that, and that if the matter were dealt with in the Senate the verdict would be given in another way, and also by a party vote. The Government have placed their cards on the table in this matter, and have told the country exactly what took place. Why should we debate the subject of the Teesdale Smith contract at the' present time when we have a motion on the business-paper to appoint a Select Committee to inquire into the whole circumstances of the case. Honorable senators whom it is proposed to appoint to that Committee should wait until they see the witnesses and hear their evidence before they come to a conclusion on the subject one way or the other. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> talks about contracts being entered into privately, I remind him that there was a contract entered into for powellised sleepers that created a great scandal, and led to the appointment of a Royal Commission, from whom we may expect a report shortly. </para>

Each should respect the rights of the other, and, in taking advantage of our rights, we should interfere with those of the State Parliaments as little as possible. The  matters  dealt with at the Conference of Premiers of the States, which are referred to in  the Governor-General's  Speech, are those dealing with the Murray waters question and the question of the conduct of Savings Bank business by the Commonwealth Bank and the State Savings Banks. These are matters of the greatest importance, and they cannot be dealt with solely by either the Federal or the State authorities. Our powers with regard to the control of waters are of a very limited character. We have power over navigation, but must not interfere with the right of the States for the conservation of waters for irrigation. The question of irrigation with the waters of the Murray is a matter of moment to the States immediately concerned, and to the Commonwealth. Attempts have been made on many previous occasions to have the matter settled, and we all realize that, in the interests of the country, it should be settled on fair and equitable grounds. </para>

                                <para>- The settlement of the question can only be brought about by an agreement as to the quantity of water available for each of the States specially concerned, and this can only be provided for by a system of weirs and locks on the river. It was quite up to the Government of the Commonwealth to say to the State Premiers, " We recognise the need for having this matter settled, and are prepared to contribute a certain amount of the money derived from the people to bring about a settlement." It is true that Queensland may not be affected, and that Tasmania and Western Australia are very little concerned in it, except in so far as it makes for the general prosperity of the Commonwealth. The need of bringing the matter to a conclusion is admitted, and, in the circumstances, it is, in my opinion, wise that we should deal with it in the manner proposed by the Government. Honorable senators .should remember that if the whole control of waters in the Commonwealth had been placed in the hands of this Parliament, and the </para>

A proposal involving the expenditure of £1,000,000 must be admitted to be an important one. It properly finds a place in the Governor-General's Speech, and should be discussed in this Parliament. On the question of the conduct of Savings Bank business, honorable senators will agree that a very large section of the community were opposed to the Commonwealth Bank opening a Savings Bank in opposition to the State institutions. We know that we could not shut up the State Savings Banks by legislation, and our opponents considered that the only way was for the Commonwealth Bank to enter into competition with them. Although the difficulty was pointed out, this Parliament gave the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank power to conduct Savings Bank business, and he has done so. He had the sympathy of the Labour Government in starting that branch of the business of the bank. </para>

                                <para>- The matter is one of grave public policy, and I admit that much is to be said on both sides. The Labour Government had not the power to close the State Savings Banks, but they have attempted to do so in an underhand manner. They attempted to close them by the competition of the Commonwealth Bank. Many persons consider that it is wrong that the Commonwealth Bank should continue its Savings Bank business, and the only way to settle the matter is to bring it before the people again and see whether they are now prepared to go back upon what they previously authorized this Parliament to do. </para>

                                <para>- I am trying to deal with the matter as fairly as possible. Is it not honest that the Prime Minister should say to Parliament, " We agree with the desire expressed by the Premiers of the States that the Commonwealth Bank should not continue the Savings Bank business." Personally, I think it was a mistake for the Commonwealth Bank to enter upon that branch of business, and I say now that the matter is one of such grave public importance that it is worthy of a place in the Governor-General's Speech. The Government cannot be fairly accused of grovelling or kow-towing to the State Premiers when they recognise the importance of this question and express themselves as prepared to deal with it. </para>

                                <para>- That may be so; because before the Commonwealth Bank started, the State Government had the right <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> carry on Savings Bank business in the different post-offices. When that right was denied them, it was only natural that they should seek other methods of carrying on the business they had acquired, and of acquiring more business. I am not cavilling at the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank commencing a Savings Bank business. He is given the power to do so, and he has done so. He considers it desirable to continue and extend that branch of the business of the Commonwealth Bank. If I occupied the position held by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Denison</inline> Miller I should probably feel inclined to adopt the same course. This Parliament determined to put the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank in a very strong position, and decided that he should not be amenable to political influence in any way whatever. When a man is placed in a dominant position like that we expect him to use his best judgment in dealing with the matters referred to him, and that he will not be the blind tool of the Ministry of the day. </para>

The Constitution, in dealing with the power of this Parliament to control banking business, especially exempts all State banking.

Was that any reason why a third should be established ? The present Government have determined to amalgamate these institutions, and to have only one bank there. </para>

                                    GOULD.- That may be. Now, why was it considered so very desirable to open a Savings Bank branch of the Commonwealth Bank? The fact is that my honorable friends started a bank without a penny of capital, and the readiest way in which they could place that institution in a position to compete with other banks was to obtain the requisite capital from the people of this country. In that way they thought they would be able to support the Commonwealth Bank and prevent it from being a failure.

Seeing that we have established the Commonwealth Bank, I desire it to prove a success. We have been told by the Governor of that institution that it is to be the bankers' bank; so far, I do not see any sign of that. I do not think that the Commonwealth Bank will injure the private banks in the slightest degree. </para>

                                <para>- I do not think that we can rival my honorable friends opposite in adopting an attitude of that kind. I have said nearly all that I wanted to say upon this question. My chief aim was to allude to the speech delivered the other day by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> and to the attempt which has been made to belittle the address delivered by the Governor-General at the opening of this session. While the Vice-Regal utterance does not contain many promises, it contains sufficient to keep this Parliament busy if we only set to work in earnest. But with the position which exists to-day it is impossible for any serious business to be transacted. I have no doubt as to what would be the result of debate upon any measure which was intended to give effect to the agreement arrived at by the State Premiers in respect to the Commonwealth Bank. Indeed, I am very doubtful how far the proposal in respect of the utilization of the Murray waters would be acceptable to honorable senators opposite. Both in this Chamber and elsewhere we have recently heard a good deal about trusts and combines. We have been assured that there is some danger of a great trust securing a footing here. What have the Government done in respect of that matter? They have appointed a Royal Commission which will submit a report at an early date. </para>

Should it be found that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Street has not sufficient power to satisfactorily conduct his investigations, it will be quite open to the Government to submit legislation to endow him with that power, and even, if necessary, to amend the Constitution. We ought to be able to make effective whatever powers have been vested in this Parliament by the Constitution. Where the Constitution is defective, I am prepared to see it amended; but I have failed to discover any necessity for its amendment in connexion with any of the referenda proposals. </para>

                                <para>.- Why should the honorable senator continue to hammer away at that ? For the time being, it is dead. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith was a particular friend of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Henry</inline> Chinn, whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has been so anxious to place upon a pedestal. There is just one other matter to which I would like to refer, and that is the administration of the Defence Department during the past few months. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> who was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> predecessor as the Ministerial head of the Department, spoke the other night, I was pleased to note that he took no exception to the action of the Minister of Defence in replying to the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Churchill,</inline> the First Lord of the Admiralty. Both sides of the Senate are pledged not to make the Defence question a party one; and I am sure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> will acknowledge that I was always prepared to support him on matters of defence policy. I think that has been the attitude of the majority of honorable senators. A little time ago <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was called upon to comment on a speech delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Winston</inline> Churchill. I am very glad that he wrote the minute which he did regarding that matter - a minute in which he pointed out that the Commonwealth was proceeding upon a settled policy of naval defence, agreed to at a recent Imperial Conference, from which it was not going to be diverted by the utterance of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Churchill.</inline> I am pleased that it has thus been brought home to the residents of the Old Country that we do not wish to be dependent upon a treaty with a naval Power whose people we do not welcome to the Commonwealth. It is about time that the Pacific was again policed by British war-ships, as it was in the days of old. I believe that that task can be effectively undertaken by our own Navy. There is no need for me to dilate upon the value of our Fleet as a naval training-ground for our own people. I admit that the report of General Ian Hamilton has given us grave reason for pause in respect of our military training scheme, seeing that he has affirmed that it will cost double the amount set down by Lord Kitchener. One cannot fail to realize that our monetary resources are limited ; but if we observe a wise economy and effect a change of policy in respect of our expenditure, I do not think that we need be apprehensive. There are many works connected with the defence of this country the value of which will be spread over a number of years, and the cost of which should be defrayed out of loan funds. For instance, there are parade grounds, rifle ranges, drill-halls and fortifications of a permanent character, and it is only fair that each year should bear its proportion of the expense incurred upon such works. If we wish to make our defence effective, we 6hall have to spend a great deal of money that we cannot reasonably be expected to raise each year. Let us assume, for example, that we wish to expend £400,000 or £500,000 upon these permanent works. It is a wise policy to realize that we cannot construct all works that are going to be of value for the next ten or twenty years out of our ordinary current revenue. The proper course is to borrow money to construct them, and charge each year with its fair proportion of their cost. </para>

                                <para>- I voted for that Bill, and would do it again, so long as it contained a similar provision spreading the cost of the ships over the time for which they would be effective. It is not right to borrow to meet the current expenses of defence for each year, because these ought to be met from the revenue of each year; but it is a wise policy to borrow for defence works that are going to last for a long period of time, leaving each year to bear its own proportion. The Labour party say they do not believe in borrowing; but I do not suppose any party in the Commonwealth has borrowed more <inline font-style="italic">freely</inline> than the State Labour Governments have done. The vaunted non-borrowing policy has not been followed in New South Wales; and in Western Australia the Labour party have also been piling up a big debt. Labour members are beginning to realize that there are circumstances in which borrowing is perfectly justified. I hope that when this debate is finished we shall have an opportunity of dealing with the Government Preference Prohibition Bill. If the Opposition regard it as of such small moment, I hope they will pass the second reading, and allow it to become law, reserving to themselves the right of repealing it if at some future date they are returned to power. </para>

                        <para>. - I have been requested to bring before the Minister of Defence a matter of interest to North Queensland in particular, with regard to the selection of the Australian rifle team for Bisley. It has been the practice of the Commonwealth Council, which consists of one representative from each State, to depute to Queensland the right to choose its two representatives, one from the north and one from the south. Tests were held to select those two representatives for the team which has just left Australia, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> Grosskreutz was duly selected as the representative for North Queensland. He is a member of the Proserpine rifle club, and went at his own expense to Mackay to shoot in the district competition for the selection of two representatives, who afterwards shot in the final at Townsville, under the auspices of the North Queensland Rifle Association. He was selected as the result of that test, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Halliday</inline> was selected as the representative of South Queensland. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Grosskreutz</inline> was informed by letter from the North Queensland Rifle Association that he had been duly selected as the representative of North Queensland in the Bisley team, in the following terms: - </para>

                <para class="block">The second representative was selected from Southern Queensland, on the ground that he had an aggregate of three points more than Grosskreutz. Bagley scored 530, as against Grosskreutz's 527. On these figures it would seem that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bagley</inline> was entitled to represent Queensland; but, when the difference in the conditions, and the number of shots allowed, is pointed out, it will be seen that the score Grosskreutz compares favorably with that of Halliday, and certainly more so with that of Bagley. The conditions of the North Queensland shoot were: - Thirty shots each over 300, 600, 700, 900 yards - total, 120 shots. Gross.kreutz's score, 527. The conditions of the Southern Queensland shoot were: - Twenty-one shots each over 300, 500, 600, and thirty shots each over 900, 1,000 yards. By these figures the Southern Queensland man had 123 shots, as against Grosskreutz's 120 shots, and from .these three shots, of course, it was possible to pile up fifteen points more. By comparison, the northern man's performance was much the better. I quite realize that it is pretty hard to gauge the conditions of rifle shooting at different places. A dozen different things may enter into the matter - light, wind, and various other conditions have to be considered. But I would point out to the Minister that the same variations of conditions operate wherever these tests are made. </para>

                        <para>- For that very reason, it will be seen that the two competitors were absolutely on a different footing. The 'South Queensland man had included in his. test the 600-yards range, which is considered to be the easiest range to shoot over, and he also had substituted the 1,000-yards range for the 700- yards range, which is acknowledged to be the hardest range to shoot over. I approached the Minister on this matter some time ago, when he pointed out to me that the Commonwealth Council had the right of selection, and that he, as Minister, did not consider that he waB justified in interfering. I agreed with that view, and did not further press the matter. The Commonwealth subsidized the team to the extent of £2,000 on the last Estimates, but another £5,000 was accorded to the State Rifle Associations, and a further £5,000 to the District Rifle Clubs throughout the Commonwealth. Therefore the Department should have some greater supervision over these matters than they have had. I recognise entirely that this is a Queensland matter; but a further step has been taken. The father of this young North Queenslander has taken the financial responsibility of sending his son to Bisley as an extra member of the team. I believe that the young fellow will acquit himself very creditably. In North Queensland we regard him as the " pride of the north," and he proved it in the recent contest. I want the members of the Senate, and the Minister of Defence in particular, to watch his performances at the international competitions, and if he acquits himself creditably, which I have no doubt he will do, it will be only fair that compensation should be paid to his father for any expense to which he has been put, out of the £2,000 subsidy already granted, if the Commonwealth Council has the money available; but, if not, the money should be found. The Minister of Defence should have sufficient influence and control over the Council to bring that about. I might mention that  Colonel Merritt,  when I communicated with him on this matter, very kindly offered to bring to Parliament House all the papers, and show me that the Commonwealth Council had acted very largely on the recommendation of the State representatives in Queensland; and, of course, that, with the other representations, went a very long way. He did come up here, at inconvenience to himself, but, being in recess. at the time, the building was closed at 4 o'clock, and, unfortunately, I had gone when he arrived. Later, I saw the Minister, and after hearing his version of the affair, and of how the thing waa conducted, I did not take further steps. I do not say that any outsider should have the privilege at any time of going into a Bisley team and claiming to be franked or compensated for any expense he is put to. But, when I approached the Minister on this matter, he pointed out, very rightly,' that, even if the Department had sufficient jurisdiction, which he rightly denied, it was more than the Department or the Minister dare do, to oust the man who, had been selected by the Commonwealth Council. He said that if Bagley were ousted, he would have a claim against him as Minister, or against the Commonwealth Government. I believe he would. I believe now that Grosskreutz who was selected by the North Queensland Rifle Association, and acknowledged by it to be the representative of North Queensland under the conditions or practices then operating in that State for the selection of the two representatives, has a very high moral, if not a legal, claim against the Association for any expense that may be incurred. I trust that, a better system of selection will be found for Queensland in the future. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. We contend that, for the encouragement of rifle shooting throughout Queensland, the north should be represented. We have there a territory of very huge extent, and, in these matters, we do not want too much centralization in the south. In the north, rifle shooting is one of our chief recreations. The members of rifle clubs in outlying places go to great expense in practising. They put in a lot of their time, and subject themselves to great inconvenience for the indulgence in that very serviceable recreation. I think that the Department, or the Minister, might take this view of the matter, too, that outlying places should receive encouragement to the greatest extent; and, if there is a tendency in any part of the centralized places to not give them the encouragement to which they are entitled, the Department, by virtue of the subsidies which are given to these institutions, should exert a greater influence. I commend these remarks to the members of the Senate generally, and to the Minister of Defence, for their consideration, in the hope that justice will be done. </para>
