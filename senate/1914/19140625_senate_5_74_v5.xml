I regret to have to inform the honorable senator and the Senate that, in spite of every effort to obtain an answer to the question,I am unable to supply one.I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Oakes</inline> that the attitude taken up by the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank with regard to this and similar questions is apparently that there is no obligation on him to answer them, nor any compelling power in this, or in another place, to make him do so. It is in these circumstances that I have been unable to obtain for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Oakes</inline> an answer to his question. </para>

I tried to explain to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Oakes,</inline> and to the Senate, the difficulty I had not only on this, but on previous occasions in obtaining answers relative to the management of the Commonwealth Bank. I said that it seemed to me - and I offered no criticism on it - that the attitude adopted&#39; by the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, whether right or wrong, was that he was under no obligation to answer questions dealing with the management of the internal affairs of the Commonwealth Bank. </para>

I ask now whether the honorable senator is quite sure that the contract was entered into on that date. Is it possible that that was the date on which the quotations were submitted ? </para>

                    <para>. - I do not know whether the Honorary Minister intended us to take his reminder as a general invitation; but I can assure him that, on this occasion, at any rate, there is no intention to forego our privilege, because this offers, perhaps, the most convenient opportunity to let the people of this country know what they will have to deal with at the forthcoming elections. It is well known, of course, that the Senate has a certain amount of power over a Supply Bill. I have no doubt that my honorable friends on the opposite side would like us to take what might be termed the heroic course;but I can assure them that the challenge which was thrown down has been accepted in earnest, and that this Bill, which is the only measure that now stands between the Parliament and the people, will not be used by this side to prevent that challenge from being taken up. With the Supply Bill out of the way, the people will have an opportunity of passing judgment upon these who have occupied the Treasury bench during the past twelve months. We intend to take this opportunity to let the people know some of the sins- of omission which the Government, have committed during that period, and some of their sins of commission. I do not intend to go over the whole gamut, because that would take too long, and I might, perhaps, be charged with &#34; stonewalling&#34; the Bill. It would be quite beyond the power of one man to remember all the&#39; Government&#39;s sins of omission and commission, so I propose to confine myself to the particular blunders of which they have been guilty in the Department with which I was for some time associated, and that is the Defence Department. Regarding their blunders in connexion with the Cockatoo Island Dockyard, I desire to. refer to a couple of articles which have appeared in the official organ of the Fusion party in N ew South Wales. The <inline font-style="italic">Sydney. Morning. Herald</inline> of the 5th June contains a leading article on this subject, from which I quote the following passage: - </para>

                    <para>It is clearly the duty of the Federal Government to take the grave facts with regard to the condition of affairs at Cockatoo Island, which we publish elsewhere, into its immediate and closest consideration. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">The article continues - lt is unnecessary to attempt to allocate the responsibility for the state of affairs now obtaining. What is certain is that no Government, realizing its obligations, dare neglect for one moment the amelioration of the present position. The building of war-ships is a very serious and vital national work, and an important adjunct to the possession of a navy. But it is work that must bc adequate, or it ought not to be done at all. There can be no cheese-paring in this brunch of defence work, for the expenditure of millions of pounds on naval construction  depends  on the efficient management of the department that controls this expenditure. </para>

And so forth. Many of the evils at present existing can be removed. It will be the duty of the Government to remove them, if the building of war vessels is to continue in Australia without an excessive drain on the public resources, and a delay in construction which is expensive in itself and a serious drawback to the efficiency of the Royal Australian Navy. The difficulties are great, but the greater the difficulty the greater the opportunity for the Minister of Defence to prove that he has the desire and the capacity to carry through with expedition and thoroughness an essential reform in the defence organization of the Com.&#34; mon wca 1th. </para>

                <para>On   the 16th June, the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> published a special article, from which I make this quotation - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>In view of the discussion in Parliament, it may be stated that the general features1 of the situation at Cockatoo Island, &#62;as emphasized by the new general manager, have been known to the Naval Board and the Minister of Defence and his predecessor for a considerable time. They were the subject of representation by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cutler,</inline> who was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> Salter&#39;s predecessor in the management .of the dockyard, by the Management Committee who controlled the works on behalf of the New South Wales Government, and by -the State Government, when the transfer to the Commonwealth was&#39; made. </para>
                    <para>The conditions obtaining at the Dockyard w.ere also, it is understood, communicated to the Naval Board by Commonwealth officials some time ago. The report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Julius</inline> on the power plant last year also revealed some aspects of the deficiencies in equipment. The Department has, therefore, ;been in possession of the main facts regarding the Dockyard for at least a year, and in .some respects for a  longer period. </para>
                    <para>Several matters needing reform were from time ~~to time deferred, pending the arrival of the new general manager,  t  .For -some reason (in keeping, however, with the general procrastinating policy adopted with regard to the Dockyard), <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> King-Salter&#39;s  appointment was delayed for several months, during which time conditions grew steadily worse. An Advisory Committee was appointed by the Commonwealth Government with a view of selecting&#39; a suitable expert in naval construction for the post of general manager. The Committee comprised Admiral <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Reginald</inline> Henderson (upon whose report the organization of the Royal Australian Navy was based) ; Captain Haworth-Booth, naval adviser to the Commonwealth in London; and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Denny,</inline> the well-known Dumbarton shipbuilder. After considering a very large number of ^applicants, the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King-Salter</inline> was recommended as the first of six names submitted to the Government in May, 1913. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King-Salter</inline> was, however, not appointed till January, 1914, and did not arrive in Australia till last March. It is believed that a great deal of valuable time in reforming conditions at the Dockyard would have been saved if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> King-Salter&#39;s  services(which were available) had been secured at an earlier date. </para>
                    <para>There is reason to believe that the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King-Salter</inline> has been in the possession of the Minister of Defence for several weeks. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">When the late Government took over the dockyard they knew that up till that time only dredges and small launches had been constructed there, in addition to which one torpedo boat  destroyer had been reconstructed. They knew that a considerable portion of the machinery had been adapted to the purpose for which it waa used, that some of it was obsolete, some of it out of date and some of it unsuitable. They knew, therefore, that a general reorganization of the dockyard was necessary, and that a considerable quantity of new machinery would have to be purchased before the dockyard could be made up-to-date for the building of warships. With that end in view, they took steps to have a committee appointed in England to advise them of a suitable man for appointment as general manager. On the 5th May last year, whilst the elections were proceeding, and whilst I was absent in Western Australia, the recommendation; of that body reached the Commonwealth. When I returned from Western Australia the Fisher Government had been practically defeated. It was only a matter of a few days before its members would be  leav-ing  office, and, in those circumstances, it would have been wrong for me to make any appointment. We made no appointment, therefore, and the papers were left for my successor to-deal with. What happened ? He was scarcely in the saddle before he made a most vicious attack on his predecessor in office in - connexion with the general administration of the Naval Bases, and particularly in connexion with this dockyard. He cannot plead, therefore, that he did not know that a bad condition of affairs existed at Cockatoo Island. Of course he attempted to lay all the blame for these conditions upon the late Government. He attacked us, and we had to accept responsibility. But to-day he has been in office for twelve months with a knowledge of the conditions which then obtained, and he has now to answer to the people of this country for what he has done to put them right. </para>

He came into office in June of last year. He could not say that the committee appointed to advise the late Government in the Old Country was not a committee whose recommendation was worth acting upon, because Admiral Henderson had been in charge of one of the most important dockyards in Great Britain for some time, whilst Captain Hayward Booth was the trusted adviser of the&#34; Government in regard to naval matters at the other side of the world, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Denny</inline> was one of the best known shipbuilders in the Old Country.

                        <para>- The fact is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> Salter did not definitely accept the appointment till February, 1914, and he did not take up his duties until March of this year. My statement is that the Government allowed a period of nine months to elapse from the time they took office until <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> Salter entered upon his duties in Sydney. This, too, iri the case of a dockyard which the Minister had declared was in a hopeless state of disorganization, upon which he affirmed we had wasted thousands of pounds, and in connexion with which, according to him, intolerable delays were taking place. If the late Government were guilty of all these things, what must be the sentence on the present Ministry, who, knowing all about them, took nine months to make the appointment of a general manager, and during that period refused to give effect to a single recommendation of the acting manager? If the charge of confusion can be sheeted home to the Fisher Government as the result of their administration of Cockatoo Island Dockyard, what charge can be sheeted home to the present Government, who allowed nine months to intervene before making an appointment? </para>

                        <para>- The Minister informed us only the other day that he waited until the High Commissioner came to Australia in order that he might consult him on the matter before taking definite action. Now, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid may be a very clever politician, but he is certainly not an authority on naval construction. Yet the Minister declined to accept the recommendation of three competent gentlemen in England regarding the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> Salter, and preferred to await the arrival of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid in order that he might first have a conversation with him on the question. In order to show that the late Government were quite aware of the conditions which obtained at the dockyard, and that they were preparing to take every step necessary to put that dockyard on a proper basis, I come to the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Julius</inline> for the purpose of advising the Government as to the best means of providing  an up-to-date power plant there. That gentleman was appointed whilst I was Minister of Defence. We all remember the sensational action taken by the Minister to call public attention to the carelessness of the late Government in this connexion. In order to direct the attention of the electors to the alleged carelessness of his predecessor in office, he dramatically closed down the dockyard on receiving the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Julius</inline> regarding its condition. </para>

Was that action on the part of the Minister taken for any other purpose &#171;than that which animated him when he made an attack upon the Fisher Government previously, namely, a desire to create in the public mind an impression that we had entered into a bad bargain, and that the present Ministry had to undertake a Herculean task in putting things right? But supposing that everything which the honorable senator said was absolutely justified - that the plant at the dockyard was dangerous to human life - what can be said of his subsequent action? The answers given to questions to-day show that the Government have not installed a new power plant yet - that they have not even called for tenders for it. They have taken out a few of the boilers, but, with that exception, the power plant at Cockatoo Island Dockyard to-day is the same as that which they took over from their predecessors. &#39; </para>

I hold in my hand a Parliamentary paper which was printed on the 14th September of last year, and on pages 3 and 4 of it are to be found the only statements which can be in any way construed into indicating weakness on the part of the boilers. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Julius</inline> said - </para>

After the dramatic action of my honorable friend opposite, a Board was appointed to report on the boilers, and on the 7th August they submitted their report, in which they draw attention to the fact that a number of boilers are worn out, but not in any paragraph of their report, although they go into details, do they speak of any of the boilers as being dangerous to human life. Various witnesses before the Select Committee said a worn-out boiler was not necessarily dangerous. It means worn out for economic, effective work. Although the Committee of officers from the Department knew the dramatic action that their chief had taken, and that something desperate was required to buttress him up and save his face, not a word appears in their report as to one boiler being dangerous to human life, working at the pressure at which they were working. The Minister shelters himself behind the Naval Board, but he was. present -at &#39;the meeting of the Board when the matter was considered. He ought to know that there is a telephone line between Sydney and Melbourne, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Julius</inline> is on the telephone or could have been reached by a telegram. Yet the simple idea of sending a telegram to Sydney and asking <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Julius</inline> whether the boilers were dangerous to human life never occurred to him.

And that he did not think he was warranted in considering whether the boilers were or were not dangerous? - He has said that he did not, and I am prepared to accept that statement, and to believe that he used the word &#34; practically &#34; in that sense. 2183. I feel confident that the boiler could have been repaired in a few days? - I thought at the time it was possible to stud it, and. that that would be a comparatively cheap job, but the men to whom I have referred asserted that the plate underneath was in such a condition that they could not risk studding it, but that they would have to take it off, drill it right through, and rivet it. 2184. It was only on account of the cost of repairing the boiler, that it was condemned? - Yes. </para>

                    <para>I have reported very strongly against. Cockatoo Island as a naval ship-building establishment, and there are several reasons why. First of all, it is an island, and difficult uf access. It cost money to get material there, and to get material away from it. It is difficult from the point of view of labour; the men cannot live near it, and it takes them a long time to get there and to get to- their homes afterwards. They probably have to leave home in. the morning with a very poor meal, and get a scratch one in the middle of the day, and. it is very late at night before they get another. That is- working under poor conditions. With regard to the island itself, the area is limited. There&#39; is a. very big&#39; rock in. the centre, with, a limited amount of flat land around. You cannot lay out shops to the best advantage; that is, you cannot lay them out as shops are laid out in other parts of the world, so that the raw material comes in at one end and goes through a series of operations until finally fixed on the ship. The place is as hot as the ante-chamber to Hades in the summer. It is hot because that huge rock in the centre absorbs the heat and keeps off the wind. Whichever way the wind is blowing the men are working under fearful conditions, which men ought never to be asked to work under. The blacksmith foundry, and all those shops, are worked under shocking conditions; and I object for that reason. I contend that any work done there will be done at great cost. Nobody gets any good out of it - the Government do not get any good, nor do the men, nor any one. I have always contended that it would be perfectly easy to find another site in Australia, and equip it with up-to-date, modern machinery in every particular, at a less cost than has been incurred for Cockatoo Island. We should then be able to turn out our ships cheaper and quicker. </para>

                        <para>- It is one of the finest harbors in Australia, if not the finest. No one can say anything against it as a harbor. He says it would cost money to get material to Cockatoo Island, but, if that be so, what would it cost to get material to Port Lincoln ? Unless one got a full ship-load of material, everything less than a ship-load would have to be transhipped from some other port in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> will have a better acquaintance with the geography of South Australia in three months&#39; time than he has now. The Iron Knob is at the other end of the Gulf. Again there is no coal supply at Port Lincoln or anywhere near it. There is no coal supply in the State of South Australia, and all the coal required for the dockyard, if established there, would have to be brought from New .South Wales. There is no labour supply at Port Lincoln. The total population of the place is somewhere about 1,500, and I ask honorable senators to contemplate a proposal to establish a dockyard at a place where there is a very small population, and hundreds of miles from any place where there is a considerable population. Any surplus labour required at any time would have to be brought a great distance from one of the capital cities of the Commonwealth. I did not take that advice.. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> likes to take it and establishes a Naval Dockyard at Port Lincoln he must accept the responsibility. I think the honorable senator would have some difficulty in getting Parliament to vote the money and in persuading the people of Australia that that is the place to establish a dockyard for the building of war-ships. When &#39;this gentleman condemns the Cockatoo Island Dockyard, I want the Senate and the country to know that the same gentleman made the recommendation to establish a dockyard at Port Lincoln. After a recommendation like that from him, I did not take very much notice of Captain Clarkson&#39;s objections to the Cockatoo Island Dockyard. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. It was not an ideal site, but it had reached a certain stage of development which permitted a start to be made with the construction of war-ships there more quickly than at any other -place in Australia. Moreover, we had entered into a contract with the Government of New South Wales for the construction of war-ships. That contract was not. proceeding satisfactorily, and we very soon realized that it would be more satisfactory to take over the dockyard altogether. </para>

                <para class="block">This is the Third Member of the Naval Board dealing with the part of the administration that comes under him. He makes a drastic recommendation to the Minister, and yet he says that he did not know at what pressure the boilers were working at any time. I come now to the evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Manisty,</inline> the then Secretary of the Naval Board. In answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> at question 1911, I find this evidence - </para>
                <para>Did each individual member of the Board read <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Julius&#39;</inline> report right through before proceeding to act upon it? - I read it, and I think that Captain Onslow did so. The Minister read it, and I am sure that Captain Clarkson did. </para>
                <para>You proceeded collectively to discuss it? - Yes. It arrived on a Wednesday, together with ft duplicate copy, which, I think, was given to the Minister. Captain Clarkson took the report home with him, with a view of considering it before the Board met next morning. </para>
                <para>Would the Board have met next morning in any case? - A special meeting was held to deal with the report. We considered it a serious matter; but Captain Clarkson suggested that we should wait until the following day before taking action. </para>
                <para class="block">Yet there was no telegram sent to Sydney </para>
                <para>Who was absent from that meeting? - Admiral Creswell was the only absentee. </para>
                <para>Was the discussion prolonged? - I should hardly say it was. We discussed it from half-an-hour to three-quarters of an hour. </para>
                <para>Was a special meeting convened to consider the matter? - I am practically certain that a meeting was convened for that purpose. </para>
                <para>Was there any difference of opinion as to the meaning to be given to the words &#34; practically worn out&#34;? - No; but I think a suggestion was made that we should ask <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Julius</inline> for a further interpretation. </para>
                <para>There was then an idea that the phrase might be open to more than one construction? - I thought it was a rather serious action that we proposed, and we considered whether we should obtain from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Julius</inline> any further confirmation of his statement. I do not think there was any doubt, however, as to what should be done. </para>

No action was taken to get in touch with Sydney or to communicate with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Julius,</inline> although there was a doubt in the minds of the members of the Naval Board, and apparently of the Minister,- as to what was meant.

I want to read an extract, because this expert imported by the Government at great cost had one good word to say for us, anyhow, which needs to be said at the present juncture, in view of the attempt now being made to put all the blame on the workmen in the dockyard - </para>

                    <para>I ought to add that the work which I saw in progress was of good quality, and left very little to be desired. I have, however, no doubt that the work here costs more than it would cost in good modern shops. After careful consideration, it seems to mc that any improvements to be made at Cockatoo Island must be dependent altogether on the programme of ship-building which may be adopted for this yard, and that until such programme is arranged over a series of years it is not possible to settle to what extent more money should be spent on shops, machinery, wharfs, &#38;.c. </para>

                    <para>The cruiser, I understand, can probably be launched in April or May, 1014. If thu slip on which the cruiser is being built is to be used continuously, as is necessary if the yard is to be worked economically, all arrangements for the next ship to be laid down on that slip ought to be well in hand now. When specifications for material have to bc sent to England, when the plates and bars have to bc rolled there and sent out to Australia, it takes a long time to lay down a ship after a decision lias been arrived at to build her. </para>

Has Parliament been asked to sanction any proposal for the ordering of more plates for building other ships? Not a word has been heard. &#34; Preference to unionists &#34; has been of infinitely more importance than the Australian Navy. A dead-lock between the two Houses has been of far more importance than getting these works going in an economical and workman-like fashion, and so the Minister wastes his time in political cockfighting, and leaves these, to his mind, less important matters to drift.

                <para class="block">My second charge against the Government is that they have no plans or proposals. They are simply drifting along, and a dead-lock suits them. The delay with the building of the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> suits them, because they know that as soon as she is ofl the slip it will disclose the fact that they have no plans; that they have made no preparations for the building of any ship to follow her, and that, therefore, men must be thrown out of work and the dock-  yard practically laid idle. The Government have planned all through for delay. The whole of their programme for the dockyard for the last year has been delay. Leaving that matter, I will pass to Fremantle, at the other side of the continent, and deal with the provision of Naval Bases. A Fleet without a Naval Base is hampered, cannot move, and certainly would be useless in time of war. The late Government had a programme to provide the Naval Bases necessary for the Fleet. They had Admiral Henderson&#39;s programme in that regard, and were proceeding with it. The present Government, as with the Cockatoo Island Dockyard, wanted to find fault with the late Government. They wanted to show the electors that we were a set of incompetents, and so they said, &#34; The Labour Government blundered again at Cockburn Sound. They chose the wrong spot. They acted with insufficient advice. We must get another expert out to advise us.&#34; And so they brought out <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Maurice</inline> Fitzmaurice, at a cost of 4,600 guineas and incidentals, which will be disclosed when the Budget is submitted in the next Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Maurice</inline> Fitzmaurice has been here, and gone away. He reported in December, 1913. What is the position after .the Government have had his  advice? Cockburn Sound is in exactly the position to-day that it was in when he came out. No sooner did my honorable friend assume office than one of his first acts was to discharge about 100 men employed there in proceeding with the development of the Naval Base. Since then the Government have had about forty or fifty men pottering about and getting in each other&#39;s way. They have had the report of an expert. What did he tell them ? For the information of the Senate I shall read what he said - </para>

                        <para>- Nothing of the kind. What I am endeavouring to make the honorable senator understand is that Admiral Henderson recommended the establishment of a Fleet Base at Jervoise Bay; that the late Government undertook a preparatory survey of that spot, and of other parts of Cockburn Sound; and that, acting on the advice of their responsible officers, they decided that it was the best site available. . They were about to proceed with the works required to make it a Fleet Base, when the present Government - which the honorable senator supports - came into office, stopped operations on the pretext that there waa not sufficient information available; and brought out an expert from England at a cost of &#163;4,600. That expert reported in December of last year, and my prophecy is that the Government will not do anything until after the impending elections, because otherwise they must show that the Fisher Ministry chose the right spot. </para>

                        <para>- I charge the Government with having, for political purposes, and with a view to scoring off the late Government, cost this country somewhere about &#163;10,000. They expended &#163;4,600 in importing an expert from the Old Country; and they have spent another &#163;3,000 or &#163;4,000 in putting down that trial shaft, which was totally unnecessary, because, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has said, one can determine the nature of the strata at Jervoise Bay, and for 12 miles south of it. Let me tell him that, 5 miles north of Jervoise Bay, the Western Australian Government established a dock, aud the bottom of it fell out into the Indian Ocean. The late Government did not need anything more to convince them that they could not put down a dock at Jervoise Bay. What <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Maurice</inline> Fitzmaurice said, in effect, to the present Government was, &#34; If you wish to play with this matter, you may put down a shaft here. It will kill time.&#34; That is all that the shaft is being sunk for. What will happen at Jervoise Bay is what happened at Fremantle - the workmen will strike the Indian Ocean. The people of Western Australia are laughing at the Minister and at the Naval Board for putting down a shaft costing thousands of pounds within a few miles of that ghastly failure which cost Western Australia &#163;200,000 - a failure which was engineered by the Liberal party there. As a matter of fact, that party won an election upon it. With that circumstance staring us in the face, we refused to consider the question of the establishment of a graving dock at Jervoise Bay, and declared that if a dock was to be established there at all, it would have to be a floating dock. The fact that the Government are putting down a shaft there is an acknowledgment that what they did, they did for political purposes, and nothing more. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Maurice</inline> Fitzmaurice was brought out from the Old Country to condemn the late Government. He was sent down to Port Western with that object in view. Yet what does he say? He says - </para>

                    <para>I am, therefore, of opinion that a bucket dredger or bucket dredgers ought to be employed for the entrance channel, and a suction dredger with revolving cutter for the turning basin. All the dredgers ought to be able to dredge their own flotation. I understand there are at the present time two bucket dredgers under construction, which it is proposed to use at Flinders Naval Base. Both these dredgers have, under contract, to be able to dredge 900 tons per hour. </para>

I am glad that the Minister has reminded me of those dredgers. It is true that we ordered two dredgers, one of which was to be constructed in Australia, whilst the parts of the other were to be obtained from England and assembled here. Those parts have now been lying in Cockatoo Island Dockyard for three months, and no attempt has been made to put them together. </para>

                        <para>- The late Government let a contract in Sydney to Messrs. Poole and Steele for the construction of one of these dredgers. The period covered bv that contract has now expired, but no penalty has been imposed. It will be remembered that the Government would not extend any consideration to the Western Australian Government in regard to its contract for the supply of sleepers, but when dealing with private firms they have an extremely tender conscience. Evidently they think that it would be cruel to enforce the penalties provided in the case of a contract for the construction of the dredger, and accordingly they have extended the time of the contractors. That is further evidence of their policy of delay. Indeed, delay and procrastination seem to be the chief feature of the administration of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> in Naval Defence matters. That being so, what else can we expect but wasteful expenditure and discord in the Navy Office? I put these facts before the electors of Australia, backed up as they are by the evidence which I have read from official reports. </para>

                    <para>. - Before replying to the statements of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> I would like to express my regret at the circumstances which are responsible for him speaking earlier in the debate than the Leader of the Opposition. I only trust that the indisposition which has prevented <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> from being present in this chamber will be of brief duration, and that we shall see him here again before the session closes. I turn now to the matters which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has brought forward, and personally I can have no objection to him affording me an opportunity for dealing with some of the very reckless statements which he has made, not only in this chamber, but outside of it, and which - if I am any judge of his methods - he will continue to make despite the fact that ample refutation of them is forthcoming. It would be impossible for me, in the brief time that I propose to occupy, to deal with the thousand and one matters which are involved in the statement of the honorable senator and with the important naval establishments which formed the subject of his criticism. I shall attempt however, to deal with some of the major ones - major in the sense that attention has been directed to them by his statements this afternoon. The honorable senator commenced by reading quotations from the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> which is a new source of inspiration for him. There were only two definite statements in the whole of the extract he read from that paper, although it contained a good deal of reckless assertion. One was that the Government must at once introduce piece-work at Cockatoo Island, and the other that, although we had <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Julius&#39;</inline> report in hand recommending the provision of a new power plant, no steps had been taken to carry out that recommendation. That is the influential journal whose advice he urges us to take, insisting, apparently without regard to consequences, and without preliminary inquiries or conferences with the men, on our at once introducing piece-work. The honorable senator could only have read the quotation to show that it carried his support, and that we were open to the criticism which the writer launched against us. </para>

                        <para>- There is nothing to justify that assertion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has referred to the alleged delay in the appointing of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> Salter, repeating the statement which he made a little time ago, and to which I offered a very reasonable and fair-minded answer. He said that when he left office -there was in the Department a recommendation from a committee appointed by him in favour of appointing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Salter</inline> as manager at Cockatoo Island, and the honorable senator has been going about the country alleging that a delay of eight or nine months took place afterwards. I concluded the matter in December, and we took .office at the end of June - so that the period was only about five months, because for a month after we took office I was unable to do anything in the way of appointments owing to the Government having been challenged by a vote of censure by the honorable member&#39;s party. There is  a well-known rule, which I am not certain we ought to respect too closely outside matters of policy, that when a Government coming from the country is challenged it ought to abstain from all but routine business until it has made its position good in the House. After the censure motion had been disposed&#34; of, I  felt  it my . duty, in spite -of the recommendations -of the committee, to make other inquiries regarding which I informed the House in December last. I do not feel bound to take the recommendation of any committee without inquiry, no matter how influential its members. This committee had recommended a gentleman who occupied at that time a position which suggested to me the  advisableness  of making other inquiries about him. I never had any doubt about his professional qualifications, but I thought it advisable to make other inquiries as to his possession of -tact, and his capacity as a manager for an Australian dockyard, knowing that he was coming straight <inline font-style="italic">from</inline> a  naval  dockyard at Home to take .charge of .a yard manned by Australians, who were familiar, perhaps, with conditions other than those existing in a British yard. I thought it would be nothing short of disastrous to bring put here a gentleman who, for want of certain personal qualities, might be found  ill-equipped  to take charge of our establishment. I, therefore, made other inquiries, and in the course of these, while communicating with the High Commissioner, I ascertained that he also was informed regarding this gentleman, and was on his way out to Australia; so I .thought it better to delay the matter until I had an opportunity of personally conversing with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid about it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> now twists that round and says that I was waiting for <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid&#39;s advice as to the professional qualifications, of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Salter.</inline> What I did, before I ever thought of delaying until <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid came, was to institute inquiries, which could not be made in a day. I am pleased to be able to say that as the result I satisfied myself that when I cabled Home for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> Salter at the end of December, I did so with more confidence that I was inviting the right man to come here than perhaps has been the case with any other man with whose appointment I have had anything to do. </para>

                        <para>- I will deal with that matter later. I have fully justified what little delay did take place, because we wanted in a manager tact and other personal qualities necessary to lift the yard up from its present unsatisfactory condition on to a good, sound basis. The delay which &#39;did occur is more than justified by the results. In any case, it was not a delay of nine months; at the most, it was five months. I do not suppose that will prevent <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> from saying nine months when he next goes on a platform, because he has repeated the statement this afternoon.  Although I reminded him that the appointment was made in December, and although he held in his hand a document showing that it was made then, he still did not feel any sense of shame in repeating the statement. </para>

I do not know how far that is true, because my recollection is that the, report was handed to the press by roe very shortly afterwards. In any ca-se, it was made available to this Chamber. I must  remind the honorable .senator that the evidence he read this afternoon was all obtained after I closed the yard. That evidence, for what it is worth, was not available to me when I came to the decision which caused the boilers to shut down. </para>

The question to-day, so far as I am concerned, is not whether Cockatoo Island Dockyard ought to have been closed then in the light of what honorable senators know now. The only question I am concerned with now is whether, in the light of the information put before me at the time, I was justified in taking the course I did. Here is the evidence on which I acted. Here is the report placed before me. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> said that I had acted upon the advice of one member of the Board, I corrected him, and said it was the advice of the Board. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> said, &#34; No, it was one member.&#34; Here is the document, signed by three members, and the fourth one was absent through illness.

                    <para>The following is extracted from the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Julius,</inline> viz.: - &#34; The whole of the boilers, of which there arc six, are practically worn out. All of them were, I believe, second-hand boilers when installed,   and at the present time considerable repairs have to be effected every week-end to keep them running for another week.&#34; I am of opinion that the Board, having received this report, can pursue no other course than to immediately order the fires in these boilers to be drawn, and the boilers put out of, use until a survey can be made by a board of engineer officers. This will entail the suspension of a number of men for at least a week, in the case of a favorable  report  being received. On the other hand, if the boilers aru condemned as unsafe as the result nf this survey, the work of construction must In: stooped until other plant can be provided or other arrangements made. </para>

In view of that statement, no one can say that, as a layman, with the advice of the professional gentlemen of my Department before me that even delay was dangerous, I could conscientiously do other than I did. If this had <inline font-style="italic">been</inline> a private establishment, and it had been known that private employers were keeping boilers like this in use, every honorable senator would have denounced it as an evidence of greed on the part of a capitalistic employer. In the State House <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> will remember we frequently heard claims for the inspection of land boilers, because of the great danger to life and limb incurred by those working with unsafe boilers. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know  that  any man could have done other than I did. The three members of the Board presented a minute to me that, because of the way in which they read <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Julius&#39;</inline> report- and it is immaterial whether they read it right or not - they came to the conclusion and advised the Minister that it was dangerous to continue to run those boilers. I say that I should have been criminally guilty if, in view of that, I had not immediately ordered the boilers to be closed down for examination. No other member of the Senate but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> would urge that against me as a crime. </para>

                        <para>- No; it is not. The explanation of that is this: I may point out that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Manisty,</inline> in his evidence, did not confirm that, but said he thought it was so. I speak now after many months have gone by, and my recollection of the matter is that when the report first came before us I did not have an opportunity to read it. I received a telephone message next morning that it was necessary to have a Board meeting, because of the serious nature of the report, and I at once went down to the meeting. </para>

                        <para>- That is quite right. The report was a long document. I receive many reports over night that I have not time to read before I go to bed. I did not read that report. I did not consider that it was sufficiently urgent to do so, and next morning I was informed of the serious nature of it, and that the Board desired a meeting to consider it, and I went down to the meeting. In any case there was the recommendation from three members of the Board, and there was only one course open to me, and that was to follow their advice, or, in the alternative, to run what appeared from the papers to be a serious risk, involving the lives of human beings. What were the alternatives to be considered ? The worst that could happen from following the course I approved was that there would be a little delay - a temporary shutting down of the works. The other alternative, had these boilers been as dangerous as the Board advised me they were, was to risk the sacrifice of life. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> can take that risk if he likes. I will not do so now or at any other time. </para>

                        <para>- Then I can produce the documents, and show them to honorable senators. Within a week of the time when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> made that reply - the question was asked on the 19th December, and the telegram to  Colonel Miller  is dated the 24th of the same month -  Colonel Miller  was instructed to proceed to Sydney to represent the Government in taking over the property. It was no mere question of valuation preparatory to taking over the property, but the actual taking over of the property. The papers disclose, not that preliminary negotiations were in progress, but that the negotiations at that time were completed with the exception of one or two details referring particularly to the position of the officers who were to be transferred. This piece of deception by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was duplicated in another place by his leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> who assured the members of the House of Representatives that they would be consulted before the transfer was completed. The right honorable gentleman never kept that promise. There was in this case an attempt to get the matter through without Parliament being informed of it. The Ministry desired to place it in such a position as to prevent criticism of their action until it was too late to criticise. There was a very good reason for this. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> knew that he was taking over an obsolete plant, and the State Government knew that they were getting rid of it. No sooner did the State Government find this ready purchaser than they loaded the burden upon their friends, and immediately set to work to select an ideal spot where they are. starting an up-to-date establishment for much less than the last Commonwealth Government paid for an obsolete one. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend is quite right. No one would ever dream now of building the establishment which he bought at a cost of nearly &#163;1,000,000. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has again referred to what he has described as a policy of delay, and says that we did not act on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Julius&#39;</inline> report as promptly as we might. I gave an answer to-day to a question put by the honorable senator with regard to this matter. It indicated that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Julius,</inline> having presented his re port, I think, in July, was then invited to come to Melbourne and confer with the Naval Board. It was not possible for him to do that in twenty-four hours. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Julius</inline> is a busy man. He would not be worth much to the Department if he were not. As a busy man, well up in his profession, it was some time before he was available for the purpose. When he was available there were many details to be discussed, as honorable senators can readily understand. The upshot was that an agreement was arranged with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Julius</inline> to put through all the plans and specifications, to call for tenders, and, when they came in, to supervise the installation of the plant. It is quite obvious that we were not in a position to spend a single penny on the plant until Parliament had made the necessary appropriation. There was, therefore, a clause inserted in the agreement providing that it was to be contingent upon Parliament making the necessary provision. No doubt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> would have rushed into the matter, quite ignoring Parliament. I have not the slightest doubt, judging by the way the honorable senator took over Cockatoo Island, that he would have snapped his fingers at Parliament, and would have blundered ahead without considering the result. It did not appear to me that that would be a right course to follow in view of what was due to Parliament, or that it would be good business. I therefore inserted in the agreement a provision that it was to be contingent upon a parliamentary appropriation. As early as possible we got Parliament to appropriate the money, &#163;175,000. Steps were then immediately taken to inform <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Julius</inline> that he might get to work. I do not know whether he had gone before the Loan Bill was passed, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Julius</inline> notified us that he was going away for a holiday at Christmas time, and he went. On the 24th January, the Third Naval Member of the Board had a conference with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Julius.</inline> Some attempt has been made by the cheap wits of the Opposition to suggest that it was not necessary to get a parliamentary appropriation to justify  a  conference. Of course it was not. But having got the appropriation it was necessary for some one to go still more into detail with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Julius</inline> as to the way in which his recommendations were to be carried out. For that purpose the Third Naval </para>

                </continue>
                <para class="block">Member travelled from here to Sydney in order to thresh out the whole matter. The result was that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Julius</inline> was then given the necessary authority to proceed. He had to draw up plans and specifications of the plant required before tenders could be advertised for. I cannot say whether honorable senators know anything about an extensive power plant ; I do not myself; but I understand from inquiry that it includes a multiplicity of separate machines and parts, and carefully drawn specifications are required for each. As my honorable friends opposite tell us, when calling for tenders we should always beware of the contractors. A contractor is a man who appears to be wanting in any conception of what is right. </para>

                        <para>- The answer given to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> discloses the fact that, on the 24th February, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Julius</inline> was given final instructions to proceed. I assume from what follows that he then got into touch with the general manager at Cockatoo Island. It must occur to any one that, in putting in new plant in place of an old one, the new installation must proceed on such lines as will not throw the establishment idle. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Julius,</inline> therefore, got into touch with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> Salter, and a month later they submitted a joint recommendation urging that, instead of proceeding on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Julius&#39;</inline> recommendation to invite tenders for one plant only, alternative- tenders should be invited in order that the Board might be able to determine as between the two plants which would- give best value for the money. That is what has happened, and nothing more can happen until <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Julius</inline> has completed his plans and specifications. I do not know, but I presume that by this time, they are nearly completed; but that is a matter for which I have no responsibility. </para>

But the honorable senator will notice that the arrangement with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Julius</inline> was one which, I think, had everything to commend it. He was not only to prepare the plans and the specifications, but to superintend the installation of the plant. There is a great deal in that. As honorable senators will know, a man who draws up the plans and the specifications, who is the architect of the installation, is the best man in the world to see that it is properly carried out. The arrangement made with Mr; Julius was on the basis that he did the whole thing. If we were not going to get the money there was no need to proceed&#39; under that arrangement. </para>

                        <para>- The recommendation was signed by Captain Hughes-Onslow, on whose behalf the honorable senator kept us all out &#39; of bed one night. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> who never tires of asking that we should keep defence out of the arena of party politics, and who never misses an opportunity of trying to make defence a party question, has alleged to-day that what has taken place on my part has been an attempt to belittle or to deprecate the possibility of ship-building in Australia. The answer to that allegation is the statement of a few simple facts. If we wanted to prevent Cockatoo Island Dockyard from having a fair chance; if we wanted to create the impression that war-ships could not be built there; if we were out to destroy the initial effort which has been made there, would we have taken the first opportunity that came to us to ask Parliament to appropriate &#163;175,000 to replace the obsolete machinery which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> had bought a few months ago? Would we have taken the action we did to bring out here, at a good salary, a gentleman like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> Salter; would we not have been prepared to let the establishment run along as it was, in a condition of muddle, knowing that if it was allowed to continue it would surely run itself out in the course oi time? If we were anxious to see this establishment end in total failure, would we do what we are prepared to do now, and that is to invite Parliament to vote a sum of &#163;200,000 to still further equip this establishment and replace the obsolete machinery which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> bought, and about which he made such a fuss at the time? That is the answer to the statement that we are not trying io give Cockatoo Island Dockyard a fair chance. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> also said that we were without a programme; that we only sought delay; that we wanted the whole thing to run to the ground; that we were anxious, when the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> was launched, that the men should be discharged ; that we were taking no steps to provide for a continuity of works. I have no doubt that when he leaves this Chamber he will make these statements again. </para>

                        <para>- Before the honorable senator departs, let me show the little foundation there is for his statement. Let me first deal with the programme of the honorable senator, who says that we have no programme. A little while before he left office, he sent to British shipyards orders for two ships - the submarine depot-ship and the oil-ship. He spoke about the programme of his Government. It was to send orders&#39; for vessels to be built out of Australia. </para>

When I found what the position was, I caused a cablegram to be sent to the Admiralty, telling them that the present Government were anxious that these vessels should be built in Australia, and asking them to say how far they were committed, because by that time tenders had been received. An answer came back which disclosed that in fairness to the Admiralty they could not then counteract the orders which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> had given. </para>

                        <para>- Nor can I do so approximately. The last statement is on a par with other reckless statements which this ultra-party politician is always making on a matter which he pretends should be kept out of the arena of party politics. No fair-minded man can charge the present Government with any delay in spending that portion of the &#163;175,000 necessary for the installation of a new power plant. I have shown my honorable friend what his programme was - sending orders for the building of boats outside Australia. He said that the present Government were anxious, when the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> was launched, that there should be no other &#34;boat to take her place, that the workmen should be thrown idle, even appealing to their very natural fear in order to prejudice them against the Government. It would have been very much better and more honest, but very much less like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> if he had told the truth, and said that, whilst he did what he could to divert work from the establishment, at the same time he was speaking without any knowledge of what the Government intended to do. Let me point out the difference between the last Government and the present one. </para>

It is time that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> and others ceased these absolutely unfounded aspersions about our trying to leave the dockyard without work&#39; when it was the Labour Government, I repeat, who sent the orders for ship-building out of Australia - orders which I tried to countermand in order to have the work done in Australia. In contrast to the action of my honorable friend, who did what he could to divert work from these shores, and to put money into the pockets of workmen other than those engaged at Cockatoo Island, I intend to show what is proposed by the present Government. I admit that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> did something. He did not merely propose to send the order for building these ships out of Australia - he sent them. Here is the programme of the present Government - it is rather a long minute, and I do not know whether I had not better give the substance of it. </para>

                        <para>- Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> desire us to order the material today that is required for the building of a ship five years hence? The position in regard to Cockatoo Island Dockyard is that it is necessary to proceed to consider the construction of a subsequent vessel before the vessel on the stocks has been completed. In order to do that, we have to look ahead, and see how soon orders should be placed for the materials required for the construction of vessels to be subsequently built. Perhaps it would be well for me to read a portion of the document which I hold in my hand, with a view to showing exactly to what the Government are committed. </para>

                        <para>- That will not prevent my honorable friend from going round this country and repeating his libels. I propose to read a portion of the minute regarding this matter which I submitted some time ago to my colleagues. In it I dealt with the necessity which exists for providing for continuity of work at Cockatoo Island. That continuity of work is necessary in order that the establishment may be run with businesslike economy, and that the management may be able to retain a thoroughly trained and equipped staff. Otherwise the advantage which we gained in the building of one ship would be lost in connexion with the construction of another. It is, therefore, desirable to provide for continuity of work, in order that, as far as any establishment can do so, we may keep attached to Cockatoo Island the men who are skilled in the particular work to perform which the dockyard exists. I also pointed out in my minute that, in order to give effect to the Henderson programme, it was time to consider steps for the placing of orders for further vessels. Following these preliminary observations, I went on to say - </para>

                    <para>These considerations have induced the Government to approve a minimum ship-building programme covering the next five years.

                    <para>The Board, however, having fully considered the whole matter, advised, in place of the above, two light cruisers of the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> class, and two improved submarines. In making this recommendation, the Board is following the lead of the Admiralty at Home. It appears not improbable that the present type of destroyer will disappear altogether, its place being taken partly by the improved submarine, which is, in fact, a submersible torpedo-boat, and partly by a new type of light cruiser which is in the nature of a destroyer destroyer. It is also considered by the Naval Board that the cruisers will be of more naval value in the immediate future than the six destroyers originally proposed. The proposed modification, I am pleased to say, has the approval of Admiral  Patey,  who, in addition to the reasons advanced, expresses the opinion that they will be more satisfactory for the training of the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> than the destroyers would be. These two cruisers will bc built at Cockatoo; but, regarding the submarines, it is recommended, owing to the special and intricate structure and mechanism of these vessels, that they should be ordered from British yards. It will be sufficient if the orders for these vessels arc placed next year. </para>
                    <para>The total estimated cost of the modified programme will bc f 1,700,000, a sum slightly less than the estimated cost of the programme for which it has been substituted. This cost will be spread over the next four or five financial years. These proposals&#62; as I have stated, the Government have decided to adopt as a minimum programme, leaving it open for any additions to be made, should circumstances render such action desirable. </para>
                    <para>It will be seen that these building proposals, covering the next five years, while continuing the steady development of the Australian Fleet, will also give effect to the policy of continuous work previously set out as being desirable regarding Cockatoo Island; but both a3 regards carrying out the building programme and providing for Cockatoo, it is clearly necessary to place orders a considerable time ahead. </para>

It is undoubtedly serious, and that seriousness arises from two things - an insufficiency of labour, in spite of all that has been said to the contrary by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> - an insufficiency which is practically admitted by the secretary of one of the largest unions there. It has never been disputed that there has been a shortage of labour there of late. </para>

                        <para>- First, I am told, &#34; You could not get them outside j&#34; and then, &#34;You would not let them in.&#34; Which am I to listen to ? The position is that there is a shortage of labour there, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Salter</inline> has made two recommendations, one that we should try to make up the shortage by obtaining men who are not now recognised as fully qualified boilermakers to do some work requiring less skill, and the other to introduce a system of piece-work. I believe both proposals, particularly the latter, will be extremely distasteful to the men employed at Cockatoo Island. Am I to approve of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Salter&#39;s</inline> report, and so signify my desire that he should immediately try to introduce the piece-work system ? I know perfectly well what would happen if I did. When I see the papers outside clamouring for instant and drastic action, I ask myself whether they ever consider the responsibility which rests on me in trying to bring about the necessary changes there by such means as will avoid any dislocation of the work now going on. I am not free to devote all my time to this matter, but I have placed myself in direct communication with the union there in order that I may put before them the point of view of the manager, hear what they have to say, see how far it may be possible to put Cockatoo Island upon an improved basis, and ascertain if it can be done with the entire co-operation and cordial support of the men themselves. </para>

I am not to be influenced by the extravagant declarations of journals ordinarily friendly to my party, or to be perturbed by the gibes of my honorable friend opposite. I shall go ahead in the course I have marked out for myself, to get face to face with the men, and see whether we cannot devise some system which they will agree to accept, and which will remove many of the difficulties under which the Cockatoo Island Dockyard labours to-day. The matter concerns them as workmen there as much as it does myself as representing the Department. </para>

The only reason it is going down is that it is nearer your camp where the workmen are, and therefore it is handier to get through with it.&#34; Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has deliberately stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Maurice</inline> has advised us that he prefers Jervoise Bay, and that we are suppressing the truth.

                        <para>- What Admiral Henderson asked for was never attempted until this Government came into office - that was, a thorough exploration of Cockburn Sound. It suits <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> for political reasons, to enable him to get a move on on the eve of the elections, to regard what was done during his term of office as a full and thorough examination of that place. This Government decided to call in <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Maurice</inline> Fitzmaurice, not being satisfied with the professional advice available in the Department, where works of this kind, involving large sums of money, were concerned - I suppose in Cockburn Sound alone &#163;2,000,000 was involved - and knowing how easily and frequently money is lost in modern works because of faulty engineering. Having done so, the only thing to do was to follow his advice. He comes along and says, &#34; The information you have is good enough as far as it goes, but before I, an eminent engineer, with a particular knowledge of this class of work, can decide anything, I want further information.&#34; He directed that that information should be obtained. It has been obtained, and sent on to him from time to time. Until he forwards us the definite plans which it is part of his contract to supply, indicating whether the work is to be proceeded with, it is not possible to make any considerable headway there. The only thing that can be done is to do some preliminary work, quite small as compared with the major undertaking, which can be pushed ahead. I do not know what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> wanted the Senate to believe when he made this serious allegation : that he assumed that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Maurice</inline> Fitzmaurice had told the Government, &#34; If you want to play with your money, go on sinking a shaft.&#34; What about his reference to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Maurice</inline> Fitzmaurice, when he first came here, as an under-strapper in the engineering world ? The gentleman upon whom he was relying was <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Maurice</inline> Fitzmaurice, and he does no good to his own political reputation or standing when he refers to a man at the head of his profession as an understrapper. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Maurice</inline> Fitzmaurice is pne of the three gentlemen selected by the Admiralty to act as advisers with regard to works of that kind. </para>

There was no comparison about it in the newspaper statement. </para>

                        <para>- Some time ago, the honorable senator asked me for copies of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Maurice</inline> Fitzmaurice&#39;s report, and I sent them to him. Then, in a statement he made in an interview with a representative of the press, he charged me with having furnished him with only a portion of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Maurice</inline> Fitzmaurice&#39;s report. I complain of the statement, because when he sent me a letter I rang him up and told him that I was sending him the report. Then he rushed into print and accused me of having furnished only a partial report, or portion of the report, after I had given him an assurance that I was sending him the lot. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> did not correct his statement next day, and did not even say that he was mistaken. But he slipped away, leaving the matter at that stage. I know what party fighting is, but surely there is such a thing as acting in a decent and manly way in matters of this kind ! I now give <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> an opportunity of repeating his statement that the report&#39; I sent him was only a partial one, and that I was suppressing something. </para>

If I have spoken warmly, I make no apology for it, because I feel that, in this matter, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has sought, by partial statements, and by ignoring the simple and obvious facts of the case, to launch a mere political accusation against me in the conduct of the Defence Department. I have no particular reason to take any exception to that from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> but I do ask honorable senators to recollect that in connexion with all the matters to which he has referred they will find in the speech I have made to-day what I submit is a sufficient answer to his very wild statements. I do not want anybody to think, because I have spoken as I have done with regard to Cockburn Sound and with regard to Cockatoo Island, that I am not as conscious as anybody could be of the great extent of the work yet to be performed. </para>

                        <para>- There is a very different proposition at  Hanns&#39;  Inlet to that confronting us at Cockburn Sound. If a mistake were made in selecting Hanna&#39; Inlet, it would only have meant the dredging of a channel for a few more yards than would otherwise have been necessary. No one ever challenged the selection of that site. But it was thought that as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Maurice</inline> Fitzmaurice was coming out to give advice on works of magnitude like Cockburn Sound, it would be a mistake not to obtain his advice also upon the projected works at Westernport and upon Cockatoo Island. What <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Maurice</inline> did make clear to me, and what I could not get cleared up in any other way, was that the proposals at Westernport were largely in excess of the requirements as laid down by Admiral Henderson. </para>

                        <para>- I am going to make an admission for the benefit of my honorable friends opposite should they succeed to Ministerial office. It is that if they wish to be popular in a Department they must agree with everything that the officials put before them. If they do that, the officials will go round and sing their praises in such a way as possibly to lead them to believe that they are bigger men than they really are. Any man who goes down to one of the Departments, especially the Defence Department, and believes it to be his duty to look into matters, and give a decision upon them as they appeal to him, is not going to be as popular as a man who will sign anything that is put before him. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend brings up matters here, and I am putting the naked truth about them before the Senate. Coming back to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell&#39;s</inline> question, and the position at Westernport, let me say that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Maurice</inline> Fitzmaurice gave us a general indication of what it was necessary to do to carry out Admiral Henderson&#39;s proposals. The plans for the detail of the works have been completed, and authority to proceed with them has been given. The most serious question there is that of dredging. We could have finished a great deal of the work at Westernport during the last twelve months. I can tell the Senate of some of the work that would have been proceeded with if I had not taken charge of the Department. The proposition was made to me a good while ago to approve of the construction of a wharf. Before I had been in the Department very long, an order was submitted to me for the purchase of a lot of machinery for the construction of the wharf. I marked it &#34;Deferred,&#34; It came up again the other day, and I was reminded that it had been put before me about twelve months ago. I thought then that it was time to say why I had deferred it. I do not claim to be an engineer, but I could see at once that there was no need to proceed with the construction of that wharf twelve months ago, seeing that it was quite impossible to get any ship to tie up to the wharf until the channel was dredged. There have been some delays in the completion of the dredges, and in arranging for the dredges <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> apparently did not think of the necessity of a tug to pull them out. </para>

                        <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> will make me an offer of a tug now I shall gladly submit it to the Board. We are up against the difficulty now of getting a tug built. The difficulty of getting a tug built to-day is very considerable. That is one of the things that will make for a little further delay. I hope to overcome the difficulty by hiring or obtaining from some other source a tug that will enable us to start dredging as soon as the dredges are available, which I think will be within sixweeks&#39; time. I do not mean to say that dredging will proceed then, because the necessary hopper barges will still require to be provided. But I anticipate that it will not be very long now before a&#39; start can be made with the most serious undertaking at Westernport - the dredging of the channel. </para>

                        <para>- As for throwing men out of employment, a few of them did, perhaps, lose a little. The blow of closing down the works, if it was a blow, was eased to them by the fact that they knocked off on Thursday, and on Friday were paid for the balance of the week. On the Monday very few of the men were out of work; on the Tuesday still fewer; and by Wednesday, with the exception of a few engaged in the shops, they had all been absorbed again. The alternative to that was, as I said before, risking their lives; and I was not prepared to take that risk. Perhaps I ought to apologize for taking up so much of the time of the Senate, but the matters with which I have dealt are not unimportant, and honorable senators will admit, in view of the &#39;emphatic charges and statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> that I was entitled to the indulgence of the Senate whilst I replied to them. </para>

                    <para>. - I must congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and the Minister of Defence on the very spirited way in which they dealt with the question of defence. The Senate is, I think, to be congratulated that Defence is not a party question. One wonders what might have happened here to-day had it been a party question. I recognise that, with regard to many matters, these two honorable senators possess a deeper and wider knowledge than belongs to ordinary members of the Senate; but if one may judge by the temper displayed by the Minister before resuming his seat he got the worst of the argument, otherwise he would not have tried to use the language which he sought to apply in an underhand way to&#62; the ex-Minister of Defence. It is perfectly satisfactory to know that Defence is not a party matter. But, why, may I ask, have three hours been occupied in discussing in minute detail one or two matters which could have been dealt with easily by the last two speakers? I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> deserves every credit for the way in which he has put his case. The Minister, to the extent he has gone in trying to complicate the question-- </para>

                        <para>- When the defence consists in not only answering, but levelling direct charges and using language which should not be &#39;used here or elsewhere, the defender exceeds the reasonable limit of what should be the defence of a Minister. If the honorable senator expects his Estimates to pass without reasonable criticism from the Senate, without the critics being subject to the kind of defence to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Oakes</inline> referred, it is not in accordance with the method which I have always seen adopted in dealing with Estimates. However, that is a matter between the Minister and the ex-Minister. As we have an opportunity of dealing with grievances on a Supply Bill, I desire, in the closing hours of the Senate, to again refer to the question of the Teesdale Smith contract. I was perfectly satisfied when the Select Committee was appointed to deal with the facts which they would bring out. Some of the gentlemen representing the Government have taken exception to me being on the Committee, as the references made by me to the matter here pointed me out as a partisan. In my long experience I have rarely known a Select Committee to be appointed except at the instance of a partisan. The custom has been for an honorable member who  believed that some wrong had been done to bring the matter forward, and to make out the strongest case he could, and when a Select Committee was appointed to come forward and get out the evidence in the best possible way. But, after all, the chief purpose was to have a good Committee appointed, who would come to a decision on the evidence adduced. I do not propose to refer to the proceedings of our Select Committee, because the statement has been made in the other House that the inquiry has come to a standstill. </para>

                        <para>- I will state my reason for accepting a position on the Select Committee. My long parliamentary experience had led me to think that a Select Committee always included the men who had brought the subject-matter of the inquiry before Parliament, and that the reason for having them on the Committee was that the whole evidence could be brought out on each side. Leaving myself out of the question, I believe that a very fair Select Committee was appointed by the Senate. It included three senators from each side whose partisanship could not be questioned. I propose to deal now with what has happened with regard to the contract. I intend to deal briefly with the evidence supplied by persons interested in letting the contract, and that is the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs and the parties to the correspondence laid on the table. First I want to refer to a statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Poynton,</inline> who, speaking in another place, said - </para>

                        A member of Parliament does not like to take undue advantage of his privileges; but there are circumstances in this, and other contracts, that have a very ugly look, and every one of them can be traced to one man.

                        <para>- I withdraw it, but I referred to the actions of the Minister, saying that they were not the actions of an honest man ; I did not say that the Minister was not an honest man. Let me explain to what I referred. When the papers in this case were asked for in the other House, the Minister laid on the table certain documents as being all the papers connected with the contract, but they were only those papers that it suited the honorable gentleman to make public. When a &#39; Select Committee was appointed by the Senate, on which the Government side is well represented, three of the seven Liberal supporters in the Senate being members of it, the Minister prevented his chief clerk from producing the papers, and, acting on advice given by the Prime Minister, declined to appear before the Committee himself. Were those the actions of an open and straightforward man? But I do not wish to be abusive; the papers speak for themselves. What was the Minister&#39;s first reply when charged by the Leader of the Opposition with having let a contract without public competition ? It was that time was the essence of the contract; that there was urgency in the matter. The exEngineerinChief, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane,</inline> said, however, that he &#34; suggested some time ago to some men of experience that they should go to </para>

                <para class="block">Port Augusta, and inspect the work with a view to submitting a price.&#34; Therefore, time was not the essence of the contract. Picked Government favorites were told that this plum was waiting to be gathered, and they  went to   Port Augusta to make an inspection. There was no advertisement in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> or <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> or <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> or <inline font-style="italic">Telegraph,</inline> nor in any Adelaide paper, asking the general public to make an inspection, and to offer a price. The invitation to inspect was confined to a few picked favorites of the Government. Later, a contract was entered into between the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith. The Minister says that he has not signed a contract. I asked question after question on the subject, and the Minister representing the Minister of Home Affairs in the Senate maintained that the Assistant Minister had not signed the contract. But some of the correspondence reads as if a contract had been signed, or, at least, a rubber stamp impressed on a contract. To what does the Honorary Minister refer in the following letter, written by him to the Crown Solicitor ? - </para>

                    <para>Captain Saunders, Supervising Engineer, Port Augusta, saw me this afternoon with reference to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith&#39;s contract. He had seen the recommendation of the Engineer-in-Chief With regard thereto dated the 5th February, 1914, before he saw rae in company with the Engineer-in-Chief and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith. He took the recommendation as applying to the section from 92 to 106 miles. He remembers that the recommendation in question was handed to the Minister shortly after he and others arrived, and that after reading it the Minister asked the Engineer-in-Chief whether he had satisfied himself as to the rates asked for being if anything slightly less than the rates paid by the Government of South Australia to Mr.&#39; Teesdale Smith for similar work, and that on receipt of the Engineer-in-Chieft&#39;s  assurance of this fact, I stamped my approval on the papers. </para>

Moreover, having examined the papers laid on the table, I can find no stamped document among them.

Is the Honorary Minister above Parliament ? </para>

Does anything justify a Minister, when the promise has been made that the papers in connexion with a contract will be laid on the table, in laying on the table a few originals, and a great many copies and keeping back papers that should not be kept back? There is no justification for such a thing, and yet members of the Government would try to bind me down because I am on a Committee which the honorable senator knows will never have an opportunity of reporting. Time is the essence of the contract in this case, and I am taking care to use my time to let the public know what is happening. </para>

                        <para>- I would be very pleased to hear the honorable senator. To some people this contract may appear a small matter, and they may say that there is not sufficient in it to warrant all this fuss being made. What can be more reprehensible than a Government in office letting to one of their own picked favorites a big contract without the safeguard of public tender? Could a worse principle be adopted by those who are responsible to the people for the administration of the Public Departments? Let us consider for a moment the extent of the contract.

I have it on the authority of an experienced contractor that whenever a contract is entered into for loosening earth in this manner the soil is put into the embankments at no additional cost, unless the embankments are of great length. In this contract there are over 100,000 yards of cuttings, and over 134,000 yards of embankments. Worse than the business genius at the head of the Department to which an honorable senator refers is the genius of the whole of the party in trying to smother this business up. This is the policy that keeps the party funds sufficiently financial to return the Government members to Parliament. </para>

                    <para>- Every effort has been made by the Government to cover up the magnitude of the real presents that were made to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith. As one excuse, they have said that there was a difficulty in regard to water supply. As a matter of fact, from Bellamy&#39;s Well to the beginning of the track there is a line of pipes; the water trickles out into the tanks, and is loaded on to the camels&#39; backs. A water supply is ready to hand. There is a distance of 287 chains of surface formation, for which the contractor gets 45s. per chain ; that is a distance of a little more than 3&#189; miles. If the contractor gets, as he does get - I had the figures a little time ago - less than &#163;700 for that distance, it means that the other 10 miles runs out at about &#163;4,000 per mile. In attempting to blind the public to the real facts, the Government have dared to make a comparison between the finished railway to Yass-Canberra and the Teesdale Smith contract. No such comparison can be made. I have seen both lines, and I know that on the finished line from Queanbeyan to Canberra there is an overhead bridge, with steel girders, spanning a stream over 70 feet wide, whilst the Teesdale Smith contract is not for the making of a railway, but only for the loose earthworks. The culverts, even the small Monier pipe culverts, have to be put in by the Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith had merely to remove the loose earth in the cuttings, and run it out on the embankment, and yet the Government are comparing the price of the finished line at Yass-Canberra with the work done by Teesdale Smith, and are saying that it is a fair comparison. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">The Queanbeyan-Canberra line passes through a number of hills with small, hard, blue granite-like cuttings, infinitely harder than any along the Teesdale Smith length of line. There is no work in the latter worth more than1s. or1s. 6d. per yard, yet the Government are paying 4s. 6d. per cutting and 2s. 6d. for embankments. Everybody knows that a yard from a cutting will make more than a yard on the embankment, and the result is that Teesdale Smith is getting nearly 8s. per yard for that earthwork. These are facts that ought to be kept before the public. Some people think that I should keep my mouth shut, because I am on the Committee; but, so far as any effective report is concerned, that Committee&#39;s investigation has been deliberately blocked by the Honorary Minister, who whines about his character having been impugned. </para>

The people pay the bill and find the money, and the Government have shown by their Estimates that they have not been making ends meet by about &#163;100,000 a month since they have been in office. They are able to make a surplus to show the public, only by taking more than one and a half millions of the surplus given to them by the late Government when they left office.

                <para class="block">What can be thought of a Minister who writes a public document of that kind, when in the same papers it is shown that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly, Mr. Hobler,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chas.</inline> Timms, on behalf of his brother, discussed this matter on the 28th February. It is not only an attempt to deceive the people outside, but so far has it gone that it seems an attempt on the part of the Minister to deceive himself. He deliberately sits down, and writes  a  make-believe letter to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> as if altogether ignorant of the fact that the matter had been discussed by himself and the others in his own office, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hobler</inline> had been sent by him to fetch and produce papers in connexion with it. There is no doubt that at the time he wrote that letter <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly</inline> was aware that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Timms&#39;</inline> offer had been turned down. Of course, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly</inline> may endeavour to put the whole blame on an officer who has retired, but I should like to see a system of parliamentary government in which the responsibility is taken by the Minister in charge. Nothing could be more despicable than that a Minister who is responsible, and can be punished by Parliament, should hide behind an officer who has left the Department. I spoke before of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane&#39;s</inline> excuse of lack of memory, and that excuse may be perfectly genuine, for many a busy man may forget an important matter; but in the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly,</inline> his memory failed him to such an extent that, when he was  questioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Poynton</inline> in the House, he pretended to have no knowledge of what had occurred. The facts cannot be repeated too often, but I am deterred from saying more by the anxiety of the Government to conclude the business, and by the fact that there are other important matters that have to be considered apart from the Government. On 5th May, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly</inline> wrote as follows to the Engineer-in-Chief: - </para>

                <para class="block">I have been over this line; and I ask why the Minister picked on 69 <inline font-style="italic">\</inline> miles? I suppose that most honorable senators, like the public, are innocent of the conditions there, and wonder why this was done; but the reason is plain, for 70 miles onward is the hardest and most difficult cutting on the railway up to date. </para>

                        <para>- The work from Port Augusta up to 76 miles had already been done during the latter part of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Saunders&#39;</inline> management under Government control, and the rails were running to that point. The Minister knew that from 70 miles was the hardest cutting, and if he got the cost of that included he would again be able to make a comparison as to the cost under ordinary management. We have the evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hobler</inline> that the cost was 2&#163; per cent, more than under day labour; and the excuse is made that the work was urgent. It was so urgent that no Minister can now say whether or not the contract is finished. I could speak at great length on this matter, but, as I said before, I have no desire to do so. Honorable senators have tried to twit me with the suggestion that, being a member of the Select Committee, it is not altogether according to parliamentary etiquette for me to make any remarks before- the Committee have finally reported. The Committee, however, have made one report; and I have deliberately refrained from commenting on anything that has come to my knowledge as a member of the Committee, confining myself to information laid on the table of the House, to what has taken place in the other Chamber, and to what is within my personal knowledge.. The very fact that a contract has been let without calling for public tenders constitutes a grave danger to the administration of the Department, if it be allowed to pass without check or challenge. The Minister complains that we are imputing corruption to him, and holds out his hands to show that they are clean. Why does he not take the opportunity that a fairly-constituted Committee gives him, to let the public know that his administration is above suspicion, and will stand investigation? If the Minister declines to avail himself of that opportunity, I decline to keep my mouth closed, but arraign him at the bar of public opinion for letting a contract under a system of pure favoritism - for giving to one favoured man an opportunity that was refused to all the other contractors in the Commonwealth. So far as plant is concerned, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Timms</inline> undeniably had a larger and better plant for quickly completing the work. If any honorable member follows the correspondence as closely as I have, he will see that behind this small contract was a big one, which has been stopped by the discussion of this question in Parliament, in the press, and oh the platform. For this the public are the richer, and even the colleagues of this Minister are the better. These secret contracts will not bear the searchlight of public opinion, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly</inline> has had the opportunity presented of testifying whether he has been straightforward in his administration. I accuse <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly</inline> of three or four acts of deliberate trickery to the House of Representatives and the Senate. He refused, in the first place, to admit that he knew of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Timms&#39;</inline> . offer,, leading the House to believe he knew nothing; secondly, he had papers laid on the table purporting to be the complete papers, which they were not; thirdly, he refused to allow the representative of his Department to produce the papers before the. Select Committee, thus delaying the investigation; and now, according to- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Cook, he has been advised not to appear before that Committee. If that is the action of an honest man I am no judge of honest men. So far from being the attitude of a straightforward man, who has nothing to cover up, it is, to my mind, what might be expected from one who has blundered badly, and is trying to get out of the difficulty by the good old way of placing the blame on some one else, hoping that Parliament may prorogue or something turn up to prevent his being called to account. Seeing that the Select Committee of which I have the honour to be a member will not have another opportunity of dealing with this matter, I could not allow this Parliament to close without adding these statements to what I have previously said upon the Teesdale Smith contract. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not feel disposed to allow this motion to pass without saying a few words regarding the view which I take of the inexpediency  of  its introduction here. When this matter was first brought forward, in 1905, I expressed views which I entertain just  as  strongly to-day, and which I have  no  more hesitation in expressing now than I had then. The view which I voiced on that occasion was that this Commonwealth Parliament was not only not justified in interfering with the internal affairs of other portions of the Empire, but that the Senate would be the first to resent similar action if it were taken by the Imperial Parliament or by any other Parliament in the British Dominions. In support of that view, I should like  to  make a quotation from a recent public utterance by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher.</inline> Not long ago, some matters connected with the internal government of the South African Federa-tion occupied public attention here,  as  elsewhere, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> amongst other public men, was either invited to give  an  opinion, or did give an opinion, upon them. </para>

                <para class="block">That was a very sound position for him to take up. But it is equally sound, if, instead of assuming the position of one of the autonomous Dominions being dictated to by the Mother Country, we reverse it, and picture the position which exists here to-night  -  that of one of the Parliament* of an autonomous Dominion attempting to obtrude its views, and by that means seeking to influence the current of public affairs in the Old Country. </para>

                        <para>- Whether it is in support of, or in opposition to, the Imperial Government, is immaterial. If it be proper that the Parliament of one of the self-governing Dominions should seek ibo support the Imperial Government, it must be equally competent for it to criticise and denounce that Government. In my opinion, it is extremely inadvisable that we should attempt to take part in matters which belong exclusively to another portion of the Empire. </para>

No greater proof of that can be looked for or desired than that memorable and historical speech made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balfour</inline> in the House of Commons, when he admitted the failure of his life&#39;s work as an opponent of Home Rule, when he declared that the time had arrived when some form of self-government should be conceded to Ireland, and pleaded for an effort to be made to arrive at an arrangement which would render that form of government acceptable to all parties in Ireland . </para>

I cannot shut my eyes to the fact that Ireland is armed from north to south, and arrayed in two hostile camps, and that it is recognised by the Imperial authorities at Home that the slightest false step may precipitate a civil war. </para>

                        <para>- There are only two points I wish to put. No matter how strongly honorable senators may hold views on one side or another, I cannot see how they can shut their eyes to the fact that the position at Home is extremely critical, and fraught with the utmost danger. In these circumstances, it seems to me extremely undesirable that a Parliament not immediately concerned with the outcome of this struggle should attempt, by such a motion as this, to declare that an action at which the Imperial Government falters should be pushed through, rightly or wrongly. For the two reasons that I have given, first, that it is in my opinion a pernicious practice which is growing up, for Parliaments in outlying Dominions, by resolution, to interfere in matters which are of purely local concern to other portions of the Empire; and second, that at this juncture a motion of this kind will be pernicious rather than helpful, I propose to vote against it. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not propose to give a silent vote on this matter. At the same time I do not propose to take up much of the time of the Senate. I have no wish to probe into the motives that have actuated the mover and his friends in bringing forward this matter - honorable senators are within their rights - and I have not a word to say against Irishmen who desire to see Home Rule for Ireland, but I feel that the submission of this motion is an unwise step, and, as my leader has stated, one that would be resented perhaps more bitterly by those who are supporting the motion to-night than by any other section of the community if interference with our affairs came from the Old Land, or any other part of the British Dominions. It is also an unwise step because it will not help affairs at Home, as the honorable senator thinks it will, because it will only tend to make the situation more embarrassing than it is at present. It is a question upon which the people of this country are very much divided. I admit that a very large portion of our people are strongly in favour of Home Rule for Ireland, but at the same time there is probably an equally large portion against it. Further, I say, this is not our business. The question was not put to the country when we were before the electors. We were not asked whether we favoured Home Rule for Ireland or not, and I do not think we are called upon here to give judgment in regard to this matter; </para>

                        <para>- From the  public  press. The honorable senator knows that it is perfectly true. If the motion is intended to lead to some solution of the difficulties in the Old Country, it will utterly fail, but it is probably intended to put some honorable senators, who are very shortly to go to the country, in a hole, and work to their detriment. But I can assure honorable senators that they are dealing with a double-edged sword that will turn against themselves later on. It is throwing into Australian politics, where there are already quite enough difficult problems, and where there is quite enough strife, another bone that will cause contention. In conclusion, I have only to say that, if this motion is intended to be merely the expression of a pious hope, it will do no good, and that if anything more is intended it will be utterly useless. I therefore join with my leader in what he has said, and do not intend to support the motion. </para>

                    <para>. - Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl,</inline> I do not intend to give a silent vote on this motion. I regret exceedingly that the Minister of Defence, and his colleague, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, have felt themselves called upon to oppose it. It is all very well for the Minister of Defence to say that he has read <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher&#39;s</inline> statements in regard to the South African Government. South Africa, like Australia, is one of the Dominions of the Empire, whereas this motion relates, not to a Dominion, but to the very heart of the Empire itself, in which every Britisher, whether he lives in South Africa, Canada, or Australia, is interested. If we do not have peace, order, and good government at the heart of the Empire, how can we expect that Empire to sustain and maintain its position before the rest of the world? This motion begins - </para>

Is not the London <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> recognised as one of the most important newspapers in the world, and, in view of the opinion which it has expressed, are we to remain silent, as the Minister of Defence has asked us to do? I hold that we are in duty bound to give expression to our opinion on this question. </para>

                            would have us be silent, but we are not going to be dumb. Although I sit on this side of the House, I was sorry to hear any one representing the Government of Australia at the present time speaking as the Minister of Defence did to-night.

                        <para>- It was. I invite the Minister of Defence and his colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl,</inline> to examine the map of the world and to note the many parts coloured red as an indication that they belong to the British Empire. He will observe that Australia and Canada loom large territorially, and that England, Scotland, and Ireland are but small territorially. Yet this little trouble - because, after all, it is a little one - that is occurring at the heart of the Empire is probably going to disturb the equilibrium of the whole of the British Empire. Let me remind honorable senators that, before next month, the King himself will experience the same difficulty with which the Governor-General of Australia has recently been faced. He will have to act. </para>

                    <para>. - I, too, do not propose to allow this motion to pass without giving expression to my views upon it. I have but recently returned from the heart of the Empire to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has referred, and can say that there are there many hundreds of thousands of people who, I have no doubt, would wish to be able to describe this trouble, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has done, as but a little one. It is by no means a little trouble. It is one the immensity of which very few of us out here can recognise. The moment one is brought into somewhat immediate contact with the strong feelings expressed by people of all classes and denominations in England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, with regard to this impending difficulty, one realizes how grave it is. It is because I have just come from the Old Country that I feel that I cannot cast a silent vote to-night. Looking at the motion, I am constrained to ask whether every honorable senator who proposes to vote upon it has read it. The very terms of the motion are sufficient to make one hesitate before supporting it when one knows the real facts. The aspiration expressed by the motion is that something should be done by Parliament to assist in cementing the Empire into one harmonious whole. It goes on to say that the Senate is invited to express the opinion that Home Rule, if granted to Ireland, will bring about this desirable result. I say deliberately, with the full knowledge of what I am saying, that in the mind of no man in Great Britain to-day, strong Home Ruler or anti-Home Ruler, is there any hope at all, much less a confident hope - and I embrace all classes in that statement - that if the Home Rule Bill as now introduced is brought into effect without any amendment there will be anything like harmony in the British Empire. That is the confirmed opinion of all men who think. </para>

                        <para>- We all know that there is trouble, but, between having some impending trouble, which we all hope may still be allayed, and precipitating a crisis, the end of which no man can conceive, there is an enormous difference. I say advisedly that I know the Home Rule Bill will bring no peace or harmony to Ireland. Those who are avowedly and openly pledged to the Bil&#93; may wish it, and I can quite understand their wishing it; but I say deliberately that, keen as they are for it, they are, with others who are in politics, and on this particular question, opposed to them, in a state of indescribable anxiety and dismay at the immediate future of Ireland and Great Britain because of it. </para>

By this resolution we who are accustomed to legislate, and who know what an immense difference there may be between two Bills with the same title, are asked to use a bald, loose phrase that not one of us in our capacity as senators would put up with for a moment. We say &#34;Home Rule!&#34; I ask What measure of Home Rule? What kind of Home Rule Bill ? I am not dealing with the one now being submitted for amendment; but, even taking that, does any one of us know its full contents? </para>

I am not speaking pro or con on this matter, although, of course, I am going to vote on the motion ; but every one of us must admit that there may be an immensity of difference between Home Rule measures. We might have some sort of Home Rule Bill which would bring- Ireland into what all of us want to see it - one harmonious whole; but surely honorable senators will readily admit that a Bill proposing to give Home Rule may bo introduced which will bring about the disastrous opposite. That is what I fear the present Home Rule Bill will do. I indorse what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> said. I say, with all respect to the Senate, that I do not believe that our resolution will have any effect, and that I do not think it ought to. I am in accord with what. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> said on that point. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> when addressing the Senate, enumerated all the public works which the Government have on their programme. But his effort is only a piece of window-dressing in preparation for the general elections.. To listen to the&#39; honorable senator, one would never have thought that he is a member of a Government who, although they have been twelve months and more in office, have not only failed to submit a programme of public works of their own, but have stopped almost every public work started by their predecessors. I am safe in saying that no previous Government of the Commonwealth were responsible to a greater extent for the suspension of important public works. I can safely say, also, that no Government in Australia has ever in the same time been responsible for creating so many &#34;unemployed in the Australian labour market. We have only to consider the state of affairs in Western Australia to recognise the truth of my -statement. The present Fusion Government were responsible for the cancellation of the sleeper contract entered into between the Government of Western Australia and the last Federal Government. &#34;That contract was proposed by the State Government of Western Australia with the object of developing a province of that State which has remained in its original condition since the white race came to Australia. No province on this continent has been more neglected than that particular part of Australia, though it possesses perhaps the most admirable climate in the Commonwealth- </para>

                        <para>- And, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> says, some of the richest land. It is a well-known fact that the gigantic karri  timber will grow only upon soil of a very superior kind. In order to open up that province at a time when the unemployed difficulty had reached a rather acute stage in Western Australia, the State Government undertook, as a means of finding remunerative work for the unemployed, the erection of timber mills in that part of the country. It was hoped that, while producing an extremely valuable article in the shape of sleepers for the transcontinental railway, the operations of those mills would be the means of opening up one of the richest districts in Australia, and of making way for settlement. By cancelling the sleeper contract the present Government are  responsible  for upsetting the good intentions of the State Government, who spent &#163;200,000 to build railways and instal machinery for this industry. They are responsible, also, for hanging up the construction of the western section of the transcontinental railway and for delaying the completion of that line. We have only to listen to speeches such as that delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to recognise their utter hollowness, and that they are merely political trimming before an election. What has been the attitude of the Government so far as the Naval Base at Cockburn Sound is concerned ? Our political opponents in Western Australia clamoured for the starting of the work there. The late member for Fremantle, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hedges,</inline> more than once accused the late Minister of Defence of .going out of his way to delay the starting of works at Cockburn Sound, with the object of keeping men out of the electorate at election time. We are now told by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> as Minister of Defence, began that work before he should have done so, and began it for electioneering purposes. Who are we to believe, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hedges</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> ? But whether the work was begun too soon or too late, the present Government have been responsible for its suspension from the time they took office up to the present time. Again, we can consider the position at Cockatoo Island - a place which was a perfect hive of industry for as long as I can remember it. What is the position of affairs since the present Government took office? The place is now as silent as if a hammer never rang on a boiler there. The new General Post Office in Perth is another of the public works provided for by the Labour Government, but blocked by the Fusion Government. The history of this Fusion Government has been the suspension of public works wherever it has been possible to suspend them. In the face of these facts, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> lias had the audacity to outline what will be, if it ever materializes, the greatest public works policy that Australia has ever seen. Surely the honorable senator does not expect us to take him seriously ? Surely he does not think that the electors will swallow such ridiculous promises made just before an election ? I should like now to refer to a matter which has been more in the public mind of late than any other. I refer to  the constitutional questions which have been discussed in this chamber during the last few weeks. The Fusion Government have failed entirely to introduce any useful legislation. Whilst they are leaving no record in that direction, they are undoubtedly &#34;making history, so far as upsetting the Constitution is concerned, in a manner which no previous Government ever attempted. During the last twelve months we have- had several violations of the Constitution by the present Government. It was not that they was any occasion for bringing about that state of affairs; it waa not that the legislation introduced had any need to raise any great constitutional issues. It was a deliberate attempt on the part of the Government to get out of a difficulty in which they have been from the beginning of their existence, and that is the difficulty of being in office without a majority in each House. For the purpose of reducing the numbers against them in this Chamber, the Government have gone out of their way to raise the most important constitutional crisis which has ever been raised in the history of the Commonwealth. Party reasons, and only party reasons, are at the bottom of the position in which we find ourselves to-day. The Government are prepared to destroy the all-powerful position which the Senate has occupied since the beginning of Federation. They are ready to rob the Senate for all time of its rights under the Constitution for the sake of gaining a mere party advantage for the time being. The Constitution gives to the Senate, and rightly gives to it, enormous powers. It is not created in the ordinary way in which an Upper House is elected. The Upper House of a State in Australia, or the Upper House in the Old Country, is brought into existence by some privileged means of election, by some means other than by the adult voters in the community. According to my reading of history, the Senate is the one Upper House in the whole world which is elected on an adult franchise, and, as the result of that broad franchise, it is at the same time the most democratic Upper House in the world. Australia is the only country in which, as far as I Enow, the Democratic or the Labour side has been able to capture the Upper House. Therein lies the reason for the present antagonism to the Senate by the reactionary party. It is not because there is any need, or any weakness in our Constitution, that the present crisis has been brought about. The one object in view is to destroy the only Upper House of a democratic nature in Australia. I am sorry to say that honorable gentlemen who have been members of the Senate from the start, and may now fairly be called its enemies, have lent themselves, for mere party purposes, to destroy its powers. When we re- member how the Democrats in the Federal Convention struggled to place the Senate on such a broad and democratic basis as to secure to it co-equal rights with the House of Representatives, with the one exception of introducing money Bills} when we recollect that the Democrats in the Convention, of the type of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston, Mr. Isaacs, Mr. Higgins,</inline> and, may I include in the gallant band, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid,</inline> fought to secure for the Senate a more broad and democratic Constitution than was enjoyed by any Upper House then in existence, we must be surprised to find men who claim to be entitled to use the glorious name of Liberal entering into a conspiracy to rob the Australian Upper House o.f its democratic character. I have only to refer to the debates in the Convention to prove what I have said. When the Constitution was first suggested, it was not intended that the Senate should be a democratic House. It was expected to be similar to the Upper Houses of other countries. It was thought that it would eventually become like the Senate of America, which is frequently called &#34; the rich man&#39;s club.&#34; Nearly all the members of the Federal Convention predicted, and expected, that none but men of very great wealth would be able to win a seat in the Senate because of the enormous expense of contesting an election. That seemed to be the prevailing idea, and the Democrats in that body laboured in order to make the Senate as democratic as possible by placing it practically on the same basis as the House of Representatives, inasmuch, as in the case of a proposed law for an alteration of the Constitution, the Senate would have as much power as the other House, and provided that the proposed law passed through the Senate, it would be referred to the people, so that they might give their judgment. In the light of these facts, we can understand the difference between the meaning of the word &#34; Liberal &#34; in bygone years and. the meaning of the word as it is used in Australia to-day. The power to amend the Constitution is perhaps the greatest power of all to be found in that instrument. According to a well-known constitutional writer and authority, Professor Burgess, if a Parliament has the power to bring its Constitution into harmony with the will of the people, that country can never go very far wrong. Our Constitution was framed in such a way that from time to time, just as the popular wish might desire, it would be possible for the Senate to pass a law to bring the Constitution into line with the will of the people. Therefore, a power to amend the Constitution may be rightly said to be one of the greatest powers it contains.

                <para>This is the most important part of a Constitution, upon its existence and truthfulness, i.e., its correspondence with real and natural conditions depends the question as to whether the State shall develop with peaceful continuity, or shall suffer alterations of stagnation, retrogression, and revolution. A Constitution which may be imperfect and erroneous in its other parts, can easily be supplemented and corrected if only the State be truthfully organized in the Constitution ; but if this be not accomplished, error will accumulate until nothing short of revolution can save the life of the State. </para>
                <para>We all believed that the Constitution gave the Senate the right to pass a proposed law, and have it submitted to the people for approval or rejection ; but we have found, within the last few days, that, notwithstanding the clear and definite statement in section 128, that if either House of the Parliament passes a proposed law it shall go automatically to the people, the present Government has advised the Governor-General that he may not submit six proposed laws passed by this Chamber. That means that the Government of the day can practically force the Governor-General to take an unconstitutional step. I do not think that a democratic people, as the Australians undoubtedly are, will permit a crime of this sort to be committed without the punishment which it is in its power to mete out to those who are guilty. As I am speaking, not to the few honorable senators who are present, but to thousands of electors outside - to the people in the far-off States, who should be made to understand the real effect of what has been done by the Government - I shall read the opinions of some of the framers of the Constitution on this point. It was proposed in the Convention that proposals for the alteration of the Constitution, if passed by a majority in each House, should be submitted to the people ; but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs, who at the time was Attorney-General for Victoria, moved an amendment providing for the submission of a proposed law after it had been passed by either Chamber. So that one House could not defeat the other House if it wanted to amend the Constitution, the proposed law was to go to the voters of the Commonwealth. He said - page 717 of the reports of the Melbourne sittings - </para>

                    <para>All I desire to say in support of the Victorian Assembly&#39;s suggestion is this, that, if either House - I do not care which - brings forward a proposal and the other House does not agree with it, then there shall be an opportunity, if the House originating the proposal desires to refer the proposal to the people, as a people; and the States, as States. This protects the States, and it protects the people. </para>

                    <para>I only ask for some ultimate means of preventing catastrophe.I only ask those honorable members who say &#34; Trust the Federal Parliament &#34; to go further and meet the inevitable by trusting the people who are behind the Federal Parliament. Let us trust the people whose interests are all in all to us, who have to pay the taxes, whose life, whose liberty, and whose property are at stake, and not necessarily stand by the rigid system of electing men for general purposes, and of allowing those men to say finally whether the people shall ever have a voice in the matter or not. I would point out that a question affecting the Constitution is different from all other questions. It may be right - I do not think it is - to say that on ordinary matters of legislation Parliament should have its own way. On matters of Constitution it is surely right to let the people have an opportunity of expressing their opinions one way or the other. </para>

                    Isaacs thought that Parliament should have its way on questions of legislation, but that on constitutional questions, which are much more important, it should be the duty of the people to give an opinion, and that either House should not be allowed to prevent the people from giving an opinion. The Senate has, on two occasions, passed six Bills for proposed alterations of the Constitution, which have already been submitted to the people on two occasions. Under section 128, and in accordance with the views of the framers of the Constitution, these Bills should be again submitted to the people; their submission should not be blocked by the Fusion Government advising the Governor-General not to submit them. This advice robs the Senate of its powers, and prevents the people from expressing an opinion. Not only is the Senate &#34; gagged &#34; for the time being, but the people are also &#34; gagged.&#34; They are not permitted to say &#34; Yes &#34; or &#34; No &#34; to these important proposals.

                        <para>- What is to be gained by that appeal to the people, except the opinion of the public regarding the violation of the Constitution? Parliament will find itself in the same <inline font-style="italic">eni de mc</inline> after the election as it is in now, and has been in since the beginning of Federation. But had these great constitutional questions been submitted to the people, and had Parliament been given the powers for which we ask, it could then do something. As it is, public money is being spent uselessly. This grand double dissolution which the Fusion Government have brought about will give no return for the money spent on the elections. It is really a penal dissolution, punishing the Senate because it would not back down on the well-known principles of a majority of its members, namely, preference or protection to trade unionists. The Government, to destroy that majority, have determined to destroy the powers of the Senate. Truly we are making history. Before passing from this aspect of the question, I would like to give the Senate a few more quotations. </para>

                <para class="block">In giving expression to that opinion <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> was repeating what we know to be a well-established fact. The greatest stigma on the Constitution of the United States is the fact that it cannot be altered to meet the demands of public opinion.. When that Constitution was originally framed, perhaps as a document it expressed some of the finest sentiments and: grandest principles of government of that time, but owing to the decisions of the Supreme Court and to that Conservative element in America which has dominated that Republic for so long, the American Constitution has not kept step with the will of the majority, and it has come to be recognised that it is almost, impossible to effect the slightest amendment of it. It was in order to provide against that state of affairs that the framers of our Constitution gave so much power into the hands of the people of Australia by means of the referendum, and as a first step they made both Houses equal, so that if one House passed a Bill for a proposed amendment the other House could not possibly block it. When the framers of the Constitution were building, they thought they foresaw the possibility of a Conservative or reactionary Senate, and it was in order that the Senate would not block legislation for the amendment of the Constitution that this power was put into the Constitution. But to-day, in spite of the fact that we have a democratic Senate, the very situation which the Constitution framers sought to avoid has been brought about by the political trickery of the present Government, who have forced the Governor-General to take an action which, I am sure, that gentleman in his heart disapproves of. I now propose to quote <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid&#39;s opinion. And remembering that that gentleman was one of the founders, not only of the Constitution, but also of the Fusion, and knowing that he is the Fusion&#39;s great authority on many things, it would be well to let the public- know what he thinks in regard to these matters. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid said - </para>

                        <para>- No doubt <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid took that view, and as this is the States House, it was a very proper view to take. Let us suppose, for instance, that the financial advantage given to Western Australia, whereby for ten years that State received slightly more from the Consolidated Revenue than any other State, were to be wiped out by the House of Representatives, owing to a combination of the representatives of the big States of Victoria and New South Wales; or that similar action were taken in regard to the Murray waters question, which so closely affects the State of South Australia, and that the States House were powerless to protect - the interests of the State affected, then the Senate as a States House would be rendered completely useless. That is the position we find ourselves in to-day. Three or four years ago the Fusion party were howling throughout the Commonwealth about the Labour party trying to bring about unification and robbing the States of their rights. Yet they to-day, at one fell swoop, are robbing the Senate of the right to protect the interests of the States. I hope the people will recognise this fact at the forthcoming elections. If they do, we may look for fewer Liberal representatives in the Senate in future. I should now like to quote the opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, a gentleman who has ever been regarded as one of the foremost Democrats of Australia. We must all admire the manner in which he presides over the Arbitration Court, which, in my opinion, is a tribunal more difficult to conduct than any other in the country. As time goes on, the law will more and more, I think, be called upon to decide . industrial matters, and eventually the greatest Court in the land will be the Court of industrial arbitration. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J</inline> Justice  Higgins performs his onerous duties with eminent success, and in the utterances I am about to quote he recognises that the Senate ought to have the power to which I have been referring. When dealing with the matter, he said that if one House were permitted to block the will of the other, we should have that stagnation which we found in every Conservative Upper House in the world; and that, therefore, there ought to be a reference to the people. During the Federal Convention at Melbourne, he said-&#34; </para>

                </continue>
                <para>But as I understand it now, it is, in. .brief, this :- That supposing the Senate or the House of Representatives should wish to have an amendment of the Constitution, and the other House does not agree to it, then there shall be a referendum to both States and people, as to whether the amendment shall be law or not. </para>

                    ; If that is the proposal, I shall vote for it. I think the Premier of New South Wales is quite right when he says that it is not a Radical matter at all. It is not a question of Liberal politics or Conservative politics, but simply a question of common sense, and it is a device that may be used either by the Senate or by the other House. If the Senate should wish to have an alteration of the Constitution, and possibly it will, I do not see why, assuming that there have been due safeguards taken, it should not have the matter referred to the States and to the people as here proposed.
                </para>
                <para>I think I have quoted sufficient to show that the attitude taken by the Labour party in reference to the memoranda presented to His Excellency the Governor-General a few days ago - the answer to which we heard yesterday - is supported by what took place at the Convention. I am satisfied that the people outside, when they&#39; get the opportunity, will wreak their political vengeance on those who would rob the Senate of its well-established right, and make it practically useless for the purpose of legislation; otherwise, I see but very little prospect for the Senate in the future. We shall simply be asked to say &#34; ditto &#34; to any legislation passed by another place, no matter how ridiculous or unnecessary that legislation may be; and if we refuse, this Chamber may be dissolved at any moment at the whim of the Government of the day. I have no doubt that the people will insist on giving either House the right to bring about any alterations in the Constitution that may, from time to time, be deemed necessary. The people, I hope, will be able to fully appreciate the position. Even our political opponents cannot say that we have shirked responsibility for our actions. We have not attempted, to unduly protract debate, but have, as far as possible, expedited business, in order to have an appeal to the country. Had we chosen, we could have availed ourselves of many means under the Standing Orders, when the Government Preference Prohibition Bill was sent to us, to block public business for months; but we showed our utter contempt for that measure by, to use a phrase that has become somewhat celebrated, &#34; booting it out &#34; at its first appearance. </para>

                        <para>- That Bill has been so trenchantly dealt with that it is unnecessary to refer to it again. If we are not the natural guardians of the Senate, I do not know whom we can expect to stand up for its rights. We made our protest through the proper channel, namely, the Governor-General, whom we thought to be something more than a mere &#34;rubber stamp&#34;; but his reply was simply that he had &#34;consulted his advisers.&#34; If we turn to figures, however, we see that the Gover nor-General&#39;s &#34; advisers &#34; consist of practically one member of the House of Representatives ; so that it would appear that the majority of twenty-two in the Senate counts for nothing, as against that one. And this is what responsible government has come to in the Commonwealth! A tangle of the kind can only be unravelled by the electors of Australia; and I look forward to the present Government being shot out of their position, just as they were four years ago, when, after the secret conference, they thought they had such a strong combination that Labour was &#34; down and out &#34; for years. That the Fusion Government went down in 1910 was a fortunate thing for Australia. </para>

                        <para>- The Labour Government did not go down three years afterwards, but, as a matter of fact, came back with an increased number of supporters in the country. It is true that the numbers were not sufficient to give them power in the House, of Representatives; but the party, so far from &#34;going down,&#34; have increased their numbers at every election from the beginning, as I have no doubt they will increase them at the next elections. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not propose to follow the constitutional arguments, interesting, though they may be, that have been advanced, although there are any number of eminent men who could be quoted on the other side. A great deal of nonsense is being talked about the rights, of the Senate being taken away, and so forth; but, as a matter of fact, the Constitution is working exactly as its founders; anticipated and intended. To establish a Federal form of government the small States had to be brought into the Union, and in order that they might not be overborne by the larger States, equal representation in the Senate was provided. On the other hand, in order to obviate the possibility of the small States dominating the other Chamber, which is the superior branch of the Legislature - holding, as it does, the control of the purse, and being vested with  the power of making and unmaking Ministries - a safety-valve had to be provided, namely, that of the double dissolution. When Parliament becomes unworkable, the provision relating to the double dissolution comes into operation. Nobody can say that this Parliament is workable, and, therefore, effect is being given to the Constitution by sending both branches of it to the electors. For a party which mouths its love and affection for the people to exhibit such reluctance to face the electors as is exhibited by my honorable friends opposite, is very amusing indeed. However, I will not pursue that phase of the subject further. I wish, however, to call attention to one or two remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. He stated that the present Government had stopped works all over the country, and had thus created unemployment. I desire to show how incorrect is his statement. Let me take the case of the construction of the transcontinental railway, with a view to showing whether the Government have created unemployed. The Fisher Government controlled that line  284  days, and employed, on an average,  429  men; whereas the Cook Government controlled it  331  days, and employed, on an average,  851  men, or a little more than double the number. In the matter of platelaying, the Fisher Government laid  18  miles, at the rate of fifteen days per mile. The Oook Government laid  163  miles, at the rate of two days per mile. The Fisher Government surveyed  86  miles, at the rate of three days per mile; whereas the Cook Government surveyed  391  miles, at the rate of  1  mile per day. </para>

                        <para>- They are not. If he doubts their accuracy, the honorable senator may move for a return. In the matter of earthworks, the Fisher Government constructed  49  miles at the rate of five days per mile, whereas the Cook Government constructed  242  miles at the rate of two days per mile. I come now to the question of cost. Under the Fisher Government the cost of construction was from  30  to  50  per cent. higher than it is under the Cook Government. </para>

                        <para>- I repeat that the cost of construction under the Fisher Government was from  30  to  50  per cent. more than it is under the Cook Government. Later on I shall give the official figures in detail, because they are absolutely correct. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> opened his remarks this afternoon by declaring that he intended to take this opportunity of showing up the sins of omission and commission of the Government. In other words, he intended to blacken the Ministry before an appeal is made to the country. Followed as he was by the Minister of Defence, I do not think he made much out of his attempt. Of course, the rank and file of the Opposition followed in a similar strain. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> spoke of the Teesdale Smith contract. During the last two months he has lived upon that contract, and so have other members of the Opposition. It is the only thing they have upon which to go to the country. They will probably find, however, that they are making a mistake. In letting that contract, there was only one object in view. I do not say that it was quite a wise thing to let it without calling for tenders. But the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs has accepted the fullest responsibility for his action. There were two points which had to be connected, and which were  14  miles apart. </para>

The platelaying plant at the eastern end of the transcontinental line was idle. There were forty men depending for employment upon that plant. The object of tha Government was to connect the two ends of the line as quickly as possible, in order that these men might be kept in employment. Accordingly, the work was regarded as one of urgency. It was pressed upon the Minister by the engineers as one of urgency. They assured him that the price quoted for the work by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith was a fair one, and, believing that it was, the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs let the contract. Now I would ask, &#34; Have the public lost anything by reason of this contract?&#34; </para>
