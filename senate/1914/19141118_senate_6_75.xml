          <para>- Last session, when the  question of the national regiments, more particularly the wearing of kilts, was under consideration, I made an interjection which I find has caused considerable pain to Scottish people in Tasmania. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was speaking in opposition to an order by the ex-Minister of Defence authorizing the wearing of kilts, he stated that the Scottish regiments had always acted most gallantly on the field of battle, and led the&#39; way. I, in a very jocular manner, and without any desire to detract from the splendid manner in which the Scottish regiments have always conducted themselves on the field of battle said, &#39; &#39; Away from the field.&#34; Several letters have reached me from Tasmania in which regret has been expressed by Scottish people that I made the interjection. I have now to express extreme regret for having reflected, as my interjection did, on the courage of Scotchmen generally. I had not the slightest desire to detract in any way from the very gallant manner in which we know, and history tells us, Scotchmen have invariably conducted themselves on the field of battle. On the contrary, I have always entertained the highest possible respect for Scottish people in every capacity, and I regret very much that my jocular interjection was taken seriously, and has had the effect of hurting the feelings of many of my good Scotch friends. </para>

            <para>- I desire to ascertain whether the attention of the Leader of the Government has bees called to an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Evening Journal,</inline> published in Adelaide, on the 16th November. I do not propose to read the article, but the writer alleges that Yacca gum is one of the principal ingredients in the manufacture of picric acid, which is being used very largely by Germany to destroy the Allies; and that during the six months ending July last something like 1,200 tons of this commodity were exported from South Australia, the greater portion of it going to Germany. I desire to ask whether the attention of the Leader of the Government here has been called to the. article, whether he knows anything of the facts alleged therein, and if they are true, whether he will endeavour to take steps to prevent the exportation of any more of this very dangerous article at the present time. </para>

            <para>- Seeing that many of the permanent officers connected with the Instructional Staff have gone or are going with the Expeditionary Forces, and that necessity exists to make temporary promotions to fill the vacancies caused by their leaving the country, will the Minister of Defence see that the noncommissioned officers connected with the Instructional Staff are given a fair chance of obtaining temporary promotion? I wish, also to direct the Minister&#39;s attention to&#39; Lord Kitchener&#39;s and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> French&#39;s action in this connexion, as shown in the following extract from a speech by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith</inline> reported in to-day&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Age: -</inline></para>

            <para>- Our General Officer Commanding has the same power  as that referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith,</inline> and no doubt will exercise it, to promote to commissioned rank non-commissioned officers or even privates for service in the field ; but the honorable senator&#39;s request that temporary promotions shall take place, for instructional purposes, not for services in the field, but for those remaining here, is quite a different matter. The question has been under consideration for some time, and I have to-day approved of a number -of senior non-commissioned officers being appointed temporarily to fill commissioned ranks. </para>

          <para>- By leave of the Senate, I desire to make a personal explanation. Last Thursday, when I was speaking upon the Patents, Trade Marks and Designs Bill, I had occasion to refer to the extraordinary heat manifested in the consideration of the measure  by  certain members of the Opposition,  particlarly  by Senators Gould and Millen, and I identified both those gentlemen with the cause of countries outside Australia, particularly in connexion with their action at the time the Tariff was being discussed in this Chamber. In the official  report of my remarks I find that there are two inaccuracies, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is the author.

            <para>- No. So far from the cap fitting, I find that the question of the imposition of a 5 per cent, duty on mining machinery did not arise at all. Therefore, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> sought to identify me with the granting of a preference to Germany on that occasion he was guilty of a very big inaccuracy indeed. The items in which I was particularly interested when the Tariff was under review were high speed reciprocating engines and rock drills. </para>

            <para>- I considered the question of whether a duty should be levied upon those articles purely from the stand-point of what was best in the interests of the mining industry of this country. The second inaccuracy of which I complain was the statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that - </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline>voted for free German machinery. </para>
        <para class="block">I did nothing of the kind. I no more voted in favour of the free admission of German machinery than I did in favour of the free admission of British or American machinery. When, therefore, the Leader of the Opposition attempts to identify me with an effort to favour Germany, the facts fail to support his contention. Still more do the after consequences of my action in this chamber disprove his statements. The items in which I was particularly interested when the Tariff was under review were dynamo electric machines and rock drills. In regard to the first I find from the records for 1913 that the imports from the United Kingdom of dynamos up to 200 h.p. were valued at &#163;168,000, those from the United States at &#163;131,000, and those from Germany at &#163;48,000. The imports from the United Kingdom of dynamos in excess of 200 h.p. were valued at &#163;56,000, those from America at &#163;9,000, and those from Germany at   &#163;3,000. It will be seen, therefore, that, while the importation of all dynamos from the United States and the United Kingdom represented a total value of  &#163;299,000, that from Germany represented only &#163;65,000. In the light of these figures it is quite clear that, although I endeavoured to place certain of these machines on the free list, Germany did not thereby derive very much advantage, inasmuch as she supplied only one-seventh of our importations into Australia during the past twelve months, which is a fair period upon which to build calculations. The next item on which I&#39; felt keenly was that of rock drills, and I voted to place them upon the free list. From the official records for last year I find that the imports under this heading from the United Kingdom were valued at &#163;3,000, those from the United States at &#163;28,000, and those from Germany - the country which I am alleged to have favoured - at &#163;736. In other words, only one forty-second part of the importation of rock drills into the Commonwealth came from the country which, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> I am supposed to favour. In regard to high-speed reciprocating engines, I felt particularly keen, and I do so to-day. But I learn that the total value of the imports under this heading from the United Kingdom last year was &#163;28,000, whereas that from Germany was nil. Thus, if inquiry be made into the after consequences of my efforts in this chamber, it will be seen that, in respect of one of the two items upon which I felt keenly Germany derived no advantage whatever, whilst in respect of the other, her exportation to the Commonwealth represented only one-seventh of our imports. When the Tariff was under review, I felt strongly on two or three of these particular lines, and I feel just as strongly to-day. If similar circumstances arose to-morrow I would repeat the votes which I cast on a former occasion. </para>

            <para>- I will conclude by remarking that the Tariff which was dealt with by this Parliament in 1907-8 included, as an integral part, a 5 per cent, preference to British manufacturers.

          <para>- Seeing that it is becoming a practice for honorable senators to make personal explanations, I desire to say a few words in reply to the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline> It appears that I have done him some slight injustice so far as the naming of a specific duty is concerned. If, in speaking on the spur of the moment, I said that he voted for a particular duty, and my statement is inaccurate, I apologize at once. I do not remember saying whether he voted for a 5 per cent, duty or a7&#189; per cent. duty. The whole purport of my remarks was that, whilsi <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> charged <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> and myself with being proGerman because we had voted for low duties, he himself had voted and fought tenaciously for the lowest possible duty on mining machinery, and his explanation to-day is a practical admission of that fact. </para>

            <para>. - This measure, so far as the larger number of its provisions is concerned, has already made two appearances before this Chamber, and, regarding that portion of it, I do not propose to say anything at this juncture. There are certain additions which have been made, and to one or two of them I will address myself. The Bill, as the Minister very correctly stated the other day, is a very innocent and small instalment of the reforms which are necessary, but he hazarded the opinion, in which, I suppose, the Senate generally will concur, that the present is certainly no time to face those reforms, which undoubtedly the Department and the Forces are calling for. But there is one reform to which, seeing that it is dealt with incidentally in the Bill, I would like to impress on the attention of the Minister. I have already referred here to the fact that our organizations and plans, even our rules and regulations, are all designed for the defence of Australia from the attack of a raiding force. Both now and on a previous occasion Australia found that it was not called upon to meet the attack of an enemy approaching our shores, but, in common with the rest of the Empire, our contingents went out to fight in other countries. For an emergency of that kind we have no provision.. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">There is nothing either in our defence scheme, in the organization* of the Army itself, or in the provision for equipment, which contemplates a possibility of that kind. Yet it does seem to me inevitable that whenever the Empire is at war Australia will desire to take an active share in the war. That&#34; being so, I do suggest that the Minister of Defence should address himself to the question of presenting to us some proposals by which, without maintaining in the time of peace a military force for service abroad, we should, at least, have the organization which would enable that force to be enrolled and sent forward at the earliest possible date. I intend to show later that in this Bill there has been some attempt made to provide for the circumstances which were brought about when we sent an Expeditionary Force abroad. I am sorry to say that the one effort which is being made in that direction seems to cut right across the bedrock of our defence system, but I will refer to that a little later. Before taking the proposals of the Bill as they come, I would like to direct the attention of the Minister to some remarks he made the other day commenting upon a brief speech delivered by the Leader of the Opposition in another place, and that was the time taken in the despatch of our Expeditionary Force. The Minister expressed the opinion, and it is a very sound one, that it was not advisable to send out ill-trained troops. I understood his argument to be on these lines : that, as our troops to go into the field must be trained, it is advisable to train them thoroughly before we send them abroad. I quite agree that it is necessary to have the troops trained, but let me point out that, if the Minister keeps  then  here till they are trained, there will still have to be an inevitable delay after they reach Europe. If, for instance, our troops were trained up to the last moment here, there would still have to be further delay when they reached Europe. That arises from the fact that a very large number of our troops are mounted, and even those which are infantry employ a- considerable number of horses, for infantry cannot move without horses. When the horses have completed a journey across the water extending from six weeks to two months, no horse will be in a position to do anything more than crawl . If the Minister refers to his officers, or cares to consult those who have had a very large experience in the shipment of horses to India, he will find that when horses are unshipped in India the practice is to turn them out into a paddock and to allow them to take such exercise as they please. It is not until two or three weeks have gone by in that way that the horses are compelled to take gentle exercise only, and it is possibly six weeks before an attempt is made to work them. Now, a trip to Europe is longer than a trip to India; therefore that delay must inevitably take place. I ask the Minister to ascertain if it is not possible, despite the desire to send our troops as well trained as possible, to reduce the time for which they are kept here, bearing in mind that in England, if that is to be the final destination, it will be necessary to delay matters until the horses can be got into condition, when the men could complete their training. If there is to be six weeks or two months of absence from the battlefield in the training camps at Home- and it does seem to me that period is rendered necessary by a consideration for the horses - we might reasonably make an effort to shorten the period of training here.  If  that can be done I am sure that the Minister will be the first to agree that the value of Australia&#39;s help to the Empire will be considerably augmented by every day&#39;s delay we can avoid in sending our troops away. </para>

              <para>- The Minister knows perfectly well that a great portion of the training of lighthorsemen is infantry training, and that the horses -are used merely as a means of locomotion. Mounted riflemen are not cavalry, but merely infantry, who are mounted for the purpose of greater mobility. Now I turn to some of the proposals in the Bill. The first proposal to which I wish to direct attention is that which deals with the area, within which residents are liable to training. I see that the radius is 5 miles. I ask the Minister to consider whether that is not too long a distance to compel a boy to go to receive his training. . If a boy is outside the 5-miles limit he is exempt, but if he is living at a distance of 4- miles and 7-8ths he is liable to go to the nearest training centre. I think that the </para>

              <para>- It makes every boy liable to training. Cases, not of 5 miles, but of 3 miles, came under my notice. I venture to say that the provision represents a very great hardship in the case of boys, who, after working all day, have to go home, get a wash and take a meal, and then to travel 3 miles to a training centre. I am speaking now as a firm believer in the system, and as one who wants to remove causes of friction, believing that its ultimate success will rest -entirely on the goodwill with which it is received by the people. Every year is bringing into the ranks of those who will make or unmake the system the boys who have passed through the course. </para>

              <para>- The Minister will find, if he makes an inquiry, that there have been complaints from parents whose circumstances were such as I have related. Until we can extend our Instructional Staff, and until the population increases sufficiently to enable us to have a larger number of corps, it seems to me that the distance provided by the Defence Act to-day is excessive, and as such represents a hardship on a very considerable number of our lads. There is a somewhat bigger evil still. I do not know whether the Minister&#39;s attention has been drawn to the fact, but in shaping the areas when the system was first launched, and with the very natural desire to follow the rail ways for the purpose of transport, areas were included which were so far apart that, when the lads passed from the Cadets into the Citizen Forces, they went into camp without having been trained. The Minister has only to look over the records of the Liverpool camp incident to find ample confirmation of my statement. Along the north-western railway in New South Wales - that is the line which runs from Sydney to Narrabri and Moree - there is an area which includes quite a number of towns. In one town it was found, for various reasons, that only eight lads were liable for enrolment; in another town, thirteen lads ; and, in another town, twenty lads. These lads were scattered along miles of railway in order to make one regiment. The boys were not trained, because the limited number of instructors could not cover that extensive area. The boys had no chance of being put together ; they did not know their officers, nor did the officers know the boys. It was no wonder, therefore, that, when the lads got to camp, they, instead of being familiar with elementary training, were simply a raw mob, through no fault of their own. Here, again, I am not criticising, because I can quite understand that these areas were first designed, to a large extent, on paper. I am only directing attention to experience which ought to enable us, by readjusting the areas, to avoid the evil to which I have referred. There ought to be some limit. We ought to lay it down as a principle that we will not include within an area to which compulsory training applies any centre not sufficiently populous to give such a number of boys as would justify us in having a proper instructional officer there, or an officer to visit them at least with sufficient frequency. That is not the case to-day, and I trust that, now the Minister is on the matter of exemptions, he will look into it as early as possible. When I left office the initial steps had been taken to ascertain how far the areas might be revised. I hope the Minister will see the matter is not lost sight of, because it is putting the boys to considerable inconvenience, and doing no good to the Forces. The Minister, like myself, has been brought face to face with the constant and pressing difficulty of granting exemptions from the legal obligations imposed by the Defence Act. We have laid it down that everybody is liable to service, but no provision is made for granting exemptions other than those set out in the Act. I am sure the Minister, as I did, must have come across numberless instances where to compel boys to discharge their legal obligation would be, not only a hardship, but would possibly deprive them of their means of livelihood. We have no provision in the law to meet cases of that kind. I have already told the Senate that I had broken the law, and granted exemptions. There is no legal power to do so. </para>

              <para>- I am not at all frightened, because, if the cases were brought forward, there is not a man here who would not approve of exemptions being granted in the circumstances. It would be more correct to say, not that I broke the law, but that I refrained from enforcing it in certain cases. The Minister now comes forward with a proposal to legalize what has been done. The Bill leaves each case to be dealt with by the Minister upon its merits. I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is looking for trouble, but the clause seems likely to open the flood-gates of trouble for him. I know nothing more undesirable or unfortunate for the Minister than to have representations made to him asking him to say that in this, that, or the other particular case he shall exempt a boy from his legal obligations. It would have been better to make an effort to put in the Act itself the circumstances and conditions which would entitle a boy to ask for exemption. </para>

              <para>- But there is no reason to say that the son of a widow should escape. The principle which guided me when in office was that, where the training, when carried  out,  would so interfere with the boy&#39;s occupation as to destroy or reduce his means of livelihood, there was a sound reason to grant exemption; but; merely to say that a boy must be exempted because he is the son of a widow would be ridiculous, as the widow might be a millionairess. So far as one can judge the sentiment of the people of this country, there is no desire on their part to enforce the military obligations to the extent of destroying a boy&#39;s means of livelihood. That should be the test. If a boy can discharge his duty under the Act without impairing his means of livelihood,  he should be called upon to do so ; but, immediately it interferes with his means of  livelihood, there is a reasonable ground for relaxing the obligation. It will be extremely difficult for the Minister, or any one else in his chair, to take on himself the responsibility of saying what boy shall or shall not be allowed to go free. It will depend, in that case, not altogether on the merits, but a good deal on the force and pertinacity with which the case may be pressed on Ministerial attention. One advocate a little more capable of putting a case in attractive form than another may secure an exemption, whilst an equally meritorious claim in less &#34;successful hands would be refused. I am suggesting this course because of my own experience, and also because I believe it would save a good deal of the criticism &#39; which would otherwise be likely to arise to the effect that favoritism was being shown. If we can lay it down in the law itself, or devise some machinery by which we shall avoid placing on the shoulders of the Minister the difficult obligation of deciding on what must always be a very nice point, I am confident that it will give greater satisfaction to the community and relieve the Minister of a great deal of trouble. Tnere seems to be a proposition in the Bill that will cut across the very foundations of our defence system, which provides primarily and essentially for a Citizen Defence Force. We have sought to limit the Permanent Forces to a minimum, professing at least to desire only so many permanent soldiers and such permanent units as may be necessary for the efficiency of the Citizen Forces. They are, to a large extent, the handmaidens of the Citizen Army, but there seems to be a proposal in the Bill which is going to depart from, or, at any rate, widen the principle very considerably, and to a dangerous extent. By clause 7 it is proposed to introduce an amendment, the effect of which will be to enable the establishment, enlistment, and enrolment of permanent forces in time of war. I know of no reason why we should enlist permanent forces in time of war more than at any other time. To make them permanents units in time of war would mean continuing them as permanent units in time of peace. </para>

          <para>To that it is now proposed to add &#39;.&#39; or except Expeditionary Forces in time of war.&#34; If it is intended only by these words to take power to enrol for the definite purposes of a war and for some period afterwards, and that the expeditionary forces shall fall back into the ordinary citizen ranks afterwards, I am satisfied, although I still think the words employed are much too wide for that limited meaning. If that is the Minister&#39;s intention, he and I are quite in accord as to what should be done. It is only a matter of determining the right wording to express it. I hope Australia will still adhere to the idea of a citizen army, but I fear there is a growing danger, unless something is done to check it, of that ideal being gradually abandoned and a permanent force being allowed to grow. We have already increased our permanent forces to twice the number that Lord Kitchener said would be sufficient. The extension of the permanent units has been gradually going on. </para>

              <para>- I am sorry that my honorable friends disagree with me, but I still feel, from my limited experience of the Department, that unless the country keeps a careful eye upon it there will be a steady pressure on the part of permanent officers to gradually increase the permanent units, until, before we know where we are, instead of the permanent units being kept down to the minimum necessary to the efficiency of the citizen soldiers, they will become the major portion of the army. I am utterly opposed to that, and should not have spoken on the matter, especially at this time, unless I had felt that there was a grave danger involved. </para>

              <para>- If you will allow it to grow, &#34; Yes.&#34; Of course, I have sufficient faith in the democracy of Australia to say that the moment it detects anything of that kind it will stamp upon it with both feet. But I wish to prevent it from growing up to be stamped upon. I do not say for a moment that the Department is tied down by Lord Kitchener&#39;s recommendation ; but, as the result of knowledge which came to me in that Department, I have no hesitation in stating that there is a steady pressure from all quarters to augment the list of permanent soldiers throughout the Commonwealth. It seems to me that the proposal contained in clause 7 of this Bill indicates the effect of that pressure. I do hope that, before the measure emerges from Committee, the Minister will confer with his legal advisers, who are better able to express a definite opinion than I am as to whether or not the addition of the words &#34;or except Expeditionary Forces in time of war,&#34; would not permit of the creation of permanent units which would continue as permanent units after the war had ceased. Then it is proposed to include amongst the permanent corps for which authority is to be given, an aviation corps. I admit that the nucleus of a permanent aviation corps is desirable, but I do not think that, even in this matter, we canafford to ignore the pressure to which I have referred. I am quite sure that in the aviation corps we can supply the major proportion of our requirements from our Citizen Forces, if we are disposed to do that. I hope that the Minister will put his foot down upon anything other than the creation of the necessary nucleus- </para>

              <para>- Yes. But there are some very elaborate proposals to be found in the Defence Department, one of which the Minister himself turned down before he quitted office on the last occasion. The professional soldier is always disposed to regard the citizen soldier as a somewhat secondary quantity, and is ever anxious to build up the permanent side of our Defence Force. </para>

              <para>- If we find that the training which our youths now undergo is not sufficient to make our Citizen Army efficient, let us call for greater sacrifices on the part of our citizen soldiers, and give them greater remuneration for their services. I am not convinced that we cannot provide the major portion of our requirements from our citizen soldiers. At any rate, we should endeavour to do so before multiplying the permanent lists of our soldiers. There is particular need for my remarks in regard to the aviation branch of our defence system. I do not suppose that, in the whole of a modern army, one can find any corps in which there is so much absolute idleness, and in which there is such a brief life, as there is for those who join the flying corps. </para>

              <para>- I do not mean brief from the stand-point of mortality. But at Home it is recognised that, after a man has been in the flying corps four or five years, he is done. His nerve has gone. Consequently, I ask, What are we going to do with our airmen - if they be permanent men - when they cease to be of value as aviators? Hence the reason why we should call upon our citizen soldiers to discharge the duties appertaining to this corps. </para>

              <para>- That is obvious. I quite recognise that we must have a permanent Instructional Staff. But unless a very strong hand is kept on the military officers who make recommendations in these matters the aviation corps will be largely increased by permanent appointments. I know that the recommendations in the Department to-day would, if adopted, be sufficient to create a very elaborate corps indeed. In my opinion, that is quite unnecessary, and would be extremely costly. I am certain that if. the regulations are shaped attractively we can obtain from our citizen soldiers ample material to thoroughly equip our flying squadrons. Consequently, I trust that no effort will be made to take into the aviation corps any more than instructors and mechanics. My criticism is not prompted by any hostility to the Bill or to the Department. I have merely discharged what I conceive to be my duty. Certain facts have come to my knowledge, and I have formed certain opinions regarding them. If there be one question in our public life which calls for a free expression of opinion it is that of our Defence Forces. It was never more necessary that there should be a full understanding of what is going on in our Defence Department than it is now. There are other mutters in this Bill of a subordinate character, but which are nevertheless of some importance, to which I might refer, but it seems to me that they can with more advantage be discussed in Committee, and consequently I shall reserve my remarks until we reach that stage. I trust that the Minister will regard my efforts as being dictated by a desire to improve this measure, and not to destroy its usefulness or to harass his efforts in getting it passed into law. </para>

There might be occasions upon which its effect would be to expedite the business of an estate, but there are other occasions on which the creditors would be entitled to be consulted. I remind honorable senators that the bankrupt could be employed by permission of the Court, or permission of the creditors, and usually there would not be such a hurry in connexion with the settlement of an estate that any loss would be sustained by delay in securing permission of the Court or of the creditors. What the honorable senator proposes might be advantageous in some cases, but the amendment would be attended by the danger that very often what is done quickly is not done in the right way. Under clause 97 the trustee may secure the permission of the Court or of the creditors to employ the debtor in the way proposed. I would ask honorable senators not to agree to the amendment, unless they feel very strongly concerning its advantages. </para>

          <para>. - I have no objection to accept the suggestion offered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior,</inline> and make the amendment read in such a way as to permit the trustee to employ any person, including the bankrupt, to do any business necessary for carrying on the business of the bankrupt. With regard to the statement of the Minister that the Bill elsewhere provides for the employment of the bankrupt, it is true that, in clause 98, and not clause 97, there is a provision enabling the trustee, with the sanction of the creditors, .by resolution of any general meeting, to appoint the bankrupt to superintend the management of his property, or any part thereof, or to carry on his trade for the benefit of his creditors on such terms as the trustee may direct. It is clear from that that the Bill contemplates the possible employment of the bankrupt, but not for a limited period or a definite task. It contemplates his employment for the superintendence of the management of his property, or any part thereof, or the carrying on of the trade of his business. I am proposing to invest the trustee with the power to employ the bankrupt as an employe. If his employment is detrimental, as it would be in only very exceptional cases, and that is overlooked by the trustee, it will probably be realized by the creditors or Committee of Inspection, and the bankrupt&#39;s employment will not then be continued/. Why there should be the necessity, not merely for the formality of obtaining a resolution, but for the cumbersomeness and the risk of obtaining a resolution, I fail to see. If a bankrupt is to be employed to go on with his business as if he had not failed, I think that the creditors have a right to be consulted. If he is to be employed to superintend the management of his property and control the working services of clerks and otherofficers, I consider that the creditors should be consulted. Provision is made for that in clause 98 ; but my amendment will give to a trustee merely the power to temporarily employ the bankrupt, and the bankrupt having an acquaintance with his business, and knowing the people with whom he had been dealing, will be able to do the work, in many instances, much better than could any other man, even though the latter might be otherwise, and generally much more* skilful. If a trustee wants to employ the bankrupt for a week, say, to collect debts, probably there is no better man. who could be secured for that purposeI am not seeking to enlarge the powers, of a trustee to any very great extent toenable him to carry on without having to resort to the provision made in clause 98. As one who has had some experience in connexion with bankruptcies, I can say that, after the first meeting of creditors, it is most difficult to get them to meet again. They have to be urged and entreated to attend a meeting. They say, &#34;We have attended a meeting,&#34;  or &#34;We have written the debt off.&#34; And many of these persons are those who will complain afterwards, blaming the Act, or somebody. I hope that the Minister will see that my amendment proposes no undue enlargement of the powers of a trustee. It is only providing a little greasewhich will enable the wheels to revolve more smoothly, and to facilitate proceedings in the interests, not of the trustee, but of the creditors, and at less expense to them. It is absurd to involve the estate in the expense of convening a meeting or of obtaining the authority which is required in clause 98 - authority which, I agree, it is desirable should be obtained! where a bankrupt should be engaged to carry on the business as though no bankruptcy had occurred, or to superintend the management of it. I cannot say  offhand whether such an express provision as I propose is in force anywhere; but I know that it is a common practice, especially in connexion with a country storekeeper, for the trustee to employ the bankrupt in connexion with the work. It is almost a necessity, and certainly it is an advantage. I do not know that it is necessary to pass a resolution in a case of that kind. </para>

          <para>. - It would appear that if this amendment is accepted it will entirely remove from the creditors any safeguard -which otherwise they would have. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has pointed out, the creditors in an estate will not be consulted before the bankrupt is employed. &#34;The amendment is a very sweeping proposal. It gives the bankrupt unlimited power in the management of his own estate </para>

            <para>- Clause 98 provides that the creditor shall be consulted before the bankrupt is employed to again run his business. But the amendment empowers the trustee to appoint the bankrupt to act in any capacity, even to again superintend his own estate, without the creditors being consulted. It appears to me to be an attempt to get round clause 98 by not giving the creditors a say in the question of employing a bankrupt. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lt.-Colonel Sir ALBERT</inline>GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;4.52&#93;.- The idea of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> is not to cause difficulties, but rather to ease difficulties which otherwise might arise. The amendment does not go so far as clause 98 does. It enables the trustee to employ the bankrupt, possibly to collect  debts or to report as to the solvency of different persons. It confers a limited power, and the exercise of the power is always subject to the control of the trustee. It confers upon the trustee no powers greater than those which are conferred by the clause in paragraphs e and <inline font-style="italic">g.</inline> Under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> he may use his own discretion in the management of the estate and its distribution amongst the creditors. Could honorable senators place a wider power in the hands of a trustee than this power ? The amendment only makes clear the power which the trustee would have to employ the bankrupt in certain circumstances and for limited periods. In framing a law under which wide interests will be involved, we cannot afford, for the sake of terseness, to leave in doubt anything which can be made clear by a few words. I urge upon the Minister that it is desirable to adopt an amendment of this character. It is clearly in the power of a trustee to play ducks and drakes with an estate if he is unwise or incapable, bub surely it will be assumed that every trustee will be a man of integrity and ability, who will be quite capable of discharging the duties of the position. It will not derogate from the protection of creditors to give this limited power. If the amendment is made, and a  trustee  discovers sufficient cause, he can always remove the bankrupt without consulting the creditors. If honorable senators think it is undesirable that a bankrupt should have anything to do with the administration of his estate, do not confer the power to employ him on the trustee. But we know that there have been innumerable cases where the estate of a bankrupt has been successfully administered by reason of his employment. It must be recognised clearly that in that capacity he cannot do just as he did when he was running his business on his own account. A man running his own business is his own master, and unwise speculations may land him in bankruptcy.

            <para>.- Exactly. He has the whole control, subject to a supreme authority. The Minister would be well advised to take the matter in hand. It is difficult for him without a knowledge of bankruptcy practice to handle a Bill of this kind, and a little deference might be paid to the opinions of lawyers engaged in actual practice, whose whole object is to smooth matters and apply a little lubrication where otherwise it might be necessary to go to Court and incur a good deal of expenditure that might be saved. </para>

            <para>- There is a danger in a State bankruptcy of even a first-class trustee, anxious to expedite matters, appointing a bankrupt to do things which would meet with the disapproval of nine-tenths of the creditors. We make provision in clause 98 for the sanction of the creditors, who are surely the chief people to be consulted when the estate has reached that stage. If the Committee is anxious to run the risks of haste because of the danger of going slowly, it can adopt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating&#39;s</inline> amendment, but I see greater danger in throwing aside the safeguards provided in almost all the Acts - Australian and English - as shown by the marginal notes. </para>

            <para>- The marginal notes suggested a comparison with the Queensland Code. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> used his position and knowledge of the Act to mislead the Committee in that case. However, it is not a matter for warmth. It is a question whether we are going to insert a clause that cuts into clause 98, and may even altogether supersede it. Clause 98 gives all the permission necessary for the employment of the bankrupt to assist in dealing with the estate, but only with the permission of the creditors. It is safer to follow the beaten track. The reason advanced for the change is that more speed may be gained. It is a question of speed against safety, and, with my usual conservative nature, I prefer to stick to the beaten track&#39; of safety rather than embark on unknown roads with those who are anxious to get along at a greater rate. I see grave dangers ininvesting trustees with unusual powers. </para>

          <para>. - The Minister seems to have missed the reason for tabling the amendment. He has said it is a case of speed as against the safety of the creditors, but that is not the position. The experience in every State is that once a first meeting of creditors has been held a large number of them wash their hands of the whole affair, and it is sometimes almost impossible to get another meeting. If that is so in the limited areas of the States, what can w* expect when the area of the bankruptcy will be the Commonwealth? There may be a case where the creditors range from Townsville to Hobart, and it will be difficult to summon a meeting of them to get a resolution of the character provided for under clause 98. Assuming that an estate has been sequestrated, and a trustee appointed, the trustee may wish to employ the bankrupt. I ask that he should have the power to employ him in anything  abort of the superintendence of the business of the estate, or any portion of it; but the Minister by refusing to accept the amendment prevents the trustee from so employing the bankrupt without the sanction of a meeting of the creditors. What would happen if he could not get the creditors together? In that case a deadlock would arise so far as the appointment of the bankrupt was concerned. In such circumstances, of what use would it be to empower the trustee to employ the bankrupt? </para>

            <para>- I beg. the honorable senator&#39;s pardon - it did not. The marginal note inviting a comparison with the Queensland Code was placed in the wrong part of the clause. It was a proviso at the end of the clause, to which the comparison should have referred, and not that particular portion of the clause which was under discussion here for an hour. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> has asked me if the power contained in this clause is at present exercised by trustees. My experience has been limited to my own State, and I say that in Tasmania the trustee has been endowed with all the powers which will be conferred by clause 98 of this Bill. Yet the marginal note to clause 98 would lead us to suppose that that provision is based upon section 64 of the .English Bankruptcy Act, section 61 of the Western Australian Bankruptcy Act, and section 25 of the Tasmanian Act. That is a deliberate invitation to the Committee to believe that that particular clause is based upon section 25 of the Tasmanian Act. </para>

            <para>- -Then section 26 of the Tasmanian Act gives the trustee certain powers with the sanction of the Committee of inspection. I wish to see the trustee empowered in all cases of minor importance in connexion with the administration of an estate to employ the bankrupt for specific work or for a specific term. But if the bankrupt is to be employed for the general superintendence of the whole or any part of the estate, I believe that the restriction imposed in clause 98 should apply. If my amendment be not carried, and the bankrupt&#39;s services are required for a month, or for the performance of some specific work, the trustee will be unable to employ him unless he secures the sanction of the creditors by special resolution. I ask the favorable consideration of the Vice-President of the Executive Council to this aspect of the matter. If the wording of my proposal does not meet with his approval, I appeal to him to allow it to pass, and before the Bill is finally dealt with, we can, if necessary, rectify its verbiage. </para>

It would always be open to the creditors or to the Committee of inspection to upset what the trustee had done. </para>

I make the offer to honorable senators that, if they will permit the clause to pass, I shall be prepared, before the report stage is reached, to move for its re-consideration, in order that an opportunity may be given to consider an amendment which would have the effect <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> desires without cutting across the provisions of clause 98, as I believe the present amendment does. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lt.-Colonel Sir ALBERT</inline>GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;5.35&#93;.- It might be well to insert an amendment giving the trustee power to deal with matters in the way suggested- by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> where an estate is under a certain value. Clause 98 might be amended so as to provide that, upon the creditors failing te attend a duly summoned meeting, the trustee should be at liberty to exercise such of the powers as are provided for in that clause as he might think desirable, subject to the right of the creditors, if they so desired, to vary or alter the decision of the trustee at a meeting subsequently convened. In the case of an estate of small value, it might not be worth while to call the creditors together, and in -such the course proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> might be adopted. In all other cases clause 98 could be brought into operation with a proviso that if the creditors failed to attend a summoned meeting the trustee should be empowered to exercise the powers given under the clause in the interests  of the estate. This might cause delay, but it involves the maximum of security. We should be very -careful in dealing with this measure not to impose restrictions in connexion with the administration of insolvent estates that do not exist at present. We want to make this Bill acceptable to the whole of the Commonwealth. It is very important, and will, no doubt, be a valuable piece of legislation. The VicePresident of the Executive Council was, apparently, a little hurt by my statement that the marginal notes are misleading. Let me assure the honorable senator that I made no charge against him in the matter. No Minister could possibly undertake to examine the whole of the marginal notes to the clauses of any Bill. </para>

          <para>.- The Vice-President of the Executive Council is fearful that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating&#39;s</inline> amendment would give the trustee a power which is not covered, or should not be covered, by the clause. I point out to the honorable senator that in section 137 of the South Australian Act which is referred to in the marginal note the power is not a restricted, but an absolute, power. The section reads - </para>
        </talk.start>
        <quote>
          <para>All powers vested in any insolvent which he might legally exercise for his own benefit may be exercised by the trustee for the benefit of the creditors in such manner as the insolvent might have exercised the same. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">It will be seen that under that section, which is referred to in the marginal note to this clause, absolute authority is given to the trustee to exercise the powers which the insolvent might have exercised prior to insolvency. Let us take a case in point. Suppose that an insolvency occurs 300 or 400 miles from the place where the creditors are doing business. They are not acquainted with the customers of the insolvent. They are not conversant with the ability of the customers to pay up. They are not acquainted with any of the things which are foremost in the mind of the insolvent. Yet, under this clause, the trustee cannot employ the insolvent, even although he may see that it would be to the best interests of the creditors to take that course, simply because he is a bankrupt. The first consideration should be to study the interests of the creditors, and the next consideration is what power should be conferred upon a trustee to enable him to exercise his judgment for the benefit of the creditors. If a trustee may sell a part of the estate at very much less than its real worth, without consulting the creditors, surely he ought to be at liberty to employ the bankrupt, seeing that the trustee is there to study the interests of the creditors. He is their safeguard. He will have to administer the estate largely without consulting them. </para>

            <para>- In certain circumstances, he may be the best man. If at the first meeting the creditors specify that the bankrupt shall not be employed, it will meet the case. The bankrupt cannot be employed then, because the trustee will be the servant of the creditors. Section 141 of the South Australian Act reads - </para>

          <para>The trustee may, with the approbation of the Court, appoint the insolvent to superintend the management of the estate, or to carry on the insolvent&#39;s trade or business, and otherwise to aid him in administering the insolvent&#39;s estate and effects in such manner and on such terms as he may think best for the benefit of the creditors. </para>

        <para class="block">That provision is almost identical with clause 98 of this Bill. Although it will be seen that absolute power is given to a trustee to employ the bankrupt, yet the Minister hesitates to accept the principle. What I do not like is that the man who could be most useful and beneficial is singled out as the one man who is not to be employed by the trustee. I ask the Minister to accept the amendment. In South Australia I have known of dozens of cases where the best man for the creditors to employ was the bankrupt himself. Where he is so employed, he is a servant under a master, and not a master superintending the business which he brought to ruin. The amendment, in my opinion, will make the clause more effective and useful. The Minister has remarked that it is contrary to practice to employ the bankrupt; but in South Australia I have known the bankrupt tobe employed in dozens of cases by the official assignee to superintend the stocktaking and the collection of debts, and very often to supervize the transfer of the stock to the successful tenderer. </para>

          <para>. - I think that the discussion has justified itself, because it shows that there is some necessity for departing from the inelastic provisions of the measure. I accept, in the spirit in which it has been proffered, the suggestion of the Minister that this matter can be dealt with at a later stage. I hope that it will then be dealt with in the light of the present discussion, because I think it has been revealed that it is not desirable that we should rely on the inelastic provision of clause 98, and will get something more elastic. Due precautions should be taken to safeguard the interests of all concerned. I do not propose to press the amendment at this stage. </para>

        <para class="block">The words in paragraph c of clause 97 are identical with the words of the proposed new paragraph in clause 96. The effect, therefore, of my proposal would be to transfer paragraph c from clause 97 to clause 96. It will be obvious to honorable senators that there are matters in connexion with bankruptcy provided for throughout the measure which require intervention by the Court or application to the Court - in many instances matters of routine. So far as they are concerned, I do not think it would be desirable to add the expenses which are involved in securing the authorization required by clause <inline font-style="italic">97</inline> to employ a barrister. The object of my proposal is to leave these matters to the trustee under clause 96 without the necessity of his having recourse to the authority which is provided for in clause 97. The amendment, I may say, has not been recommended by any body of lawyers; it has been recommended by the Committee of the Chambers of Commerce to which I have referred several times. A majority of the members of that Committee were men who had been accustomed to dealing with bankrupt estates. Experienced men like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Borchard,</inline> of New South Wales, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lemmon,</inline> of Victoria, realized that in many instances it is necessary that an application should be made to the Court in a matter which, to a large exteno, is one of routine. The application must be made in order to comply with the law. If it would be necessary in all instances, before employing a counsel, attorney, or solicitor, to obtain a resolution of the creditors, the proceedings would be unnecessarily cumbersome. I hope that the Minister will realize the necessity and the advantage of making this amendment. </para>

          <para>. - I admire the skill with which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> puts his views before the Committee.  His  proposal is to alter clause 97 by transferring to this clause the paragraph under which the trustee may, by permission of the creditors, by resolution passed at a general meeting, or of the Committee of Inspection, or by leave of the Court, employ a barrister. I ask honorable senators, Is it not a fair thing to have this safeguard to the employment of barristers or solicitors for other people? There is no occasion for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> to talk about the cumbersomeness of getting the Committee of Inspection or the creditors together, because, at his suggestion, we have reduced the Committee of Inspection to two persons. Therefore, under the Bill the permission of only two persons has to be obtained for the employment of a barrister, and the Court or the Committee of Inspection can give the authority. This proposal to vest the authority in the trustee alone is, I think, an unnecessary interference with the scheme of the Bill. In my opinion, it is an unreasonable re quest. I do not propose to detain the Committee, because I believe that the common sense of honorable senators will perceive that it is an amendment which can be dealt with promptly. </para>

The trustee would have the power to make him an allowance under the clause, but in his case it would be a dole or charity. &#34; B,&#34; another bankrupt, might be allowed to assist the trustee and do some work, and the money allowed to him under the same clause would not be a dole or charity. By omitting the words to which I have directed attention, all bankrupts would be placed in the same position. I want to apply the same principle as applies in the case of old-age pensions. The fact that a bankrupt does not work for the estate may be due to causes, outside bis own- control, such as ill health or the desire of the creditors to secure the services of somebody else. I do not want any pauperisation in this matter. The Committee of the Associated Chambers of Commerce regarded it as the general policy of the Commonwealth that there should be nothing of a pauperising character about the allowance. </para>

            <para>- The declaration of a final dividend is totally different from the declaration of any &#39;other dividend. Nobody objects to receiving payment of dividends without notice, but to receive payment of a final dividend without notice is another matter. Before a trusteedeclares the final dividend it is only right that he should publish - a notice of  his. intention in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> so that creditors may be afforded an opportunity of saying, &#39;.&#39; This should not be the final dividend. The estate should realize more.&#34; To my mind, a distinction should bedrawn between the payment of an ordinary dividend and the payment of a  final  dividend. </para>

            <para>.&#34; - I desire to repeat the question which L put to the Minister of Defence last week, in reference to the military raids which were recently conducted on business premises. I wish to know whether it is theintention of the Attorney-General or of the Minister to make any announcement in regard to the result of those raids, more particularly in the case of individuals or firms whom the raids have revealed were unjustifiably under suspicion. I do not suggest that it is desirable that the Government should announce details. of what was done or what was discovered in connexion with those raids, but wherethey revealed the innocence of any firm or firms I believe the fact should be made known as widely as possible. </para>

Many of these lads have to attend the Technical College on certain nights each week, and have, therefore, either to forego their class instruction or their drill.  As every drill lost means that they have to attend a double drill to make up that loss, I desire to know whether something cannot be done to remedy their position. Compulsory drill at night entails a great loss to these young men, who are endeavouring to fit themselves for the battle of life. I am not unmindful of the difficulties with which the position is surrounded, but perhaps something can be devised to overcome them. </para>

            <para>.- In reply to the question raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> I wish to say that the AttorneyGeneral has promised, as soon as possible, to make a statement in regard to those  firms whose premises were searched, and in which nothing of an incriminating nature was found. I understand that he has made a statement to-day, but I am not in possession of it. &#39; I will endeavour to get it by to-morrow, so  as  to be able to repeat it here for the information of honorable senators. Concerning the question raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> I informed the Leader of the Opposition to-day that inquiry has been made from the Administrator of what was German. New Guinea, but we have not yet received a reply  as to any appointments which have been made. </para>

              <para>- The reply is that the position of the ex-Governor and the late officials of German New Guinea is determined, to some extent, by the terms of occupation granted to them by the military officer,  Colonel Holmes.  There are certain questions arising out of those terms which, to &#39;our mind, necessitate a reference to the British Government. We have referred those questions to the Imperial authorities by cable, but. we are not -yet in receipt of their reply. The matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Watson</inline> has been raised previously, and it has been found necessary to give the brigade-majors in districts in which there are night schools or technical classes power to adjust these matters. If he will suggest to the persons who have made representations to him that they should wait upon the officers in question, the difficulty may po* sibly be overcome. If that course fails, the matter can then be brought &#39; before Head-quarters, but trainees cannot be relieved of their obligation to drill. _ The same difficulty cropped up. earlier in the operation of our defence, scheme, and it was overcome by allowing trainees to perform their drill in the day time, or on nights on which they were not required to attend technical schools. But the Area Officers have full power to adjust these matters. </para>
