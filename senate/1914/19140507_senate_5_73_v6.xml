There is the law, and it is for the magistrates to interpret it as they think fit, but I should like to add that I have been struck by what would appear to be a want of uniformity in some individual cases, and have directed one officer who is most closely in touch with these prosecutions to get together some information, on which either it may be necessary to ask Parliament to amend the Act, or a communication from the Department to the magistrates may be found sufficient. </para>

If the honorable senator refers to a statement in the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Times,</inline> I did see it, and the reason why I have not publicly contradicted it is that life is too short for a Minister in charge of the Defence Department to attempt to answer all the silly  tarradiddles  with which enterprising reporters crowd the columns of their papers. In this case, which was specifically brought under my notice, I wish first to give an absolute denial to the suggestion that any influence, social, political, or otherwise, has ever moved me in any exemptions which have been granted. </para>

                            <para>- I have, and sooner or later Parliament will be asked, perhaps not to legalize what has been done, but to make provision for legally doing it in the future. There is no provision in our Act for exemptions in certain cases where I have granted them . One of those cases is where a lad would have his means of livelihood interfered with if called upon to comply with the terms of the Act. In such cases I have granted an exemption from the drill or camp which the boy would otherwise have to attend. </para>

                            <para>- But it also means that Parliament will have to say whether a boy is to be deprived of his livelihood, or whether it will grant exemptions for this specific purpose. In this particular matter, the boy, who was quite a junior, called himself a commercial traveller, and was called on to travel along one of the northern railway lines in New South Wales at the time when he was required to undertake his camp drill. I gave him an exemption, although I had no power under the Act to do so. </para>

                        <para>On 17th December last I addressed to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> a question regarding the administration of the Arbitration (Public Service) Act, and the honorable senator promised that the Government would consider the matter.  The Act has been applied by the Government equally to members of the claimant association and to* non-members. Seeing that another Act is now about to come into operation, have the Government yet decided whether they will call on non-members of the association to pay their proportion of the costs,, or undertake to meet the costs of the case themselves? I should like to know the Government policy on this matter. </para>

                        <para>- Some questions were submitted to me in respect to which I promised to obtain information to meet the convenience of honorable senators without asking them to formally repeat the questions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> asked a question with regard to the Gunnery School at South Head. I obtained a report on the subject, which was entirely re-assuring, but not quite complete, and I have sent it back to the State Commandant that it might be supplemented. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> asked a question as to additional allowances to Area Officers. In replying to the honorable senator, I safeguarded myself by saying that I was speaking from memory in saying that provision was made for the payment of the allowances in question. I find that I was not quite correct, and that, although approval was given to the making of the additional payments, the basis on which they were to be made is still under consideration. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> asked whether foreign oats were being supplied to the Defence Force, and the answer to his question is that, while the horses were fed on Algerian oats, the Algerian oats were Australian grown. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> made an inquiry as to the woods utilized at Lithgow for the stocks of rifles. I understand that quite a number of woods have been tested with satisfactory results in a limited number of cases. I am obtaining a full report on the whole matter, and, I hope, will be able to place it before the Senate shortly, with samples of rifles fitted with the woods which most appealed to the manager of the factory. </para>

In July,1913, I approved a recommendation of the Engineer-in-Chief that he should have authority to let piece-work where it was considered that the work could be carried out to better advantage and more economically by doing so;also of the rates being authorized by the Engineer-in-Chief. The Engineer-in-Chief fixed a scale of rates, and several small portions of piece-work were let by the acting Supervising Engineer, Kalgoorlie. </para>

                    <para>. - Such a long time has elapsed since we listened to the fervid eloquence of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Oakes,</inline> and the cautious and sage-like utterances of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> that an individual like myself might be easily excused if the ring of their words had almost disappeared from his mind. Yet so fervid were some of the statements that I still hear them ringing in my ears. In paragraphs 1 and 2 of the opening speech the Governor-General is practically taking farewell of the Parliament of the Commonwealth, and is about to depart from our midst, and the reasons given for his departure are those of ill-health and other private matters. I do not think we have any right to pry into the private matters that may have influenced  His Excellency  to, at such a period as this, go away from Australia to quieter regions than he might consider those of the Commonwealth at the present time. I am sure that every member of the Opposition is sincere in his regret that the climate or conditions of Australia should in any way impair the health of a gentleman whose stay here has been so agreeable to all the citizens of the Commonwealth. I am going to take what may be regarded as a rather irregular course. The custom is to deal with the opening speech paragraph by paragraph. But for reasons of my own, and perhaps also for the convenience of the other members of the Senate items 3 and 4 dealing with the test Bills that the Government are apparently making an attempt to force through both Houses of the Legislature may be left to a later stage of my remarks in connexion with this extraordinary Speech. Paragraph 5 contains a rather surprising statement from the Governor-General as the mouth-piece of the Government to the effect that the report of the Premiers&#39; Conference will be laid before us. I suppose we are expected to infer that the Senate will receive from this document sufficient information to justify the meagreness of the policy which  His  Excellency&#39;s Advisers have so far laid before us. During the election campaign, and subsequently through the press and in other ways, the Government have continually assured us that they were going to bring forward a very substantial policy when they had the opportunity. Yet here we have them bringing before us - what? The report of the Premiers&#39; Conference ! Where is that report? I have not yet received a copy of it, and cannot tell what it will contain. Seeing that the Government have proclaimed its existence by means of the Speech, and that the Senate has had an adjournment of considerable length, every honorable senator ought to have had a copy of it long ago. Even if we had it, what has it to do with the policy of the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia ? Have we reached a stage at which the Federal Government must go to an outside body for a policy to bring before Parliament - and not a constitutional body either? I have made similar statements to this on previous occasions, and have been criticised for making them, but though I have the greatest respect for every Premier and Government of the Australian States personally, I do not see where they come in, so far as the policy of the Federal Government is concerned. Yet paragraphs 5 to 11 of the Speech seem to refer to nothing but the Premiers&#39; Conference. We have had Premiers&#39; Conferences before, and we have had other Governments. We have had Prime Ministers actually sitting on the doorstep of the Premiers&#39; Conference waiting for a courteous hearing, but we have never been told before that we are to take our policy from any Premiers&#39; Conference that may sit in Australia. Paragraph 6 makes another extraordinary statement to .the effect that the Government have some idea of a policy with regard to the taking over of the State debts, and that the Prime Minister and Treasurer have conferred with the Premiers of the States on the matter. I can imagine the Treasurer and Prime Minister doing a thing of that description. The right honorable member for Swan years ago made the statement that he had often been compelled to eat dirt, an,d I imagine from this paragraph in the Speech that the right honorable gentleman, in company with the Prime Minister, is still prepared to eat dirt if necessary to retain office. </para>

                        <para>- I believe the members of the present Administration have been indifferent to almost everything. I can imagine the right honorable member grovelling before such an august body as the Premiers of Australia and other State Ministers when going before them with a statement, that he had prepared. I have had his statement carefully read to me, and expected to find something in it, but there was nothing in it. It practically says, &#34;Here is what I have done. If it does not satisfy you, for the love of heaven tell me what will !&#34; I can imagine the smile of derision on the faces of the Premiers when they saw the Federal Treasurer in such an abject position. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. He was prepared not only to apologize for his first statement, but to adopt any suggestion that the State Premiers or Treasurers might make, and then go back and prepare another statement himself. In fact the right honorable gentleman was prepared to do anything. It is degrading o not only to the Commonwealth Parliament, but to the people of Australia that their Ministerial representatives should be brought down to the position of having to kneel to the Premiers, Treasurers, and other Ministers of the States in connexion with the policy that they propose to introduce. The Commonwealth has not only been authorized, but has almost been directed by the Constitution to take over the State debts. It has also the alternative of taking over an equivalent or proportionate amount from each State, and we know that the Constitution has actually been amended to enable the Government to take over all the indebtedness of the States to date. Seeing that the Government have actually received that authority from the people direct it is their duty to take the debts over, no matter what the opinions of any State Government may be, although of course it will be all the better if it can be done with the full consent of the States themselves. </para>

                        <para>- I have been talking about the manner in which the Premiers of the States had been ap- &#39;proached by the honorable senator&#39;s colleagues. They did not go to the Conference as men who were taking the responsibilities of government on their own shoulders. They rather went as men pleading to the State Ministers to give them some assistance or ideas that they did not possess themselves. Even though they went to the Premiers&#39; Conference and discussed matters with State Ministers, they have not finished anything. There is no finality about the business. We are in exactly the same position as we have been in since the Act amending the Constitution in respect of the State debts was passed. </para>

It is the duty of the Commonwealth to take over the State debts, and the Commonwealth Government should go about it in their own way. If there was any obligation on me to assist the Government to carry out this obvious duty I would give them my advice, but as they apparently prefer the opinions of the State  Premiers  and Treasurers to those of members of this Parliament, I will leave them &#34;in their own soup,&#34; to quote the elegant expression already used by some of them. * Nothing has really been done, nor is anything going to be done, concerning the State debts until a fresh Government comes into office, because it is notorious that this is a Government of no results. They have done nothing up to the present, and are not likely to do anything in the future. I make bold to say that the great majority of the electors of Australia hope they will go out of office without doing anything. They say they have not had time, or if they had time they say, &#34;It is not opportune,&#34; and so they keep deluding the people. </para>

                <para class="block">It will be seen that State banking is exempt. There is a peculiar feature connected with State banking. I can remember that, when in the Federal Com.vention the question of banking was raised, the only State in the Commonwealth that had a State bank was South Australia. That State then had a small State bank which was crippled, restricted, and confined as much as possible by the Conservative element in the South Australian Parliament of that time. It was a mere semblance of a State bank, and could only lend money to the producers of South Australia in certain proportions and under certain conditions. I admit that since then it has been liberalized &#39; to some extent, but even now it is so restricted that it is not of as much value to the people of the State as it was intended to be by those who were responsible for its establishment and who supported it. It only issues debentures and lends out the money so received at a little higher interest, than is paid for it. It was for the protection of that little State bank of South Australia that the words to which I have referred were inserted in paragraph xiii., of section 51 of the Constitution, and an exemption was made of State banking other than that extending beyond the limits of one State. But there is nothing in the paragraph restricting the operations of the Commonwealth in connexion with banking, savings, banks, or anything of the kind. If the people of Australia at the inauguration of Federation meant that the Commonwealth should take over and control banking, are we now to suppose that they meant only general or commercial banking, and that the Commonwealth was not to have anything to do with the savings of the people? Is that the opinion of the people now ? I do not believe it is. At the inauguration of Federation all the Savings Banks in the different States were  not  Government Savings Banks. Any one who knows the history of savings banking in Australia must know that it was only after the Commonwealth began to move in this direction that the Savings Bank in South Australia got the security of the Government of the State behind it. The same may be said of Tasmania, and we know that in New South Wales there were two savings bank institutions in operation there. It was only within the last few weeks that they were amalgamated into, one institution, and were guaranteed the security of the State. In the case of all the institutions in the different States there was competition, irregularity, and lack of a State guarantee. It was because the framers of the Constitution were aware of this that they inserted paragraph xiii. in section 51 of the Constitution. They were of opinion that it was better, in the interests of Australia, that the Commonwealth should control and direct the Savings Banks throughout Australia. When the Commonwealth Bank was established, we know the opposition that was displayed, not only to the general banking, but to the savings banking, and everything else in connexion with it. We know the names and reputation of those who were opposed to it. We know that those same gentlemen are to-day members of the present Government, or supporting that Government, and that they never had any sympathy with the general or savings bank branch of the Commonwealth Bank. One reason why the Commonwealth can more effectively control and manage the savings of the people is that we have taken over, in the Post and Telegraph Department, an institution which can materially assist in the conduct of this business. The Savings Banks in the different States were connected with the Postal Departments of those States, and when those Departments were taken over by the Commonwealth, it should naturally have followed, as the most economical and best thing to do. that, the Savings Bank branches should have been taken over at the same time. General banking and savings banking by the Commonwealth Bank had many opponents amongst the supporters of the Government, who did all they possibly could to defeat it. Not being able to do so in this Parliament, they went outside and influenced their friends in the State Parliaments to do as they did. That is why the Treasurer, the Prime Minister, and the Premiers of the different States, with their henchmen, are prepared now to do what should have been done long ago. If they had any sympathy with the best interests of the people, and loyalty to the Constitution, they would long ago have seen that the State Governments did their business through the general branch of the Commonwealth Bank. They have shown their opposition to the establishment of that institution by refraining from doing so. </para>

                        <para>- I have already stated that when the Commonwealth Bank was established, and the Commonwealth Savings Bank branch agreed upon, a number of the Savings Banks in the different States were not State institutions at all. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> knows that. I have given instances of it. It was only when the Commonwealth Government did their duty that those opposed to the Commonwealth taking over banking of any kind roused themselves. What did they do? In Victoria the State Government increased the interest paid by the State Savings Bank, and increased the salaries of the officers. Those officers and th&#169; general public of the State have to thank the last Commonwealth Government, and not the State Government of Victoria, for anything they have gained in that &#34;way. </para>

                        <para>- Of course they did, and they gave the Savings Bank there the guarantee of the State which it never had before. Previously that institution was an outside affair, and all the control the Government had in connexion with it was the appointment of a certain number of its directors. The people of South Australia had no Government guarantee for their deposits in that bank. The late Commonwealth Government did everything they possibly could to give the States a fair deal in this matter. At the very inauguration of the Commonwealth Bank the State Governments were offered, if they were prepared to come in and assist the Commonwealth and do their duty under the Constitution, the use of all the money they already had control of. They were offered 75 per cent, of all new business in each State, and were offered an equal call with the Commonwealth institution of the remaining 25 per cent. I have already mentioned that the Commonwealth Government, in taking over the Post and Telegraph Department of the different States, had the best facilities for _ the carrying on of the Savings Bank business which had previously been conducted in the post offices of the different States. </para>

                        <para>- They could not help but admit it. Here we have six different institutions in the various States, with six boards of management. Those six institutions could be carried on with one head office in the Commonwealth. We have six boards of management spending money in erecting buildings and in other ways to carry on a business which could be more economically carried on by the one institution established by the Commonwealth. Every honorable senator knows that, and the Premiers themselves know it, but their jealousy of the greater powers of the Federation and their alliance with those who have been opposed to the conduct by the Commonwealth of both general and savings bank business makes it impossible for them to .see any good in the Commonwealth Bank. In summing up I say that it was the duty of the States to assist the Commonwealth by transacting all their business through the Commonwealth Bank, and it was in the interests of the people of the different States that they should have handed over to the Commonwealth - under conditions that we set down - the Savings Bank branches. Had they done that a saving would have been effected to the people, there would have been greater prosperity in Australia, and the Commonwealth Bank would have been a greater success than we can ever hope it will be under existing conditions. I am looking eagerly forward to the time when the people will wake up and realize what is best in their own interests - the time when they will condemn these State jealousies rather than commend them. </para>

But the Treasurer and the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth attended the Premiers&#39; Conference and said, &#34;Well, gentlemen, we are in a quandary. We do not know what to do. There are several engineers and railway managers in Australia wrangling about what the uniform gauge ought to be. We have not the ability to decide the question, and we have not the courage to ratify what has already been done. What shall we do, what shall we do?&#34; Do not honorable senators recollect that  some years ago the battle of the gauges was fought in this Parliament? </para>

                        <para>- The Opposition are prepared to deal with that. A statement was made in connexion with it some years ago. Honorable senators know that the battle of the gauges was fought here and that the Commonwealth is at present constructing 1,063 miles of railway on the 4-ft. 8&#189;-in. gauge. They also know that we have a guarantee from Western Australia that the State will build another 400 miles of railway on the same gauge. The Premiers&#39; Conference was not competent to deal with this matter. Its members said to the Treasurer and the Prime Minister, &#34; We can only accept your recommendation. What is it?&#34; Thereupon the Treasurer replied, &#34;Well, gentlemen, I think the best thing we can do is to refer it to the Inter-State Commission.&#34; Neither the Government nor the State Premiers felt themselves competent to deal with it. </para>

Their one idea is to push them on to &#34; father.&#34; To my mind, the question of the railway gauge to be adopted by the Commonwealth was settled long ago, and I cannot understand this particular paragraph in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech. When one looks at it, ono does not know whether it is the uniform gauge, or the financial aspect of the matter which is to bo referred to the Inter-State Commission. Then I would ask, &#34;What qualifications have the InterState Commission for investigating the question of a uniform railway gauge?&#34; With the exception of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swinburne,</inline> I do not know that any of the other members of that body possess engineering knowledge, and even his knowledge is of a limited character. Although the Commonwealth has decided to adopt a 4-ft. 8&#189;-in.  gauge,  the Government are referring this question to a body of men who know very little about it. So far as this conversion of the different States lines to a uniform gauge are concerned, the Government ought to have a policy of their own. It should not be necessary for them to consult the Premiers&#39; Conference, or the Inter-State Commission, or even the Judges of the High Court. They ought to have a policy of their own, and they ought to come boldly forward with that policy. In paragraph  12  of the Governor-General&#39;s Speech, we are informed that - </para>

Then we are told that the Government intend to do great things in connexion with our navigable rivers - the Murray and the Darling. They had not a policy even on that matter, financial or otherwise, but they exclaimed, &#34; For God&#39;s sake, let us get out of the difficulty. Let us pass this question on.&#34; So they passed it on to the Inter-State Commission, which has more work before it than it will be able to do in a thousand years- </para>

Everything else has been referred to that body. The Inter-State Commission is to carry on the government of Australia. Then the Government also approached the Premiers&#39; Conference on the question of immigration. They went there and said, &#34; There is a great outcry in the press in regard to immigration, and the Labour fellows are complaining that we are flooding the country with immigrants. What are we to do ? Can we do in co-operation with the States anything which will relieve the Commonwealth Executive of blame? Do, for God&#39;s sake, tell us, so that we may get out of all our difficulties.&#34; Then they made certain suggestions with a view to the selection of suitable immigrants. They are going to get suitable immigrants to come out here, and the Commonwealth is to assist to bear the expense. It is a very peculiar thing that immigrants are corning out. They are being brought out by the States. </para>

There is a Government in the Commonwealth, and there are Governments in many of the States, that take very little interest in the people when they come here. They have been unable to get able-bodied men and women to come, and <inline font-style="italic">now</inline> they are bringing out boys and youths. Any one going about the streets of Melbourne this morning could see batches of these immigrants. Although I can see very badly, I saw about five youths in one group, seven in another, and three or four in another. I saw batches of young immigrants walking about the streets of this city with haggard faces, wondering where they were going to get employment. These were youths in point of years, but men in point of physical ability. It is the same old story: &#34;We will bring boys and youths out here, every one of them being able to do a man&#39;s work. We will give a boy or a youth 10s. a week, and as soon as he becomes a man he will get the sack, and we will get more out.&#34; Is that the kind of policy which the present Government, in conjunction with the Premiers&#39; Conference, are prepared to advocate for Australia? The immigration policy of the Labour party is to make the Australian conditions so satisfactory that men here will write to their friends in the older land, and say to them, &#34;Come out here, where you can get a better living than at home.&#34; That is the immigration policy which we think is justifiable, so far as Australia is concerned. But what a miserable thing it is to bring out boys able to do a man&#39;s work, to give them a boy&#39;s wage, and when they want a man&#39;s wage to get out more boys ! I ask the Minister if that is their immigration policy, and if it is then I am ashamed of the Government, the Premiers&#39; Conference, and the whole lot of them. </para>

                <para>In the opening Speech there is a paragraph in reference to combines. I do not know whether the matter was considered at the Premiers&#39; Conference or not, but it looks as though it was. We are told that legislation is to be introduced to control combines. For the last five or sis. years our opponents have been declaring that there was nothing of the kind in this country. If that is so, what is the use of their introducing legislation to control combines ? </para>

                        <para>- Yes; the Attorney General is a sensible man, only his astuteness is smothered up by the stupidity of other men. We find that even the present Government are prepared to rush legislation in connexion with trusts and combines. Even the newspaper that supports them is to-day declaring that in Australia there is a dangerous trust or combine, although in a contemporary yesterday there was an article written by an ex-member of the Senate declaring that it was a mere Labour party cry. I want to know what the opinion of the Government is. Do they believe in what was stated long ago by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> H. Irvine and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn?</inline> Do they believe in what Was stated yesterday in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> by ex-Senator Chataway, or do they believe in what was stated in the <inline font-style="italic">Age?</inline> Do they believe that there is a combine in Australia, and that the same description of combine has fleeced, not only the consumer, but the producer in the United States and other States on the American continent? The combine has carried on the same practices there, and if they get an opportunity they can do so here. I Want to know the policy of the Government. A Bill is to be introduced. </para>

A glance at the notice-paper will satisfy anybody that the proposals deal with an amendment of the Constitution, and not with any legislation which might be passed under the Constitution as it now exists. But even if it could be held that the honorable senator was anticipating the discussion on the proposals I would not rule him out of order, because it is one of the best-known practices of Parliament that the debate on the Address-in-Reply gives to every honorable senator an opportunity in his speech to range over any legislative and administrative matters which may be properly considered in Parliament at all. </para>

                        <para>- I am sure, sir, that your ruling will be assented to by every member of the Senate; it has been the practice in the past, and I believe it to be a common-sense rule. I was discussing paragraph 11 in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech which relates to combines, and asking the members of the Government to say whether their proposed legislation is to take the form of an amendment of the Commerce Act or an amendment of the Australian Industries Preservation Act; in fact, to tell us what form it is likely to take. Since the inception of this Parliament the members of the Labour party have always supported legislation of this description. They have always supported a Government who were prepared to bring in legislation for the protection of the people of Australia. But at the same time they declared that such legislation was no remedy for the evil of trusts or combines, and that the only effective way of dealing with them when they became destructive was by nationalization. The States have the power to carry that out, whereas the Commonwealth has not. The members of the present Government go to the State Conference and say, &#34;Are you able to do it?&#34; and the members of the Conference answer, &#34; No. Even if we are, we have not the inclination. It is a matter to be dealt with by the Commonwealth Parliament.&#34; Consequently the Government are thrown on their own resources at once. A great deal of misrepresentation has been indulged in as regards the members of the Opposition. It has been stated repeatedly that we are opposed to every kind of combination or trust or amalgamation of business. We are opposed to them when they become injurious to the people of the Commonwealth, but not until then, and then we are prepared to deal with them, and always have been, if we can get the power. You, sir, know that the members of this party have always declared that the great American trusts, the great British trust, the great trusts of every description which have become destructive in the countries where they operate are the forerunners of the very policy of the Labour party, and that is to bring under Government control large industries that are  likely  to be made monopolies either by individuals or by trusts or monopolies. That has always been our policy. We have never declared that every trust or combine is a menace to, or will rob, the people. </para>

                        <para>- I thought the honorable senator would mention that question. He is always &#34; in the smoke.&#34; The Tobacco Trust has received no more consideration, so far as its destructive character is concerned, than has any other trust in Australia. No trust that becomes a menace to the best interests of the community will receive any quarter from this party. </para>

                        <para>- An inquiry was made long ago and a case established. The honorable senator is so young in politics that he might be regarded as one of the &#34;Babes in the Wood.&#34; He knows that a Commission sat, and that members of this party were on that Commission. He knows what evidence was taken and what has been done up to the present, but he also knows that we had no power to deal effectively with the trust at that time. Thirteen years ago the Tobacco Trust was in course of formation and was treating its employes scandalously. A Royal Commission was appointed to inquire into the matter, and immediately the Commonwealth obtained control of Customs and Excise, the Tobacco Monopoly began to wake up. It built commodious and convenient places for its employes and gave them the very best wages. By so doing it silenced one section of the community. Its employes are not calling . out now because they are well treated. </para>

                        <para>- When did we ever have the opportunity of doing anything? I am stating the case as it actually is. Although the Tobacco Monopoly may be charging the honorable senator more for his smoke than it ought to, still it is paying its employes decent wages, employing them fairly constantly, and giving them good conditions. Consequently they are not making a noise. It is for the general public, who are suffering from the monopoly, to kick up a row. Even if they did the honorable senator would not help them, but we would. However, it does not matter what the honorable senator does. These reforms will come as surely as the seasons, in spite of the Government and its supporters. The only effective way of dealing with a monopoly, trust, or combine that is dangerous to the people is for the Government to take it over and work it in the interests of the whole community. </para>

                <para>I see we have now got away from the Premiers&#39; Conference in the Speech, because I come now to a reference to the Tariff, which has been referred to the Inter-State Commission. Apparently when the Government have not got the Premiers&#39; Conference to help them, they fall back on the Inter-State Commission. That body will do everything, and the Premiers&#39; Conference will do the rest. Those two bodies are the rearguard and vanguard of the Commonwealth Government. I see by this paragraph with regard to the Tariff, chat the Government hope that something will be done. They are always hoping. The Conservative party have always been hoping for the last fifty years that things will remain as they are. That is their condition at the present time, and their hope for the future. </para>

                        <para>- It is very difficult to get rid of weeds that have been established for generations. They have been declared by different Parliaments to be noxious, but they still grow  up  in quiet corners where the hoe and the scarifier cannot reach them. The Tariff then is to be considered by the Inter-State Commission, and it is hoped that something will be evolved to the advantage of the Government. There is a great deal more to that effect, but nothing real or tangible. There is no indication that in the near future the Government will do anything to protect Australian industries against unfair competition from other parts of the world. </para>

                        <para>- I did not like to say that, for fear of offending somebody. I will merely put it that the honorable senator knows more about the subject than I do, and that ought to satisfy all my <inline font-style="italic">confreres,</inline> because I know a little about everything, and not much about anything. The Government propose to bring forward great schemes in regard to the Northern Territory - a subject which they cannot refer to the Inter-State Commission. They say they have completed the survey from Pine Creek to the Katherine River. Why, it was the last Government that passed the Act for that purpose, and put the work under way. The present Government have only carried on our policy. The most important step that they appear to have taken in connexion with the .Northern Territory is  the  discharge of certain officers appointed by us. There is no partiality or preference about the present Government towards anybody to whom the last Government gave a show. If they want, officers, they want them to be of the right colour, the right kidney, and the right opinion; and, consequently, they are prepared to cast off any officer whom they did not appoint themselves, or who, by any stretch pf imagination, may be thought to hold opinions which do not exactly coincide with their own. That is what they have done in the Northern Territory; and yet they talk about favoritism. There has also been a kind of survey of a line from Oodnadatta to the Katherine, and to the Queensland border. We are also told that something is to he done in the way of carrying out the recommendations of the Commission appointed by the last Government to inquire into Northern Territory matters; but as, apparently, the Government have no legislative measures to bring before Parliament in connexion with the Territory, we must, I suppose, let the subject pass for the present. I come now to the subject of the transcontinental railway, which, we are told, is progressing. It is progressing because it got a good start. It was started on right lines by our Government; but now matters are becoming confused. When the present Government and their supporters were before the country, they were viciously opposed to anything in the shape of day labour. It was the policy of the late Government to carry on all their work by day labour, if possible, although, incidentally, they had to let contracts, as must always be the case. The present Government, however, told the people that the day-labour system was a most extravagant way of doing work. They said, &#34; &#34;We do not believe in day labour. We would rather be robbed by the contractor than by the working man. The contractor is able to get more work out of the worker than we can, and, consequently, the work can be done cheaper.&#34; They have already made a commencement in that direction by letting a contract at the Port Augusta end of the transcontinental line to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline></para>

                <para class="block">Smith. I am sure that no one on this side of the chamber has any animosity towards that gentleman. He is a contractor, and, like all the other contractors that I have ever known, he is prepared to take advantage of any individual or Government when the opportunity occurs. That has always been the creed of the contractor. I have not risen this afternoon to blame the officers of the Commonwealth Railway Department for anything that has been done regarding the transcontinental railway. I am here to condemn the Government for shielding themselves behind their officers, and endeavouring to make the people believe that they were Simon Pures led into difficulties without their knowledge. It is the duty of every member of a Government to be on his guard to act in the best interests of the people. There are peculiarities in connexion with this matter. Members of Parliament and the public have heard a great deal about it. I do not intend to go into all the details. I am going to confine myself to the peculiarities which are always the most interesting feature of any- matter. In the correspondence presented to Parliament it is stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> said that he had sent experienced men over to South Australia to examine the works and, presumably, to take contracts. &#34; Experienced men.&#34; According to the information that was furnished to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> - and I was there at the time - the only person sent over there was a man who, in a telegram from Captain Saunders to the Government, was called &#34; Fauldingham.&#34; I am dealing with the peculiarities of this matter, and I say there was no such man ever sent to South Australia as a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Fauldingham.  1 do not know whether there was a mistake made by a telegraph operator or anybody else, but as soon as I heard the name &#34;Fauldingham &#34; I said, &#34; There is something fishy about this.&#34; I know most of those connected with railway construction, and I know of no&#39; one in the business named Fauldingham. But I did know a contractor in Melbourne at one time named Falkingham, and I knew that he had a number of sons. I knew also that statements had been made in another place respecting the capacity, ability, honesty, and decency of a certain engineer, and that one of the sons of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Falkingham</inline> wrote to that engineer for a job. </para>
                <para class="block">The engineer knew him too well, and refused to give him the job. It appears to me very peculiar that the individual who gave condemnatory evidence concerning that engineer before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Hodges, and who applied for a job and was refused employment, should be the only individual sent over by the authority of the present Government to South Australia to look at the works. One of the Falkinghanna  was sent over there. I am not usually suspicious, but it looks peculiar and as if there was a conspiracy somewhere, and that those connected with the conspiracy were the Government, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane,</inline> and Falkingham.  I think that an explanation of some kind should be given of this peculiarity. I know that Senators Gardiner and Rae have been over in South Australia, and have seen the country where this contract has been let. I have been there myself. I was over this country fifteen or sixteen years ago, and I am satisfied that Senators Gardiner and Rae will agree with me when I say that rising on that tableland the character of the country is such that there are only a few boulders on the top of the soil, none of which you could not kick out with your foot. A peculiarity of this contract is that in country like that the contractor is to receive 4s. 6d. a yard for cuttings, a.nd when he deposits the spoil 1½- chains from the mouth of a cutting he is to get an additional 2s. 6d. a yard, or 7s. a yard in all. I have worked on various railways, and probably there are other members of the Senate who have done the same. I have seen  cuttings of this description carried out. There is no man who has had any experience of construction work on a railway who would not be prepared to do that work for two-thirds of the money that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith is getting for it. </para>

After all, it is only ordinary muck shifting. So far as side drains are concerned, they are usually 4 ft. 6 in. wide at the top, 18 inches deep, and 1 foot wide at. the bottom. I have carried out miles of this work myself at 4s. 6d. a chain, when the spoil was just thrown out, and 6s. a chain where it was wheeled into a bank formation. There are 9 yards and 1 foot in each chain, and that price represents 6d. per yard for throwing the stuff out, and 8d. a yard for wheeling it into the formation. </para>

Yet here we have the Government paying 7s. a yard for some of these embankments. That will give the public some idea of the preference which the present Government are prepared to give to some people. I am sure they would never be willing to give any unionist in Australia so soft a thing as they have given to one of their own kidney at the present time. </para>

                        <para>- They are only giving Timms, for the much more difficult work of sinking a tank, 2s. 7d. a yard, and he considers it a very good price. I wish now to refer to a statement appearing in the newspapers as coming from the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs. He said he got a statement from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell,</inline> the Engineer-in-Chief of Commonwealth&#34; Railways, showing that, in Queensland, bridges, side drains, and side cuttings are always carried out by piecework. The Minister assumed from that that the day-labour principle was not adopted in connexion with such work. I have worked under contractors, and on the day-labour principle. I have worked for Chapman, for Fry Brothers, contractors, and others. I have done side cuttings, side drains, and such work for the prices I have mentioned. I worked for the South Australian Government on the railway from Hergott to Oodnadatta, and I carried out contracts, sub-contracts, piece-work, or whatever honorable senators choose to call it, on that day-labour job. I desire that honorable senators who do not understand work of that kind should have some idea of what it really is. The work of constructing side drains can be done very rapidly, and only a man or two are required for a mile of such work. It is not necessary to employ a ganger, either on a day-labour job, or a contract job, to look over men who are doing that kind of work. In carrying out such works, day labour is the most advantageous method to adopt, whether for the contractor, the Government, or the men employed. So that there is really nothing in the statement drawn from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell</inline> by the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs, I could say a great deal more in connexion with the peculiarities of the contract that has been let by the present Government, but I have no desire to unduly occupy the time of honorable senators. </para>

                <para>I said that I would leave till the last what appears to me to be the most debatable portion of the Governor-General&#39;s Speech. That is contained in paragraphs 3 and 4, referring to the test Bills. I have not very much to say, even upon them, although a good deal may be heard about them before this debate is concluded. I should like to say that, whoever has been the chief adviser of the Government in carrying out, attempting to carry out, or pretending to carry out a policy of this description, fie has not been their best friend, or the best friend of the people of Australia. I am not going into the merits or demerits  of  preference to unionists. I have plenty of material to enable me to do so, but that is not my present intention. I intend to speak only of these Bills as test  Bills  They are measures of less consequence to the people of Australia than would be the simplest piece of legislation that could be introduced by any Government. </para>

                        <para>--Even the new postage stamp is of more importance than are these two measures. Yet those measures are to be used for the purpose of wasting the time of this Parliament for years. Let us suppose that the same rate befalls them in this Chamber as befell them on a previous occasion. Let us further suppose that the Governor-General is appealed to, and that he grants a double dissolution. What will happen ? Parliament will have to meet again, and those Bills will again have to be passed, by the other Chamber; they will then be transmitted to the Senate, whence, after they have been dealt with, they will be returned to the House of Representatives. If the disagreement continues, the Governor-General may then cause members of the two branches of the Parliament to sit together, and the debate upon the Bills may proceed for an indefinite period before a vote is taken upon them. So that the best interests of the Commonwealth are to be sacrificed for a party issue of this description. If any Governor-General were so oblivious to the welfare of the people of this country as to countenance the wasting of two or three years of the time of this Parliament in wrangling over a party matter of that description my opinion of him would be of a very indifferent character. But no matter what may happen, honorable senators upon this side of the chamber are prepared for any contingency. They always have been. An appeal to the people has no terrors for them. But I warn the Government of the delay that is bound to follow the adoption of the policy which they have put before the people of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I did not desire the honorable senator either to cry or laugh. In the first place, the Leader of the Opposition cast some reflection on the sincerity of the Government in their desire to remit big national issues to the nation itself. He seemed to suggest that we were not desirous of terminating the present position by an appeal to the people. Having impugned the sincerity of our professed desire to place matters in the hands of the electors, he went on to refer to the scanty programme which had been submitted for this session. He laughed it to scorn, and said that we had nothing to put forward. Did it not occur to the honorable senator that, as we are desirous of getting to the people at as early a date as possible, it would not have been sincere on our part if we had come down here with an elongated programme of work for the current session. The reason that the programme is scanty is because we do not propose to invite this Parliament to undertake a lengthy programme of business until the electors have had an opportunity of speaking. </para>

Not only by its acts, but by the words of honorable senators, this branch of the Legislature clearly indicated that the particular measures which formed the policy of the Government would not be allowed to go through. </para>

I come now to the next matter to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> referred, namely, the Premiers&#39; Conference. It seems to me that he either misunderstood the nature of that Conference, or that he wished us to take up a blustering, brow-beating attitude towards the Premiers of the States. He said that it was degrading that the Commonwealth Government should have gone to the Premiers&#39; Conference for a policy. There was absolutely no justification for such a statement. I challenge anybody to show, from anything which happened at that Conference, that the Government have drawn any inspiration from that body so far as their policy is concerned. </para>

                        <para>- We will see. I do not wish to speak harshly to my honorable friend, the Leader of the Opposition, but he cannot have given this matter serious consideration, otherwise he would not have made the statement which he did. The only matters which were discussed at that Conference were matters concerning which this Government had a policy. The purpose of the Conference, so far as Commonwealth Ministers were concerned, was to ascertain whether it was possible to carry out the working details necessary to give effect to that policy. </para>

                        <para>- I am now dealing with the matters which were dealt with at the Premiers&#39; Conference. I say that the Governor-General&#39;s Speech gives a clear indication of the policy of the Government in regard to the matters which were discussed at that Conference. Some honorable senators speak as if the Premiers&#39; Conference had no right to meet. That these gentlemen, the representatives of the people of the different States, should confer together, and should also consult Ministers of the Commonwealth on matters in which State and Federal interests meet, and sometimes overlap, is, in their eyes, a grievous wrong. For instance, the Leader of the Opposition spoke of a uniform railway gauge. Can anybody say it is wrong that the State and Commonwealth Governments should confer upon that matter? He affirmed that the Ministry had no policy in regard to the gauge question, and he wanted us to take up a browbeating, blustering, bullying attitude towards the Premiers. He declared that the late Government had adopted the 4-ft. 8-i-in. gauge. That is perfectly true; but I would ask, &#34; How much further are we towards securing a uniform gauge because of anything that they did?&#34; As the result of some information which they obtained, they decided that a 4-ft. 8-^-in. gauge was a desirable one for Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; and they had no more justification for meeting and for making recommendations than had the State Premiers. The late Government decided to adopt the 4-ft. 8-J-in. gauge on the transcontinental railway line from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta.  But how has that decision helped towards the unifying of the railway gauges throughout Australia? We can pass here to-day, and in the other branch of the Legislature to-morrow, a resolution declaring that we will have a uniform railway gauge of 4 ft. %\ in.&#34; for the railways of Australia; but it will not help the matter forward by a single inch. </para>

He is satisfied that on the railway matter I am perfectly sound, which, of course, disposes of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor, Senator Rae,</inline> and other honorable friends opposite, but he still thinks that he has caught me in some other direction. Just at present 1 do not wish to enter into a constitutional argument with my honorable friend.

                        <para>- There would be a very strong objection to the unifying of the gauges. Take the railway gauge of my own State. You propose to alter that gauge, which will take a considerable time. There will be a very strong objection on the part of people living on spur lines to the change of gauge that will be necessary until you have altered the whole system of the State. There are more than financial difficulties to be faced. There is, first of all, a tremendous engineering undertaking as to how to bring about the change with as little&#34; inconvenience as possible to the people concerned. Then comes the financial problem. You can adopt a gauge. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> says that his bold, daring Government did adopt a gauge. They did, but they did not say anything about how they were going to get that gauge established. There are big financial problems, not to be met by the mere easy suggestion that the Commonwealth should find the whole of the money.&#39; Now, it would not be fair if the Commonwealth did that. If it were to turn round and take the financial responsibility of altering the lines in New South Wales to another gauge, the effect of , that would be obvious. </para>

                        <para>- There would be a very strong objection on my part to the Commonwealth finding the whole of the money. It is a question as to how much the Commonwealth shall find, and how much we can reasonably ask the States to find, and in what proportions the States shall contribute. These are all problems which have to be threshed out somewhere. </para>

                        <para>- If there is, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> admits, a financial problem which concerns both the States and the Commonwealth, what possible harm is there in consulting the States ? Not only is there no harm in that proceeding, but it becomes absolutely essential that those who represent the States shall get face to face in conference to thresh out the thing. The more one looks into this matter, the more, if he wishes to get at the truth, he discovers that it is a many-sided problem. It is not to be disposed of by mere accusations of want of courage, by mere denunciations of the holding of a conference, or by anything of that kind. It is only going to be solved first of all by a very close business and professional examination of the points in issue, and by bringing together, to some harmonious conclusion, the various interests which are represented by, at any rate, five of the States on one side, and the Commonwealth on the other. There never will be, in my judgment, a unifying of the railway gauges of Australia until it is brought about as the result of the joint effort and the co-operation of these two forces. </para>

We are quite prepared to discuss the views, the terms, and conditions on which it shall be done, and the share of the responsibility which will be borne by each party, and to meet you in every possible way we can.&#34; That is a business-like attitude for a Government to take up. The first question was to find whether the States were willing to join us in doing the thing. It is of no good to go to a conference and say, &#34;Here we have a cut-and -dried thing; we propose to tear up the gauge in Victoria and put down a 4-ft. 8^-in. gauge.&#34; It is of no good to say to New South Wales, &#34;We are going to destroy your railway system, and to put another gauge down.&#34; All that we can say to a conference is, &#34;We believe that the time has come when we should take in hand the question of bringing about a uniform gauge for the railways of Australia. Having met together, and there being a general recognition of the advisability of having a uniform gauge, the next question to be considered is, are we to determine and thresh out the various points of conflicting interests?&#34; What the Government did recently was just what any other body of sensible men would have done. </para>

                        <para>- That did not unify a single yard of railway between Melbourne and Sydney. What my honorable friends did was to adopt a gauge of 4 ft. 8&#163; in., and to talk about it. The only practical step which has been taken by a Government is the very one which they are disposed to denounce here. If nothing else had been considered by the Premiers&#39; Conference, that question alone would have justified the upholding of it, because it was one of the matters which it was highly essential should be discussed. It brought the States to an agreement - one which they had never joined in before - as to the desirability of unifying the gauges.. There has never been any agreement on the matter except that sort of doctrinaire agreement which my honorable friends and I have joined in ou the platform. We now have an official agreement entered into by the properly constituted spokesmen of the several States, joining with the Commonwealth Government, and saying, &#34;This is desirable; we accept it as a desirable principle, and we will now set to work to thresh out the problems, so as to ascertain exactly what is the next step to take.&#34; </para>

He denounced us for going near the Pre.miers. Now there are certain matters with which you have to confer with the. States, unless you are prepared to ask the people of Australia to give you full power by an alteration of the Constitution to wipe the States out of existence. With regard to the rivers, it is of no use to talk about what you would or ought to do, because you have no power to act, nor can you, from your constitutional power, do what is desired unless you have the co-operation of the States as well as for financial reasons, and because they are the owners of the land. </para>

South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales have been quarrelling over this matter for years, and therefore we must throw up the project, and, accepting the counsels of despair, say that nothing can he done.&#34; Because my honorable friends opposite failed in the past, are we to assume that we shall fail all the time. What does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> want done? Nothing. Here are these magnificent water-ways, which every one admits constitute one of the finest, assets that Australia possesses, and, because of a want of common action between those who are interested, practically nothing has been done. What has happened recently is that three States have come to an agreement. One recognises quite well the tremendous financial responsibility which will be involved in carrying out the agreement. We also recognise that, owing to the changes of local politics, there is a difficulty in getting three States to arrive simultaneously at a common ideal. </para>

Now the Commonwealth comes along and says, &#34; Here is a big national duty, and a great national advantage, and we think it is within our competency - there is no legal obligation upon us - in the interests of the people of Australia, if we can, by associating ourselves with that movement, and sharing some of the financial consequences of it, to give it such a start that it cannot bc stopped.&#34; That means, first, a conference with the Premiers. Will honorable senators on the other side seriously contend that it is either unconstitutional or derogatory to Federal Ministers that, in these circumstances, having a cognate object in view, they should seek to confer with the States in the hope of attaining that object? </para>

                        <para>- I will say the same thing about my own State, where nothing practically has been done. When the present Government see an opportunity of joining with the States which are most directly concerned, and giving a good push forward to a distinctly big national undertaking, some fault is found because there is no mention in the Constitution of a meeting of State Premiers. The thing is too ridiculous for serious consideration. Another matter discussed at the Conference and concerning which we are told that we have no policy, waa that of banking. The Government have a policy on that question and put it before the people at the last election as plainly as any party could do. The candidates under the Liberal banner told the people that they were out to bring to an end the duplication of savings bank business. We always held - and if we wanted any justification for our attitude I could obtain it from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor&#39;s</inline> speech this afternoon - that there was no justification for setting up under Federal auspices a duplicate of the excellently managed Savings Banks already in existence in the States. </para>

                        <para>- The Constitution does not say that the Commonwealth is bound to establish a savings bank where there are already State Banks doing the work. No one disputes the legal authority, or the Commonwealth Bank would not be in existence, but there are dozens of things which the Constitution authorizes us to do which have never been touched yet. The question was whether it was an advantage to the people to exercise the Commonwealth banking power in the direction of duplicating machinery already in existence. </para>

                        <para>- My unqualified belief is that in dealing with Savings Banks what the honorable senator calls provincial, and which I prefer to call State, control is infinitely ahead of Federal control. Whether that is so or not, no one can deny that at the last election this party put forward its views very clearly and generally on that subject. We could not give effect to our policy in that matter without having a conference with the State Premiers. The question was one for mutual arrangement, if it was to be carried through at all. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friends failed to get the States&#39; business because they tried to bully and bluster them, and insulted them at every point in the negotiations. To give effect to the policy for which our party stood, it became necessary to confer with the State Premiers, and there was no way of meeting the State Ministers all together except at a Premiers&#39; Conference. At that Conference, whether the policy of the Government was right or wrong, it was agreed to fall in with our proposals.. It was not, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> would suggest, a case of the Federal Government going there to obtain inspiration for a policy. We submitted a policy, and the Conference fell in with it. </para>

Without saying whether our views on the question are sound or not, I can safely say that, as the result of that Conference, and the attendance of Federal Ministers thereat, there has been arrived at upon this particular subject an agreement which puts the Government party in a position to submit to Parliament a Bill to give the agreement legislative effect. </para>

The only measures mentioned in the Speech for submission during the session are those which arise from the agreement arrived at at the Premiers&#39; Conference, and cannot be delayed if faith is to be kept with the several States who made the agreement, and one other matter to which I shall refer later as being equally entitled from its urgency to be considered even before the anticipated election. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> said that we were going to refer the Murray waters question to the Inter-State Commission.

It was part of their business to look after the control of traffic on the river, so that there should be no. preference there, just as it is part of their business to see that there are no differential rates on the railways. But the InterState Commission have nothing to do with the question of whether the States and the Commonwealth shall share the financial responsibility of carrying out certain works for the conservation of water on our big Inter-State waterways. It was in this matter that an agreement was arrived at. The Government propose not to send the matter to the Inter-State Commission, but to introduce a Bill to give effect to the agreement. A number of honorable senators opposite have sufficient knowledge of the requirements of Australia to realize that any Government which brings into effect a scheme to conserve a large body of water in our main waterways will have done something of which Australia will be proud and justly thankful. </para>

                        <para>- The obligation is not constitutional. The Government would move in this matter, not for the purpose of spending money on any particular river, but because more than one State is concerned in these big waterways, and a great financial responsibility is involved. They recognise that the Commonwealth may reasonably take a hand in a large national undertaking of that kind from which .it is anticipated that unlimited advantages will flow. </para>

                        <para>- We are not dealing with a waterway that is confined to one State. That makes the matter entirely different. If the honorable senator has been around a camp fire on the Darling he will know the arguments that go on as to whether the water coming down belongs to New South Wales or Queensland. They would keep men out of their beds all night to argue that question, but I do not think such difficulties -arise in the case of the noble stream on which the City of Melbourne stands. </para>

                        <para>- No precedent is required for such a request. All these obligations will come along, and the Government of the day will have to take the responsibility of saying whether it will share them or not. In the case of the Murray waters, the Government thought it was a matter in which it might not only reasonably take part, but take a leading part, in order to stimulate the movement and push the scheme forward. One of the difficulties in the exercise of many of the powers conferred on the Commonwealth by the Constitution is that members of the Opposition invariably seem to think that any suggestion coming from a State is an insult to the Commonwealth. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> spoke about the Commonwealth grovelling to the States, and going on its knees to the States. </para>

I know that they are entirely mistaken, and I want <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> to take a little more lenient view in future of the State Governments when he hears them described in &#39;those terms. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> twitted the Government because of an announcement in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech that the InterState Commission is considering the Tariff. The honorable senator seems to find a great deal to amuse him in that. I am never more happy than when I see my honorable friend amused. I do not quite know whether his quarrel with the Government was because they have placed upon the Inter-State Commission the obligation of inquiring into Tariff matters. If it was, I may remind the honorable senator that the Government of which he was a member stood committed to practically the same thing. They also proposed at one time to refer the consideration of Tariff questions, if not to the Inter-State Commission, to a special Tariff Board created for the purpose. </para>

                        <para>- I know the frantic efforts which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> made to run up a higher Tariff. I used to sympathize with the honorable senator&#39;s painful efforts as a Free Trader to pile up Protectionist duties. I was about to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> once did me the honour to notice a public statement of mine. When I say that he did me the honour to notice it I mean by that that the honorable senator found fault with what I had to say. I had made the statement that the party then, unfortunately for the country, in opposition had decided to adopt some form of Tariff Board or tribunal such as the Inter-State Commission for the purpose of an inquiry into Tariff questions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> drew attention to that statement and said that the Liberal party had not a monopoly in that connexion, because, as a matter of fact, his party also was pledged to such a proposal, and he referred his audience to a statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> on the point. At that time it was generally understood and admitted that the Labour party were prepared to put the question of inquiring into the necessity for Tariff alterations before some tribunal of that character. What we have done is exactly on the same lines and carries out the same idea. </para>

                        <para>- On an occasion when I enjoyed with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> a very excellent lunch given by the Chamber of Manufactures in Sydney. I have been surprised to hear that any doubt should be thrown on my statement, because I know that members of the Labour party who could speak with authority expressed themselves in terms of approval of the idea of having an examination into Tariff questions, not by a political Commission, but by some permanent and non-political tribunal, with a view to framing a Tariff on the evidence so secured. What we have done in that regard will, 1 am sure, appeal to the common sense of the people of Australia. No one who has in this, or any other Parliament, gone through a Tariff session, can for a moment question the assertion I make that Parliament is the most impossible place in which to determine the details of a Tariff. </para>

All that we have done in the matter has been to set the Inter-State Commission at work to look into the details of the Tariff, and no one will question the capacity of that tribunal for the task. We are told that by the action the Government have taken they are going to tie the whole thing up. I may tell <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> that it is not going to tie up the Tariff for three years. </para>

                        <para>- I confess that there is one aspect in which it is very painful. I refer to the fact that honorable senators opposite have evidently laid themselves out to try to influence the public mind with the idea that there is something approaching corruption and something dishonorable in connexion with this contract, and yet they lack the courage to make a plain statement to that effect. Honorable senators heard yesterday the suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith, in consequence of his having received this contract, gave a substantial donation to the funds of the Liberal party. The honorable senator put this statement in the nature of an inquiry. </para>

All these things are said for the purpose of poisoning the minds of the public, and with the object of conveying by innuendo or suggestion that there has been a want of common honesty in dealing with public money on the part of the members of the present Government. </para>

Only one interpretation can be put upon the statements that have been made, and that is that it is intended to make a charge of corruption against the Government. </para>

                        <para>- When the sitting was suspended, in reply to an interjection, I was proceeding to deal with the question of whether the price paid under this contract was excessive or not. In considering that question, it is useless- as I think honorable senators will recognise - to indicate that certain prices have been paid for work in other parts of Australia in country which may or may not have been of the same character. It is idle to institute a comparison between things which are not comparable. </para>

It was impossible for any one listening to him to form any other conclusion than that the work was extremely easy. He affirmed that he knew most of the railways in New South Wales, and was familiar with the country through which they passed, and declared that he had not seen easier railway construction anywhere. That statement may carry some weight, seeing that it purports to be the opinion of a man who has seen for himself. But I wish to put against it the opinions of two other persons whose judgment is entitled to even greater weight than is that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline> Whether this Chamber elects to accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> as its authority or not, it must recollect that at the time this contract was entered into, the honorable senator&#39;s advice was not available.

                        <para>- I am prepared to accept responsibility for anything that the Government have done. But when I was interrupted I was not dealing with the question of responsibility at all. At the time this contract was let, there was certain information before the Minister. Every Minister is bound to get information before he arrives at a decision. To whom does he look for that information? He does not look to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> for it - he seeks it from the paid professional advisers of the Department. What do they say on this matter? I wish to put in sharp contrast to the opinion expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> yesterday the views of two officers of the Department - views which are more eloquent of the character of the country than is anything that I can say. In a report by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hobler,</inline> that officer describes the country as follows - The cuttings generally, so far as he has opened them up, which is to cutting 119, show that 103 and 104, though fair material on top, have hard cores of reefs of disjointed silicated sandstone, which is too hard to plough, awkward to bore, and bad shooting. </para>

He stated that the soil is so loose that when one walks over it, one sinks into it. Yet the opinion which I have just read is that of a responsible officer of the Department with some professional knowledge. </para>

                <para>The first two cuttings required blasting. Cuttings 103 and 104 containing hard cores of reef of disjointed silicated sandstone, which is awkward to bore and bad shooting. Cutting 113 pure sand, 114 hard material, consisting of silicated sandstone mixed with stiff white clay. A number of the cuttings being awkward to plough, the ploughs the contractor had not being heavy enough, the contractor was compelled to obtain heavier ploughs. The road for a distance of five miles, over which the contractor has had to cart his water, is heavy sand, necessitating him employing nearly as many live stock in carting water as the contractor had horses working in the cuttings. He was compelled to cart water in some instances from Bellamy&#39;s Well, at 87 miles to 100 miles that is, 13 miles. </para>

                        Smith, the well-known contractor, has been to Port Augusta and talked the matter over with Captain Saunders, and yesterday he came here to&#39; see me. He is just finishing a contract in the Eyre Peninsula, namely, the extension from Minippa  to Streaky Bay, for the South Australia Government, and he has a large quantity of plant, tools, men, and horses at his disposal. He submits an offer to do the work, and I wired his terms to Captain Saunders for his opinion.

It was quite evident that the track-laying gang were going to overtake those in the early portion of the line unless something was done. If the track-laying gang had overtaken those who were preparing the roadway, then the gang would have been thrown idle. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly not for what I call haste, but they did proceed there without looking far enough ahead. The position was that the matter had become urgent. The point we are now trying to clear up is not whose fault it was that these difficulties arose, but whether, .the difficulties having arisen, the proper steps were taken to get out of them. Irrespective of whose fault it was, it was urgent that the work should be pushed ahead. The urgency was the justification for what was done. It was upon that ground that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> recommended the acceptance of the tender. It is not for me to say at this juncture whether his advice was good or bad, but I would ask honorable senators in  fairness to put themselves in the position of the Minister. He is told that matters are coming to a deadlock - that a big gang of men will be thrown idle unless the work ahead of them can be expedited. The responsible officer then, supported by his subordinate officers, recommends to the Minister that the best way out of the difficulty is to make this arrangement with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith. The Minister is then in the position of having either to reject or accept the advice of his officers. I venture to say that whichever he had done this House would have found fault with it. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad of that interjection. We are told in this case that the Minister ought not to have accepted the advice of his officers, but should have assumed Ministerial responsibility and overridden them. I have a distinct recollection that when it was intimated that I, as Minister of Defence, was calling in other advice than departmental on the question of Naval Bases, I was told that the professional officers of the Department were on the spot, and that I ought to accept their advice or get rid of them. </para>

One cannot institute comparisons between localities far distant, but while we are dealing with the question of prices it would be interesting to mention the cost of making the line from Canberra to Queanbeyan, the figures for which have recently been made up. I do not put this forward as parallel work or similar work to that in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith is engaged, but every one will admit that the conditions at Canberra should be much easier than those on the edge of the desert of South Australia. They are nearer civilization, the water difficulty is absent, and there are other features reducing the cost in the Federal Capital as compared with the cuttings on the east-west railway. This report, recently obtained from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bell,</inline> comes at a rather opportune time, although of course it is quite, independent of the controversy regarding the transcontinental line : - </para>

We heard from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> yesterday a statement that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith has but a very small plant. I think the honorable senator gave him credit for having 150 horses, camels to the value of &#163;1,300, a few small scoops, and odds and ends. I have here a statement on the subject of the plant, which I am given to understand is not a hearsay statement at all, but an official valuation of the plant on the work at present, and the total valuation is given at &#163;11,742. </para>

                        <para>- There are three down in this statement at a valuation of &#163;1,050. From my knowledge, unless values have recently changed very much, &#163;350 is not an unreasonable price for a camel team. There are 160 horses, at &#163;30 apiece. Any one who knows anything of the value of horses, or of the type used by railway contractors, will admit that &#163;30 is not an excessive price for such horses. There is another item of forty scoops at &#163;4 apiece. I do not think that any one will quarrel with that valuation, if it refers to the kind of scoop that I have in mind. </para>

                        <para>- The items in this statement in respect to which I can form an independent judgment appear to me to be quite reasonable. For instance, the statement includes three waggons at &#163;50 a-piece. I do not regard that as anything like an excessive price. I have paid a much heavier price for a secondhand waggon of the ordinary type that knocks about in the back country. I mention these things, not as conclusive, but as indicative of the fact that the undertaking to which. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith has committed himself is not the light and easy picnic that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> tried to persuade the Senate it is, but a very serious contract, the many difficulties of which justify the prices he is being paid. </para>

                        <para>- By no means. But I would remind the honorable senator that whatever plant is used, apart from the question of wear and tear, there is always the possibility in such a part of the country of inability to dispose of it to advantage at the close of the contract. It is argued by my honorable friends opposite that the Government, in letting a contract, must bear some portion of the cost of the plant for that reason; and that is one of their arguments against the contract system. When a man is called upon to provide a plant worth &#163;10,000 or &#163;11,000, he is entitled to something in respect of wear and tear and depreciation, and, possibly, also to something to compensate for the risk that he may be unable to dispose of it at the close of the contract for anything like its market value. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that limitation. Every Minister has to take the responsibility of accepting or rejecting the advice of his officers. When honorable senators say that a Minister must take the responsibility, and cannot shelter himself behind his officer, what does that mean? Every time a Minister indorses a recommendation of his officers, he accepts responsibility, if he is guided by it. Where an officer in a Department is in a proper position to advise the Minister, it is the duty of the Minister to accept the advice or the responsibility of overriding it. I venture to say that Ministers will be found to get into trouble more often for overriding and departing from the advice of their officers than for following it. I have been called to task for having passed over the advice of the officers of my Department. Half the miseries of my life to-day arise from the fact that I occasionally find myself differing from my officers. I think that a Minister accepts as much responsibility in differing from the recommendations of his officers as in adopting them. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable senators cannot say that in this case, because, if they do, instead of talking about the Teesdale Smith contract and Ministerial responsibility in connexion with it, they should have been talking of the advantages of day labour over contract labour. If honorable senators, in the privacy of their own chambers, and communing with their own hearts, will put themselves in the position of a Minister, the position in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly</inline> was, they will admit that if they were given the advice of an officer paid a good salary, and occupying one of the most important positions in the Public Service of Australia; with behind him a reputation of many years standing as a competent officer, ninety-nine men out of a hundred- </para>

                        <para>- What was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly</inline> not smart enough to do? I say that there was before him the advice of an officer whose business it was to give advice. I admit at once that nothing that has been said here, or elsewhere, or that could have been said in the course of the debate on this matter, in criticism of my colleague, would have been a bit too strong if he had done what he has done against the advice of his officers.  His  position then would have been very different from what it is to-day. In this case, a responsible officer of the Department puts certain information before the Minister. It is immaterial, for the purpose of my argument, whether the information was right or wrong, since the Minister had a right to assume that it was correct information. </para>

                <para>I pass from this matter to the final portion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor&#39;s</inline> address, in which -he dealt with the test Bills. They seem to furnish some cause for merriment for the honorable senator. He spoke of these Bills as quite insignificant little affairs, in respect of which no Government would be justified in what he calls delaying the business of the country. The honorable senator pointed out that, to get these test measures through and arrive at a final solution of the difference of opinion between the two Chambers may take not only months, but years, and he suggested that, during all that time, the business of the country would be tie&#39;d up. That would be a very serious thing if that were all that could be said on the subject. But is the business of the country going to be tied up as the honorable senator suggests ? If nothing were said about the test Bills, is not the business of the country tied up already by the difference of opinion between this Chamber and the other ? One must not judge the difference of opinion between the Government and the Senate by particular Bills that have been introduced. We have already had a warning from the  President  of the Senate that, if the present Government dare to introduce into .this Chamber Bills that are distasteful to the Opposition, they will be &#34;booted out.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- The one thing we are aiming at is, at the earliest possible moment, to ask the people of this country to decide into the hands of which political party they will intrust their political destinies. I do not pretend to disguise the fact that the issues involved are much bigger than are the two test measures. But the only way in which those issues can be decided is by the submission of test Bills. At the bottom of all government is finance, and, from the experience of last session, when a Loan Bill made its appearance in this Chamber, it is clear that a very wide difference of opinion exists between the two political parties here regarding financial methods. </para>

But if there is one thing over which a Government must have control it is that of finance. No Ministry can continue in office unless they have control of the financial affairs under their jurisdiction. This Chamber gave the Government an intimation last session that it would not allow them to deal with financial questions in the way that they wished. </para>

This is a matter we can discuss as constitutional students. We have adopted a political system which requires that the Government of the day shall be responsible only to one House. It is unthinkable that a Ministry could be formed in that House if they were only supported there by a minority. Therefore, small though our majority may be elsewhere, it represents the Government of this country. </para>

                        <para>- They had not. On the occasion when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGowen</inline> resigned, they had not a majority. Not only had the Government no majority, but they took extreme means to create one. Let me remind my honorable friends, in all seriousness - when they urge that the present Government ought not to have taken office - that we took office because the Fisher Government resigned and advised the Governor-General to send for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook.</inline> Therefore, I say that the only proper and constitutional thing which could be done was done. An honorable senator asks if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> could not have declined to accept office. The Governor-General could certainly have declined to accept the advice tendered by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher:</inline> but what would have happened then <inline font-style="italic">t</inline></para>

                        <para>- It depends upon how the Chamber in which there is a. majority against the Government is elected. I acknowledge, with a feeling of pride, that there is no other elective upper Chamber which is at all parallel to the Senate. Therefore, to some extent, we are like the heathen - a law unto ourselves. Replying to the question of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> I wish to say that I have known Governments to hold office in one House although a very strong opposition to them existed in the other. I believe that state of things has occurred in Victoria. </para>

A moment or two ago I was asked if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> could not have declined to accept office. But if it were not a proper thing for him to form a Government, with a majority of one behind him in the other Chamber, would it be a decent thing for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> who is in a minority, to form a Government? </para>

I repeat that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> resigned, and that the only course open to the Liberal party was to form a Government. It is not our fault that our majority is so small. Honorable senators opposite cannot blame us for that. They cannot blame us because we are taking the only step open to us to make that majority a substantial one, and to give the electors an opportunity of solving a state of affairs for which we are not responsible, but for which the country is responsible, inasmuch as it expressed itself indefinitely on the political issue. </para>

                        <para>- The Constitution provides the only way in which we can solve the problem with which we are confronted. Nobody supposes that any member of Parliament is keenly anxious to face the people before the term for which he was elected expires, unless an absolute necessity for so doing arises. We always express a very burning desire to face the electors again, but every honorable senator knows that there are considerable disabilities attendant upon such an event quite apart from the result. No honorable senator is anxious to see the doors of this Parliament close in order that he may go upon an election tour. But the conviction has been forced upon the Ministry that the only thing which they can do, consistent with the preservation of their self-respect, is to solve this entirely unsatisfactory state of affairs at the earliest possible moment. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, undoubtedly he did and discussed it - a matter which we might discuss here if we were anxious to perfect our Constitution, but just now I am not concerned with that at all. The fact is that there is this difficulty existing. The Constitution points clearly and plainly to the only way in which the Government can solve the difficulty. It is not to be solved by the resignation of the present Government with a majority, because if that change were made you would have in office a Government with a minority. In my opinion the present Government with a majority had better be in charge of the affairs of the Commonwealth than a Government with a minority. </para>

                        <para>- No one proposes to dissolve the Senate on every occasion when it differs from the other House. I have already said that if the only things in dispute were the two matters covered bv the test Bills there would be no necessity for the heroic measures which are to be resorted to, but while they are the test measures to meet the requirements of the Constitution, the real fact from which there is no escape is that the two parties are fundamentally opposed, and it is not possible for the Government of the day to move ahead with its legislative proposal. I would venture an apology for having trespassed on the time of the Senate so much except that my honorable friends opposite are largely responsible for the infliction they have created. </para>

                        <para>- During his speech the Minister of Defence made reference to a statement which I am alleged to have made outside. I think that as  President  I have the same right to make a personal explanation as has any&#39; other member of the Senate. I have no objection, either inside or outside the Senate, to any criticism that any honorable senator may be pleased to make on anything I have said. I ask for no quarter in that direction; I expect none, and probably when it comes to my turn I will give none. When I took this position I gave up none of my rights, nor do I intend to do so, to fight outside this Chamber for the principles of the party in which I believe. While I am in the Chamber I hope to carry out its duties as fairly and as honestly as I can. </para>

                        <para>- The only reason why I got up to make this explanation was that if I must be criticised outside the Senate and inside for&#39; the statements I have made, I want it to be clearly understood what the statements are, so. that there shall be no misconception about them. The Minister of Defence, in speaking, said I had publicly stated that the Senate would &#34; boot out &#34; any of those measures which were distasteful to the Labour party. I did not say anything of the kind. What I did say was that if the Liberal party were in earnest in desiring a double dissolution, and if they really believed in their own policy, it was the easiest thing in the world for them to get a double dissolution, because they had always announced that they were utterly opposed to the great measures &#34;passed by the Labour party during the three years of the Fisher Administration. These included such measures a3 the Land Tax Act, the Commonwealth Bank Act, the Maternity Allowance Act, and several others. I said that if the Liberal party were in earnest in desiring to get a double dissolution, an easy way to get it, if they believed in their own policy, would be to come down with a measure repealing any one of these Acts, which that party had previously so strenuously opposed, and see how short a time it would take the Senate to &#34;boot&#34; the measure out, not once, but, if necessary, a dozen times. </para>
