The rifles are of more value than the amount of money they represent to us at present. There is an urgent need that proper .care should be exercised over all available rifles, and we have found by bitter experience that the only way to insure that is to make the rifle clubs responsible for the care of the rifles. </para>

There has been a considerable number of cases of delay, but in most of those that have been investigated it has been found that the soldier on leaving did not complete the form necessary for the payment to be made. In all cases I have asked those who find delay occurring either to wait on or write to the District Paymaster in the State in which they reside, and instructions have already been issued that the payments shall be expedited. </para>

                            <para>- No. My reply was that in most cases where nonpayment had occurred it was found that the soldier himself, although he had told his wife that he had made the necessary arrangements, had gone away without making them, and we invited the people concerned to call at the District Paymaster&#39;s office. When they did so the claims were looked into, and if the case was genuine we filled out the form ourselves in the absence of the soldier, and authorized the payment. As regards the cases mentioned by the honorable senator, the arrangement is that they can either call at or write to the District Paymaster&#39;s office. But we have found that in many cases they write to the member for the district or to myself direct, in some instances from as far away as Queensland. </para>

                        <para>. - The ostensible object of this Bill is one which must commend itself to any legislator who believes that a more satisfactory method than the strike should be adopted in the settlement of all industrial disputes. If I took it upon myself to say that the ultimate objective of the Government in introducing this measure goes a little farther than that, I should not be saying anything out of place. Incidentally, I may be permitted to refer to a statement made by a legal member of the Ministry in submitting the Bill for consideration in another place. He said - </para>

                    <para>I am profoundly convinced that nothing short of an amendment of the Constitution will do what is necessary. </para>
                    <para>To that statement I subscribe, with the exception of the last word &#34; necessary,&#34; for. many of us hold that the objective of the Labour party is to secure such an amendment of the Constitution as will confer unlimited jurisdiction upon the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. Now, whilst I am just as desirous as is anybody of securing industrial peace, I do not admit that it would be entirely satisfactory to attain that objective by giving complete jurisdiction to that tribunal. The same gentleman, in discussing this measure, said - </para>
                    <para>The points to be considered are the constitutionality of the proposal, and subject to that, whether it will work expeditiously and well. </para>
                    <para class="block">Beyond question those are the immediate points to be considered, and the sponsor of the Bill evidently entertains some doubt as to whether it will be held to be constitutional and watertight in all its provisions. In my opinion, the objective of the Labour party, and the consideration of whether the Arbitration Court will work expeditiously and well, are in direct conflict with each other. If we confer upon the Arbitration Court jurisdiction to interfere not only in Interstate, but also in Intra-State industrial disputes, its business will become so congested that it will be impossible for it to work expeditiously and well. Even at this hour of the. day, when Federation is fourteen or fifteen years old, it may not be out of place to review the conditions which were responsible for the recognition in our Constitution of the Federal principle. </para>

                            <para>- No, because these difficulties have arisen on account of a want of appreciation on the part of industrial organizations of what constitutes federalism,  and  because they have attempted to use the Federal Courts in the decision of causes which were not within the competency of such Courts. I need hardly remind honorable senators that Australia at one time had a unified system &#34;of government. That system, however, was found to be absolutely inconsonant with the ideals of the Australian people. Unification, therefore, broke down, and the different Colonies were called into being with all the powers inherent in sovereign States under the British Crown. Just as we occupied an unsatisfactory position under unification, so it was found that we had gone too far in conferring unlimited sovereignty upon the different sections of the Australian people. Almost immediately decentralization had been completed, a movement was inaugurated to create some central form of government which would exercise legislative functions of a truly national character. As far back as the fifties a movement was inaugurated in favour of the establishment of a Federation. Some politicians recognised the necessity for a Federal union, but very rarely were politicians and the people ii&#62; accord as to what was desirable. Consequently, the establishment of a central form of government was not consummated until after we had had thirty or forty years&#39; experience of government under a decentralized system. The movement for the consummation of Australian nationality to a certain extent remained in the hands of the politicians; of the day. Many of them deserve all the praise which will be accorded them by some historian, if not by us, but others amongst them acted as brakes upon the wheels for the consummation of Australian nationality. A golden mean was found. It was very soon discovered that the intention of the people was not to bring about a restoration of that condition of government from which they had escaped thirty or forty years before, but while preserving most of their self-governing functions for the various States, to constitute at the same time a central government which would deal with matters of wholly national and Australian import. To make a long story short, the Federation came into being. A Federal system of government was adopted by the people of Australia as, so to speak, a half-way house between the ideals of a unitarian system of government, favored by some, and the complete retention of the sovereign power of legislation by the different Colonies if Australian nation hood were not to be consummated. Altheugh in my humble way I did what I could to bring about the establishment of Australian nationality, and fought fairly hard for the adoption of the first Commonwealth Bill, and also for the Bill which ultimately became the National&#39; Constitution, I was not altogether satisfied with the latter measure as an ideal&#39; instrument of government. It is a very fine Constitution, and reflects great credit . upon the worthy men who drafted it, but I thought a more unified system than that which was adopted would have been better. After the experience of twelve or thirteen years of Federation, I am not now too sure that we did not confer too many functions of government upon the National Parliament, which is called upon to look after the affairs of one of the world&#39;s continents. I think now that it is possible that if we erred it was in the direction of being somewhat too generous in the bestowal of legislative functions upon the National Legislature, rather than in the direction of too greatly limiting its powers. Beyond all doubt, whatever its virtues or defects may be, Federalism is, in my opinion, a more satisfactory method for the government of our Australian communities than would bc a more highly unified or decentralized system. The instrument of government known as the Constitution is, of course, the intention of the people expressed in language. &#34;When human thought is expressed in language confusion at times necessarily arises as to the correct interpretation of the language in which it is expressed. There is always a border lino between expression and intention, and it is that debatable border line which is the cause of litigation in our ordinary Courts between citizen and citizen. It is because of the existence of this debatable ground of interpretation that we are at times in a condition of confusion as regards the point where State jurisdiction ceases and Federal jurisdiction begins. No matter how great may be our desire to secure industrial peace, it will scarcely be denied that, for reasons best known to those who direct the industrial organizations of Australia, there has been a very great desire on their part to ignore State tribunals, and to seek the settlement of industrial disputes by the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think so. I think the employers are more sensible. They are more conversant with the troubles attendant upon the establishment of industries, and more ready to recognise the virtues of decentralization in such matters. I think they would prefer that industrial disputes, with the exception of those of an Australia-wide character, be decided by the Courts of the State in which they arise. What did the framers of the Constitution intend? They intended that disputes confined within the boundaries of one State should be decided by the tribunals of that State. </para>

They clearly limited the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth industrial tribunal.

                            <para>- But there is no way by which its jurisdiction can be enlarged except by an amendment of the Constitution, to which the people of Australia must consent by a majority in the aggregate and by a majority of the States. That is a condition which must be kept in mind in any criticism t&#62;I the industrial position in Australia, so far as it is governed by Commonwealth legislation. My honorable friends opposite say that  they  require unification in regard to the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court over industrial disputes. They desire to confer upon the Commonwealth Courts unlimited jurisdiction in regard to industrial quarrels. That is the objective of many of them, but it is not the objective of a true Federalist. After an experience of thirteen or fourteen years, I have come to the conclusion that Federalism is the only system of government that can be satisfactorily operated in this Continent, in view of the fact that in the space of a century and a quarter we have in this country had an unsatisfactory experience of the unitary system of government. The real question is very often evaded. Those who favour conferring greater jurisdiction upon the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court say that it does not matter if an Inter-State dispute is manufactured, since the difficulty attendant upon an unsatisfactory industrial position is none the less real if the dispute is confined to one State. They claim, therefore, that the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court should have jurisdiction over all such disputes, and that access to that Court  should _ be made available to all who desire to bring their cases before it. I am not going to grant that at all. The law in regard to other matters does not grant that? </para>

If two parties in the married state desire to separate, and decide by collusion to bring their case before a Court of competent jurisdiction, it it within the province of the Court, should the collusion be discovered, to refuse to permit the parties to separate. Have not honorable senators at times heard of nonsuits in connexion with ordinary Courts?

                    <para class="block">Not at all. How many times do we hear of parties approaching an ordinary Court, and. a litigant, the absolute merit of whose case is not disputed at all, being declared to be out of Court on a nonsuit, simply because certain conditions which are considered essential by the Judge or magistrate have not been complied with ? The equity of the litigant&#39;s claim is not decided on at that moment, but he is nonsuited. Because certain parties to a dispute assumed to be of a Federal character have been nonsuited perforce the whole principle of Federalism in regard to conciliation and arbitration must be attacked. It is a most improper position. The most satisfactory industrial situation we can create will be one by virtue of which the Commonwealth Courts are enabled to clearly indicate to parties that their disputes are not of a Federal character, and not within the purview of the Court created under the Federal Constitution, but should be decided by State authorities, which are quite competent to act.. In other words, as collusion is not permissible under ordinary law in connexion with a matrimonial cause, so the framers of our Constitution clearly did not have in their minds any desire to have collusion made permissible in regard to bringing State industrial disputes before a Federal tribunal for settlement. The whole tendency of this Bill is to provide a free and easy approach to the Conciliation and Arbitration Court by any person who desires it, or any organization whose officials desire it, irrespective of whether the original cause of dispute is of a truly Federal character or not. I desire to see industrial peace. I desire to enlarge the function of the Arbitration Court if it is possible under the Constitution, but I shall not at any time by my humble vote assist in any great enlargement of any power of the Court if that power has not been conferred upon it by the Constitution. In other words, I will not assist to bring ordinary State disputes before the Commonwealth Court for decision. I maintain that the people of Australia in the different sections known as States are quite competent *t all times to set up tribunals that will be fully able to deal with any matter which is purely of a State kind, that is, any matter involving an industrial dispute. It is a parody on the Commonwealth Constitution, a complete subversion of all its Federal principles, to attempt to enlarge the functions of the Arbitration Court so as to permit of manufactured disputes - disputes which originally were not truly Federal in character - being brought forward to congest the Court and inferentially to throw odium on the Courts of a similar character which may have been erected by the State Governments. </para>

                            <para>- In Tasmania, the tribunals which have been erected by the State Governments have, up to the present, on the whole, dealt very satisfactorily with various industrial disputes which have been put before them. In Victoria, the situation is by no means deplorable. For many years Victoria has had tribunals which have dealt with matters of an economic character as between employer and employe, and the results have been most satisfactory. The Commonwealth Constitution provides&#39; for a- Conciliation and Arbitration Court it is true, but from the nature of the Constitution, from the very nature- of settlement in Australia, it would appeal to any person with common sense that the proper course to take would be at all times to refrain from bringing before that tribunal cases which were not essentially and in their true spirit of an Australian character. There is an attempt at all times, and there has been an attempt on the part of this Legislature, to strain the Constitution and to permit access to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court on the part of people who were involved in disputes which were not of a truly Federal character. I must confess that honorable senators opposite, who disagree with the view of politics that I take, have on the stocks certain proposals - have had them on the stocks and sent them to the people, who have rejected them - which will have the effect of enlarging the functions of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, in fact, of conferring absolute jurisdiction on the Court in regard to any industrial dispute, whether of an Inter-State or of a purely State character. That is their declared objective, and if they acknowledge, as the Attorney-General acknowledged in introducing this measure, that an amendment of the Constitution is essential to effect that objective, we know where we are, and the thing we have to decide - we who are Liberals and helped to frame the Constitution which conferred Federal jurisdiction on a Federal tribunal to deal with disputes of a truly Federal character - is whether or not we shall attempt to enlarge the functions of that tribunal which we are now constitutionally incompetent to do. There is a point at which we must refrain from attempting to confer upon that tribunal jurisdiction where it is not constitutionally competent to exercise it. </para>

                            <para>- In his remarks - and I think that they were admirable in tone - the Minister introducing this measure said that rules and procedure had to be observed by any deliberative or judicial assembly. That observation is so trite as to hardly necessitate any indorsement from me. No tribunal, no matter how free and easy may be its system of trial, can altogether dispense with rules of procedure. There must, be some form, some rule and line according to which a tribunal must regulate its hearing of any case. To say that the High Court will not at any time decide what is an industrial dispute is, to my mind, a simple begging of the question and a misuse of language. Anyhow, if it is constitutionally competent for us to endow the High Court, with jurisdiction in this matter; if it is constitutionally competent for one Judge of the High Court to decide before the merits of a case are heard as to what is an industrial  dispute; if the observance of that procedure, if the enactment of such legislation, will facilitate the settlement of disputes which are really and truly of an Inter-State character, then I welcome the measure. But, reading between the lines, it is easy to see that the legal gentleman who is sponsor for the Bill does not believe that it is going to be final. He questions the constitutionality of the action which he is taking. </para>

                            <para>- Our honorable friends on the other side want to extend the power of this Parliament to legislate in connexion with any industrial dispute, whether it is of an Inter-State character or not. What does the referendum proposal mean, if it does not mean that? Is not the whole object of that proposal to confer unlimited jurisdiction on the Conciliation and Arbitration Court? That will be the practical outcome of the adoption of the proposal which has been twice rejected, and certainly I shall resist to the very last any attempt to destroy the Federal nature  of  the Constitution in regard to its power in connexion with industrial disputes. If, within the limits of the Constitution, it is competent for us to do anything which will so enlarge the jurisdiction of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court as to facilitate the settlement of industrial disputes of an Australian character, then my vote will be in support of the measure. But I doubt very much the constitutionality of the provision conferring jurisdiction as regards the definition of an industrial dispute upon one Judge, from whose decision there is to be no appeal. It strikes me that the weakness of all these attempts to enlarge the jurisdiction of the Court has been in the direction of taking away the power of appeal. I do not think that we can create any Commonwealth tribunal of an industrial character, from the decision of which no appeal will lie to the High Court. Unless the Constitution <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> very radically altered - and I hope that it will not be altered in that direction - all legislative attempts of the character of this Bill will be the very limit of futility. But, as much may be granted, as many points may be stretched in the interests of industrial peace, 1 am not going to offer any great opposition to the attempt which is being made to give the High Court power to at once, in some easy fashion, determine what is .a Federal industrial dispute. I hope that the Constitution will not have to be enlarged to bestow upon the Court that power. I hope that it does possess the power, but, at the same time, I very much doubt it. I believe that the intention of the whole Bill will be destroyed by its language prohibiting any appeal to the High Court as a whole from the decision of any one Judge. I am not a lawyer. I am only a layman. These are questions which exercise to the utmost the greatest forensic ability, the greatest legal skill and judgment. We know that there is as much difference between the lawyers who are members of this Parliament in regard to this matter as there is between eminent doctors in regard to the diagnosis of many an obscure case. One has only to read the opinions which have been formulated on the Bench, and the opinions which have fallen from the lips of legal gentlemen in Parliament, to understand that we are dealing with a very ticklish question. I am sorry that the power of appeal is not given in the measure, because I believe that it is there where a constitutional flaw will be found to exist. </para>

                            <para>- There will be increased expedition in regard to the matter. The honorable senator knows that the law&#39;s delays are proverbial. For any one to expect that anything in the nature of a judicial tribunal will proceed with lightning-like velocity in regard to its deliberations and decision, is to expect something which is not likely to come to pass. The very nature and merit of any judicial investigation or deliverance is to be calm and temperate in tone. Any verdict proceeding from a competent tribunal must necessarily be slowly pronounced if it is going to be  well considered. There can be no violence in legislation, or in any judicial procedure, without producing very bad results. I think that there is no matter to which the old proverb, &#34; The more hurry the less speed,&#34; would more neatly apply than this. If a case is well considered by those who have the responsibility of bringing it before the Court; if there is no artificial element in the case, it can be safely considered by any Commonwealth tribunal such as the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, and the High Court. But it the element of artificiality is introduced, if there is a looseness in regard to the constitution of those associations which are the litigants, then we must understand, in accordance with ordinary legal practice and judicial procedure, that those parties, as a consequence of their own negligence, misreading of the Constitution, and, perhaps, intentional wrong action, will be nonsuited. No matter what is dons in regard to this business, we shall never reach the stage which some honorable senators regard as ideally desirable, when the plaint will be entered on one day, the whole question reviewed next day, and the decision handed out on the third day. If by any constitutional alteration we too greatly enlarge the functions of the Arbitration Court, Ave shall produce a condition of things absolutely opposed to that desired by the Attorney-General, by myself, and by every other well-wisher of the community, a condition which will not permit of legislative processes being worked expeditiously and well. </para>

                            <para>- The community, in the aggregate, is very much like the community divided into units. It is  never  a competent judge of its own case as affecting individual interests. If the honorable senator brought a case against me and lost it, he would, in all probability, be dissatisfied with the Judge or the jury. That is human nature. It is altogether at variance with the essence of things for us to expect, either in the State or the Commonwealth, to be successful at any time in erecting a tribunal that will be able to hand out a decision satisfying everybody. No competent tribunal -worthy of the name will ever do anything in as hasty a fashion as some industrial organizations in the community and some individuals desire. T 3hall not offer any opposition to the measure. The Minister introduced it in a very conciliatory fashion, as was meet and proper ; but I am afraid that the language of some of the clauses renders it almost certain that ultimately the Bill, if it becomes an Act, will be declared to have produced a situation which this Legislature is not competent under the Constitution to produce. </para>

                            <para>- Whatever were the honorable senator&#39;s exact words, his general advice was to hasten <inline font-style="italic">slowly</inline> with the measure. He did not strike a very original note in giving that advice, because it has been given by every apologist for reaction and standing still since the institution of parliamentary government. When will the time be ripe ? Will it be in a couple of years when, if matters remain as they are, arbitration will be brought into such contempt as to be completely wiped off the statute-book, or when employers and employes are at death grips, as they were in the nineties, at the time of the maritime strike and the shearers&#39; strike ? The honorable senator says in effect that the time is not ripe now. I ask him when it will be ripe. It will never be ripe for his shade of politics, because those who think with him are not now friendly to arbitration in any shape or form. They are trying to befriend it, so to speak, in an unfriendly and unsympathetic way by means of unsympathetic administration. I do not know why, but I have had the greatest difficulty in securing a copy of the report of the Registrar of the Court, which is full of useful information to every honorable senator. I wanted to see it particularly to make myself acquainted with the position up to date, the difficulties that have been surmounted in the past, and particularly the manufactured difficulties that have been put in the way by those who do not want the law of arbitration to work satisfactorily. So far as my knowledge goes the Registrar&#39;s report has not been placed on the table. I have made inquiries and find that the last Government, who were in office when the report was tendered, did not think it of sufficient importance to lay it on the table, and I have, therefore, been much in the dark as to what has &#39;really happened. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> went back even beyond the beginning of arbitration in this country. He dwelt, not only upon its origin; but on the power vested by the Constitution in this Parliament to frame arbitration laws. We came to a decision to employ arbitration in preference to the old method of settling industrial disputes. They were to be settled, not by haphazard means, but by slow and deliberate steps. We were forced to take that course by dint of circumstances alone. We did not get the whole-hearted support of the honorable senator&#39;s party when we first proposed that arbitration should be introduced to do away with strikes. </para>

                    <para>Arbitration has been tried in this country, and has been hampered in many ways. We attempted to put an Act on the statute-book in the simple belief that the Arbitration Court would be clothed with sufficient powers to carry out its work without interference from any quarter, even including the High Court itself, but this belief was vain. No sooner was the Act brought into operation than we found that the power which we thought was vested in the Court was not vested in it at all, but that the High Court was still free to interfere with its work in many ways as it has done for the last eight or nine years. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> may be satisfied with that condition of things. He may be pleased to let the Arbitration Court be fettered more and more by the High Court. Every appeal that is made shows with greater clearness that the High Court has imposed on the Arbitration Court additional handicaps, and placed in its path additional obstacles. The honorable senator says that that is right, that that state of things was ordained, and should continue, whereas we on our side say it should not continue, but that an effective stop should be put to it. The stop that we propose is this further attempt to prevent the High Court from impeding the useful work  of the Arbitration Court. That is the reason for the introduction of the measure.- </para>

                            <para>- But there is no other Court from which appeals are made so consistently and at such cost. Besides, the difference between other Courts and the Arbitration Court to my lay conception is that, whereas other Courts have been recognised as Courts from which an appeal should lie as a matter of course, it has been laid down in an Act of Parliament, as clearly as possible, that no appeal could, or should, lie from the decision of the Arbitration Court. Yet appeals have been made from its decisions again and again, and upheld by the High Court. We laid it down as clearly as language would let us that no appeal whatever should, or ought to, lie from the Arbitration Court to the High Court. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> was a member of the Government which passed that provision, and will recall it. It is section 31, and reads as follows: - </para>

                    <para>It would seem that language was given to men in these latter days, as has been well said, to conceal their thoughts. In that case we endeavoured to employ language to express our intention by Act of Parliament as plainly as we could, yet we find the High Court asserting and establishing its jurisdiction over the Arbitration Court, although absolutely prohibited by that Act from doing so. One case was tried, and it .was found that the High Court arrogated to itself the right to exercise jurisdiction over this tribunal, notwithstanding that a special Act of Parliament avowedly prevented it from doing so. I can only sympathize with those honorable senators who took wart in the framing of that Act. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was one of them, and Senate* Keating was another.

                            <para>- Honorable senators upon this side of the Chamber are of opinion that these mistakes can be remedied. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> has urged that we ought to go slow in regard to this kind of legislation, and that the time is not ripe for it. We think that the time is ripe to apply a further remedy if the existing remedy has proved ineffectual. Thus we hope that the Arbitration Court will exercise jurisdiction, within its own sphere, by means of an appeal to a single Judge of the High Court, on whatever question may come before it. But the High Court will be shorn of the power which it has exercised in the past, to occupy days in considering a measure, and thus to land the contending parties in a huge bill of costs. </para>

                    <para>What has been the history of arbitration during the past four years? From the records I find that there has been no fewer than eleven appeals to the High Court by employers, or at the instigation of employers. In nearly all of these cases our opponents have triumphed. The first case was that of an appeal against the registration of the Jumbunna Coal Miners. In that instance the Registrar had registered this association of workmen. He had laid the position before the  President  of the Arbitration Court, who had assented to its registration. Yet the employers attempted to secure the cancellation of that registration. It is true that they did not gain a victory. But the employes were subjected to a large expenditure, notwithstanding that they had been led to believe that no appeal lay to the High Court, and that when once their association had been registered it would remain registered, independent of what view might be held by that tribunal. The next case was that of the Broken Hill miners. There the employers appealed to the High Court on a question of jurisdiction, and while they did not gain a complete victory they at least secured a partial one. </para>

                            <para>- The question of jurisdiction was all the time involved in these appeals. In the case of the Broken Hill miners, the employers gained <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> partial victory, but, again, the employes were subjected to very heavy costs in resisting that appeal. I need hardly remind honorable senators that industrial organizations have not unlimited cash at their disposal, and that the expense incurred and the exasperation caused by the want of faith exhibited by the employes in the Arbitration Court have supplied them with their main grievances. The next anneal was in the Boot Trade case. In that the employers appealed to the High Court on a writ of prohibition, and the employes obtained a partial victory, but only after they had incurred a large expenditure in resisting the appeal. In the next case the issue of the common rule was discussed before the High Court. Notwithstanding that that had been one of the main features of arbitration, and that the application of the common rule bound employers on one side and employes on the other, the fact remains that when this issue was included in an appeal to the High Court that tribunal completely nullified it. The common rule was knocked out, and the employes thus suffered a further defeat at the hands of the High Court. The fifth case was that of the Tramways badge, in which the employes insisted upon exhibiting on their clothing the badge of membership of their union. The Tramway Company held that they must not do that,  and the matter was made the subject of an appeal to the High Court, over the head of the Arbitration Court, which was specially charged to deal with all matters of this kind. In that case the employes had a victory, but their costs were very great indeed. </para>

Then there is the case of the Merchant Service Guild. That was a case in which certain ship-owners in New South Wales appealed to the Arbitration Court, where the men succeeded in gaining an award ; but, when the employers were called upon to observe that award they appealed to the High Court on the plea that the Arbitration Court had no jurisdiction. The High Court concurred  in that view on the ground that the dispute did not extend beyond the limits of New South Wales. </para>

                            <para>- It is a singular thing that the decisions of the High Court in these appeals have been mostly adverse to the employes. They have sustained defeat after defeat at its hands. In its latest decision it has inflicted a blow upon the Arbitration Court from which that tribunal can never recover, unless the attempt to remedy that evil which we are making in this Bill proves successful. The next case was that of the Engine-drivers. There we witnessed the ingenuity of our opponents in endeavouring to appeal to the High Court on the question of whether engine-driving was an industry or not. The moment the engine-drivers obtained an award from the Arbitration Court, the employers appealed to the High Court on the ground that engine-driving was not an industry. The High Court held that this view was a sound one, and, after a long process of litigation, the engine-drivers found, to their dismay, that the award which they had been at such pains and expense to obtain went for naught. On that occasion, this Parliament, in its wisdom, came to the rescue bv passing an Act declaring that engine-driving was an industry, just  the same as is mining, carpentering, plumbing, or any other class of labour. After that Act was passed, an award was again obtained by the engine-drivers, and the employers once more appealed to the High Court with a view to having the validity of the law tested. The High Court thereupon declared that the amending law was perfectly valid, and, consequently, to-day engine-driving is recognised as an industry. Then the builders&#39; labourers went before the Arbitration Court. They subjected themselves to a lot of trouble and expense, and with what result? The employers appealed to the High Court, and said, &#34; The Arbitration Court has no jurisdiction in this case.&#34; The builders&#39; labourers secured a victory on thai? occasion, and the employers have now appealed to the Privy Council, where they will very probably secure a favorable verdict, seeing that the possession of the long purse tells in most of these contests. The tenth case to which I desire to direct attention is that of the Merchant Service Guild, in which an award was appealed against by the shipowners of the Commonwealth. The employes did not gain a complete victory there, altheugh they approached very closely to it. Nevertheless the expense and trouble of getting that case before the Court nearly resulted in failure. The last case on my list is that of the Tramway companies. That was before the Arbitration Court for ninety days, and, at the end of that term, the employers appealed to the High Court. With what result? After the employes had incurred all the expense of securing evidence before the Arbitration Court, their labours went for naught, because an appeal was made to the High Court, and that appeal was upheld. The result is that we do not know where we are to-day. We are in a mist. We do not know whether an association of workmen can or cannot get a cas&#169; brought before the Court, when, in their opinion, a dispute exists. The object of this Bill is to more clearly define the position of the rival parties in connexion with arbitration. I am supporting the measure in the belief that, though it may not be entirely successful, it is a step in advance of anything we have previously attempted to do. It will restrict the powers of the High Court in dealing with appeals from the Arbitration Court. If the measure is successful, as we all hope it will be, it will be the means of paving the way for more peaceful relationships between employers and employes. It will bo the means of making arbitration more respected in Australia than it is to-day. Up to date, we have had, in connexion with arbitration proceedings, nothing but the piling up of expenses by associations. I believe that I am fairly within the mark when I say that, as the result of the repeated appeals to the High Court in connexion with arbitration proceedings, not less than &#163;50,000 has been spent by the various unions throughout Australia. We wish to avoid that enormous and unnecessary expense. We desire, above all. that the principle of arbitration shall in this country be given a fair trial. Up to the present it has not had a fair trial, because of the powers which have been usurped by the High Court. This Parliament said that the High Court should not interfere with the Arbitration Court. It has interfered, in a very material way, in the eleven case&#39;s to which I have referred. We have had three victories, and a few partial victories, but in the majority of vital cases the decisions have unquestionably gone against us. The result has been that arbitration in -Australia, with the great bulk of employes and with very many employers, has  become  almost a by-word. We know that the bulk of the employers are not favorable to arbitration. They favour the Wages Board system, which enables them to victimize the members of Wages Boards if they do not act in conformity with their wishes. </para>

He may have his own opinion, just as we have ours. It cannot be contradicted that when an employe is placed in a position in which he is called upon to adjudicate on a case, if, in the exercise of an independent mind, he runs counter to the wishes of his employer, there is more than the average sense of justice to be found in human nature in that employer if he does not visit that employe with some punishment for his action. We say that a tribunal to deal with industrial questions in a just and equitable manner must be raised far above the possibility of victimization by either employers or employes. That type of arbitration may be expected from a Federal Arbitration Court, or, for that matter, from a State Arbitration Court composed of persons entirely removed from, and independent of, the parties to the conflict. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> and the members of his party chiefly favour Wages Boards, whilst we stoutly favour independent arbitration tribunals. We want to have. the principle of arbitration respected, and to have both parties in the industrial field contented. Our only course is to favour a competent tribunal, and not a partial or dependent tribunal, some of the members of which must rely for security in their positions upon the good graces of their employers if they dare to exercise independent judgment on the matters brought before them . <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> has informed me that members of Wages Boards in Tasmania have frequently been victimized. </para>

                            <para>- I have heard a similar statement made with respect to Wages Boards in Victoria. If it were not so, it would be in direct defiance of general experience. For my part, I say that employers are against arbitration, and particularly against that type from which an independent and equitable award may be obtained, and they are in favour of Wages Boards, for the reason that their employes cannot be sure of getting a fair deal from those tribunals. They are in favour of a form of arbitration under which the independence of the Court may be undermined. We cannot expect an impartial judgment from a Court that is not lifted above the sphere of the influence exercised in the past by employers. I feel that the arbitration principle is worthy of a further trial. We have met with many disappointments in our efforts to give the principle a trial in Australia, but I think it is our duty to give it a more extended trial before finally deciding to put it on one side; For my part, I have not yet lost hope of arbitration in Australia. We know that employers have put very large sums of money into efforts to defeat arbitration. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company spent &#163;12,000 in an effort to defeat an application to the Arbitration Court for the fixing of the wages of its employes. When we find a company of that kind spending money in the effort to be relieved from the effects of our arbitration laws, we may be satisfied that the principle of arbitration is not working in their favour. As one who has been a good deal in the turmoil in the past, I say that, in the interests of employes, of fair employers&#34; and of the community generally, arbitration is worthy of a more thorough and more  careful  trial than it has been given up to date. In the Federal sphere of action it has not been given a fair trial, because it has been exposed to the repeated interferences of a higher tribunal. The last decision of the High Court has reduced arbitration in the Federal sense to an. absurdity and an absolute farce. We do not know where we stand now. When a body of workmen become dissatisfied with their conditions, they do not know whether they can approach the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court or not. I am in favour of this further effort in the direction of arbitration, although I am not too confident that it will prove satisfactory. It is only by continually trying that we can finally reach success. I support this further trial in the hope that the Federal Arbitration Court will be made all powerful within its domain, and will thus be the means of exercising a beneficent influence in securing reasonable and just relationships between employers and employes. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not know whether I was more shocked or amused to hear the wholesale denunciation of Wages Boards which we had from the honorable senator who has just resumed his seat. I heard an interjection to the effect that they were not working too well in the Labour-controlled State of  Tasmania  ; and I may inform the Senate that in New South Wales, where the Wages Board system is in existence, it is operating, not only under the supervision of a Labour Government, but apparently with the entire approval of that Government. That being so, one must assume either that the Labour Government of New </para>

                            <para>- That kind of thing may be all very well for the platform, but it will not convince members of this Chamber. I do not say that the Wages Board system is entirely satisfactory. There have been occasions when its operation has not given a great deal of satisfaction, but I do say that, on the whole, the Wages Boards in New South Wales have given more satisfaction than has any other effort yet made to deal with industrial disputes in the arena of the Law Courts. If that is not so, what have my honorable friends opposite to say to their political brothers-in-arms - the Labour party in the New South Wales Parliament? </para>

I say that in that State we have Wages Boards operating under the auspices, and with the sanction, of a Labour party armed with a considerable measure of parliamentary strength. I know the Labour party of New South Wales, and I refuse to believe that, if they saw in the Wages Board system all the evils which my honorable friends opposite profess to see in it, they would not make an effort to remove them. </para>

I refer to the Bill introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid in 1894, dealing with the land and income <inline font-style="italic">taxes.</inline> The Legislative Council at that time, if they did not reject the measure, at least so mutilated it that it was practically destroyed. What was <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid&#39;s answer? It was an immediate dissolution of Parliament, fie went to the country and came back with a slightly larger majority than he had before. He passed the measure in the Lower House, and the moment he did so the Legislative Council of the State said, &#34; Our function has ceased.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- I am not speaking of States where the Legislative Council is elected upon a narrow property qualification. I have not a kind word to say of them. I repeat that the Labour party of New South Wales, strong in their parliamentary majority, have countenanced the Wages Boards in that State. If they believe them to represent the iniquity which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has suggested, they have the remedy in their own hands. The fact that they have so far refrained from putting that remedy into operation is indicative to me that they regard those Boards, if not as entirely satisfactory, as st least giving a greater measure of satisfaction than any of the other expedients hitherto resorted to. Listening to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch&#39;s</inline> address, I could only regard it as a plea for an alteration of our law, not because the law is wrong, and not because the principle upon which it is based is wrong, but because a majority of the Judges of the High  Court have taken a different view from that taken by a single member of the Court. In other words, if the position were reversed, and the Judge of the Arbitration Court had given a decision against the union, and the High Court had ruled against the Judge of the Arbitration Court in favour of the  union, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> would be the last in the world to ask us to pass this legislation. The honorable senator does not ask us to pass this Bill because the existing law is wrong, and he does not venture to prove that the majority of the High Court have been wrong. </para>

                    <para>A number of unions have approached the Arbitration Court, many of them misled by faulty legislative work, for which the Senate must share the responsibility. The Parliament did place in the Act a provision, in which, I venture to say, it exceeded its powers. I am afraid that there has been in the past a tendency on the part of the Commonwealth Parliament, and one which has not even yet exhausted itself, to overlook the fact that it is in. a different position from any Parliament which existed in Australia before. Previous Parliaments, like the Imperial Parliament, have been free to legislate how, when, and where they would. They were not operating under a Constitution written in the sense in which ours is written. We have to accustom ourselves to this fact, that we are working with limited powers, which are set out in the Constitution. We are not going to overcome that disability, if it is one, by any laws which we may pass here. </para>
                    <para class="block">That is the point I want to make. The correct thing for my honorable friends, and those who think that our powers are circumscribed, to do is not to go on placing futile laws on the statute-book - further invitations to Labour unions to test their cases in Court - but to proceed with another plank in their platform, and that is the referenda proposals. This Bill, in my opinion, is lacking in honesty, both to the Parliament and to the people, who expect so much from it. They have already made one effort by Act of Parliament to override the Constitution. I refer to the. Act in which they sought to take away the appellate jurisdiction of the High Court. I am only a layman, but I venture to express the opinion that nothing which this Parliament may do, so long as the Constitution retains its present shape, will enable us to do that. The limitation is there, consequently, if my opinion is sound, what my honorable friends are now doing is giving a further invitation to the unions to spend another &#163;50,000. That is not honest to the unions. There is not a member of the Government party to-day who is prepared to affirm that he does believe sincerely that the Bill will meet the difficulty which it is supposed to meet. </para>

                            <para>- I have expressed some doubt on the point as to whether the Bill will help at all, and I venture to say that most honorable senators who have listened to me share that doubt. That being so, I do submit that my honorable friends would have dealt much more frankly, and I think, in the end, much more beneficially, with the unions they have taken under their special care if, instead of occupying time with this Bill, instead of adding to the measures which are going, in my judgment, to be declared <inline font-style="italic">ultra</inline><inline font-style="italic">vires,</inline> they had said to the  country at large, &#34; We do not believe that, under the Constitution, we have power to do what we think ought to be done. Until you alter the Constitution, as we have invited you to do, we can do nothing for you,&#34; and then proceeded with their referenda proposals. That would have been an entirely frank and, in my opinion, a business-like course to pursue. There can not be any doubt that if the country approved of the proposed alterations the field would be perfectly free for the Parliament to legislate as it likes in industrial matters. Regarding their proposals, I, of course, take up the same attitude now as I did before. I am not favorable to the major portion of them. </para>

                            <para>- As regards the referenda proposals of the Labour party, I do not alter my attitude one iota. At the same time, it does seem to me that my honorable friends, to be logical, ought to proceed with them instead of with this Bill. Instead of patching with quite ineffective patches the defective legislation of the past, it would have been much better for them, and in the long run much better for the unions, if they had immediately proceeded to grapple with what is the real difficulty in the way, and admitted that, from their stand-point, the difficulty is not in altering legislation, but in the limitations imposed on our efforts by the Constitution. If they hold the views they profess to hold, the correct remedy is to try to widen the Constitution. Although I do not view their proposals favorably, I feel constrained to admit that, after the results of the last election, they will be quite entitled to proceed with them again. I make no secret of that fact. It was put before the electors as one of the things they proposed to do, and, having got electoral warrant for proceeding with it, and that being the only way which will give them the real remedy they seek, it does appear to me that they are in an entirely illogical, position at present. They are wasting our time and misleading the unions by placing on the statute-book other laws which I venture to say will share the fate of preceding ones. I have only dealt with two matters, compared to which the other matters involved in the Bill are comparatively insignificant. I do not propose to touch on the minor questions at this stage, but there are one or two details which I would like to discuss in Committee. In conclusion I only wish to emphasize the point as strongly as I can, that my honorable friends opposite are going to land the unions, if the doubts they share with me are founded on fact, in another series of expensive lawsuits and another series of very bitter disappointments. I do submit for their consideration whether it would not be more honest on their part, and better for the country, and certainly better for the unions, if, instead of wasting time in passing legislation of this more than doubtful character, they were to at once proceed with their efforts to secure those wider powers, without which I am quite satisfied they will never be able to carry their objective. </para>

                        <para>. - I admit that the concluding portion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> address somewhat astonished me, and that was his anxiety regarding further expense in which the unions may be involved should the measure become law. I am somewhat surprised at the sudden anxiety on his part, because I know that in the past he has expressed no anxiety on that score. He has given us a lecturette this afternoon; he has said that, instead of introducing legislation of this nature, wo should have proceeded with our proposals to alter the Constitution. On each occasion that we submitted our referenda proposals  to the National Parliament there was no stronger opponent of them than the honorable senator, and so, too, on the platforms in the country, I venture to say that when they are resubmitted here there will be no stronger opponent of them than the honorable senator. Consequently, where is the logic of his argument? n fail to find- it. The principle of this measure is to make the Commonwealth Arbitration Court the final arbiter in cases of industrial dispute. I admit frankly that it may not enable the various organizations, be they employers&#39; or employes&#39; organizations, to reach the desired goal. But, in view of recent decisions, it is imperative that at least one more attempt be made to find out whether or not some machinery can be invented to put an end to costly litigation in connexion with industrial disputes. That litigation is costly to both parties to the disputes, with this difference, that one party is better able to bear the cost than the other. I refer to the employers&#39; organization. The spirit of the Constitution in this matter is that industrial disputes should be settled with the least possible cost to the parties engaged in- them. Whether it is the letter or not is another matter, and it has certainly been proved that it is not the letter. I speak with experience of the Australian Tramways Employes Association, with which I have been connected - one of the youngest associations registered under the Act. It is in connexion with the award given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins in .the Tramway case, and the further litigation before the High Court, and the High Court&#39;s judgment, that this Bill has been introduced. It cost that young organization about &#163;5,000 from the time its case was first filed until the High Court gave its decision. If that is going to be the fate of every organization registered under the Act, what encouragement do we give to organizations to discard the old weapon of the strike? </para>

                            <para>- That is not the point at issue. The spirit of the Constitution was to invite the workers to lay aside the weapon of the strike and settle their disputes peacefully, cheaply, and without stopping the revolutions of the commercial and industrial wheels of the nation. The workers of the Commonwealth have accepted that invitation and have registered themselves under the law of the land. What has been the result? The cases quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> this afternoon prove that whilst the worker has thrown away the weapon of the strike and submitted himself to the law of the land, the employer, on the other hand, has gone on strike, and there are many ways of doing so. The Australian Tramways Employes Association obtained an award from the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. Several tramway systems settled their differences by agreement under the compulsory powers possessed by the  President  of the Court. The Adelaide Tramway Trust and the Brisbane Tramway Company refused to enter the Conference as ordered by him. There was nothing left for him to do but to give an award in the case of those two systems. Its effect was to increase wages, shorten hours, and grant to the men holidays they had never had before. It made their conditions of employment better in every way ; but as soon as it was given, the Adelaide Tramway Trust and the Brisbane Tramway Company raised the technical point of jurisdiction, and any one who goes into the history of the case will see the truth of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins&#39;s statement that the approaches to the Court lay through a veritable Serbonian bog of legal technicalities. All that the Bill asks for in clause 6 is that the unions may know before they take their case to the Arbitration Court whether they have a case or not. That is the point. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> did not mention that clause in his second-reading speech. He was simply anxious about the expense to which the unions might be put. He- has not been anxious on that score during the past few years, and, as I interjected as he was leaving the chamber- </para>

                            <para>- I give that statement an emphatic denial. It is not a habit of mine, and I defy the honorable senator to prove that it is. I did not mean what I said in any offensive way, for I knew the honorable senator was called out on business. I was simply going to repeat for his benefit, now that he has returned, an interjection that I made when he was leaving. If he is not gentleman enough to accept&#34; that explanation, I cannot help it. The history of the Tramway case is sufficient to prove to those of us who are on the side of the employes that it is absolutely imperative for this Parliament to make a further effort to save, not only the unions, but the employers, from the cost of litigation. The present situation means that when an award is given in favour of the employes, the employers organizations begin to play battledore and shuttlecock with them. That is the wrong way to preserve industrial peace. I said when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was speaking, &#34; After this the deluge,&#34; meaning that the workers of the Commonwealth were getting very restive under the repeated galling action of the employers in taking the cases to the High Court on technicalities. The Labour party advocate the settlement qf industrial disputes by peaceful methods. That is true not only of members of the National Parliament and State Parliaments, but also of the leaders of the various organizations; but, if this kind of business is to go on, there is the danger of resort to the old weapon of the strike, and, hearty advocate though I am of the peaceful solution of disputes, it will be very difficult for me, or any of my colleagues, to continue to advocate it if all the unions have to stand the costly process of appeal in order to get their disputes settled, only to find, in the end, that they are no better off than when they started. It took some little persuasion to keep the Adelaide tramways running, not only during the hearing of the case, but after the High Court had given its decision. I appeal to all who desire the continuance of industrial peace to give this measure a trial. I think it will minimize present difficulties, although I agree with its opponents that it will not go the whole length. The only way to bring about absolute security in this regard, and to make the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court the final industrial Court of Appeal, as I think it ought to be, is by means of an alteration of the Constitution; but, whilst we are waiting for this, there may be a danger of an industrial upheaval, which the majority of the members of this Chamber are desirous of avoiding. It is for these reasons, and many others, that I am supporting the second reading. I sincerely hope that, if it is not as effective as we desire it to be, when the time comes for us to submit the referenda . proposals once more to the people our friends opposite will be just as anxious for the welfare of members of trade unions as they are to-night, and will carry that anxiety from within the four walls of this building to the platforms of the country. I trust that they will advocate then, on the public platform, an alteration of the Constitution which will give us lasting industrial peace in Australia. </para>

                        <para>. - I realize, like others who have spoken, that it is desirable that we should have effective means of conciliation and arbitration for the settlement of industrial disputes. Those who took part in framing the Constitution, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> reminds us, made provision for the establishment of Conciliation and Arbitration Courts in connexion with industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any State. We passed in 1904 a Conciliation and Arbitration Act, which has since been amended in the light of experience. These amendments have not always achieved the end aimed at, but we must remember that Parliament is not the only authority in this matter. The Commonwealth was founded, like all other self-governing communities of the highest order, as consisting of three distinct parts - a Legislature, an Executive, and a Judiciary. Not one of these, in origin, is dependent on the other; none is the creature of the other. Each derives its existence, its virtues, its powers and effect from the Constitution. The High Court is provided for, and was brought into existence by the Constitution itself. </para>

                    <para class="block">Parliament has certain powers with regard to the High Court, but does not absolutely define or limit its jurisdiction. Parliament, under the Constitution, has certain powers to clothe the High Court and other Courts which it may create with jurisdiction, but apart from that the High Court has original jurisdiction under the Constitution, of which nothing that this Parliament may do can deprive it. That is largely the cause of the position in which we find ourselves to-day. </para>

                            <para>-.- The people can make an alteration in that regard, but this Parliament cannot. We must recognise our limitations when we proceed to exercise our powers. If the power lies with the people, and not with this Parliament, all our efforts to do what lies within the people&#39;s&#39;  province,  and not within ours, will be absolutely futile. But those efforts, however futile, may generate in the minds of certain persons outside hopes and beliefs that are not at all well-founded, but that may lead them to courses of action involving enormous expense, and perhaps ending in ultimate disaster. I have always hoped that a Commonwealth system of conciliation and arbitration in relation to industrial disputes would be expeditious, comparatively inexpensive, and certain. I fondly believed and hoped that access to the tribunal which would deal with these&#39; matters of conciliation and arbitration, would be easy and satisfactory. But, in common with the majority of people, I must confess to a feeling of disappointment. Resort to the Arbitration Court so far as the parties to industrial disputes are concerned, has not been attended with the success, inexpensiveness, and certainty for which we all hoped. To-day certain criticism has been levelled at the Commonwealth law in regard to conciliation and arbitration. Some of that criticism has been merited, and some of it unmerited. We have been told that the approach to the Court is, in the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, through <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> Serbonian bog of technicalities. We have been assured by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> that the invoking of the powers of the Arbitration Court, with a view to the settlement of industrial disputes, has been attended with considerable expense and uncertainty, and that the High Court has been appealed to against its decisions, with the result that those decisions have been reversed. </para>

                            <para>- No doubt. Incidentally I wish to refer to a casual remark by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> in regard to lawyers generally - a remark which he subsequently qualified to some extent. He said that one could hardly meet a lawyer on a staircase without realizing how businesslike the latter was. To that statement I replied that .the lawyer certainly is, and should be, business-like if one meets and consults him as a lawyer. I have had persons consult me as I have been coming down the steps of a bank, and in all sorts of out-of-the-way places. They have asked my opinion upon matters, and they have afterwards had the goodness to obtain the advice of another member of the legal profession, and to inform him of the opinion which I had expressed without telling him of the circumstances under which it was obtained. I have known of cases  in which clients have seized the opportunity of consulting solicitors when they met them outside their offices, thinking that thereby they would escape the consultation fee. It is quite a common practice amongst many persons in the community to endeavour to obtain a little cheap law. </para>

                            <para>- The main provision of this Bill is clause 6, which proposes the insertion of a new section in the principal Act. It provides that any party to a dispute -before the Arbitration Court may make an application to the High Court for a declaration of the existence of a dispute. I quite recognise that it is most desirable that a Court, before dealing with any matter on its merits, should be satisfied that it has jurisdiction. Any steps which may be taken to have that question determined as early and as finally as possible will meet with my approval. The procedure outlined in the proposed new section, in its intent and purport, is one to be commended. But I very much doubt whether the provision will give effect to the intention of the framers of the Bill. If the measure passes in its present form, I believe it will merely &#39;be a misleading post to a good many persons who will be disclosed to invoke the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Court. The clause provides that when an industrial dispute is submitted to the Court, any party to the proceeding may apply to the High Court for a decision on the question of whether the dispute or any part thereof exists; that such application may be dealt with by one Justice of the High Court, and that his decision as to whether there is a dispute cognisable by the Arbitration </para>

I venture to say that almost any lawyer in Australia would have told those men that they had not a hope of ever getting their case before the Arbitration Court, because such an associated body as they were was not contemplated by the Act.

                        <para>The respondents, for whom <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Starke</inline> appeared, contend, on the other hand, that the term &#34; industry,&#34; as used in section 55 ( 1 ) <inline font-style="italic">b,</inline> connotes an entirety different from, and outside of, the mere personal vocation of the employe, and should be construed objectively, ns denoting a collective enterprise in which, to use the words of section 7, employers and employes are associated. . . . The claimants do not deny that in section 55 (1) a, which speaks of &#34; employers in or in connexion with any industry,&#34; and of &#34; employes in that industry,&#34; the word &#34; industry &#34; must bear the meaning put upon it by the respondent. The respondent very naturally asks why should the same word, twice used in the same section in the same phrase &#34; in or connexion with any industry,&#34; have a different meaning according as the phrase is used to qualify the term &#34; employer &#34; or &#34; employe.&#34; </para>

                    <para>Members, of the Federated Engine-drivers and Firemen&#39;s Association were employed in different industries. Some were employed in mines, some in factories, some in hotels, and some in tanneries. The unit of organization as contemplated by the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act would be illustrated in mining employers and mining employes, hotel employers and hotel employes, tannery proprietors and tannery employes. This association cut right across the lines of division of the several units contemplated by the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. For the purposes of that Act they were, therefore, not engaged in &#34;an industry.&#34; They were engaged in various industries. Different members of the Association would come under the term &#34; employes &#34; as applied to different industries. The Chief Justice went on to say - </para>

On the contrary view, there is a sudden change of meaning of the same word in the same sentence, and the phrase &#34; in which persons are employed,&#34; which, as to part of the subject, means &#34; in which persons are employed by an employer,&#34; means, as to another part, &#34; in which persons engage.&#34; </para>

                    <para class="block">They might be treated as persons following one industry, but their several employers could not be dealt with as though they were banded together in one organization. The manufacturer of certain goods might be, in one employer&#39;s organization, prepared to deal with all his employes, and another employer might be in a different association altogether - such as the Hotelkeepers Association. The same applies with regard to every industry with which engine-driving was associated. Later on - page 411 of this volume - <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith said - </para>

                        <para>A good illustration is afforded by the present case, in which the award as proposed would extend to employes engaged in industries of all possible kinds, from drivers of locomotives or of winding-engines on mines, to men in charge of small gas-engines used in industries in which the use of engine-power is merely subsidiary, and to employers engaged in equally diverse industries. </para>

                    <para class="block">I remember that, after this decision was given, legislation was introduced to alter the unit of organization in connexion with the Arbitration Act. It was proposed then to make the basis of organization not an industry but a handicraft. When that measure was before another place, one honorable member, a member of the Labour party who has devoted a considerable amount of time and attention to this subject, strenuously opposed that proposal. He objected to grouping the employes under handicrafts rather than in industrial groups. I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Catts,</inline> a man who has been very conspicuous in his attention to this matter. When he took up such a strenuous and positive attitude in confirmation of the principle which the High Court recognised as the principle underlying the Act, it may be reasonably inferred that there is, at least, even as a matter of policy, room for difference of opinion as to whether it is better that employes should be associated in groups of handicrafts or in groups of industries. At any rate, what we did in 1904  was to group them in relation to industries, and not in relation to handicrafts. That is what the High Court pointed out. They considered that the Judge of the Arbitration Court could not deal with a group of engine-drivers because there was no corresponding group of employers with whom he could deal. It would be necessary for the Court to deal with them separately. </para>

I am endeavouring to show that the High Court did not give a senseless decision to the effect that a man who was an engine-driver was not engaged in an industry. The decision of the Court was that this Parliament had laid down in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act a definition of &#34;industry&#34; for the purpose of a system of conciliation and arbitration. They gave their interpretation of it, an interpretation which I submit is borne out by common sense. We adopted the principle, and the High Court could only deal with the Act as they found it, and as we left it. The proof of the pudding is in the eating, because we subsequently amended the Act to make such an association as the Engine-drivers and Fire- men&#39;s Association justiciable under our conciliation and arbitration law. </para>

                        <para>Turning to the specific definition of &#34; industry,&#34; it rather appears to mean a business (as merchant), a trade (as cutler), a manufacturer (as a flour miller), undertaking (as a gas company), a calling (as an engineer), or service (as a carrier), or an- employment (a general term like &#34; calling &#34; - embracing some of the others, and intended to extend to vocations which might not be comprised in any of the rest), all of these expressions, so far indicating the occupation in which the principal, as I may call him, is engaged, whether on land or water. If the occupation so described is one in which persons are employed for pay, hire, advantage, or reward, that is, as employes, then, with the exceptions stated, it is an industry within the meaning of the Act. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>That was the decision of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs in a case preceding this one, quoted with approval both by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Barton and the Chief Justice. Later, in. his own judgment, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Barton said - &#34;Industry,&#34; therefore, as defined in the fourth section, and as used elsewhere in the Act, means a concern or concerns carried on by employers, in which the employes work with the employers for wages or other recompense. It does not mean the mere vocations of sections of workmen not bound together in respect of their connexion with an enterprise or enterprises of the same kind, but carrying on, in widely diverse undertakings - for example, &#34; in mines, in timber yards, in factories, in soap and candle works &#34; - one out of the many classes or divisions of work which are necessary for completely constituting and conducting such undertakings. Such sections of work- men may form associations for their mutual support  and protection, and nothing that has been said in this case casts a doubt on the legality of such bodies, but they are not associations of employes &#34; in or in connexion with any industry,&#34; as the term &#34; industry &#34; is used in the Act. </para>

                        <para>With regard to the first question, I am clear, as may be gathered from what I said in the Jumbunna case, that the Constitution, by section 51 (xxxv), enables the Parliament, if it so desires, to empower the registration of organizations such as the claimants in this case. That is to say, it may empower workmen to associate and register as organizations having regard only to the nature of the work they personally do, and entirely disregarding the class of industrial operations in which they and their employers are mutually engaged. </para>

                        <para>The true meaning, then, of section 55 is not, I think, difficult to grasp. First, it dealt with employers&#39; associations by allowing any association of employers in any industry to be registered, provided that during the preceding six months, the employers associated employed, on an average, per month, not less than 100  employes  in that industry. </para>
                        <para>The next paragraph gave the corresponding right to the employes by permitting that same 100 employes - or more - to register also as an organization, and so protect the right of the workers in the industry, as against the employers. </para>

                        Barton. I have read at length from these judgments, because it might appear to those who may read this debate that the High Court had given a decision that persons engaged in engine-driving were not engaged in an industry. They decided that the men were engaged in varying industries in the particular case before them. They decided that the men could not be regarded as a grouped body in connexion with &#34; an industry &#34; as the term is used in, and for the purposes of, the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. As
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline>
                        Isaacs said, he had no doubt that we have the power under paragraph 35 of section 51 of the Constitution to enable such bodies to form associations, to organize and to register; but the rea question which the High Court was determining was whether this Parliament, in 1904 did exercise its power to enable* such an association to register and obtain the benefit of the Act. He, like
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline>
                        Barton and the Chief Justice, held that, in the exercise of our legislative powers in the Arbitration Act in 1904, we did not go so far, and he was compelled, as they were compelled, to hold that the association was not an organization in relation to &#34; an industry &#34; as provided for in that Act. They did not decide baldly that the men were not engaged in industry, but in &#34;an industry&#34; defined and provided for by the Act.

                            <para>- I am not dealing with that question, but with what the High Court decided. I think, when a statement is made of the kind which was delivered here this afternoon, it is due to the Justices of the High Court that some little time should be given, as I am glad to see members of the Senate are giving me, to put, even though it be only in the form of extracts, some presentation of the facts from their point of view. Reference has been made to the Tramways case. I will only refer to the case for the purpose of showing how, I think, our efforts, so far as portion of an important clause of this Bill is concerned, will be futile. I do not think that anything we may put into the Act to prevent the High Court from exercising its jurisdiction of prohibition will have any effect whatever. The High Court derives its authority from the Constitution. The Judicature is dealt with in chapter III., sections 71 to 80, both inclusive. Section 71 reads - </para>

                    <para class="block">That is not, so far as this Parliament is concerned, statutory jurisdiction. It is jurisdiction in a sense inherent in the High Court from the moment that it is constituted. Even if there was no Judiciary Act, directly the High Court was constituted under section 72, without any action on the part of this Legislature or of the Bench itself, it has attached to it immediate jurisdiction in mandamus, prohibition, or injunction against an officer of the Commonwealth. That jurisdiction is absolutely original, and analogous to the inherent jurisdiction of the Courts in the Old Country, which have not derived their existence from any statutory authority. It is a Court created by a Statute of the Imperial Parliament itself - the Commonwealth Constitution. Matters affecting its <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> are dealt with locally, but the moment the appointments are made its original jurisdiction attaches to &#39;it. It was decided in the Tramways case No. 1 that original jurisdiction was conferred by section 75, sub-section 5, of the Constitution upon the High Court, to issue a prohibition to the  President  of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, and that section 31 of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904-11, so far as it purported to take away from the High Court the power to issue prohibition in respect of an award or order of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, was invalid. That decision was given on 24th March last, and that is what I meant when I said, in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> &#34; We have lived and learned.&#34; The provisions in this Bill were put into the 1911 Act. The 1904 Act contained a provision making certain decisions unappealable, but the words prohibiting mandamus, prohibition, or injunction were not in that Act. They were put into the 1911 Act. As recently as 24th March of this year, we were reminded by the ruling of the High Court that its jurisdiction in relation to mandamus and prohibition is not, so far as this Parliament is concerned, statutory and derived from this Parliament, but original as expressed in the Constitution, and that nothing that this Parliament can <inline font-style="italic">do</inline> can alter it. Only the alteration of the Constitution can affect it.

                        <para>In the case provided for by section 51 (xxxv) there are three limits: The subject-matter of the legislation must be (1) a dispute, (2) an industrial dispute, (3) an industrial dispute extending beyond the limits of any one State. If it does not fall within these limits, the Parliament has no authority, and it is a mere truism to say that Parliament cannot confer on a Court of its creation authority to .deal with matters not within its own power. ... By the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 it was provided (section 31) that no award of the Court should be challenged, appealed against, reviewed, quashed, or called in question in any other Court on any account whatever. The section stood thus when  Whybrow&#39;s  case (1) was decided in 1010. In 1011 Parliament inserted the words &#34; or bc subject to prohibition or mandamus &#34; after &#34; called in question.&#34; It is objected that the power to grant prohibition has now been taken away. The answer to that question depends upon the authority by which it was conferred. . . . In my opinion, the jurisdiction of the superior Courts in England to grant the common law writ of prohibition &#39; was original and not appellate jurisdiction. An examination of &#34; the origin and reason of the writ,&#34; as well as &#34; the history of the procedures by which it has at different times been enforced,&#34; to use the words of Brett, J., in <inline font-style="italic">Worthington</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Jeffries</inline> (2), seems to put this beyond controversy. </para>

                            <para>- We can vest tha jurisdiction where we like, but the question is whether, when the Judge has exercised his jurisdiction, his decision is appealable. We say it shall not be appealable, but -whether or not the High Court can exercise in its original jurisdiction powers of prohibition in respect of that decision is a matter that is very much in doubt. I am inclined to think that the High Court would still have the power by a prohibition order to restrain proceedings upon a decision given by a single Justice. The argument used against that would nui in this way: &#34;A single Justice is, for the purposes of this section, the High Court. The application in the terms of the section is made to the High Court. The High Court is invested with jurisdiction to decide the application, and in the exercise of that jurisdiction a single Justice may be the High Court.&#34; There is, at the very best, a considerable amount of doubt as to whether, by framing our legislation in this form, we can substantially effect what the High Court decided on the 24th March last that we did not effect. </para>

We have our powers; the High Court has its jurisdiction, its duties, and its responsibilities, just as this Parliament has. I should be very sorry to see a state of affairs established which would generate in the minds of the public at large the idea that there was friction between two such important bodies, both established by the Constitution. I have had a considerable amount of practice in reading judgments, and have read the decisions of the High Court extensively, but have seen nothing in them which would in the slightest suggest to a dispassionate observer that the High Court was desirous of aggrandizing itself or belittling this Parliament. On every occasion that it has had to interpret the will of this Parliament as expressed in Statute form it has gone into the most careful analysis of the Statute, and, so far as I can see, has exercised its jurisdiction in accordance with the highest traditions of such tribunals throughout the world.

But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> stated that the Court had held that the engine-drivers were not engaged in an industry; and many persons outside would interpret : such a judgment, if given, as not only an offence to common sense, but as an insult and a reflection upon their calling.

The Court merely declared that they were not engaged in &#34;an industry &#34; as defined by the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. I am sorry to have occupied the attention of honorable senators so long, but I felt called upon to put the position of the other side. T say again that any efforts put forward in this Parliament to simplify our arbitration law, to make our Courts of Conciliation and Arbitration more accessible to litigants, and to have the issues placed &#34;before it decided as early and as satisfactorily as possible, will receive my whole-hearted support. But I fear that the results which will follow from the passing of this Bill will not be of such a beneficent character as the framers anticipate. </para>
