The Government Printing Office is at the present time very much congested with work, and it is impossible to say within a day or two when a paper ordered to be printed can be circulated to honorable senators. </para>

                        <para>- I am not in a position to answer the question definitely, but from present appearances I do not think that it will be necessary to ask the Senate to sit later than 4 o&#39;clock tomorrow afternoon. Honorable senators are aware that there is a general desire to close the sittings of the Parliament this year as early as possible. In view of the condition of business in each House, although it may not be necessary for the Senate to sit beyond the usual hour tomorrow afternoon, it may possibly be necessary to call honorable senators back on Monday or Tuesday next. I shall endeavour to meet the convenience of honorable senators who have to travel to and from the other States as far as I possibly can. </para>

That offer was to establish .a wireless station at the place mentioned, provided the residents guarantee a revenue of &#163;150 per annum for, say, seven years - making a deposit of that sum - and provide the necessary building, thus leaving approximately &#163;150 per annum to be made up by the Department. The Postmaster-General cannot see his way to recommend that communication with King Island should be given without monetary contribution hy the residents, when that condition is insisted upon in all country districts when the estimated revenue is insufficient to warrant the granting of communication without such contribution. . </para>

                    <para>That this Bill be now read a second time. </para>
                    <para>I may say that the total appropriation for works and buildings during the year 1914-15 amounts to &#163;4,303,870, which is an increase of &#163;1,037,391 over that of last year. The total expenditure last year under this heading was &#163;2,578,095, and there was appropriated, but not expended, the sum of &#163;688,474, making a total appropriation of &#163;3,266,479. I desire now to direct attention to the main items in the Bill. These include Fleet construction, for which an appropriation is sought this year of &#163;750,000. In 1913-14 there was expended under this heading the sum of &#163;753,537, and there was an unexpended balance of &#163;267,950. Upon telephone construction during the current financial year it is proposed to expend &#163;950,000. The amount expended last year in this connexion was &#163;951,221, and there was unexpended &#163;128,479. Upon Federal Capital works for the current financial year the appropriation sought is &#163;270,000. </para>
                    <para class="block">The amount expended last year was &#163;252,245, and there was an unexpended balance of &#163;32,755. The works connected with the water supply and main sewer of the Capital are being proceeded with. In addition, the erection of brick works, the installation of an electric power plant, and the construction of a storage reservoir for regulating the flow of the upper waters of the Queanbeyan River are being carried out. Upon the Northern Territory the appropriation sought this year is &#163;34,610, the amount expended last year was &#163;50,545, and there was unexpended a balance of &#163;9,305. The construction of the railway from Pine Creek to the Katherine River is proceeding. The installation of an up-to-date tin concentrating plant at the Marranboy field is approaching completion. All the reports concerning this field indicate prospects of considerable richness and permanence. The work of boring for water on the main overland stock routes is proceeding. Messrs. Vestey Brothers, the private . firm which has undertaken to construct extensive meat works at Darwin, have made a start on buildings. It is understood that they propose to install a temporary arrangement for killing and refrigerating, so that the export of frozen meat may be begun early in the coming year. The permanent building will cost upwards of &#163;100,000, and will take at least twelve months to complete. In regard to Papua, work has not yet been commenced on the proposed railway from Astrolabe to Port Moresby, partly on account of the necessity for obtaining further reports from engineers, and partly on account of the uncertainty created by the present financial conditions as to the development of the mining properties on which the proposed railway would depend for the greater portion of its traffic. A valuable report on the oil fields has been presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Wade.</inline> It is encouraging in its nature, and the Government have decided to proceed with the systematic development of the field. Upon Naval works for the current financial year it is proposed to expend &#163;400,300, an increase of &#163;234,219 over the expenditure of last year. The amount actually spent in that year was &#163;123,950, and there was unexpended the sum of &#163;42,131. There was thus a total appropriation for that year of &#163;166,081. The Naval works, including labour and material, will cost &#163;150,000. They include the following: Flinders Naval Base, &#163;60,000; Henderson Naval Base, &#163;60,000; Port Stephens, &#163;5,000; Garden Island, &#163;14,000; Spectacle Island, &#163;1,000; Brisbane, &#163;3,000; Port Lincoln, &#163;3,000; Albany, &#163;3,000, Northern Territory &#163;1,000. Upon machinery and plant at Naval Bases, it is proposed to expend &#163;100,000. The balance due on contracts may be thus summarized : - Poole and Steel, one dredger, &#163;10,625 ; six dump hopper barges, &#163;28,766; and the erection of a dredger from Scotland, &#163;6,500. The other items are - Steam hopper barge, Flinders and Henderson Naval Bases, &#163;22,000; steam tug, Flinders and Henderson Naval Bases, &#163;5,000; suction dredger appliances, which are to be attached to one of the bucket dredges at the Flinders Naval Base, &#163;16,000; and towards cost of new suction dredger at the Henderson Naval Base, &#163;12,000. The last  item relates to the new suction dredger recommended by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Maurice</inline> Fitzmaurice for the Henderson Naval Base. On Cockatoo Island it is estimated that naval engineering works will absorb &#163;100,000, and machines &#163;40,000. Yesterday we received the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Maurice</inline> Fitzmaurice on the proposed work at the Henderson Naval Base. The arrival of that report will enable a commencement to be made upon the various works set out in the Bill. </para>

                            <para>- I have seen the report, but I have not yet seen the plans. The report, however, mentions that the plans &#34;have been despatched, and, consequently, I assume that they have arrived. The appropriation for Military Stores during the current financial year is &#163;492,800, a decrease of &#163;17,700, as compared with the appropriation for last year. During the year the amount expended under this heading was &#163;416,842, and the sum unexpended &#163;83,658, making a total of &#163;510,500. Of course, the decrease in the expenditure under this heading is rather an unfortunate one, in that there are a certain number of stores which we cannot now obtain, even if we had the money to pay for them. I do not know that there are any other main items in the Bill with which I need deal, but in Committee the Minister representing the particular Department concerned will be glad to give honorable senators any information they may desire in respect of specific votes. </para>

                        <para>. - It is not my intention to deal at length with any of the sub-headings embodied in this Bill. Honorable senators will quite recognise that, in view of the very brief time available to us to assimilate the information which has been presented to us, our criticisms must necessarily be of a more casual than detailed character. But I wish to plead particularly for a little more elasticity in regard to votes for the public works of this country. </para>

                            <para>- Experience has confirmed me in the view which I have frequently expressed here. I quite recognise that these are matters which come more under the heading of administrative reform, and, as they do not appeal very largely to public imagination, there is a tendency&#39; on the part of honorable senators to ignore them. But I am sure that honorable senators must have been frequently irritated at finding that, although provision has been made in a Bill for some specified work to be carried out, owing to the inability of the Department to spend the whole of the money voted for the work within the financial year for which it was voted, a period of time intervenes before the unexpended balance can be re- voted. That, it seems to me, is an utterly  unbusiness-like  proceeding. It arises from the provisions of the Audit Act, which cause the Treasury to adopt what is known as the cash system, that is, that every sum appropriated by Parliament and unexpended on the 30th June, lapses and falls back into the Consolidated Revenue, and, therefore, is no longer available for the purpose for which it was appropriated until it is re- voted. That is, I think, an excellent system so far as it applies to the ordinary Public Service, but when you come to deal with public works a different set of conditions presents itself. I believe that the Minister of Defence will agree with me that a very great deal of the delay which arises in the carrying out of public works is due to the fact that, in practice, there is very little more than six months of the year available to the officers to carry the works through. Here, in the middle of December, we are asked to approve of these items, and I presume that Parliament will do so. There will be only six months of the year in which the Department can spend the money. My experience showed me that, even after Parliament approved of a work, there was, in the acquisition of land and other preliminary details - all essential to the work itself - a considerable consumption of time before the Department was really able to make a start. It frequently happened that these negotiations went on for three or four months. It followed that the Department had only a month or, at the most, two months in which to spend the money, and, being brought face to face with the dread 30th June, it was necessary for the Department to hold its hand. That had particular application to the construction of drill halls and rifle ranges. I have a distinct recollection of being warned towards the end of last year of the impossibility of the Department completing certain negotiations and expending the vote within the financial year. Quite a number of cases were held over, not because Parliament turned them down, but because of the inability of getting the negotiations carried through and the money spent within the time prescribed by the Act. I submit that where Parliament has decided that a certain sum shall be appropriated for a. specific work, there is no reason why, if that money is not spent on the 30th June, the work should be brought to a standstill. </para>

                            <para>- Probably not. In most of these cases - drill halls, for instance - it is a lump sum which Parliament appropriates. When Parliament has finally approved of a sum being hypothecated for the purpose of a par.ticular work, there is no reason why, because of some apparently unavoidable delays, the Department should be required to hold its hand. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. I know at once the difficulty that will be raised when anybody attempts to bring about a reform in which the general body of electors are not concerned. I know that the Treasury officials will be bitterly opposed to this proposal, possibly to any other proposal, for a change. Without going to the extreme of resorting to the practice which prevailed in New South Wales for many years, and, so far as I know, in other States, of saying that, where a sum of money is voted, it shall remain appropriated for that purpose for all time, what I suggest for the consideration of the Senate and the Government is that there might be a provision that the money shall remain available for the work for three or six months after the end of the financial year. That period would ordinarily give Parliament time to deal with the Estimates for the next year, and, without bringing the work of construction to a standstill would also secure to Parliament the opportunity of revising its previous decision. For the last four or five months I venture to say that the works I refer to have been,, if not brought to a standstill, proceeding slowly. It is known to everybody that Parliament will make provision for a certain work, yet, until it actually approves of the proposed vote, the Department is nob in a position to proceed. It occurs to me that instead of providing for a special period, it might be better to say, &#34; until the next Estimates are passed.&#34; That would cover up a gap, because there must be a gap between the close of one year and the time when Parliament can make provision for the next year. If the Audit Act were so altered as to provide that the unexpended balance on tha 30th June could still be utilized up to the time when Parliament dealt with the next Works and Buildings Bill, the difficulty I have referred to would disappear. No doubt honorable senators could cite many instances of this difficulty in the localities with which they are familiar. I rose with the view of once again trying to enlist the sympathy of the Senate wit my suggestion. I can see no possible danger of Parliament losing its control over the finances, nor can I see any possible danger of our  officers  getting out of hand or spending recklessly, or in a way in which Parliament would not approve, because the amounts would only be available for the particular work which Parliament had sanctioned. I do trust, although I have made several efforts in this direction before, that honorable senators will come to think that there is some merit in my suggestion, and if they approve of it, I have not the slightest doubt that it will not be very long before their  opinion will make itself felt, even at the doors of the Treasury itself. </para>

                        <para>. -  I desire to refer to what I consider a very important matter. I have asked the Minister of Defence several questions with regard to launching plans prepared before the Department commenced to construct the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane.</inline> Being a practical ship-builder, having seen many vessels launched, and having kept myself in touch with the launching of heavy vessels all over the world, I was desirous of seeing the plans for launching the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane,</inline> and the Minister, by his answers to my questions, would lead the Senate to believe that such plans are not in existence. I have seen the plans, and they were sent to the Navy Office in Melbourne in May, 1913, for approval or otherwise. The Minister may not have seen the plans. The political troubles that arose later may have caused some delay; but to say that the Department has. no knowledge&#39; of plans is an equivocation. It is not a fair answer to give to a senator who represents the people of a State. The Minister has said that he has given his consent to the construction of what they call a coffer-dam, but what is practically a permanent dock with a caisson. I have not seen the plans of the coffer-dam, but I understand that it is to be a permanent structure. We have not known such a thing to be built in any part of the world for the purpose of launching a vessel. There was a time in the history of ship-building when it was necessary to build a dam - that was before diving gear was perfected to the extent that it is now. Concrete is now laid under the water, excavations are made in hard rock, and everything that is necessary is done. It has been stated that the coffer-dam is estimated to cost &#163;32,000, and the steel caisson, which means an entrance to the dam, is estimated to cost &#163;3,000. I believe that the statement is correct, but I could not get any information from the source where I should have been able to get it. The estimated cost in these cases is generally much below the actual cost. I shall try to show that the money will be actually thrown into the sea. The structure that was proposed tt&#62; be built by the late manager of the dock to launch the vessel would have been of a permanent nature, and would have lasted as long as will that proposed. It is only right that at this time I should draw the attention  of the  Government to the matter, so that  they  can prevent the waste of so mucin, money. This is a time when we should, endeavour to get the cruiser to sea as&#39; quickly as possible. The war may last for twelve months, or for two years <inline font-style="italic">as</inline> more, and this vessel could be launched and sent to sea well within that period- Her boilers have been finished for some time, and are being used to supply the motive power at Cockatoo Dock. The manager says that he could, not. help that; the Government would not  give-  him the power he needed, and he had to use something. The engines for the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> are ready, and I believe that  the  armament is here too. If that is so, there are sufficient workmen in Australia  today  who could get the cruiser ready for sea in a very few months. When  I waa  secretary of the Iron Ship-builders Union I always kept, for the information, of the Imperial authorities, a list o$ the whole of the mechanics available ixa Australia, because the authorities predicted that at some time or other war vessels would be damaged near Australia* and therefore they desired to know  how many  men would be at their disposal when such an emergency occurred. If  th&#174; <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> were launched quickly she COUld be placed in commission in the course &#169;ST a very few months. Nobody would  ba  prouder than myself to see an Australian constructed vessel at sea assisting in  the  good work being done by the other boats. The Minister has said that the work wilE take nine months. I have an estimate, obtained from other sources, that the  work,  will take fifteen months. We can say  that  it will occupy eighteen months. That is a matter which should not be lost sight <inline font-style="italic">oS</inline> at the present moment. I shall take a further opportunity to deal with this  question,  but I think this is the time when I should prove my word that the cruiser can be launched without the building <inline font-style="italic">o&#163;</inline> a coffer-dam, and launched in ninety days, at a cost of &#163;3,000, by the building of a launching structure equally as permanent as the proposed dam. Before: the Department undertook  to  build  tha  vessel they saw that there might  be soma  difficulty in the launching of her.  The  late manager was a .competent engineer. He was construction engineer for  the State  Government for many years.  He designed  and constructed some of the largest  engineering works in Australia, and be never made a mistake. He might have been out a little sometimes, when a job was nearly finished, but after a job was permanently finished it always turned out to be good work. This gentleman is a mechanical engineer; he was taken from the work of designing engineer for the State Government for the purpose of reconstructing Cockatoo Island Dock and putting it on a fair business footing, which, I may say, he did.  His  idea then was to go in for the work of war-shipbuilding; it was the aim of his lifetime, and, although the Government, in February, 1913, decided that he was not to get the position of manager, they allowed him to put in an application. That was a most unfair and unjust thing. This man&#39;s performances as an engineer were far beyond those of any person who applied for this position, either in the Old Country or in Australia. When no one in Australia could build a dredge that was required for the Victorian Government, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cutler</inline> stepped into the breach, and built it. At one time, a boat that would carry 175 tons on a draught of 4 ft. 6 in. in order to cross th bar of one of our rivers was required. A vessel was brought from the Old Country, and it was found that she drew 5 ft. 6 in. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cutler</inline> built the <inline font-style="italic">Amphion,</inline> that carried 175 tons on a draught of 4 ft. 6 in. All these engineering difficulties have been overcome by this man. The authorities of the time tried to send <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cutler</inline> away from Cockatoo Island discredited as an engineer, but they were unable to do so. They now try to discredit him by inviting people to believe that he did not make adequate provision for the launching of the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane.</inline> I can give a few figures in this connexion which will show that I know what I am talking about. H.M.S. <inline font-style="italic">Dartmouth</inline> was launched some time ago at Barrow-in-Furness.  Her  launching weight was 2,695 tons. This represented a. pressure of 1.54 tons on each foot of the launching ways. The draught of the <inline font-style="italic">Dartmouth</inline> was 7 feet, and at the end of the ways the depth of water was 8 ft. 11 in., which allowed the vessel to have a drop of 1 foot. I have seen boats launched with a drop of 4 feet. A drop of 1 foot is a mere nothing, because the vessel is practically afloat when she drops from the ways. The cruiser <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> would have a launching weight of 2,664 tons, and the weight per foot on the launching ways would be 1.52 tons, or very nearly the same as that in the case of the <inline font-style="italic">Dartmouth.She</inline> will draw 7 ft. 6 in., and, if she were launched as proposed, the depth of water at the end of her ways would be 7 ft. 8 in., which would allow of a drop of from 6 to 8 inches. That shows that it was proposed to take even greater care than was taken in the case of the <inline font-style="italic">Dartmouth,</inline> so that no accident might happen. I have seen the estimates for the launching of these two vessels. Although I am no longer following the trade, I keep myself in touch with these things, and there is scarcely a launch in the Old Country that I do not get an account of. The present manager of the Cockatoo Island dock has had to have an engineer sent to him. The manager is not an engineer at all, nor does he profess to be one. He says that he is not an engineer, but a draughtsman and a naval architect. As such, he does not require to have the qualifications of an engineer. I shall not say anything about this gentleman, who, I believe, is trying to do his best. The Minister has said that he has approved of a modified scheme. I do not know what that means. The manager&#39;s plan is to build a concrete wall round the end of the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> out into the water for 30 feet. The wall is to be supplied with a caisson, or opening like a door. The intention is to build a dock and to Have the caisson taken up to let the water in. It may be a good enough plan, but the work is urgent, and to carry out this plan will take fifteen months, and will cost &#163;35,000. That, in my opinion, will mean a waste of money and a scandalous waste of time in getting the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> into commission. What is proposed to be constructed is not a coffer-dam. It has been misnamed. A reference to a dictionary will show that a coffer-dam is a construction built round a vessel with piles and packed up with bags, so that the water may be taken out to make necessary repairs. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, a temporary expedient. What is proposed in this case is not a coffer-dam, but a launching dock. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cutler,</inline> in the plan he submitted, proposed to lay solid concrete until he got to a depth of 4 ft. 6 in. at low tide at the end of the concrete formation. After that, he proposed to put piles into the solid rock to carry his ways out 30 feet. He proposed to put in two piles immediately after the concrete formation, with a crosshead of hardwood. Each of the piles was estimated &#39;to carry three times the weight it would be asked to carry in the launching of the vessel, and with the crosshead of timber it would carry ten times the estimated weight required. Having put down two piles for about half the distance, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cutler</inline> proposed to put down three piles for the rest of the distance, not because they were necessary, but to make quite certain that everything would be secure. He proposed to have a hardwood beam across the three piles in the same way as across the two piles until he reached a depth of 7 ft. 8 in. for the launching. It was proposed that the piles should be embedded in the hard rock. Holes would be drilled for them in the rock ; the piles would be settled in the holes, and then concreted. The ways for the launching of the <inline font-style="italic">Dartmouth</inline> were constructed of Oregon, the timber generally used for the purpose. I have never seen hardwood used for this purpose; but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cutler</inline> proposed to use hardwood for the launching ways of the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane.</inline> That would make the ways still better and stronger. As one who knows something about this work, I have not the. slightest doubt that it could be done in the space of three months, .and the launching ways constructed on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cutler&#39;s</inline> plan would be as strong, and would last as long, as the structure proposed by the present manager of the dock. It is unfair that the people of the Commonwealth should be asked to spend such a large sum for the purpose of launching this vessel, when the greater part of this expense might be avoided. I have been surprised to learn that the departmental authorities say that these plans are not in existence. They are in existence. I have seen the tracings and the estimates of cost. I could not get them in a legitimate way, and I had to get them in some other way. </para>

                            <para>- It was &#163;3,000. There is a very general idea that it is impossible to grease the ways in the water. It is, of course, always better that they should be greased dry -where that can be done. The ways which the late manager of the dock proposed to put down could have been easily greased dry, and made ready for the launching. There is a way in which it could be done, but I am not going to say what it is, because that would not be fair. I am prepared to explain the matter to any honorable senator confidentially. Men in leading positions who have been brought here from the Old Country have been disgusted with what is being done at the dock. One of them has taken his passage back for the 19th of the month. They are anxious that the vessel should be launched, but they laugh at the present manager&#39;s scheme because of the cost and the delay it must involve. It is unfair that it should be undertaken without a proper inquiry. I guarantee that any outside firm that knows its business could launch the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> in ninety days, the time I have stated. It is not necessary that any firm should be brought in to assist us to launch this vessel. We have men at present in the dockyard capable of doing the work. Every time that a complaint has been made of the delay in the construction of the ship, the fault has been attributed to the workmen. The fault has never been that of the workmen. When the construction of the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> was in full swing, the men at work upon her raised a better average of completed ironwork per week than the average in the Old Country. </para>

                            <para>- There would be no responsibility if the men who undertook the work knew their business. I have not very much money, but I should be prepared to put it all up, and take tha responsibility of carrying out the work as I have said it can be carried out. In the Old Country an average of 50 tons of completed ironwork is considered good work in the ship-building yards for the number of men engaged in the construction of the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane.</inline> When the construction of that vessel was in full swing, the completed ironwork per week reached as high as 64 tons, and the average was over 50 tons. Since the new manager took charge of the dock the completed ironwork per week has dropped down, in some instances, to as low as 20 tons. I have here a photograph &#171;f H.M.S. <inline font-style="italic">Queen Mary,</inline> a cruiser battleship, which was launched in 1912 at Jarrow-on-Tyne by Palmers without a coffer-dam. Her launching weight was 10,000 tons, whilst the launching weight of the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> would be 2,664 tons. The <inline font-style="italic">&#39;Queen Mary</inline> was launched, not over a  bottom of solid rock, but over a mud bank, and I guarantee that it did not cost more than &#163;3,000 to launch her. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister forgets that they do not drag them at all; they launch them. There must be a solid foundation for the ways, and it is  more  difficult to secure that where there is a mud bottom than where there is a -rock bottom. Apparently this country is <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> be committed to an expenditure of $35,000 to launch a vessel of 2,664 tons. I take this opportunity to enter my protest against it. I may have something further to say later; but I may say now &#163;hat, though the timber has been ordered for the work, it could be used for other purposes. I do not wish <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> quarrel with the Minister in connexion with this subject. The present as not a good time to be talking about matter&#39;s of the kind, and I am fully seized of the fact that this is an incident &#177;hat we ought to keep to ourselves. I saw  the  Minister privately, and told him there was another way of doing the work, and lie expressed the hope that I would show Mm how, but I did not have the opportunity. There should be no necessity <inline font-style="italic">for</inline> any showing, because the plan is there. I kept quiet about the matter until it was brought forward in another place, and it is only fair, now that it is before the public, that I should explain <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> position as I have done to-day. </para>

                        once more Impress upon this Chamber how little control we really have over the public finances. In saying that, I do not claim do have made an original discovery, be cause, as a matter of fact, it is an annual complaint. Whatever party is in power the present system makes it quite impossible for either side to make any careful or critical examination of the public finances. I came to the conclusion long ago that it was the system that was at fault, and it is. the system that we must change if we are ever to have a better control of the finances. One step has been made in that direction in the formation of a Public Accounts Committee, but we want more than either a Public Accounts Committee or a Public Works Committee. A Works Committee could very well have taken action in the matter which
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline>
                        brought forward to-day, but, after all, it would have very little control of the finances. This new Works Bill is introduced, just as most money Bills are introduced here, with a hint that it is important that it should be passed through all its stages as rapidly as possible. If any honorable senator rises and criticises it, or takes any length of time in discussing it, he &#34;is scowled at as if he were guilty of an impertinence.

                        <para>- If this occasion is any different from the many others of which I have had experience, I shall have to &#34; chalk it up.&#34; The Minister knows full well that what I have said is an absolute fact. We are told when a Supply Bill is brought forward that the civil servants are practically waiting at the paymaster&#39;s door for their salary, and that unless the Bill is pushed through the great calamity of the civil- servants not being paid next day, or the day after, will befall us. The time has come for us to try to do the duty that we are sent here, and expected, to perform in a much more businesslike way than has been the case in the past. They do things much better in the United States of America. The Senate there has what are known as financial committees which retain control of the financial affairs during the whole year, and are, therefore, familiar with what is going on. Both sides of the House are represented upon them, as is only proper, because by that means members of both parties are in a position to know something about financial matters when they come forward for public discussion. We have a Constitution based to some extent on the American model, and we might well copy the American example in this regard. At present we know only so much about the public finances as each Department likes to let us know. We may ask questions and try to fossick out information which is absolutely necessary to enable us to handle questions properly, but we get just the kind of answer that the heads of the Departments choose to give us. The heads of the Departments have really more control over the public funds than have members of Parliament, who are sent here by the people of the country to look after that matter. How long, I ask again, are we to be humbugged by this system ? Here is a Bill in which we are asked to sanction the expenditure of over &#163;4,000,000, and honorable senators must admit that they know practically nothing about the proposed expenditure; nor have they any effective means of obtaining information. There are three Ministers in . this Chamber - and I am not reflecting upon them - but only one of them has the responsibility of a Department. The others represent Departments, so to speak, by proxy, and have to seek information from the officials or from the responsible Ministers. Has any Minister - particularly the Minister of Defence at this juncture - the time to devote to the financial side of his Department whilst attending to his other administrative work ? It is quite beyond the power of any man to do it. When we seek for information here, the Minister gets it second-hand from an official behind him. Where the official gets it from we have to guess. It is, apparently, passed on from one person to another in such an off-handed way that the responsibility really rests with nobody. Yet the Senate has to take the responsibility of passing the Bill. It is responsible to the country; but, owing to the system that we have so long followed, it is utterly impossible for us to make anything like a careful or critical examination of the public accounts. Is it not possible for us to secure control over the finances the whole year round ? This measure is rushed in only a few days before we expect to break up for our Christmas vacation. There is on the stocks another Bill for the expenditure of over &#163;37,000,000. We are asked to sanction all this enormous expenditure in a few days, and it must be admitted that we know little or nothing about it. A Committee on the lines of those in the United States Congress would be able to make itself familiar with the position. It would sit from time to time during the year, and when matters came forward here we could give them proper consideration. </para>

                            <para>- It is, in a way, but it has not the same representation in Parliament as our Cabinet has. Still, that is no reason why we should be always without proper control of the finances. If the Minister can explain all the details of the present enormous defence expenditure, he will be a financial wonder. </para>

It is the system that is at fault, and what I am saying has been said in different ways for the last fourteen years in this Chamber. We have to take up and study money Bills of this kind while the Minister is speaking on&#39; them. During that brief period, we are expected to learn all about them. If any honorable senator thinks he can grasp matters of this kind thoroughly in that way, I am afraid he is somewhat innocent, and does not appreciate his responsibilities. </para>

                    <para>Sena-tor STEWART. - Time and again I have done everything in my power to arouse honorable senators to a sense of their responsibility in connexion with this matter, and I am sure that the Leader of the Opposition has .never given me the slightest assistance in that direction. I can recollect when he himself was a member of a Government, and when the only desire he exhibited in regard to the Estimates was to get them through as quickly as possible, and with as little discussion as possible. </para>

                            <para>- And he succeeded, just as every other Minister succeeds. But I do not think anybody will admit that that is a desirable state of affairs. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has pointed out - and as I have stated here dozens of times - the control of public expenditure has passed completely out of the hands of Parliament. I doubt very much whether responsible Ministers themselves exercise much control over it. Indeed, I doubt if the Treasurer himself has any control over it. I have come to the conclusion that the permanent officials of the various Departments rule the roost, and I, for one, am not satisfied with that position. The people sent us here, not merely to enact legislation, and to levy taxation, but to keep a keen eye upon expenditure. We are not doing that, and I do not know that we can do it under existing conditions. It is quite within the bounds of possibility, however, that if we cast about for a method which will afford us some control over the finances of the Commonwealth, that method will be found. What is the position in regard to the Estimates for the year? In the ordinary parliamentary year, honorable senators sit here from some time in June till close upon Christmas. When do the Estimates come before Parliament? In the closing hours of the session. I make this statement deliberately - that every Government, of set purpose, hold back their Estimates in  order thai, there may be no time for discussion of them. When the Deakin Government and the Reid Government were in office, I used to complain of this. I fondly imagined that when a Labour Government came into power things would be altogether different. But to my consternation and infinite disgust I found that the first Labour Government OUtHeroded Herod. I discovered that, bad as were the  so-called Liberal Governments, a Labour Government were infinitely worse. That is a lamentable confession to make. But I am now at the penitent-stool. I am confessing my sins and the sins of other people probably. I protested against the Estimates being passed without consideration. But we were threatened by a Government composed of members of the Labour party - a party which had always protested against all-night sittings, and against the enactment of legislation under physical conditions* which rendered it impossible for honorable senators to give careful consideration to the business in hand - that the Senate would be kept sitting until the Estimates were put through. Now I am not as young as I used to be, and I am not as able to take part in a &#34; stone-wall n as I was twenty years ago. </para>

                            <para>- I beg the honorable senator&#39;s pardon; I am not. When it comes to a question of physical endurance, the interests of the people must go by the board. Before the present Estimates are passed, I suppose honorable senators will be asked to take part in an all-night sitting. Why should that be the case? It is ridiculous. It is against the public interest. Such a proceeding brings us down to the position that no control can be exercised over our expenditure. We do not know anything about it, and we appear to care just about as much. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie that some change is imperative, unless this Parliament is to completely lose the confidence of the people. I do not know whether the United States of America&#39;s system of committees would be a better one than our own, although anything would appear to be better than the existing system. </para>

Those plans, I am informed, were in existence, and yet the Department professes to know nothing whatever about them. I think that is a most extraordinary state of affairs. If the plans were ever in the Department there ought to be a record of them, and if they were not, the man who says that they were is a liar. We ought to know the facts. There seems to be something sinister about the way in which our Defence Department is conducted. I have never had much respect for the man-- </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly he is, very handy, but I have never had very much respect for his methods. We have found, in England, Prance, and other countries - I do not refer to Australia - scandals by the score in regard to military expenditure. I do not insinuate that anything of the kind has ever taken place in the Commonwealth. But we have had occurrences - more especially in connexion with our Naval administration - which seem to me to savour of something which is extremely undesirable. We had at one time, I believe, three men who were charged very largely with the administration of our Naval affairs, and who would not speak to each other. They declined to confer with each other. </para>

                            <para>- I wonder if the honorable senator were the owner of a large business, and if he had appointed three managers whom he held responsible for its conduct, what he would do if he discovered that they would not speak to each other, that they would not consult each other, and that they would hold no communication with each other? He would simply summon them before him and dismiss them. That is what he would do if he happened to be a wise man. Yet that is exactly the position in which the Naval Board found itself at one time. The very fact that men in that frame of mind were allowed to carry on their mischievous pranks and yet remain in the Public Service, is evidence to me that there is something unsatisfactory and something which ought to be removed in connexion with our Defence Department. We want the cruiser <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> to be launched as speedily as possible, so that she &#39;may be of use to us should her services be required. According to the Defence Department she cannot be launched in less than fifteen months. Now, upon an occasion like the present, I hold that time is the essence of the contract. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> has said that this vessel can be launched in ninety days </para>

I am sick and tired of the Naval and Military bureaucracy which is being established in Australia. Of course, we cannot do without soldiers and sailors in times of stress. But we must not allow them to &#39;run away with our affairs. We must keep a firm hand on them, otherwise we shall land ourselves in an extreme difficulty. We ought to try to recover the control of our national expenditure. How this can be accomplished is not clear to me at the present moment, but I think that some such system of committees as prevails in the United States of America would be a most decided advantage. </para>

In any case, the whole position is most unsatisfactory - to me, at any rate. I am here as a  representative  of the people, paid to look after their interests, yet I have no more control over the expenditure of this huge sum than a man in the street, who has no responsibility at all. I think that the sooner we have a change, the better; I shall welcome it, at any rate, and hope that it will come at an early date. </para>

                        <para>. - A little time ago I took advantage of an opportunity to visit Cockatoo Island, mainly with the view of seeing what was being done with regard to the cruiser <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane.</inline> I was astonished to find that instead of the boat being constructed on ways, she was being constructed on blocks. I was still more astonished to learn that it would probably cost &#163;35,000 to launch her. On my return I endeavoured to extract from the Minister some information on the subject. I asked him if he would furnish us with the approximate cost of constructing the ways, but for some reason - and I strongly resent his action - he refused to supply the information. Apparently it was not then quite available, but since that time we have been told officially that the cost of launching the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> will be some &#163;35,000. To my mind that is an item which ought not to be passed by the Senate. It is not quite clear to me, from the Minister&#39;s replies, what is meant exactly by the construction of the coffer-dam. If it is intended to construct the dam so that the ways may be built while the dam is there, that may be a fairly good method of doing the business, but of that I am not quite sure. I challenge any one to deny that the cruiser is completed and could be launched to-morrow if the ways were in existence. To have a warship completed and not launched while the Empire is at war seems to me a most scandalous state of things. The Minister, I think, ought to institute a searching inquiry, and to take steps to insure that the cruiser shall be launched and put into commission very much earlier than nine months hence. In regard to the item for Garden Island, I am told that the authorities  there refuse to employ competent tradesmen unless they are prepared to submit themselves to medical examination. I contend that tradesmen in Sydney who have been working there all their lives, and have proved their competency, ought not to be subjected, by the direction of the Commonwealth, to any medical examination. If competent men are prepared to perform the work required from them in an efficient manner, as unquestionably they are, they ought to secure employment without having to undergo a medical test. </para>

                            <para>- I am speaking of the casual men who are fitting up the troop-ships. Several men have complained to me that they were refused employment at the Island simply because they were suffering from a slight ailment which in no way detracted from their fitness to do their work. The men informed me that they had been employed by contractors in the State for practically all their lives, but when temporary work was available at Garden Island they had to submit themselves to a medical examination, and because they suffered from a slight ailment, which, as I said, in no way detracted from their fitness to work, they were refused employment. I know of two such cases. I believe that on representations being made to the general manager, one of the men was employed, and has given satisfaction, and it is possible that the other man has been engaged, too. This is a proceeding which ought to be stopped. I trust that the Minister will issue instructions directing the general manager to discontinue the medical examination of those desiring temporary employment. I have been trying to get some information in regard to the work being done at Canberra, for which we are asked to vote over &#163;270,000. That is not much. So far as I can see, the work is progressing in a fairly satisfactory manner. But there is one thing which is exercising a very detrimental effect on the operations. The plans for the building of the city are not yet completed. It must be several years since designs for the Capital were called for. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffin</inline> is now working on these plans. I understand, too, that the levels of the main thorough fares are known, and that a very large number of men could be employed on the work straight away, and that any work done would be of a permanent character.  If that is so, it is unfair that the work should be hung up until the levels of all the streets and the byways of the Capital are made available. The Minister should see that the work at the Federal Capital is proceeded with in a satisfactory manner. It was provided in the Constitution that the Seat of Government should be fixed in New South Wales, and certainly no time limit was laid down. I do not think that the compact is being kept. Obstacles ought not to be placed in the way of carrying out that provision of the Constitution. I join with other honorable senators in stating that the Senate ought to be furnished with more information&#34; with regard to the items covered by this Bill. It seems to me extraordinary to be asked to vote &#163;4,140,345 on the meagre information placed at our disposal. I trust that in future the Estimates for works and buildings will be placed in our hands at an early period of the session, and that full detailed information will be supplied. </para>

                        <para>. - Apparently some of the older senators are not apprised of their responsibilities. We had a dissertation from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> but I think I have heard it uttered here before. I take it that if an improper expenditure is submitted, it is my duty to challenge the item, and to put on the Senate the responsibility of saying whether the expenditure shall be incurred. If honorable senators are prepared to allow the Estimates to go by default, they necessarily accept that responsibility. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> has referred to a certain item.  His  speech aroused in my mind a suspicion that there must be something wrong. He has stated that the particular work could be carried out for a tenth of the sum which is included in the Bill. As a man who understands the business, it is his duty to submit a proposal to reduce the amount, and then it will be for the Senate to be satisfied as to whether he or the Department is right. </para>

                            <para>- I quite understand that. My point is that a responsibility rests upon every individual senator, and that it is of no use for any one to try to &#34;shirk his duty. If honorable senators are prepared to take the responsibility out of the hands of the Government and reduce the amount of any item, it is their duty to take that course. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not wish to enter into the general discussion, because I believe that at the present juncture, when we are &#171;o near a long adjournment, it would be occupying time without much benefit. It might be more appropriate to the consideration of the Works and Buildings Bill than to the consideration of the finances generally. It seems to me very clear that the Parliament, as a whole, has very little control over the expenditure it sanctions, but mere mourning over the fact will not do away with the evil. In my opinion, there has not been a workable proposition brought forward either to minimize the evil or to remove it. We have the power if we choose to exercise it. A discussion of this kind usually comes at an inopportune time. In other words, it comes at such a time that we feel that it would be disastrous to delay the financial proposals in order to effect the remedy which we believe should be made. I think that the issue would be  better raised by a distinct proposition made early in the session, and dealing with the finances in such a way that the different sections could be referred to committees, which would investigate the proposed expenditures. It seems to me that the Committee of Public Accounts, which has just been created, will only go over the ground which the Auditor-General must pass over again . Very little real good can come out of the Committee unless it takes up this wider sphere of work, and if it does, possibly, there may be a chance of the Parliament regaining the control of the finances which it held originally. </para>

                            <para>- Nominally it has, but virtually it has not, because it does not proceed along the right lines to maintain its power. Originally, before the grant was made to the King, the representatives of different parts of his dominions took occasion to mention any grievances they had. That principle of the redress of grievances before granting supply is at the root of all our financial administration. But we have ceased to make these complaints. We are merely asked to consider whether it is desirable that a certain grant should be made, and that presupposes that we are acquainted with the work upon which the money is to be expended. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister did not refer to the general question, but he did refer to the specific question contained in the Bill. We have before us a Works and Buildings Bill involving an expenditure of something like &#163;4,000,000. I do not speak in the spirit of complaint, but to emphasize the fact that the information received by the Senate is not such that it should receive, though I admit that it is perhaps no less full or definite than the information given on previous occasions of the kind. The money for which the Government are asking covers so many kinds of expenditure that honorable senators should be in possession of more information as to the way in which it is to be spent than they have so far received. I am prepared to admit that the present circumstances are extraordinary: that it is not long since Parliament assembled, and that it is necessary before we adjourn to pass the measure and others of a similar character. My point is that even in ordinary circumstances honorable senators are losing their control of the expenditure of public money. It is being transferred from Parliament to the heads of the different Departments. These gentlemen now make out bills of costs. They say to the Government, &#34; We want so much for next year.&#34; The Ministers concerned pin their requests together, send them on to the Senate, and say, &#34; Pass these, or we shall have an all-night sitting.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- It is to be regretted that the honorable senator should tell tales that have no truth in them. When the last Estimates were before the Senate, I called attention to a very much-needed work of telephonic extension between Victor Harbour and Inman Valley. I tried to get some information on the subject at the time, but could get very little. From inquiries I have since made, I have learned that no progress has been made with the work. There are many outside places requiring better facilities of communication, and the inhabitants of the districts concerned have approached the Post and Telegraph Department, and have expressed themselves as prepared to assist in securing the improved communication they desire. I bring the matter again before the Senate in the hope that the Minister presenting the Postmaster-General will look into it and see that something is done to remedy this grievance. During the <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> of the last Fisher Government a piece of land, situated at Mount Gambier, was taken over from the South Australian Government to be used as a rifle range. It was part of what was known as the  Moorac  Homestead. I have learned that this piece of land has since been disposed of to a private individual, although there is not in the district another area of land equally suitable for a rifle range. The price for which the land has been disposed of is a ridiculously low one. No land of equal value and as near to the town of Mount Gambier has been sold at such a low price for the last twenty-five years. I should like to know why and by whose authority this land has been sold. Blame in the matter rests upon some one, and the person to blame should be exposed. The South Australian Government purchased the  Moorac  Homestead, and, with the exception of this piece of land, disposed of it to agriculturists. This area was particularly suitable for a rifle range, and the Commonwealth Government acquired it for that purpose. The buildings upon the property were useful for military purposes, as the woolshed might have been used for a drill hall, and the area was within a mile of Mount Gambier. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable senators who are interjecting are exposing their lack of information, and the fact that they have never visited this excellent harbor. The Naval authorities have selected it as a sub-base, and that selection immediately stamps it with value. A steamer travels frequently from Port Adelaide to Port Lincoln, and honorable senators would find that Port Lincoln would well repay a visit. They will have to vote money for a sub-base at Port Lincoln, because the natural advantages of the port are such that they cannot be passed over. </para>

                            <para>- It is not a question of beauty. It has beauty, but that is a low plane upon which to look at the matter. The bay alone is from 14 to 20 miles long, with a width of 7 miles, and deep water everywhere near the shores. I saw the <inline font-style="italic">Governor Musgrave</inline> tied right up to the rocks close to where the jetty now stands, and at the stern of the vessel one could have dropped a plummet-line into 50 or 60 feet of water. The whole bay has deep water, and the whole British Navy might easily float in it. The entrance is so protected by islands that the water inside is always perfectly smooth. It is a splendid place for a Naval subbase. </para>

                            <para>- My contention is that, as it has been selected by the Naval authorities as a sub-base, something more than a paltry &#163;100 should be spent there in twelve months. The amount set down for it is ridiculously small, and I should be wanting in my duty as a representative of South Australia if I did not call attention to the fact that its claims are being overlooked. I have no doubt that had Port Lincoln been in New South Wales, Queensland, or possibly Western Australia, it would have been made more than a sub-base. It is strategically very valuable ; it lies midway between Victoria and Western Australia, and it is absolutely safe, because, if the Navy were in it, no enemy could possibly reach them. </para>

                            <para>- There could be no danger of sudden attack. It will be a reflection on us if we do not push on with this work. I have brought the matter under the&#39; notice of the Minister of Defence for the reasons I have given, and because of the need of employment. The splendid position of the harbor would fully justify the Government in spending much more on it than they have provided for the current financial year. </para>

                        <para>. - Some comment is requisite on the very strong statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall.</inline> There has been a good deal of talk about the great delay that has taken place in the launching of the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane,</inline> whose services would be very valuable during the present war if she were on the high seas. It is idle for honorable senators to assume that the Senate has not sufficient power to deal with the matter - to bewail, so to speak, their sad legislative fate. The Senate has the most ample powers of veto and suggestion in regard to any proposal involving the expenditure of public money.&#39; Honorable senators did not seem to relish the free-and-easy reference I made to the Caucus; but this matter adds to the arguments against the very existence and conception of the Caucus. </para>

                            <para>- I refer to the weekly joint sitting of the members of the Labour party, who belong to this and another place. A matter of this kind, so serious as to justify the remarks made by honorable senators here to-day, is not dealt with by members of the Labour party at their weekly Caucus. All they talk about there is the iniquities of the Liberal party, and the mythical schemes that are alleged to be forming in the minds of the Liberal members for the benefit of that individual, who is collectively and superciliously referred to as the &#34;fat man.&#34; That is the sort of thing with which we are regaled. </para>

                            <para>- I presume we shall hear a deliverance from the Minister on the question, .the importance of which I am sure he realizes. It is a very common thing for a working man - and I am a working man - to assume all-round competency in regard to matters of this kind. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, who has had some knowledge of mining, will, perhaps, have had the same experience as I have had. I have known mines to be managed by men of high professional qualifications with very moderate success, and I have heard miners, who are quite competent to give an opinion on the practical side of mining, assert, individually and collectively, that the mines have been mismanaged, and that if they were handed over to a committee representing the miners, large profits would be made, because the expert managers who had looked after the affairs of the company for many years were not competent, or had allowed runs of profitable stone to be passed by. Since the war, in one or two cases, mines, regarding which such statements have been made, have been handed over - and properly so in order to keep the wheels of industry going - to committees of working men, and I am sorry to say that so far from their criticism of the experts being borne out by results, the mines have had to shut down after a very short period of exploitation at the hands of the miners&#39; committees. This shows that very often the working man is not as competent as he thinks he is to criticize the experts who direct operations. </para>

                            <para>- I want to show that working men are not always quite as competent to judge the plans of those above them as they think they are. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> has some practical, if not professional, knowledge in the matter, and has made some very strong statements. He has not only submitted certain evidence, but has committed himself to an indorsement of the opinions of certain working men engaged at Cockatoo Island in connexion with the construction of the cruiser and its subsequent launching. He seems to have been left to ventilate the matter, which does not appear to have been discussed by the Labour party. It is idle for the Senate to shelter itself behind any assertion of limited power. It has full power if it is resolute enough to provoke and compel an investigation. I tell the predominant party in the Senate to its individual and collective teeth, that it has ample power to have <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall&#39;s</inline> allegations carefully investigated, and it can take action on this item to force an investigation. It is of no use for us to shelter ourselves behind any milk and water statement that the accounts are not properly presented, or that full information is not supplied. It is up to the Administration, and up to the predominant party, to secure a complete and whole-souled investigation of the allegation that this item of expenditure is undesirable, and that the result which it is sought to obtain through its means can be achieved in a much shorter period at a comparatively small cost. I do not at once commit myself to an indorsement of the views expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall.</inline> But if the Minister is possessed of that ability with which we are all ready to credit him, and if he has fortified himself with the opinions of experts on this matter, it is certainly up to him - to use an Australian phrase - to tell us what he thinks of the honorable senator&#39;s allegations. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> has the courage of his convictions he is at liberty to take similar action to that which was taken a few weeks ago by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turley.</inline> It is within his power to move that this particular item be reduced by &#163;1. If his party has investigated the matter, and if they think his personal qualifications entitle his opinions to be received with respect, it is incumbent on his fellow senators to secure a complete inquiry. </para>

                        <para>. - There have been two or three criticisms this afternoon which, to my mind, deserve a little consideration. Since I have had the honour of occupying a seat in this Chamber a number of measures have been submitted of an urgent character, and, consequently, I have been prepared to extend to the Government a little sympathy under existing conditions. We must all recognise that the circumstances under which we have assembled are extraordinary. The present session of Parliament was opened at a very late period of the year, and at a time when we were under the cloud of war - a unique experience for Australia. Since we met many measures have been submitted to us which had to be dealt with in rather a hurried fashion. But this afternoon Senators de Largie and Stewart have complained that the business of this Chamber is getting out of the hands of honorable senators - in other words, that it is being conducted by the heads of Departments rather than by members of the Senate and of the Government. To my mind, the Leader of the Opposition made a very sensible suggestion this afternoon when he stressed the wisdom of providing that unexpended votes should not lapse at the close of the financial year, but should be utilized to enable works to be proceeded with without interruption. In reference to Parliament exercising control over the finances of the Commonwealth, it has been suggested that we might appoint a Finance Committee. I am not sure whether the adoption of that course would prove of very great advantage. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> has suggested that an improvement would be effected if the Estimates were presented to Parliament earlier, so that more time might be afforded for their consideration. We might then practically constitute ourselves a committee to inquire into them. </para>

I think there is a good deal of excuse for the Government in regard to these matters because of the very abnormal times in which we are living.

Unless strong evidence be forthcoming in rebuttal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall&#39;s</inline> statement, a good many honorable senators will vote in favour of delaying the expenditure of the large sum  of money which will be involved in the launching of the cruiser <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane.</inline> I hope that the Minister will recognise the necessity of supplying us with as full information as he has in his possession, so as to enable us to arrive at a conclusion upon this matter. </para>

                        <para>. - Before the motion for the second reading of the Bill is carried, I desire to say a few words, particularly in regard to the launching of the cruiser <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> at Cockatoo Island. The item to which I specially wish to refer is that of &#34; Naval engineering works, &#163;100,000.&#34; From what I can gather, the construction of a coffer-dam to enable the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> to be launched will cost &#163;35,000. If that information be correct, I confess that to me it is astonishing. To my mind, it is &#163;35,000 wasted, because I know of no other occasion on which the construction of such a dam has been rendered necessary in any part of the shipbuilding world in which I have had shipbuilding experience. I am also assured that this is not merely to be a coffer-dam, but is to partake of the nature of a caisson. I am exercised in mind as to the necessity for constructing this caisson or coffer-dam. It is true that it has been recommended to the Department by experts. On this occasion, however, I fear that the experts have made a mistake. When the Minister is replying to the criticism that has been levelled against the proposed outlay, I trust that he will be able to quote some instance in other parts of the shipbuilding world, as, for example, on the Clyde, in Scotland; Barrow-in-Furness, in the north of England; the River Tyne or Ardrossan and Leith, in Scotland, in which a similar undertaking has been carried out. In all these places vessels are built, from the smallest yacht of 10 tons to ships of 10,000 tons of launching weight; and if he can cite a single instance in which there has been need to construct a coffer-dam to enable these vessels to be launched I shall be inclined to support the departmental position. When this Parliament is asked to vote &#163;35,000 for the construction of a cofferdam in order to enable the cruiser <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> to be launched, I am of the opinion that there is a screw loose somewhere. Let me instance the launching pf the H.M.S. <inline font-style="italic">Ramillies,</inline> one of the first class battleships built to the order of the Imperial Government at the Clydebank Shipbuilding Yard in 1S93 or 1894. The launching weight of that vessel was something like 10,000 tons. She was one of four battleships, orders for the construction of which were placed by the Admiralty at that time. One of these vessels was built at the Fairfield Engineering Works, and two others in the Admiralty yards. &#39; In the building of such vessels it is customary for the foreman carpenter to be held responsible for arranging the- declivity of the launching ways. Indeed, he is entirely responsible for the construction of the vessel from keel to truck, and for her landing safely in the water. But in the construction of H.M.S. <inline font-style="italic">Ramillies,</inline> an expert from the Admiralty superseded the foreman carpenter, and entirely upset his plans regarding the declivity of the launching ways. With what result? From the moment the hydraulic button was touched until the vessel actually reached the water no less than two hours elapsed. Why? Simply because sufficient declivity had not been allowed for. If the vessel had not reached the water safely, probably the reputation of the expert in question would have been ruined. That was the only occasion in the history of shipbuilding on the Clyde on which delay occurred in the launching of a vessel. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator referred to the fact that working miners sometimes know better how to work the mines in which they were employed than do the owners. As a result of their practical experience, working men very often have a better knowledge of these matters than has the theorist who is the expert. I think it would be wrong for us to vote the amount which we are asked to vote in connexion with this matter in the absence of a full and clear statement from the Minister, who, I recognise, has to be guided by the advice of his experts. As one who does not claim to be an expert, but who has had a few years&#39; experience as a humble assistant in the building of vessels, and who has read a little, and kept his eyes and ears open, I am waiting for further information before I can honestly vote &#163;35,000 to build a coffer-dam in order that the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane,</inline> may reach the water safely and soundly. I did not have the pleasure of hearing the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall,</inline> because I was otherwise engaged. I know that he has had experience as a boilermaker and an ironworker generally, and I feel confident that he would not have made the statement he did to the Senate and to the country had he not been fully seized of the facts. Prior to the delivery of his speech he showed me a photograph of a vessel on the stocks ready to be launched, the launching ways, and the arrangements made. It is the custom in ship-building yards in the Old Country to sink cement foundations for what is known as the blocks to support the hull. </para>

                            <para>- No. The soft soap is applied to the ways, so that when the chocks are drawn and the shores are removed the hydraulic pump at the bow gives an impetus to the vessel, and her own momentum takes her into the water without the ways being fired by friction. I fail to see why the same principle should not be adopted in our dockyard at Cockatoo Island. The manager, I understand, is a gentleman from the Old Country, and if he does not know this it is something strange. I am not dictating to him. I am only telling honorable senators the experience I have had. If we intend to develop - as I hope we will do - a ship-building industry in Australia, either naval or mercantile, and if the launching of every vessel is to cost us &#163;35,000, farewell to the idea of developing a ship-building industry. </para>

If that is the rule we are to follow in the building of other portions of our Naval Unit, our Defence bill will increase considerably. Already complaints have been made from the platform, in the Parliament, and through the press, that the Defence bill is unnecessarily large. I have never admitted that it is. I have always contended that in spending money on defence we were providing a good insurance, and that is proved by the part we play in the world-wide war to-day. If we are told that for every vessel we construct we shall have to spend &#163;35,000 on a coffer-dam- </para>

                    <para class="block">For instance, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> gave us a lecture on the better control of the finances. There are honorable senators here who have been associated with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> from the beginning of Federation, and they know that he has never yet allowed a Supply Bill to pass without making a speech. I venture to say that had it not been for the very generous rule which allows us to wander all over the universe, those speeches could not have been delivered within the Standing Orders, because they had nothing to do with the question of Supply. They embraced a variety of leading subjects, dealt with in a very interesting and forcible way, but they had nothing to do with the question of finance. Honorable senators know that that is a fact. Some honorable senators have spoken to-day as if they had been dealt with in some new way in regard to the present Supply Bill. For instance, one honorable senator said that the Bill was only circulated when I moved its second reading this afternoon. On Friday last he could have seen every item in the Bill at the end of the Estimates of expenditure for the year. Moreover, if any honorable senator desires to be industrious, there is not a line in the measure about which he cannot obtain information without going to the Department. He has merely to ring up the permanent head or any official of the Department, and make a request, and no honorable senator can say that he has ever been refused information. </para>

                            <para>- That, of course, is another question ; it might take six months or five minutes. Every honorable senator has the right to ring up a Department and ask what particular lines or items in the Estimates mean. He can ask, for instance, whether a post-office he wants in Dead-dog Flat in some State is included in the vote for post-offices, and get the information. Therefore, honorable senators were rather hypocritical in saying that they have had no information on the items in the Bill, or that they can get no information. They have made no requests, and, if they had, they could have got the information they wanted. They know, too, that, as regards particular items in a Bill, the practice is for Ministers to be questioned in Committee. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has discovered some virtue which would accrue if we had Finance Committees, and he pointed to the example of the United States of America. He overlooked the fact that public men there are dealing with an entirely different set of circumstances. There are no Ministers who are responsible to Parliament, as there are in Australia. Therefore, unless the Congress established a method by which they could get some knowledge, they would be absolutely in the dark. There is no Cabinet which is responsible to Parliament; there are no Ministers who can be catechized, censured, or turned out of office; and it was because of the absence of that responsibility that Committees were established to investigate financial questions. </para>

If honorable senators take this responsibility out of the hands of the Government and put it in the hands of a Finance Committee, would they be any better off? The only change would be that you would have six other men dealing with the business. That might be an advantage from the point of view of some honorable senators. </para>

                            <para>- What would a Finance Committee do which a Minister cannot do to-day? Do honorable senators wish me to believe that if a member were placed on a Finance Committee he would become so industrious that he would set aside all the permanent heads and officials, delve in the books, and follow up everything? I do not believe the placing of a man on a Finance Committee would effect a wonderful change. I have seen men placed on Committees; I have been on Committees myself; but I found that it made no difference to my industry or energy; I was just the same individual. I do not think that, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie&#39;s suggestion were adopted, it would make any difference. What has to be remembered is that during the last year we have been in such an unsettled position politically that there has been no opportunity for financial measures to be submitted at the time when they should have been. As we all know, the items which are covered by this Bill ought to have been brought before the Senate months ago. I am not saying that in a spirit of criticism of the preceding Government. They were doing what they believed to be right in precipitating a political crisis, and when that eventuated, these financial measures had of course to stand aside. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie , is wrong there. He will find that, since the inception of Federation, there has never been a year when the delivery of the Budget statement was so late as it has been this year. The honorable senator knows as well as I do that the circumstances to which I have referred account for that. Honorable senators are anticipating that they will not receive information. They have no right to anticipate anything of the kind. They have not yet sought any information which has been refused. Until they have been refused information, it is rather unkind of them to suggest that ,they are not going to be given it. It has always been the practice, in moving the second reading of Bills of this character, to give. a general outline of the expenditure proposed, and not to refer to particular items. This has been done as fully to-day as on any previous occasion, so that some of the criticism offered of it has been rather ungenerous. </para>

                            <para>- No; but it seems to me that an attempt is being made to make it appear that there is something special about the lack of information in connexion with this particular Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> raised the question as to the best means to be adopted to overcome delay in connexion with the construction of works in an ordinary year. How do we get over the difficulty now? On the 30th June of each year, all authority to spend money vanishes. When a Supply Bill is introduced, including a Treasurer&#39;s Advance for a considerable amount, what happens when works are not stopped, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> seems to indicate? Only urgent new works are commenced, and are paid for out of the Treasurer&#39;s Advance. </para>

                            <para>- That is so, but the machine is not altogether stopped. The existing practice has one undesirable feature. Honorable senators will have noticed that in Supply Bills introduced about this time of the year far too large an amount has to be asked in the shape of the Treasurer&#39;s Advance. Parliament is practically called upon to give the Treasurer a blank cheque for &#163;200,000 or &#163;300,000. The Treasurer spends the money as he thinks fit, subsequently giving an account of the expenditure. As a matter of fact, he always endeavours to spend moneys voted in this way on the lines indicated on the Estimates which were last before Parliament. He endeavours to bridge the gap between one parliamentary appropriation and another. </para>

                    <para class="block">Lincoln must be convinced that it is a splendid harbor. Admiral Henderson was very much impressed with it; but he points out in his report that he was not here to say which were the best harbors in Australia, but to choose the best strategic position for the establishment of Naval Bases for Australia, and to outline for the Government the order in which they should be constructed. He chose Port Lincoln for a torpedo and submarine base; but if honorable senators will look up his report, they will find that he placed it among those in the second order of construction. </para>

                            <para>- No, I think the base at Beauty Point was put even further back. The Government recognise that conditions might arise which would justify expediting the construction of one base rather than another; but unless such conditions do arise, they propose to adhere as closely as possible to the advice given in Admiral Henderson&#39;s report. I mentioned, in moving the second-reading of the Bill, that a sum of money is set aside for Port Lincoln. The greater part of it will be required for land resumption there. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> raised the question of men temporarily employed by the Government being compelled to undergo a medical examination. Honorable senators are well aware that men permanently employed by the Government have to undergo a medical examination, and there is a very good reason for that. The Government undertake certain obligations in respect of public servants who become incapacitated, and it is therefore necessary, in the interests of the public purse, that permanent employes should be required to undergo a medical examination before appointment. It is news to me that temporary employes are required to undergo such an examination. I have never heard of it before. I shall find out whether an adequate reason can be given for it. There may be a good reason for it, but I confess that I do not know what it is. I have to deal now with the launching-ways for the cruiser <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane.</inline> I have already in the press given a history of this matter. It is undoubtedly regrettable that the question of the construction of these launching-ways was not decided some time ago, because there will undoubtedly be some delay due to the fact that the launching-ways have now to be put down. The  launching-ways  up to the water&#39;s edge have been put down. They were put down at the time the New South Wales Government undertook the construction of the cruiser. I make that statement because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> was somewhat severe in his criticism of the launching-ways that are there now. He has said that the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> is supported Oil blocks, and has been sarcastic about the launching-ways he found there. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable senator had asked to see them, the authorities of the dockyard would have showed him an enormous bed of concrete up to the water&#39;s edge, and the launching-ways constructed above that bed. I have seen them myself. Those launching-ways were planned by and laid down under the superintendence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cutler,</inline> who was &#34;then acting superintendent of the yard. If that work has been badly done, it was done by the engineer who has been eulogized by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall,</inline> and who, the honorable senator tells us, has a perfect plan for launching-ways below the water. There is a good reason why the launching-ways below the water, were not constructed at the outset. The Government were naturally anxious that the construction of the ship should be commenced as soon as possible. It was known that launching-ways below the water could be laid down at any time, and would take from six to nine months to construct. All that it was necessary to do to enable the construction of the ship to be started was to construct the launching-ways above water. It was known that the ways below water might be taken in hand at any time subsequently. It may be that at that initial period <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cutler</inline> prepared plans for launching-ways below the water. I have not denied that he did so. What I have said, and what I repeat now, is that I made inquiry at the Navy Office, and I have been assured that there are no such plans in existence at the Navy Office. In order that that report may not rest merely on my word, or the word of an officer of the Department, I have this statement in writing from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Macandie,</inline> the Naval Secretary - </para>

I wish to remind honorable senators that, as the initial work was undertaken by the New South Wales State Government, it is possible that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cutler</inline> drew up plans for these launching-ways which have gone into the archives of the New South Wales Public Works Department. It is possible, also, that they are at Cockatoo Island Dockyard, and if they are, we shall obtain them, because instructions have been given to make a search for them. </para>

The position when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> Salter took over the management of the dockyard was that he recognised that something must be done in regard to the slipway below water, and soon after taking up his position he began to bring the matter forward.

It was raised first in March, 1914, by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Salter,</inline> but this was the first time that any definite proposal took place. Apparently there was some discussion which does not appear on the files as to the form in which it should be carried out. The Director of Naval Works, on the 30th October of this year, put forward a definite proposal as to the construction of the slipway. The file contains on that point the following letter - from him to the Naval Secretary </para>

                    <para>With reference to  my  N.W.14/3472  of  the 1st instant, regarding the construction of launching-way for the above slip, I forward herewith plans in connexion therewith which have been concurred in by the general manager. The estimated cost of this work is &#163;28,500. Before the permanent work can be started it will be necessary to construct a coffer-dam, which will cost about &#163;6,000, arid  is  included in above estimate. It is expected that certain materials and timber will be returned to store for utilization on other works later, and the sum of &#163;2,500 will thus be saved. To hasten this work certain items have been started for the construction of the coffer-dam under the amount, &#163;3,500, already approved. The caisson to the entrance is a work for the general manager, who has put the work in Hand, as is usual under the Admiralty Regulations, but the cost thereof is not included in the above mentioned estimate. </para>
                    <para class="block">Subsequently there is an indication on the file that the question of cost was raised, and the question as to whether some other temporary construction would not meet the case. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swan,</inline> who is a subordinate of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Fanstone,  was instructed to go into the question.

                        <para>With&#39; reference to the above quoted letter <inline font-style="italic">re</inline> the slipway and dam for the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> slip, the alternative plan was put before me by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swan</inline> and it is understood from him that  it is  intended to build the concrete structure as shown op that sketch, lay and secure the launching ways to the concrete structure, grease the ways, admit the water, and remove the surrounding dam, which it is stated can be done in six days; and that for subsequent vessels the slipway will always be under water; finally, that the work involved in . this alternative plan  will  take six to seven months, which is not much less time than it is understood the complete dam will take, so that there will not be much saving of time so far as the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> is concerned. It may be observed that to leave the grease exposed to the water for six days - it is considered that to remove the piles in six days is a very optimistic estimate - is running a most serious risk, and one which I am not prepared to accept. It would appear that it has been assumed that the groundways, once fixed, would be suitable for subsequent vessels. This assumption is not tenable, as it is much more probable than otherwise that subsequent vessels will require a different set for the groundways, and also it would be quite out of the question to leave the timber ways for all time in the water. As regards subsequent vessels, it is quite impracticable to attempt to properly grease the ways under water, and  I  could not accept the responsibility of the risks involved. There is an alternative to having the ways fixed below water, and that is to have the lower end of the ways portable, and after greasing them to lower them under water, but there is so much risk attendant on this method that it is a most undesirable method to adopt, and should be adopted only as a last resource. I therefore regret that I cannot see my way to concur in this proposed alternative plan, and would observe that once the proposed work, with a dam is completed it would be done once for all for all ships that could be built on that slip, and to attempt to save money on this work would be very ill-advised. I have not seen what the Naval Works Department&#39;s estimate is for the complete plan, but it should not be forgotten that the building of the caisson to the dam will be in addition to that estimate. The estimated cost of the caisson is about &#163;3,000. Another advantage to the dam is that the slipway is kept dry during the building of the ship, which is a point of not inconsiderable importance. </para>

                            <para>- I have no idea. T have not seen it, and do not know what it contains!. The alternative to which I referred was drawn up by a subordinate officer in the Works Branch of the Navy Office in Melbourne. He is not on the staff of the dockyard, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Salter</inline> emphatically repudiated his plan. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cutler&#39;s</inline> plan is in existence I shall certainly see that we get it, and I shall certainly want to know what the general manager has to say upon it, and whether he can give good reasons why it should not be adopted. On the facts as they are before me in the docket, I should be deserving of the censure of the Senate if I turned down the general manager&#39;s recommendation and accepted that of a subordinate officer which the general manager emphatically repudiates. I also understand that the Director of Naval Works, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swan&#39;s</inline> immediate chief, has not indorsed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swan&#39;s</inline> proposal. I therefore feel that I had no alternative but to accept the recommendation of the responsible officer, although it involved increased expenditure. It has, however, the advantage that, once the work is carried out, it is there for all time, and available for all other ships. The expense, therefore, will not have to be incurred again, while it is clear &#39;from the reports that a considerable amount of the expenditure recommended by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swan</inline> once having served its purpose for the launching of the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane,</inline> would be of no avail for the launching of future ships. That seems to be an unsound proposition. We hope that the shipbuilding programme, once begun, will be a permanent policy, and any work of that kind should, therefore, be available for permanent use.. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly. He has been associated with dockyards where vessels have frequently been launched, and, therefore, must have had experience. If he is not competent to advise us on the matter, he should not be where he is. If he is not competent, we have made a mistake, and he should not be retained as general manager of the yard. But while we do retain him, unless we have very good reasons, we ought to act on his advice, especially when he warns us that any other proposal will endanger the safe launching of the ship. I shall pursue the matter of the other plan, and see that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Salter</inline> reports on it - not only whether he is prepared to adopt it, but, if it cannot be adopted, to give reasons why. Then I shall be in a position to judge whether the reasons advanced are sound or otherwise. </para>

                        <para>. -  I, too, would like some information from the Minister in regard to the acquisition of land inside the Federal Territory. I understand that all private lands within the Territory were valued at a particular period, and that the Government reserved to themselves the right to resume them whenever they pleased. That is altogether an unsatisfactory position. We must recollect that the value of land in Australia is continually increasing, and that if the Government delay resuming areas within the Federal Territory for, say, a period of ten years, their owners will then get only their value as at the time of their valuation. I am not complaining of that. It is perfectly right and just. But I go further, and say that if the Government make an arrangement of that sort with certain individuals, they ought either to complete it at the earliest possible moment, or to pay the landowners interest on the money involved. </para>

                            <para>- The value of land in Australia is continually increasing. If that particular individual had been bought out in 1908, the probability is that he would then have been able to secure a better holding for his &#163;10,000 than he would be in a position to get now. Unless the resumption of his land be completed by the year 1920, the probability is that his &#163;10,000 will be worth, perhaps, only half of what it would have been worth to him in 1908. That is my reason for insisting that if the Government intend to act squarely by these land-owners, they ought to buy them out with the least possible delay. Every year&#39;s delay means more loss to these individuals. I believe in the proposition I have laid down just as firmly as I do in the obverse proposition, namely, that no man should be allowed to profit by community-created values. I trust that the Government will, at an early date, resume the whole of the lands within the Federal Territory, and buy out the owners of them. </para>

                            <para>- We have a lively recollection of how the honorable senator&#39;s voice has for years thundered through this Chamber in advocating the need for securing for the Commonwealth, to the last farthing, what he is pleased to call the community-created values. Now, by a somersault which Blondin at his best never equalled, the honorable senator has turned round and affirmed that the unfortunate land-owners in the Federal Territory should be paid the value of their lands years ago, in order that they may be able to invest their money to better advantage. When I asked him whether he was pleading on behalf of the land-owners, he replied that I had better keep my ears open. It appears to me, however, that if anything requires opening it is the brain of the honorable senator who is now pleading for the landowners within the Federal Territory. As a land-user, he ought to know that these people will have the use of their lands from the time when those lands were valued until their actual resumption, so that they are really getting an excellent bargain. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> will yet look at things through different spectacles from those through which he has been accustomed to view them, because, in the past, he has been particularly one-eyed. He is now taking up the cudgels on behalf of land-owners, who have much the better of the deal, inasmuch as they can get the price at which their lands stood years ago- </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> objects to that arrangement, on the ground that it is unfair to the landowners, inasmuch as they should have had the money which their lands were worth a certain number of years ago. But I need scarcely point out that land values in this country have oscillated violently. Land which in New South Wales was valued at &#163;10 per acre some years ago cannot command more than &#163;2 or &#163;3 per acre to-day. Though values in the main have become enhanced in Queensland, there are instances in which they have receded. That, too, may be the experience of lands in the Federal Territory. But the fact remains that the land-owners there will have had the use of their lands from the time that they were valued for Commonwealth purposes until they are actually resumed, for nothing. </para>

I am sorry that I have not any land in the Federal Territory, because, if I had, I could very easily use it to finance for the purpose of carrying forward any other operations I might have without necessarily selling to the Government of the day. I am astonished, indeed shocked, at the new attitude of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart.</inline> He has put on his armour on behalf of the downtrodden landlords in the Federal Territory. The end of the world must be approaching when we find <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> of all men, coming out in a new light in defence of the men who have had the use of their holdings for nothing for the last four or five years. </para>

                        <para>. - I always like, if possible, to act the part of a peacemaker, and if it is in my power to compose the slight difference of opinion between two colleagues, I feel that I would be remiss in my duty if I did not make an effort to do so. It seems to me that if we come to analyze things there is not very much difference between these two honorable senators. The difference which exists is that they are both suffering from an overdose of loyalty to their ideals. Their difference of opinion arises from the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has placed before him as his ideal a principle, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has placed before him as his ideal a prejudice. The former, it seems to me, has always been one of the most consistent advocates of a mistaken theory whom I have had the pleasure of listening to. In season, and, as we all know when we want to adjourn, out of season, he has pressed this theory on the attention of honorable senators. It is in pursuance of that theory that he comes forward tonight and points out that, not only the present Government, but previous Governments have done an injustice to the landlords. It is just here that the prejudice of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> comes in. It is enough for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> to mention the word &#34; landlord &#34; to see that, as far as he is concerned, justice will go out of the window. </para>

                            <para>- I indorse entirely what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> has said as to the immorality of the position taken up by the Government in relation to these landowners. We provided in a certain Act that, if we did resume the land in the Federal Territory, we would resume it at the value it had in, I think, 1908. Nobody knows whether the land is to be resumed or not. It is idle to say that the land-owners are in a fortunate position because they have the word of the present Government. They have not any word. They cannot get from the Government to-day a definite statement as to whether the land will be resumed or not. On the other hand, if the land-owners wish to sell to private individuals, an intending purchaser immediately asks, &#34; How do I know that if I buy from you at what I think is the fair market value, in ten years&#39; time the Commonwealth Government may not come along, and, by virtue of the Act, say, &#39; We are going to resume the land at the value it had in 1908 &#39;?&#34; Now, what was the value of the land in 1908 ? A proposal has been put before the Government recently by the trustees of an estate. Being very anxious to subdivide the property, they asked the Department to give them a valuation in order that they may sell, but the Department will not do so. The trustees are unable to sell because intending purchasers would say, &#34; We are not prepared to buy land at what we think is its value when there is an Act under which the Government can hold that our ideas were all wrong, and that the real value of the land is so much less than it was sold for in 1914.&#34; These people only made the simple request that the Government should declare what the value was in 1908, and, if that was done, they would be in a position to sell. But they cannot get that information from the Government. It is pushing the powers of government to an unwarranted extreme to leave the land-owners in such a position that they are unable to sell to private individuals so long as the Act remains in existence. </para>

                            <para>- No; and I would take good care not to buy a thing that I did want if I did not know that the value was there. If the Government do not want this land, let them either repeal the Act or  give  a notification to the owners that they will resume this block and not resume the other block. Let the Government free the owners from the shackles that are on them to-day. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> said just now that if he had the land he would regard himself as an extremely fortunate individual. So would I, if I got the land for nothing; but I venture to say that if there is one man in Australia whose acquaintance I can claim who would not buy that land, or any other property with that bar sinister across it, it is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline> If there was land the market value of which was &#163;5 an acre, and &#34;the honorable senator wanted the land, and thought it was worth that price, does any one think that he would buy the land with that Act in existence?  His  friends would send for two doctors if he did. The honorable senator would know perfectly well that, although he might regard the fair market value of the land at &#163;5 an acre, and pay it, the very next day, by some change of policy, or some alteration of views with regard to the development of the Capital, the Government might come along and say, &#34;It is quite true that you paid &#163;5- an acre for the land, &#34;but we are going to fight you on it. We say that the value of the land in 1908 was &#163;3 an acre.&#34; </para>

Apart from those who held land, business people, and even those who did the work of the community in those localities, thought that there would be a brisk time, a modified boom, as the result of the selection of a particular site. </para>

                            <para>- So far as I know, a proposal for a valuation was not presented to the previous Government. I know that such a proposal has been presented to the present Government. I have urged before the view that, in fairness to the land-owners, we ought either to take the land over, and have done with the matter, or to intimate to them that we do not propose to take it over, so that they can go ahead as ordinary landholders. There is nothing unfair in that suggestion. When I state, as I do on the authority of the people who made the offer, that there is in one particular case a most modest request that the Government should give them a valuation to enable them to subdivide, it seems to me that the Government are pushing the arbitrary powers they possess to an extent which becomes extremely unjust and unfair to the land-owners concerned. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not intend to discuss the merits or demerits of a certain land policy beyond saying that it hardly seems to be involved in the question raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> although it is closely related to it. The Parliament has determined that the land in the Federal Territory shall be acquired under certain conditions, but, in addition to having the machinery for resumption, it is also necessary to have the requisite cash. The present Government have hardly had breathing time, but I hope that it will not be very long before we shall have a clear and definite policy as regards our attitude to the land-holders in the Federal Territory. Whatever our decision may be, I certainly agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that the landowners are entitled to finality, so that they may know where they stand. The methods will have to be determined, and the cash provided. The item which is being discussed relates to the acquisition of some land outside the Federal Territory. Loan money has already been provided for the purchase of land within the Federal Territory, but this sum is required for the purchase of an estate owned by a man named Fitzgerald. It was thought that, in view of the lay-out and the general contour of the country, it was desirable, in the interests of the estate itself, that the whole block should be purchased, but it was found that a certain area was outside the boundary of the Federal Territory, and so money has to be provided for the purchase of the estate. Of course, the question of what shall be done with the outside portion is involved in the item, but that will have to be decided later. I believe that the purchase of the estate will prove to be a good bargain. The general policy as to what will be done with the acquired land will he determined by-and-bye. </para>

                                and other members of this Parliament, I paid a visit to Canberra a few weeks ago, and this matter was brought under our notice. I might point out to the Assistant Minister that it does not involve, necessarily at any rate, a question of money. What the land-holders are entitled to have is a statement from the Government as to what valuation is placed on the. land which the Commonwealth has taken the right to acquire at some unknown time.

                            <para>.-I go farther, and say that, although the Government might reasonably require a little delay to complete the matter, the land-owners ought to be made acquainted with their decision within a reasonable period, and not kept in a state of suspense for a number of years, never knowing the day when the Government may intervene to take possession of their land, and naturally hampering their operations during the period. As regards the argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> that the value of land is increasing, and that these persons will not be able to make as good an investment in the future as they could do to-day if they had the money, I do not think there is much to be said on that point, because the value of the land will depend upon its productiveness. If the land increases in value, the productiveness will increase, and a man who buys in ten years&#39; time, although he may pay a good deal more, will be able, owing to settlement and other reasons, to make as good an income out of the land as he could do at the present time with land bought at a lower rate. My point is that, whatever price a man pays for land, he expects to make something out of it. One result of this discussion has been to elicit from a member of the Government an intimation that they propose to deal with this question in a definite way at a very early period, and I hope that they will do so. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> feels so strongly upon this matter, I wonder that during his short period of office he did not take steps to give effect to his views, and have the question of the valuation of these lands settled. </para>

I learn from an informant to-day that he has been informed of this proposal by the Mayor of Hunter&#39;s Hill. Tambourine Bay is up the river a little distance before one reaches Hunter&#39;s Hill or Figtree wharf.

Naturally and physically the place might be suitable for a quarantine station, but in view of the settlement that has taken place there, and the use to which the adjoining country is put, those &#60; who know the place will agree with me that it must be out of consideration as a site for a quarantine station. </para>

                            <para>- I may inform honorable senators that the college property comprises something like 130 acres, and includes a considerable portion of the frontage to Tambourine Bay. Near the foreshore there is a football ground and farm, and naturally the authorities of the college view with some alarm the possibility of the establishment of a quarantine station so near to their grounds, rowing shed, and bathing place. I do not expect Ministers to give an immediate assurance on the matter, but that they will take the opportunity of considering it. If they give the matter full consideration, I believe I can rely on the members of the Government not to consent to the establishment of a quarantine station in such a locality. </para>

I hope that the Government will reconsider the matter, and that the result of their reconsideration will be an abandonment of the proposal. Such a step should not be taken without the fullest consideration, and should not be taken at all if it can be avoided. It would be a calamity to agree to establish quarantine stations in juxtaposition to institutions of the kind to which I have referred. I have given the source of my information. I hope that my informant has been misinformed. If such a proposal has been contemplated, I feel sure that the members of the Government, upon reconsideration, will be prepared unanimously to abandon it. </para>

I hope that we shall find more suitable places to establish quarantine stations than Lane Cove River. If we can, I shall be pleased, and I am sure the Government will be pleased also.

Are they being subordinated to other projects ? It has been  represented to me by mariners who frequently traverse those waters that the better lighting of that part of the Australian coast is most imperative.

The probability is that the general policy in regard to lighthouses is still under consideration. It may be necessary, in preparation for the transfer, to carry out  the  works I have read out; but the amount provided in that- regard is only . a small&#39; one, and does not- represent&#39; the complete policy of the Government- on the matter. It represents merely a temporary arrange- - meat to meet temporary difficulties. The Government are taking active steps to secure the necessary ships, so that the work may be more effectively carried out in the future under our control than it has been in the past under the restricted activities of the States. </para>

                        <para>. - Last year, &#163;15,589 was appropriated under the heading of Naval Works, New South Wales, and only &#163;573 was spent, This year, &#163;28,078 is appropriated. How much is it proposed to spend during the financial year? Eight thousand pounds were appropriated for the Naval establishment at Garden Island, Sydney, and none of the money was spent. Five thousand pounds were appropriated for the Naval establishment at Spectacle Island, and only &#163;472 was spent. It seems foolish to load Estimates with appropriations of which only a comparatively small proportion is spent; and the Government should be careful to keep the appropriations down as nearly as possible to the probable expenditure. </para>

Of a sum of &#163;1,569 for  boatshed  and slipway at Albany, nothing was expended. A great deal has been said about the amount of unemployment in Western Australia owing to the drought, and I would urge the Government to push on with these works to relieve the acute distress existing. It is absurd to vote large amounts for works, only to find at the end of the year that comparatively few pounds have been spent. </para>

                    <para class="block">Island, it is true that &#163;8,000 was unexpended last year.

                        <para>. - I direct attention to the extraordinary position which obtained in regard to Defence during the financial year 1913-14. Probably the explanation why nothing was done during that period is to be found in the fact that a Conservative Government were in power. I find that, in the case of New South Wales, &#163;16,589 was appropriated, and only &#163;573 was expended; whilst, in Victoria, &#163;20,533 was voted, and only &#163;1,363 was spent. In Queensland, &#163;4,645 was voted, but only &#163;386 was spent; and, in South Australia, whilst &#163;4,155 was voted, not a single farthing was expended; in Western Australia, &#163;3,269 was appropriated, but only &#163;224 was spent. I hope that that sort of thing will not occur during the <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> of the present Government. What is the use of loading the Estimates with appropriations which are not intended to be spent? It  seems to me that the late Government were merely endeavouring to curry favour throughout the Commonwealth by holding out expectations of public expenditure which they never intended to be realized . </para>

Is that money to be expended upon a new building, or merely to effect repairs to the existing structure? If the latter, the money will be wasted. The building which is at present used by the Naval Brigade at Townsville is an antiquated one, and it would be a pity to effect repairs to it. It would be far better to erect a new building. </para>

If results have shown that we did economize, the honorable senator cannot criticise us for that. I would remind the Committee that there has never been a year in which very considerable savings upon the Estimates have not been effected. Speaking from memory, the Estimates for 1912-13 were something in the neighbourhood of &#163;1,000,000 in excess of the amount actually expended. That is to say that there was unexpended the sum of &#163;1,000,000 which Parliament had . appropriated. My memory is as good as is that of the average man, but </para>

                            <para>- I hardly know an occasion upon which he has not spoken. It is impossible for a Department to spend all the money that Parliament votes for it, and for the reason to which I made reference earlier in the evening. We get the Estimates placed before us practically on Christmas Eve. The officials are then required to look around for sites, and to prepare plans for these buildings. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> just now stated that the State and Commonwealth authorities are at loggerheads over a site for a boat-shed at Launceston. The chances are that, before they arrive at an agreement, the remaining six months of the financial year will have expired, and the vote will thus have lapsed. That is a very good illustration of the reason why it is not possible to spend all the money that is voted by Parliament, and it is an additional reason why the course which I suggested earlier in the evening should be adopted. I would remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> that it was a member of his own party in another place who last year moved the reduction of the Defence Estimates by &#163;1 as an intimation to the late Government that, in the opinion of Parliament, they were too big. As a result, the ex-Prime Minister gave an assurance that if the amendment were withdrawn an effort would be made to reduce the Defence expenditure by &#163;500,000. Knowing as I do something of the organization of the honorable senator&#39;s party, I do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgs</inline> would have moved in that direction unless he could have relied upon considerable support from his colleagues. </para>

That reduction was effected in obedience to parliamentary control, the absence of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> sometimes laments. Because Parliament exercised that control. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> is now loud in his complaints. Apparently, whether we spend or whether we save, those who sit upon this side of the chamber must, in the honorable senator&#39;s opinion, do wrong. </para>

                        was quite right when he wished to hold us responsible for unexpended balances last year. We do not desire in any shape or form to inflate our Estimates. We hope that the votes set down in this Bill will be expended during the year, because we believe that true economy consists in the expenditure of public money for the purpose of providing employment.

We have to try, as far as we can, in choosing a site to meet the wishes of the local authorities, and in this case there was a dispute with the Hobart Marine Board and the City Council. We have been trying to meet their wishes ; we did not desire to erect a drill hall in a place where it would interfere with the use of their boatsheds. A certain amount of expenditure was incurred on the work, and then an objection was raised to the site. I am not sure that the question of the site is settled yet. </para>

                        <para>. - Although it is practically one of the finest rifle ranges in the Commonwealth, the rifle range at Enoggera is some distance from any means of communication. We have there a Field Artillery depot and some stores for the storage of defence materiel. It is obvious that not only would it be an inconvenience to riflemen going out to shoot there, but there would be a very considerable bill for cartage unless we had some means of communication. As the State is under no necessity to make the provision, we are laying down a junction with their line to provide a means of communication, and, at the same time, to enable us to carry our stores and supplies. With, regard to the inquiry about the item for Kelvin Grove, a drill hall is being put up there, but the site is rather hilly, and it has to be levelled in order that we may secure a suitable parade ground. </para>

                            <para>- I know that an exchange was arranged when I was in office before. I believe we shifted out of Adelaide-street, and exchanged with the S&#163;ate. We got a piece of land with a very much larger area than we had before, but one disadvantage was that it was somewhat hilly, and needed a certain amount of levelling. Other work is being carried on which, I take it, is included in item of &#163;4,000. </para>

The item of &#163;2,900, to which the honorable senator referred, is to continue the policy of constructing miniature ranges, so that cadets and other persons may receive proper instruction in shooting. It is obviously impossible to forecast what distribution will be made of the vote before the applications are received. </para>

                        <para>. - I am obliged to the Minister for the information. In Queensland the people who are interested in the control of miniature rifle ranges are of opinion that a good deal more encouragement could be given to that arm of defence. The system is certainly worthy of every encouragement, and I have received some complaints - not very many - that there is some difficulty in getting the use of miniature rifle ranges for practice. I understand, from the District Commandant, that that is so, but I am not quite sure whether the difficulty directly concerns him. I am rather inclined to think that the Department here is not altogether sympathetic with the movement. I know quite well that the Minister is anxious to do all he can to encourage the use of these ranges. I am sure that every honorable senator recognises the importance of encouraging this arm. It is quite a popular thing in Queensland, and, I presume, in the other States. I trust that if the applicants cannot get the rifles free of charge the price will be made as reasonable as possible. </para>

                            <para>- We do want rifles for rifle clubs, whether we want everything or not. A rifleman without a rifle is a very innocuous soldier. Within the last few days I, and probably other honorable senators, have received a communication from a gentleman in Hobart who is interesting himself most patriotically in the rifle club movement. He has secured a very considerable augmentation to what is regarded as one of the Units of our Defence Force. I think that the point at issue is constituted by the circumstances in which the rifles are being issued. I understood, from a statement made by the Minister the other day, that some kind of a guarantee  is required from the rifle clubs for the value of the rifles issued. I believe that those who are interesting themselves, practically and patriotically, in &#39;connexion with the movement, think it is desirable for the rifles to be issued without so much circumlocution and restriction. If the rifles are in the Commonwealth, I think it is desirable to take advantage of the patriotic enthusiasm of the men who are enrolling themselves and drilling at every opportunity by giving them rifles without imposing too many restrictions. It has been well pointed out that the rifles are not likely to disappear. There might be one or two cases in which the Government would suffer; at the same time, the rifles, in all probability, would be in the Commonwealth, and available in a time of emergency. This is the time when we should seize opportunity by the forelock. Instead of having our riflemen organized in an extremely loose fashion, we should, as soon as possible, issue to thom some sort of distinctive uniform, and give each of them a rifle, a bayonet, and the necessary equipment. What is needed is that they should be readily available for the reinforcement of our Citizen Forces. Without a uniform it is questionable whether they would be recognised as soldiers. </para>

It is desirable that we should spend as much money as we can afford in , fostering the enthusiasm which our people are displaying at the present juncture by joining the ranks of rifle clubs. In our capital cities they may be seen on almost any evening marching to some central position for drill. The rifle clubs are representative of every class in the community. I think that they even more generally represent the community than would be the case with forces raised by conscription. We find the professional man and the working man marching shoulder to shoulder as members of rifle clubs, in the hope that they may be of value to the country should the necessity for their services arise. That patriotic enthusiasm should be encouraged in every way. </para>

                        has advanced, I may say that in the city of Launceston,, where I live, there is a rifle club, the members of which feel somewhat sore on the ground that they are not better treated. A relative of mine was a member of the Australian team that won the Kolapore Cup, and he came out second in the Australian average. He has taken great interest in the organization of rifle clubs at Launceston, and a number of the members of those clubs are splendid rifle shots. Whether justly or unjustly, many of them feel that they have not been treated as well as they might have been. I am not going to say that the Minister of Defence has not been sympathetic to rifle clubs. I believe that he has; but I do say that if anything more can be done to encourage the efforts of the gentlemen who have taken up this arm of defence, it should be done. Rifle shooting is sometimes taken up as  a  form of amusement, but there is amongst members of rifle clubs a patriotic spirit which we should encourage in every way we can.

                        <para>.- With regard to the question raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maughan,</inline> I may say that some time ago there was, I believe, a disposition at headquarters to frown upon the miniature rifle clubs, but I think that the feeling of opposition to them has been overcome. Since I have been back at the Department I  have seen no complaint from miniature rifle associations as to the  treatment they are getting.  The miniature  rifle club movement is one of comparatively recent growth. It has not been in existence for, I suppose, more than five years. At the outset it was, like most new things, viewed with some opposition in conservative military circles. I think that feeling has been outgrown, and the movement is now receiving a fair measure of support from the Department. With respect to the questions raised by Senators Bakhap and Guy, I should like to point out that our rifle clubs, for which I have every admiration, and for which I intend to do all I can, do not represent our first line of defence. The members of rifle clubs are not the first to be called out for the defence of the country. Those who are first called out are the members of our Citizen Forces. If the Senate were to vote me &#163;500,000 for the purchase of rifles to-night it would not enable me to get a single additional  rifle. That should bring home to honorable senators the fact that only a certain number of rifles are available, and our first duty is obviously to see that sufficient rifles and a sufficient reserve of rifles is provided for our first line of defence. I admit that it is our duty also to see that as many rifles as possible are made available for the members of rifle clubs, on just terms. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> when Minister of Defence, called for a return, which I saw in the office, as to the number of Tines available. I have had his return supplemented by later returns as regards other rifles which could be made available for the members of rifle clubs. A number of rifles of an old type are quite good for rifle shooting. In fact, many riflemen prefer them for match shooting to the short .303 rifle. A number of these rifles of old type were in reserve, but there was an objection to them that they were provided only with the ordinary service sight. One of our armourers has been able to evolve an aperture sight, which at a comparatively cheap cost can be fitted to these rifles, which then become very good rifles even for match shooting. We are having these rifles fitted with the aperture sight, and many of them will shortly be made available for rifle clubs. I can assure honorable senators that the Department is doing everything it possibly can in this direction. I am having returns brought forward every week or two in order that I may know what is being done. </para>

                            <para>- That is so, but I should like the honorable senator to tell me where we could get some ammunition for them. There are Ho factories now manufacturing ammunition for Martini-Henri rifles. I &#39;wish to deal now with the conditions under which rifles can be made available for rifle clubs. Scores of these clubs are established in country districts where we have no permanent military officer or organization. Many clubs are started full of enthusiasm, and for a time the rifles are well cared for a&#60;nd the attendance at shooting well kept up. After a time the enthusiasm flags. Then a few members of a  club  begin to neglect their rifles. It should be remembered that while our cordite ammunition is good am-&#34; munition it is extremely wasteful of the barrels of rifles. It erodes and corrodes them, especially if they are neglected. In connexion with our Permanent and Citizen Forces, one of the matters upon which our instructors lay most stress is the constant care and cleaning of rifles. In connexion with rifle clubs, there is no one to enforce this care. Many of the rifles are neglected, and when the barrels are eroded or corroded it is impossible to do good shooting with them. The good shots and the enthusiastic rifle club members will look after their rifles, but the careless members of rifle clubs will not. Rifle clubs are continually coming into existence and going out of existence. Some of them have ceased to exist before the Department has been able to take steps to recover the rifles. Some of them are never recovered, and in the case of many that are recovered we have to take 50 per cent, off the value as the result of neglect. This was the case especially when members of rifle clubs were given rifles and made individually responsible for them. When we have tried to recover rifles issued to members of a club we have sometimes found that half the members have left the district, and it is not possible to recover from them the cost of the damage done to the rifles. Thousands of rifles have been ruined in the Commonwealth in this way. We now make each rifle club collectively responsible for each rifle issued to its members. This is not a hardship upon the club. Just as the captain of a company is held responsible that the men of his company shall keep their rifles clean, so the captain of a rifle club is asked to assume the same responsibility for the members of the club. All the equipment, oil, and other material required for cleaning the rifles are issued free, and nothing but carelessness can account for a non observance of the conditions. In course of time a rifle will wear, and a calculation is made, and a certain percentage written off the value of a rifle for deterioration. The only penalty inflicted upon a rifle club is a penalty for carelessness that should be avoided. If the authorities of a club permit the members to become careless, to neglect their rifles, and allow them to become rusted, it is only fair that when the rifles .are returned the club should be debited with the loss due to the careless- ness of its members. The result of the operation of the rule has been a considerable saving to the Commonwealth, and has done no harm whatever to the rifle clubs. We should teach a man not only how to shoot, but also the proper care of the weapon with which he does his shooting. One salutary result of the rule adopted is that in their own interests the members of a rifle club not only see that their rifles are kept clean, but that the rifles of other members of the club are also kept clean, since the club is collectively responsible for all rifles issued to its members. </para>

                        <para>. - The explanation given by the Minister of Defence is to my mind absolutely satisfactory. Last week I put a question to the honorable senator on this very subject, at the request of a number of members of civilian rifle clubs in my own State, who thought it rather hard that individual guarantees should not be taken for the care of rifles. I sent to the persons interested a copy of the answer given to my question, and I rise now, as one who had something to do with rifle clubs in years gone by, and who knows the tendency on the part of some members of such clubs to be careless of their rifles, to say that I have been thoroughly satisfied with the explanation the Minister has given. </para>

The stage which the factory has reached is that the operating machinery of the factory proper has practically all been installed, but the shed for the power-plant has not been completed, and some of the power-plant itself has still to be installed. Until this is provided for the rest of the machinery cannot, of course, be operated. I am sorry that the power-plant was not gone on with, so that it might have been ready when the balance of the machinery was installed. </para>

I noticed also in the Budget-papers issued to us the other day the same amount of &#163;25,000 for wireless stations in the Pacific Islands placed under the head of special war expenditure, and included, so far as I could gather, in the amount of &#163;11,742,050, which is to be provided for partly by a loan from the Imperial Government, and partly by Treasury-bills. The doubt I wish the Minister to solve is whether the total amount to be expended is &#163;50,000, of which half is to come from special war expenditure and half from the ordinary works appropriation, or whether there is an unconscious duplication of the item. </para>

There are many items in the ordinary Estimates that are also included in the war appropriation. They come under ordinary expenditure, but are debited, so far as bookkeeping is concerned, against the war expenditure. This is one of them. I can give the honorable senator privately details as to where the money is to be spent. It is expenditure due entirely to the war. The total is &#163;25,000, and it has been provided so far out of revenue. I am not clear whether, by a bookkeeping entry, it has been debited to loan expenditure as well. </para>

It is considered better policy to have one completely-equipped school and bring to it for instruction the military officers who desire to be taught aviation. It is also intended to associate with that school the teaching of naval aviation, as it is considered more economical to have one school teaching both branches of the art than to have a number of schools scattered about. This proposal is to complete the existing school. </para>

                <para>It may be necessary to-morrow to move, that the Senate adjourn until Monday. This will be done if the work in another place is sufficiently advanced. If not, we can adjourn until Tuesday. I hope to be in a position to made a definite statement on that point by lunch-time to-morrow. I understand that another place is going to sit on Saturday in the hope of completing the work on Monday, in which case it would be convenient for us to sit on Monday also. I trust that sufficient honorable senators will make it convenient to attend on that day. </para>

                    O&#39;LOGHLIN (South Australia) &#91;10.21&#93;. - A question was answered in another place to-day regarding the visit of certain honorable senators to the Broadmeadows Camp last week, and the Minister&#39;s explanation put the matter in the proper light, but the statement was made in the
                    <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline>
                    that, after a long and dusty march, the men at the camp were kept waiting three-quarters of an hour for inspection by three senators. The reporter who made that statement ought to join the Kaiser&#39;s information bureau. It is utterly unfounded. If any misapprehension or disappointment occurred with regard to the visit of three or four of us to the camp, it was entirely due to a misleading statement in the
                    <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline>
                    of Thursday - the day we made the visit - that there was to be a visit of members of both Houses of Parliament. That statement had no foundation in fact, and no authority. It misled some of the officers to some extent. When we told the Minister that we were going out -
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland,</inline>
                    who has as on already at the front,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long,</inline>
                    who has a son in camp,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Major McDougall,</inline>
                    and myself - the Minister kindly said he would let the camp authorities know that we were coming, and they brought the troops in half-an-hour earlier than they usually do; consequently, instead of being detained for three-quarters of an hour after a long and dusty march, the men had really half-an-hour&#39;s less drill on that occasion than they usually do. I put a question to the Minister this morning regarding certain members of the Force engaged as motor-driver mechanics being reduced in pay. The Minister, in reply, said this was not the case &#34;so far as this Department is aware.&#34; I do not know what that qualification means.

                <para>My information is that when these men came to Melbourne, not only were 50 per cent. of them reduced from 8s.to 6s., but they were told that they would not receive 6s. a day until the Expeditionary Force had embarked. As a result, they had to accept 5s. per day up till the time of the departure of that Force. The information which I hare at my disposal is very definite, and it is to the effect that over 50 per cent. of these men have thus been reduced instead of only one, as stated by the Minister of Defence. </para>

                        <para>- No. But the Indian Government are purchasing a large number of horses in Australia, and they have buyers out who in many cases are purchasing through agents. The Defence Department has been asked by the Indian Government to give their representatives every assistance in its power, and, to do that we have placed many officers throughout the States at their disposal. So that very often action taken in connexion with purchases made for the Indian Government is taken by officers of the Defence Department. </para>
