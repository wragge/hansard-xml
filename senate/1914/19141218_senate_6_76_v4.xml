                        <para>- Has the attention of the Minister of Defence been drawn to the following paragraph in the Melbourne newspapers of this morning in regard to a question given notice of by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Heitmann</inline> in the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia? </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>In the Legislative Assembly yesterday <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Heitmann,</inline> Government Whip, gave notice that he will ask the Premier if he was aware the military censor had seized the third edition of the Daily <inline font-style="italic">Heat</inline> on the previous day? If he was aware that cable news had been passed by the London censors before arriving here, and that war news published in the eastern papers had been prohibited here? Also, he asked,  would the Premier, as head of the Government, communicate with the Minister of Defence with a view to the appointment of a censor who would appreciate the fact that the people of Western Australia are sane and intelligent ? </para>
                    <para class="block">Has the Minister had any communication from the Premier of Western Australia? Is it a fact that news censored by the London censor, and appearing in the press of eastern Australia, is not published in the same way in Western Australia ? And, if so, will the Minister see that the people of that State get the same news as to the actions at the front in the present war as the people in the eastern States of Australia and the Old Country get? </para>

                        <para>- I have not yet received a communication from the Premier of Western Australia. I take it that the question was given notice of yesterday afternoon, and, if so, there has hardly been time to send a communication. The matter has come under my notice in another way, and that is by means of a protest which was forwarded by the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> to the newspapers here, and sent on to me. It appears that the complaint made by the Wast <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> as to certain news being censored refers to the same news which was also censored here, so that it applies equally to the eastern and western press </para>

                            <para>- As regards the statement that news which has been censored in England is prevented from being published here, that is simply an assertion by the newspapers. News is censored in England just as it is censored here, but we have no guarantee that a cablegram received by a newspaper here is identical with information which has been censored in England and allowed to be published there. News sent out to Australia does not come from the censor in England, but from the representative of the Australian press there. Therefore it is obligatory upon us to see that the news passes the censor here. As regards the seizure of a third edition of the <inline font-style="italic">Daily News,</inline> a report has been called for from the censor as to his reasons for doing so. </para>

                            <para>- In each State of the Commonwealth we have a staff of censors, who receive similar instructions on which to act. The censors in Western Australia were chosen with regard to their fitness for the duty. They are citizens of the State, and therefore should know their duty. They would not be likely to take any action which would reflect on the people of Western Australia. The question of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Heitmann</inline> seems to indicate that they are not permanent military officers, but citizen officers who have been called up for this special duty. The censors have been instructed to, as far as possible, take uniform action in all the States. </para>

                                <para>- I will inquire into the matter, but I remind honorable senators that censored news does not consist only of cablegrams. Fremantle is the first port of call in Australia for the mail steamers, and very often information comes by that means. The press of Western Australia get the news with their ordinary mail, and the censor has to decide whether it is to be published in the form in which it is received. </para>

I think it is quite possible that men who have gone to the war may be brought under the provision. At all events,I will draw the attention of the Chief Electoral Officer to the matter, and if possible, the Act will be sympathetically administered in that direction. </para>

                    <para>I wish to say that it is not a very extensive measure, although it contains some important provisions. It is a Bill to increase the powers of the Bank. Under the present Act there are some rather severe limitations imposed on the powers of the Bank. It is necessary and advisable that the Bank should be armed with power to open up branches in any part of the British Empire. We recognise that it is destined to be the national Bank of Australia, the institution which should naturally do all the business of exchange between the various portions of the Empire, so far as Australian trade is concerned. It is the Bank to which traders in other parts of the Empire will naturally look, because, being the national Bank of the country, it is the institution in which they will repose most confidence. Therefore, we are seeking power for the Bank to establish branches outside of Australia. At the present time it cannot even open a branch in Papua. Then we ask for another power, namely, the power to purchase other banks. That, I think, is a very necessary provision, because it may be advisable in the future to acquire private banks which are now in existence. Under the present Act we have no such power. The Government feel that the time has arrived when that power should be vested in the Bank. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Then it is desirable that its authority to raise capital should be increased. At present, that authority is limited to &#163;1,000,000, and it is desired to increase it to &#163;10,000,000. The necessity for doing this arises largely from the provision which is being sought to acquire other banks. If that power is exercised, it is obvious that it may be necessary for the Bank to have a larger capital than &#163;1,000,000. Accordingly, the Bill provides for increasing the capital from &#163;1,000,000 to &#163;10,000,000. I do not know that there is anything else in the measure to which I should direct attention. I commend it to the Senate, believing that it is the desire of this Parliament to make the Bank a thorough success; to make it a strong Bank, which will be of assistance to Australia in the present crisis, and a rock of safety to the financial institutions of the Commonwealth if they should need assistance. </para>

                            <para>- I understand it has been held that the Commonwealth Bank is exempt from the payment of stamp duty. That question is now the subject of a test case before the High Court, although it relates only to whether Commonwealth Bank cheques should be subject to stamp duty. The question is such a highly legal one that I tremble to offer an opinion upon it. I should say that, if a State authority cannot tax Commonwealth Bank cheques, it can scarcely tax its debentures or its capital. To a layman, that is bush logic, but whether it is the law or not I cannot say. </para>

                        <para>, - I have no intention of discussing the very many matters which are involved in a consideration of the position of the Commonwealth Bank. It is a subject which I have no doubt would, under other circumstances, have invited a very spirited debate in this Chamber. But the fact that the Bill has only just reached us renders it impossible, so far as I am personally concerned, to debate the matter with that thoroughness which the very important considerations involved would otherwise demand. However, I cannot allow the Bill to pass without indicating with sufficient clearness the attitude which I feel is the right one to adopt towards it. Before directing attention to some of its provisions I think I may, without saying one word derogatory to the Commonwealth Bank, fairly remind my honorable friends that this measure is very largely an admission of the futility of the predictions which they made in regard to the principal Act when it was introduced. They have since been going around the country declaring that the Commonwealth Bank has done wonderful things, and that it is going to help the Government. Yet here are the Government coming forward to help the Bank. There has not been a single thing which the Bank has done that has been a help to the Government. It has not assisted them to the extent of one penny-piece. That, however, is not the fault of the Bank. It was impossible for it to accomplish impossibilities. A Bank which had no resources was not in a position to extend help to the Government of the country. </para>

                            <para>- I say that if we are going to establish a bank which shall be a national bank in reality, and not merely in name, it should have associated with it the control of the currency. That is one of the serious defects of this measure. The first proposal to which I desire to direct attention is that to vest the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank with power - subject to the approval of the Treasurer - to purchase one or more of the private banks which are doing business in this country. The Minister has stated that the necessity for increasing the capital of the Bank to &#163;10,000,000 arises largely, if not wholly, from that proposal. I desire to point out what that means. By increasing the capital of the Bank to &#163;10,000,000 we shall not enlarge its capacity to make advances in the direction of assisting people. It will merely take up accounts in respect of which advances have already been made. Honorable senators know that there are two or three banks which may be the subject of purchase by the Commonwealth Bank. If we raise the money to increase the capital of the Commonwealth Bank, it will not be in a position to make advances to the people from that amount, because the money will have to be paid over to the shareholders of the bank we purchase.We shall not be enlarging the operations of the Commonwealth Bank, or increasing its facilities to help the community.We shall simply be enabling it to take the place of, and do the business that is now being done by, the directorate of a private bank. It is safe to predict that the strong and established banks will not be sold to the Commonwealth. The only ones, therefore, likely to be purchased are those in a smaller way, and not so well buttressed. </para>

                            <para>- I do not see how a weak bank can be dangerous, although I do not apply that term to any of our existing banks, rather regarding them all as at present in a fairly good position. But some of them have, undoubtedly, advanced a large portion of their assets upon non-liquid securities. One whose name is freely mentioned as likely to be purchased by the Commonwealth, has notoriously advanced a large portion of its assets on big pastoral leases, which are undoubtedly non-liquid. Many years ago, when the boom in pastoral properties was on, it extended a considerable portion of its business in that direction, and has never been able to realize upon the securities since. For the Commonwealth Bank to take it over may or may not bo an advantage to the pastoral lessees, but it will not help the Commonwealth Bank, for any money which it obtains under the authority of this Bill, if invested in the purchase of assets of that kind, will not improve its opportunity to lend money to the community. </para>

                            <para>- If my honorable friends are satisfied with phrases of that kind I cannot quarrel with them, but I like to look at the bedrock of the business, and for us at this juncture to purchase a bank of the character I have described, or, in fact, any bank, would be an act of financial folly. We have first to borrow money, and this is not an opportune time to do so. At what rate do we expect to obtain it? Yesterday we passed a Bill under which we obtained from the Imperial authorities a loan costing us close on 4 per cent. If we raise &#163;10,000,000 to extend the operations of the Commonwealth Bank, the money will have to he found in Australia. Do the Government think they can raise &#163;10,000,000 here at 4 per cent.? </para>

                            <para>- On that argument we might as well provide capital enough to buy all the banks. This proposal will not make the Commonwealth Bank in any sense a national one. All we are doing is to start another ordinary commercial bank, for in no sense does the proposal advance the national side of finance, which ought to be the first objective of any bank started under Government auspices. If the money costa us too much, the Bank will have to charge an unnecessarily high rate of interest to those who seek to do business with it, in which case it will not do the business that it was ostensibly established to do. The first effort that should have been made ,was to secure to the Bank the whole of the business of the State Governments, and there was a way in which that could have been done. At a recent Conference between the States and the Commonwealth an agreement was arrived at by which, if the Commonwealth withdrew from the savings bank business, the States undertook to give the Commonwealth Bank all the other business under their control. There are many ways in which, starting from that, a considerable accession of strength and usefulness could have been brought to the Bank, but the Government have started out with a firm determination to ignore the States as far as possible, and to bleed them of resources which they have hitherto regarded as their own and largely relied on to carry on their public works. However, I do not expect that  anything  I can say will affect their decision. </para>

                            <para>- We shall not assist them by taking from them funds which they have hitherto employed so largely in their public works, but from the tone of the interjections I do not hope to get anything like a serious discussion on matters of such vital importance to the people. It may be right to take these resources from the States, but the consideration of the question is not to be dismissed by such interjections. We ought to have made a strenuous effort - and the opportunity, if grasped, would have taken us a long way on the road to success - to make the Bank a national Bank in the sense of doing the business of the nation, and not merely of the Commonwealth Government. The Government had that opportunity prepared for them. They refused to take it. They insisted on fighting instead of co-operating with the States, and that attitude will be not only to the detriment of the States, but will withhold from the Bank what might otherwise have been a very useful element of much-needed strength. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> concluded his breezy speech by saying that if the Labour Government had started out with a desire to work harmoniously with the State Governments, there would have been a. greater probability of the Commonwealth Bank becoming a really national bank,, and a much greater success than it is. The fact is that, from the inception of the Bank, and before it commenced operations, the Fisher Government showed their desire to co-operate iu the fullest measure with every State Government of Australia. They offered extremely liberal terms to the State Governments in the matter of the Savings Bank branch of the business of the Commonwealth Bank. The Fisher Government proposed that the State Governments should have absolute control over their assets at the time, that they should receive 75 per cent, of new savings bank business, and that upon the remaining 25 per cent, they should have equal claims with the Commonwealth Government. The State Govern men fs turned down those generous proposals. I believe that the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Denison</inline> Miller, as a practical and experienced banker, considered the terms offered to the State Governments too generous. He was surprised at the generosity of the terms offered by the Fisher Government to the Treasurers of the different States. </para>

                            <para>- I live at Middle Park, and I am in a position to say that, within a distance of one mile, two substantial buildings have recently been erected by the State Government of Victoria, at a cost of some thousands of pounds, for the purpose of carrying on the operations of the State Savings Bank. I understand that the State Government had to pay about &#163;20 a foot for the land on which the building in Canterbury-road has been erected. It is fitted with lead lights and every modern convenience, and alongside of this recently-erected State Savings Bank there is a branch of the Commonwealth Savings Bank, which was established on the spot before the State Government acquired the site upon which their building has recently been erected. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe,</inline> who lives in St. Kilda, will no doubt have noticed that, during the last few weeks, a valuable site, which must have cost a pretty high price, was acquired by the State Government of Victoria at the corner of Canterbury-road and Fitzroy-street, and immediately opposite the St. Kilda railway station, and on that land a magnificent building has been erected to carry on the State Savings Bank business, although in close proximity there is a post-office and Savings Bank in the hands of the Commonwealth, where all this business could easily have been carried on. In many places in this State thousands of pounds have been absolutely wasted by the State Government in this way. The people of the State are being bled because the members of the State Government are not prepared to work harmoniously with a Commonwealth Labour Government. </para>

                            <para>- I am dealing with my own State, and let other honorable senators deal with theirs. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has said, in effect, that the Commonwealth Bank lias not done anything since it has been in existence; that it has not. convenienced  traders, and has not made the money market more staple. T venture -to say that if it had not been for the existence of the Commonwealth Bank, and the Australian note issue, we should have had a financial crisis in Australia greater than any we have had since the establishment of responsible government here. The Commonwealth Bank is a mere infant that came into existence, so to speak, only yesterday. Still, our opponents are never tired of condemning it, on the ground that it is not a success, and does not do the business which is done by banks that have been conducting banking operations ever since Australia was first settled. What do honorable senators think will be the position of the Commonwealth Bank when it has been in existence for, say, half as long as the Bank of New South Wales ? The Commonwealth Bank must be a&#39; bigger success than any private bank, because the citizens of Australia are its shareholders, and they will not lo&#39;ok in the same way as the shareholders of private banks for direct dividends. The profits made by the Commonwealth Bank will belong to the whole of the people of Australia. When it started out to do business on a business basis our opponents attempted to arouse the animosity of the people against it. They said, &#34;This Bank came into existence to assist the poor farmers, and those who ave not too well circumstanced in life, when they desire financial accommodation, but it has proposed to assist a financial institution known as the Broken Hill Proprietary Company.&#34; I think that the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Denison</inline> Miller, is quite within his rights when he says, in effect, &#34; This Bank is for basking purposes. I know no party and no individual, and every proposition that comes before me will be viewed impartially. I am prepared to undertake any good business proposition. Whether it be submitted by the Labour party or the anti -Labour party, it will be financed on business lines by the Commonwealth Bank.&#34; I believe the Bank did finance the proposition put before it by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company. When the Bank started on these lines members of the Opposition, for party purposes, and persons interested in other banks and not in sympathy with the Commonwealth Bank, commenced certain moves in another place, and endeavoured to do so here as well. They received little or no consideration, and the people of Australia have treated their moves with the contempt they deserve. Has not the Commonwealth Bank done something ? I read in the financial column of the <inline font-style="italic">Argusprior</inline> to the last Federal election, that a big mine in Northern Queensland had ceased operations, with the result that 900 men were thrown out of employment. The mining company endeavoured to secure financial assistance from private banks, and was unsuccessful. It then applied to the Commonwealth Bank, and under the heading of &#34; Stocks and Shares &#34; in our daily newspapers, I read that the Commonwealth Bank had financed the company, and so had enabled about 1,000 men to be continued in employment. </para>

                            <para>- Absolutely. The Commonwealth Bank has rendered assistance to other companies and industries in Australia, when probably some of the private banks were indisposed to do so. There is not the shadow of a doubt that this Bank has given confidence to the people which they would not have had but for the note issue and the existence <inline font-style="italic">al</inline> this &#39;financial institution. That people have absolute confidence in financial institutions guaranteed by Governments has been recently exemplified in the Old Land. Prior to the outbreak of the war it was the custom of people bo say, in a casual way, and often in a serious way, &#34;It is as safe as the Bank of England.&#34; This always implied that a Bank of England note was one of the safest securities in the world. What has happened recently? The British Government have been issuing paper money. It should be known to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> and to others who think like him, that a number of people who possessed Bank of England notes made haste to change them for the notes which were being printed and circulated by the British Government. This shows conclusively that people have always more confidence in institutions behind which there is a Government guarantee than they can possibly have in private institutions. Before we took over the note issue in Australia, the private banks issued their own notes, and were taxed for doing so, but since the issue of our Australian notes there is not a single person in Australia who has had any doubt at all about the value of a .&#163;1 note. What would have happened if a Labour Government had not taken over the note issue ? When the war broke out, and the drought was upon us, if the private banks had still been issuing their notes, it is very probable that in some quarters there would have been a feeling of grave anxiety and a rush upon some of the banks. Once that took place, there would probably have been a financial panic. I repeat that no one to-day questions the value of an Australian note, because it is a Commonwealth note and not one issued by a private bank. </para>

                            <para>- That is not the reason so much as the knowledge that behind the Australian note there is the unlimited power of taxation of the Commonwealth Parliament and the whole of the resources of Australia, and there is also a certain gold reserve. Besides all this, an Australian note is legal tender. If I owed a debt to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> of &#163;1 , and tendered him an Australian note for <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1,</inline> and he refused to take it, the debt, from a legal point of view, would be paid, because the honorable senator would have refused a legal tender. </para>

I have no fault to find with the provision for opening up new branches in Australia and different parts of the world, because I think Chat every facility should be given to the Governor in that direction. But I do not know that I can wax enthusiastic about the provision empowering him to acquire banks which might be in deep water. I, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> am convinced that no bank which is doing well is likely to approach the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, or to be in any way desirous of being taken over by that Bank. If we approve of that provision in the Bill silently we may find ourselves in later years well within a danger zone, for the reason that the management of the Bank is intrusted to one man.

                            <para>-I am not seriously concerned in that regard at the present moment. My concern is the success and the welfare of the Commonwealth Bank, and if there are in Australia banks which are not too well placed, to use an Australianism, that is not the fault of the Commonwealth Bank. If it is, it shows that the Commonwealth Bank must have been a success even up to the present time. If it be true that private banks during the last year or two have not been carrying on their business on too profitable a basis, the operations of the Commonwealth Bank may have affected them. If its operations have affected one or two banks during the last year or two, and that is the reason why we are asked to agree to a provision for the enlargement of the capital from &#163;1,000.000 to &#163;10,000,000, a similar application may be made from time to time to acquire bank after bank, and I should say to pay compensation for taking over the banks. Are we to have any voice in regard to the banks which are to be taken over, and the manner in which the transfer is to be carried out? Are these matters to be left wholly and solely to the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank and to the Treasurer of the day? Personally, I would have preferred to see the Commonwealth Bank proceed on the lines on which it is going. If it happens to eliminate competitors, it can only do so by efficient and economic management. Any firm, or company, or institution that carries on its business efficiently and economically deserves to succeed. If the Commonwealth Bank is doing that, I see no reason why it should acquire businesses and pay compensation for them. We know that when competition is eliminated in different directions there is no payment to those who have been dispossessed. In Melbourne, a few years ago, we had cabs running through the streets. Later, the Tramway Company was formed, and tram communication was provided for the people of the metropolitan area, and the cabs were wiped out. Before the Tramway Company laid down their lines and started to run services, did they approach the owners of the cabs, the saddlers and harness-makers, and dealers in fodder, and say, &#34; We are about to run tram services, and, no doubt, you will be severely handicapped by our competition, but before we wipe you out we will compensate you&#34;? Did the Government of Victoria, before they started to build locomotives at Newport, say to the Phoenix Foundry at Ballarat, &#34; As we are about to start to make our own locomotives and to seriously interfere with your business, we will pass an Act to acquire your business or to compensate you for any loss you may sustain by reason of our action&#34;? No. Why, then, I ask, should any Government give to the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank power to acquire banking institutions which may be on their last legs because of its competition ? If the Commonwealth Bank succeeds - and it must succeed against all competitors - the more capital will be required, according to the provision in this Bill, to acquire other banks. The Commonwealth Bank should proceed as it is doing now, and if there are in the Commonwealth banks which are not doing too well, the fault is not with the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, but with the individuals who are always upholding private enterprise and claiming that the Government cannot run institutions successfully. I think that, having said these things- </para>

                            <para>- That is hardly a proper way of putting it. My main reason for speaking was that, if we are going to do this every time that our competition becomes serious in regard to private banks, we will probably be called upon to increase our capital in order that the shareholders and everybody else connected with a bank not doing too well shall get every penny to which they think they are entitled. We do not find that that is done in other lines of business. We do not find that that was done, as I was saying before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKissock</inline> returned to the chamber, when the Government of Victoria started out <inline font-style="italic">Vo</inline> make locomotives in opposition to the Phoenix Foundry of Ballarat. </para>

The matter is entirely for the Senate itself to decide. So far as I could catch the interjection of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, he was not striving to limit the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> but was only pointing out that apparently the time at our disposal was limited, and that the honorable senator should not repeat remarks for the benefit of an honorable senator who had come into the chamber. Now that my attention has been called to the matter, I must remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> that it is contrary to our Standing Orders and practice to indulge in repetition. </para>

It was merely to emphasize and amplify a point I was endeavouring to make that I attempted to repeat some remarks, because I was prompted to do it by a pertinent interjection from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks.</inline> I do not desire to take up more time, but I feel that a Bill of this kind deserves the serious consideration of the Senate, and no measure that we have had, during the last few days, at any rate, concerns me more than this does. With some of its provisions I am in hearty accord, but I cannot become by any means enthusiastic in regard to the provision which empowers the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank to acquire other banks and the provision which enables the capital to be increased. </para>

                        GOULD (New South Wales) &#91;12.14&#93;. - I do not propose to speak at great length, because I realize that time is precious and that other honorable senators desire to express their views. The Bill makes certain amendments of the principal Act. Personally I do not see any ground for objecting to the proposed amendments, when we take into consideration the whole principle and scope of that enactment. One of the less important proposals of the Bill is that to empower the Commonwealth Bank to establish branches in any part of the British Dominions. I do not object to that, because, inasmuch as we have established a Commonwealth Bank, it should enjoy every facility that is enjoyed by a private bank to enable it to deal with its own business. Another provision reads -
                    </para>
                    <para>A trustee, executor, or administrator may invest any trust moneys in his hands in the purchase of debentures issued by the Bank, or on fixed deposit in the Bank. </para>
                    <para class="block">I do not object to that provision, nor do I take exception to the amendment which is proposed in section 62 of the principal Act. The chief matter which we have to consider is the position of the Bank, which is of a three-fold character. In the first place, it should be a National Bank - that is, a Bank which transacts the whole of the business of the Governments of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth, having established a Bank of its own, should strengthen its hands by doing all its own business through it, so long as the Bank does not encroach upon ground which the States have already traversed. By all means let the Bank deal with the national accounts. Then we have to consider the question of the Commonwealth Savings Banks. Here there has been considerable difference between the States and the Commonwealth as to which Savings Banks should transact this particular form of business. We all realize that the State Savings Banks are in reality national banks. They have no hungry shareholders to appease by paying them dividends, and consequently they are able to carry on their operations with a minimum of expense. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> talks about the action of Victoria in setting up a Savings Bank in apposition to that established by the Commonwealth, he should recollect that it was the Commonwealth which endeavoured to oust the State Savings Banks from the business which they had previously transacted. I come now to the third aspect of the Commonwealth Bank, which relates to the competition into which it has entered with the ordinary private banks of the country. If it is going to compete with those institutions, I say unhesitatingly that it ought to be subjected to the same conditions as those to which our private banks are subjected. Then we should not hear of cases coming before the High Court for decision similar to that which is now occupying the attention of that tribunal. In effect, the Commonwealth has said to the private banks, &#34; Although you have to pay stamp duty upon every cheque that is drawn by your customers, the Commonwealth Bank is not going to pay any such tax, because it is an instrumentality of the Commonwealth.&#34; Need I point out that in reality it is not the private banks which have to pay the tax of a penny upon every cheque drawn by their customers - it is the customers themselves. It will be seen, therefore, that the Commonwealth Bank occupies an advantageous position as compared with our private banks, which have to contribute to the revenue by way of stamp duty on cheques. </para>

                                GOULD. - If it suits a man to become a depositor in a private bank, it is only fair that he should pay a small tax to the State should the State require it for the government of the country. If the Commonwealth Bank is going to compete with private banks it ought not to occupy a different position from that occupied by those institutions. I come now to the proposal to empower the Commonwealth Bank to absorb any private bank. It has been urged that it will absorb only institutions which are in a &#34; lame &#34; position. Still the amount which will be paid by way of compensation to any private bank for taking over its business will be absolutely determined by the value of that business. Now, , in a rough-and-ready way. we know how the public appraise the value of a bank. We all recognise that a bank&#39;s shares may be selling either at a premium or a discount. If they are selling at a discount that circumstance is indicative of the value which the public put upon the institution. It may have a capital of &#163;1,000,000, but if its shares are selling at a discount, the Commonwealth Bank will purchase it only upon reasonable terms. Of course it is possible that the Commonwealth Bank may acquire a private bank which has a large number of branches established throughout the country. In that case it will be able to step into those branches immediately, and that will be a great advantage. That the Commonwealth Bank should enter into competition with our State Savings Banks is unreasonable. Of course, if the latter were prepared to surrender their business, the position would be different. Similarly, if the Commonwealth Bank chose to open Savings Banks in places where private banks have not been established, I would not utter a single word by way of complaint. But we have to divest our minds of the exaggerated idea which has been expressed by some honorable senators regarding the value of the services which the Commonwealth Bank has rendered to the community. Let us compare its position with that of our private banks. I find that the annual report of the Commonwealth Bank for the year ended 30th June, 1914, states -

                            <para>- No. The assets are shown to be: Coin, bullion, and cash balances, &#163;2,670,446 ; bank premises, &#163;38,379 ; profit and loss, &#163;36,995. Now, let us see what are the deposits in our ordinary banks. In 1913 the deposits in the banks of issue in Australia totalled &#163;154,500,000, as against deposits in the Commonwealth Bank of &#163;9,000,000. The coin and bullion held by the private banks at that time totalled &#163;33,684,000. I have some still later figures which I can furnish to honorable senators. During the September quarter of the current year, the Commonwealth Bank held in coin and bullion only &#163;151,390, whereas the private banks held no less a sum than &#163;35,264,000. The Commonwealth Bank had made advances to the extent of &#163;1,550,000 as against advances made by our private banks amounting to &#163;118,000,000. I have quoted these figures to show that honorable senators opposite are mistaken when they declare that the Commonwealth Bank has been the means of steadying the financial position in this country, and that it has assisted our private banks. I do not quote them for the purpose of decrying the Commonwealth Bank, but merely for the purpose of illustrating the extravagant ideas which are entertained by some honorable senators. I come now to the question of notes. The Commonwealth Bank does not control the note issue, although I believe that ultimately it will do so. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> stated that in Great Britain the public are so anxious to get paper money into their hands that they are taking Government paper money and giving sovereigns in return for it. But I would point out that the Bank of England does not issue notes of less than &#163;5 in value, and that there is great difficulty in getting such notes changed except at the Bank itself. </para>

                            <para>- I happen to have had a little experience. The British Government are now issuing notes of the value of 10s. and &#163;1, because they are more convenient than are notes of a larger denomination. To a great extent these notes of small value take the place of the half-sovereign and sovereign. If I did more than refer briefly to certain provisions in this Bill I should be obliged to take up considerable time - a course which I do not propose to follow at this stage of the session. Let me disabuse honorable senators&#39; minds of the idea that the other banking institutions are in any way dependent upon the Commonwealth Bank. As a man interested in private banks, I have no objection to the Commonwealth Bank doing its business so long as it is placed on exactly the same footing as the others. I know that if I wanted an overdraft, I would have to pay the same rate of interest and put up the same amount of security with one as with the other. This is only natural when we place a bank under independent control as we intended to place the Commonwealth Bank. It may be true that the control of one man is not sufficient, and it may be desirable to appoint some one else to act with him in regard to certain general principles, although matters of detail and matters as between the Bank and its clients should be kept within the knowledge of as few individuals as possible. It would be undesirable to make the Treasurer a director of the Bank to such an extent that he would have to make himself familiar with all the intricacies and details of its business, because Treasurers come and go, continuity would be destroyed, and public confidence in the secrecy of the Bank&#39;s relations with its customers would be to some extent destroyed. People in a large way of business who have to go to a bank to obtain money, do not want all the details of their business made known to persons not primarily interested in the control or management of the institution. We know this Bill is going to be passed, and that it is useless to attempt to improve or add to it. Our only consolation is that many of the amendments proposed are very necessary, and that a number of safeguards are provided in relation to the absorption of any private bank. The Treasurer has to be consulted and to approve, and the Auditor-General has to make a report. I am sure that great care will be exercised in any transaction of the kind, or I sincerely hope it will be. In any case, I trust that we shall take every care to keep the Bank as free as possible from political control, and to insure that, when it comes into competition with other institutions, it shall be placed on exactly the same footing with them as regards taxation or other obligations. I do not think there is any obligation to put up a certain sum before a bank can be established, and, even if there was, we should not expect the Commonwealth to be called upon to do it: but, in all other respects, the Commonwealth Bank and the private banks should be on an equal footing. We have established a Bank which has behind it no capital except the power to raise certain money. We are now going to extend that power so far as to enable it to raise a capital of &#163;10,000,000 instead of &#163;1,000,000, and we must be careful that that power is not used detrimentally to the best interests of the community. I should have liked to say something as to the desirableness of placing the note issue under the control of the Bank, but as others desire to speak I shall not pursue the subject now. I may have an opportunity to discuss it in the general debate on the financial proposals of the Government. </para>

I am glad that an effort has been made to give our Bank a wider scope of operations, and, therefore, of usefulness to the people. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> referred to the apparently small amount of capital that it possesses, and apparently he regards the private banks as being of much greater magnitude from that stand-point. I was surprised to hear the figures the honorable senator first gave. He reduced them a little later, but he apparently still has an exaggerated idea of the capital of the private banks. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs&#39;</inline> most recent <inline font-style="italic">Year-Book,</inline> the private banks from the stand-point of capital are very small potatoes compared with what the Commonwealth Bank will be when this scheme is carried out. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> said the capital of the Bank of New South Wales was &#163;7,000,000. </para>

                            <para>- That opens up another question. I was simply referring to the paid-up capital of the banks. Comment has been made on the very small capital of the Commonwealth Bank, but it does not follow that a bank with a capital of &#163;3,000,000 has three times the amount of influence on the  finances of Australia possessed by a bank with a capital of only &#163;1,000,000. The bank that has the confidence of the people behind it, and the credit of the whole nation to back it up, is much more powerful than a bank whose sole capital is expressed in millions of money. Gold may be very valuable, but public confidence is an even greater asset. The importance of the Commonwealth Bank is, therefore, not to be measured by the size of its capital, but as we propose to increase its capital to &#163;10,000,000, we shall be making it by far the greatest bank in Australia, as none of the other banks has a capital even remotely approaching that amount. We may confidently look to its management to utilize the increased capital to the very best advantage. If that is done, the Bank must do an enormous business. Even now, with merely a nominal capital of &#163;1,000,000, it is doing a big business. We have been challenged to name the benefits which have accrued to Australia from the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank up to the present time. It has done, perhaps, more to improve the working conditions of the clerical workers than anything else in recent times. The poorest paid clerical workers in this country up to the time the Commonwealth Bank began operations were bank clerks, and the fact that we have been able to give them better wages and working conditions would be in itself sufficient to justify the establishment of the Bank, even if there had not been many other good effects flowing from its creation. Since the war began, the existence of the Commonwealth Bank has created a sense of confidence in the banking institutions of Australia that they never had before. We can recall the banking panic of 1893; and in the present crisis we had all the elements of another. The fact that there has not been the slightest breath of anything of the kind is due to the establishment of the Bank by a Labour Government, with a Treasury note issue to back it up if necessary. The continual attempts of our political opponents to belittle the Bank have done them more harm than anything else I can think of. It has been about the most unpopular thing they could have done. From their standpoint it has been very bad political business, and I am surprised that men, so astute in other ways, have fallen into, and persisted in, the error. There is no denying the fact that they are hostile to the Commonwealth Bank, because their very criticism shows it, and they seem quite to forget that the Bank is an institution of which the people as a whole are proud. We have twenty-two private banks, and if it had been proposed to establish a twenty-third on the same basis, there would not have been a word of criticism or fault-finding. All the criticism has arisen from the fact that the twenty-third bank is a Government Bank. One would almost think, to hear members of the Opposition talking, that the Commonwealth, with its enormous business interests, had not a perfect right to establish a bank, if for no other purpose than to do its own business. One would imagine that it was an impertinence on the part of the people to take any part in the banking business of the country. I hope the increase of the capital of the Commonwealth Bank to &#163;10,000,000 is only the first step towards making the banking business of Australia a Government monopoly in the hands of the Commonwealth Bank. The most economical banking is banking on a large scale. </para>

                            <para>- The Commonwealth Bank will be justified by its competition with the other banks, and the sound business it will be able to do. It may take longer than some of us anticipated a few years ago, but I am satisfied that in. the course of time the Commonwealth Bank will displace most, if not all, of the private banks in Australia. It is only necessary to secure common-sense in its management, and as surely as the sun will rise to-morrow it must, as time goes; on, absorb all the other banks in this, country. It might interest honorable senators to know the number of banks operating in other countries as compared with the number in Australia. The United States of America possess a much larger population and greater wealth than we can claim in Australia, but I may inform honorable senators that there are no  less than 20,000 banks doing business in the United States. That will give some idea of the comprehensive nature of the banking system of that country. These banks have an aggregate capital of something like &#163;2,400,000,000. They include, of course, all kinds of banks. My contention is, that they would be much more sound if the number were cut down by half. The most expensive system of banking is that carried on by small banks. By banking on a large scale the gold reserves cau be accumulated at one centre. It is the fact that the Bank of England holds the gold reserves of all the other banks of the United Kingdom that makes its position so secure. I say that in the same way we should make the Commonwealth Bank powerful by making it the holder of the gold reserves of all the other banks in Australia. Banking cannot be carried on nearly so economically where each bank, no matter how limited its operations, holds its own gold reserves. There has long been a popular superstition that the Bank of England is a national bank, and it is that which accounts for its strength. As a matter of fact, the Bank of England is a private bank conducted for profit in the same way as any other bank in the United Kingdom. The only difference is that it has a charter from the Imperial Parliament, which gives it powers that are not possessed by the other banks. </para>

It is generally assumed that Bank of England notes are as good as gold, but whenever a financial panic has arisen in the Old Country the Imperial Government have had to rush to the rescue of that powerful institution. This has been largely due to the fact that the Bank of England notes have been considered as good as gold, and of more value than are notes of the Bank of France or of the banks in other countries.

                            <para>- I question very much whether it is. I think that the honorable senator will find if he looks into the matter that the Bank of France is in a sounder position than is the Bank of England. If there is a run on the Bank of France, the institution can shut down, and refuse to convert its paper into gold. The notes can be redeemed at will when the Bank considers it safe to redeem them. It has very seldom refused to convert paper into gold, but the fact that it has the power to do so at any time greatly strengthens its position. I have said that the practice of the Bank of England has been to encourage a popular belief that paper money is not as safe as gold, and this has led to rushes on the Bank in a time of financial crisis. The practice of the Bank of France, on the other hand, creates public confidence in the safety of its notes. People become accustomed to the paper currency, and have every confidence in it. I should like to see a similar practice adopted in Australia. It is a waste of wealth to have sovereigns, or even half-sovereigns, in circulation. We should have more paper money, and conserve our gold, and make the best possible use of it for the benefit of the  country. If  this course had been followed in the past in Australia we should be in a much better position than we are in at the present time. I agree with some of the criticisms as to the present management of the Commonwealth Bank. I have not a single word to say against the Governor of the Bank, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Denison</inline> Miller. I think that we have secured in him the man best fitted for the task with which he has been intrusted. But I think that there should be a Board of Control appointed by this Parliament. It should be of a non-party character, and should consist preferably of the  President  of the Senate and the  Speaker  of the House of Representatives, or of one or two members elected by this Parliament. Such a Board would be a great help to the Governor of the Bank. &#34; Many men, many minds,&#34; and in banking, as in everything else, two or three heads, are better able to think out a matter than is one. I am sure that it would be a matter of satisfaction to the Governor of the Bank if, in times of difficulty, he was in a position to refer to the members of a Board of Control. This course is followed by the best banks in other countries, and by the Bank of France, for which I have a great admiration, and the Governor and Deputy-Governor of which are appointed by the Government in the same way as the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. </para>

                        <para>. - I shall be very brief in my remarks. A great deal is made of the fact that certain members of the party to which I belong have criticised the constitution of the Commonwealth Bank. I have never, during the whole of my political career, said a word against that Bank. I recognise that the possibility of the establishment of such a Bank was contemplated by the framers of our Constitution. If the Liberals who framed the Constitution had not conferred upon this Parliament its powers of legislation in connexion with banking, there could be no Commonwealth Bank; and how will the charge lie against the party which provided the foundation for the establishment of this Bank of being hostile to the institution itself ? No ! What members of my party have done has been to criticise its constitution. They have not been hostile to the establishment of a national bank, and the criticism has not been confined to members of my own party. I think it has been indulged in by a gentleman who professes to know a great deal of banking. The  Hon.  King O&#39;Malley speaks in terms of great depreciation of the institution. </para>

                            <para>- He, of course, is in favour of a national bank, and so is the Liberal party, but it differs from the Labour party in regard to the necessary provisions to make it a sound and all-embracing institution. I give this measure my support, but I venture to say that it is singularly unsatisfactory to go in for the absorption of institutions which are not prepared to continue in the banking business. I remember reading some time ago a book called <inline font-style="italic">Monarchs who have Retired from Business.</inline> They had retired from business for the simple reason that they were given no opportunity of continuing it: they were dethroned monarchs. </para>

                            <para>- I would allow any failure to go out of business, for the law of the survival of the fittest insures that only those who are fitted to continue shall survive. The honorable member has expressed the hope that eventually we will make a national monopoly of banking. I hope we shall do no such thing, for although I have plenty of good will towards our national institution, I hope to see it make itself strong, and so justify itself in competition with other hanks. What have the poor other banks done? We have heard a great deal about patriotism, a. great deal about the contributions to funds which have been established for the national benefit during this time of crisis. The associated banks have, quite recently, come to the assistance of the Commonwealth with a loan of &#163;10,000,000 in gold. That sum, I have no doubt, could have been used by the banks in connexion with the development of the resources of Australia, and in all probability it would have been returning something m the way of 6 per cent.- that is, &#163;600,000. </para>

                            <para>- Very well, sir. I resent unfair criticism of the private banks just as I resent unfair criticism of the Commonwealth Bank. I deny the allegation that the Liberal party is hostile to this institution. I, for one, have not said a syllable against it. I know that a large number of politicians hope to see the Commonwealth Bank established as a sound and satisfactory institution, and the rest of the criticism which has been advanced from time to time is that there has not been an amplification of its powers, and that the spirit of cooperation with the States has not been observed. There has been no criticism of the institution itself. I, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> express a hope that there will be the closest criticism of any financial institution which the Commonwealth Bank is intended to absorb. When an insurance company seeks absorption at the hands of a greater institution, the natural inference is that the business of the former is not in every respect satisfactory. That inference I think I may be permitted to draw in connexion with institutions which desire to go out of business permanently. I hope that the greatest circumspection will be exercised in regard to the absorption, by the Commonwealth Bank, of any other financial institution within the limits of the Commonwealth. I hope that the capital will be given to the Bank. I have no quarrel with the Bank, nor has the Liberal party as a whole, because it is the party that provided the foundation for the erection of the structure. But I will say the final word against the idea in the minds of some gentlemen that paper is entirely satisfactory as a means of circulation, and that the people should be advised to allow any Administration to indulge in the issue and circulation of paper that has not a substantial gold backing. I have been recently in a country where paper was at a discount. The people of that country have the keenest knowledge of banking. They understand how to make money by exchange. They are an industrious commercial people, but had got it into their heads that theirs was an unsustained paper issue. During my journey in that country I was able to purchase for a note - a note issued by a bank in Hong Kong, exchangeable only for silver - three notes of assumed equal value issued by the Provincial Government of the country, that is to say, the notes were only interchangeable at a discount of 66 per cent. I admit that people, if they have confidence in the fact that they, may get gold or silver for a note, will be content with paper. But let them get the idea into their head that on presentation a note will not be paid in gold or silver, and there will be a calamitous result. While I agree with. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley&#39;s</inline> remarks as to the care we must exercise so far as the absorption of other banking businesses by the Commonwealth Bank is concerned, I sincerely deprecate the inference I drew from other remarks he made to the effect that we could at any time, because of the resources of this country, issue paper, which perhaps, in the long run, would have an insufficient gold backing. The resources of a country are not sufficient to give people confidence in a paper issue. They must have confidence, not only in the resources of a country in a general way, but in the resources of its Government to give them metallic money in exchange for paper which has been issued with the sanction of authority. I support this measure, and I dissociate myself from any expression of hostility towards the Commonwealth Bank. I insist that the Liberal party has not at any time criticised the Bank in an unfriendly spirit, but it does desire to sec recrimination cease. It desires to see hostility on the part of the National Administration towards the financial necessities of the States cease. It is known to honorable senators opposite that the State I assist to represent fell in with a proposal of the Commonwealth authorities in connexion with the savings bank business. We had to do it because that business in Tasmania was conducted through the medium of the post-office. We would have had to find hundreds of thousands of pounds to provide institutions for State banking. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> has pointed out, we were engaged in this business first, and the man in possession does not like to be dispossessed. We wanted the money - for what purpose ? The State was continually advancing the money it derived from the Savings Bank to the farmers to provide for the development of its landed resources to encourage the young men to go on the land. There was a natural spirit of reluctance on the part of the State authorities to see the whole of the savings bank business pass straight away to the Commonwealth. They wanted some guarantee that they would have control of a large amount of the money which is provided by the thrift of the people to develop our landed resources. There is no spirit of hostility to the Bank in the Liberal ranks. We wish it well, but we desire care and the spirit of co-operation to be exercised in connexion with all our natural opportunities. </para>

                <para>I wish to say that it is merely intended to cover up an illegal action, if I may so term it. Section 6 of the Australian Notes Act provides that in the issue of Australian Notes those notes are to be issued and dated from the Commonwealth Treasury. Now, it has been the practice of some of the banks to date their notes, and for others not to date them. Some Commonwealth Notes were issued without a date. The attention of the Government was drawn to the fact, and as it raised the question of whether they were legal tender, it was decided to amend the Act by the omission of the words &#34;and bear date at.&#34; The Bill is purely a formal measure. </para>

                        <para>- It is designed to correct an irregularity which has arisen, but which could not possibly have been foreseen. Section 15 of the Public Works Committee Act provides that works begun before the Committee were appointed should not be referred to it. Now, although the Act was passed in 1913, the Committee have only just been appointed. Consequently a number of works passed in the Estimates of 1913-14, and already begun, could not be referred to the Committee, as that Committee did not exist. The Committee now having been appointed it is proposed to refer to them the works which the Act says shall be referred to them, but it is not possible, without this Bill, to refer to them the works which have already been commenced. </para>

The circumstances have arisen through the terms of the Act under which the Committee was appointed. It provides that work exceeding &#163;25,000 in value must be referred to the Committee for report. It was recognised that, owing to the suspension of the sittings of Parliament until April, those works might not be proceeded with, and that there was a certain amount of unemployment which should be minimized by the Government wherever reasonably practicable. It has been proposed by members of the Committee, as well as by the Government, that the mere fact that we have passed a </para>

                <para class="block">Bill to provide that no works exceeding &#163;25,000 in value shall be proceeded with without the authorization of the Public Works Committee should not militate against the chance of minimizing unemployment. The Prime Minister has taken the Committee into his confidence regarding certain works, and asked the Committee to inform him what works they deem necessary to be more fully considered by them. Those are being formally remitted to the Committee by resolution by the House of Representatives. The original Bill requires that those works shall be so remitted, but the intention of this Bill is to provide that there shall be no interruption of public works development on account of the Christmas vacation, except in relation to works which the Committee have already indicated as properly remittable to them. The Bill is the outcome of a consultation between the Prime Minister and the Committee. It is well within the purpose which both parties wish to achieve, and the Senate will run no risk in passing it. </para>

                <para>The object is to exempt from training in times of peace the classes of persons referred to who are employed in the Defence Department. A number of difficult positions are created by the fact that the Department has to employ persons liable for military training. Those persons are really carrying out military service, and if they can be called away, the Department which is responsible for the military defence of the Commonwealth may practically be hamstrung. Considerable confusion is also caused by the fact that some of those persons already hold honorary rank as military clerks, and if .called on for military training may be given rank in the Forces also. A most peculiar set of conditions may arise, and  may  even arise if they are not given rank in the Citizen Forces. A military clerk who is an honorary captain by reason of his position in the Department may be a private, corporal, or sergeant in the Forces. The main point, however, is that the compulsory provisions of the Defence Act can cause, and have at times caused, a dislocation of the administration of the defence organization by taking men away from defence work for defence training. It is, therefore, considered desirable, and never more desirable than at a time like this, that those employed in the Defence Department should be exempt from the compulsory training provisions of the Defence Act. </para>

                    <para>. - I am sorry I cannot fall into line with the Minister in this matter. We are asked to take a distinctly retrograde step. This is a proposal for times of peace, and it is only in times of peace that it ought to be considered. In a time of war other conditions prevail. We must guard in this country against, not only the creation of a caste with military privileges, but even the suspicion that an effort is being made to create it. I suggest that this is such an effort. I see no reason why a clerk who, in  ordinary  times of peace keeps his ledger or records in. the Defence Department, should not give him afternoons for training in the same way as a clerk in private employment. The Minister says inconvenience is caused, but it is caused also in every private factory in the country. There is always power to exempt on special occasions, and we certainly should not grant to these lads a privilege not enjoyed by their fellows in private employ. </para>

When the Defence Department ask everybody to fall into line and sympathetically support the compulsory training movement, they should&#39; not say &#34; All you people in private employment must do your duty, but those employed by us are to be exempt from these extra departmental duties.&#34; Physical improvement has always been urged as one of the chief advantages of universal training, and if there is anything in that argument these boys in the Defence Department should not be deprived of it. The Minister referred to the anomalies that might be caused if some one in the Department was junior to another to whom in the camp he became senior, but yesterday the Senate unanimously applauded <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating&#39;s</inline> statement that, in one tent in a military camp, a number of privates were under the direction of a sergeant who, in private life, had been shearing for two of them. </para>

                        <para>- Never mind who put it forward, we shall discuss it on this basis. I ask the Committee to consider whether it is fair that these lads who, because of the positions they occupy and their hours of work, are envied by many outside, should be exempt in times of peace from a liability which we have decreed shall fall generally upon the young men of this country. I see no reason for this exemption. It has a very unsavoury aspect, inasmuch as it must create an impression outside that those who are fortunate enough to be employed in the Defence Department will enjoy privileges which are denied to others. If we are going to have a compulsory system, let us have it. If at any time the calling out of these young men for training would be inconvenient to the Department, the Minister has ample power under the existing Act to exempt them from training, as he frequently does in the case of those in private employ. I am sorry that the measure should have been brought forward at this period of the session, because I feel that it is now impossible for the matter to be as fully considered as its importance deserves. </para>

                    <para>. - I am sorry that the Leader of the Opposition should have attached so much importance to what I said about rank in an effort to introduce a little humour into the discussion. Although this has reference to training in time of peace, that training goes on in time of war also. I take the case of men employed in the small arms factory at Lithgow. We have a large number of young men working there. It might be necessary to call out the regiment in that district for mobilization. These young men are doing very important work in manufacturing small arms. We might call them out for a came of training, because such camps are held in time of war as well as in time of peace. </para>

                        <para>- A great many things are done, but it is better that they should be done legally. We might bring in an amendment of the Act to exempt such employes in time of war. I confess that I am more concerned about their exemption in time of war than about their exemption in time of peace. Section 138 of the principal Act deals with exemption from training in time of peace, and I remind honorable senators that under that section we have exempted persons employed in the State Police and Prison Department. They are exempt even in time of peace, and all that we are asking here is for the same exemption in respect of our own employes. This proposal would not apply to senior cadets. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> references to boys lead me to think that the honorable senator is under the impression that this proposal applies to cadets. It applies only to the Citizen Forces mentioned in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of section 138 of the principal Act. I am asking only for the same exemption of employes of the Defence Department that we have already made provision for in the case of the employes of the State Police and Prison Department. With the exception of the factory operatives, the bulk of these are under military discipline and are part of a military organization. If men employed in factories under the Defence Department are called out for camp training they will have a divided duty. On the one hand, they must keep the factories going; and on the other, they must attend a camp of training. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> says that we can exempt them from going into camp, but we have no legal authority for doing so. If we could do so without legal authority in time of war, we could do so in time of peace. If it is to be done it should be done under statutory authority. If a company were established at Lithgow, I venture to say that three-fourths of it would be comprised of men engaged in the Lithgow Small Arms Factory. If the company was called out in time of war, only one-fourth would respond, as the other three-fourths would necessarily be kept at work in the factory. I am as much opposed to unnecessary exemptions as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> can possibly be, and I would not permit men to escape military training merely because they happened to be employed in the Defence Department. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is aware that there have been cases where it has been found necessary to strain the law to prevent its interference with the performance of other defence obligations by officers of the Department. A further Defence Bill of a more comprehensive character must be introduced next year ; and I can promise honorable senators that, if the operation of this measure is found to exempt men whose training would not interfere with the carrying out of the work they perform for the Department they will be once more brought under the compulsory training (provisions. I desire only to extend the exemption to individuals whose callings in time of peace or in time of war might seriously interfere with the operation of the machine necessary for carrying on the defence of the country. </para>

                        <para>- I am prepared to take the assurance of the Minister that there would be no undue exemption to the officers mentioned in the amendment if the matter were left to him. If they are to be made absolutely exempt, however, we should hesitate about agreeing to the amendment. To exempt them absolutely would be wrong. One reason why I think so is that that would at once differentiate between those employed in the Defence Department and persons in private employ, and it might very easily be said that those in the Department are very ready to impose upon others laws which they are not prepared to obey themselves. If these officers were made  exemptable  by the Minister, I should be prepared to accept his assurance that there would be no derogation of duty on their part that was not sanctioned by the requirements of the Department. </para>

                    <para>. - After the Minister&#39;s assurance, I think it ought to be possible to adjust this matter in a few minutes. The Minister has shown that he does not desire to exempt from military obligation those who might be called upon to go through their training without detriment to the work of the Department. I have no doubt that the amendment would make it legal to exempt the civil employes of the Defence Department. I should like to suggest a way out of the difficulty which would conform to the views expressed in this debate and to those which the Minister has just enunciated. By the insertion at the beginning of the amendment of the words &#34; Subject to the Minister&#39;s approval,&#34; we should make it competent for the Minister to say whether any particular class in the Department could attend military trainin? or could not. That would enable the Minister to give effect to the view which he says he holds. </para>

                <para class="block">The Bill is very brief, and practically explains itself. Its object is to raise the standard from 35 to 45 per cent. overproof in regard to Australian standard malt whisky and Australian blended whisky. The Customs Act provides for the maturing of whisky in two years, but it has been found that with the standard fixed at 35 per cent. the whisky contains so many impurities that it is impossible for it to mature in two years. It is believed that by altering the standard to 45 per cent., the whisky will be purer, better, and more marketable article and will mature in the time prescribed by the Customs Act. It is considered that this amendment of the principal Act will give Australian whisky a better chance in the markets of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister has said very clearly that the effect of the amendment will be to allow whisky to go out in two years, although it has been proved by experience that in that time it does not come up to the standard adopted. So that, rather than call on the holders of whisky to hold it a little longer, the clause, in effect, lowers the standard. Although it may be a great advantage to the holders and the manufacturers of whisky, I think that, on the whole, it will be a detriment to the people of Australia, and I am perfectly certain that, in years to come, it will be injurious to the trade itself, by giving to Australian whisky a lower standard and reputation than it should enjoy. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the suggestion I am going to make to the Minister will be taken in a proper spirit. I do not think that any information which has been given to the Senate can give us an assurance that, so far as the public are concerned, the Bill is required. It may be required from the departmental view ; but their case is not very strong as presented in the memorandum read by the Minister. I do not think that advantage should be taken of the fact that this branch of the Legislature is ready to sanction a good deal of work that is dealt with in the other House, and, perhaps, dealt with there rather rapidly. I ask honorable senators to consider whether it is right to pass a measure of this kind on the little information which has been furnished. The only justification for the measure seems to be a departmental one; but that does not seem to be a very strong one. It certainly does not appeal to me, nor do I think that it appeals to any honorable senator. I am quite prepared to recognise that, in matters of this kind, the Department and the Minister must introduce measures to bring the law into certain lines to carry out what is the obvious spirit of the community; but I do not think that we have heard anything to justify this Bill being rushed through the Senate, and unless honorable senators are satisfied that there is some justification other than that which we have heard, we would be quite justified, I think, in asking the Minister to defer the consideration of this clause until we meet again, and to let us have a Merry Christmas in the meantime. </para>

I cannot say whether I am right or wrong; but, apparently, there is an arrangement between the Department and the manufacturers of whisky to make up to them for what the Department should have done. In my opinion, the Customs Department should have afforded our Australian whisky distillers more protection than they now enjoy. When the duty upon imported whisky was raised, the Excise duty should not have been increased to the same extent. This Bill apparently represents an effort to overcome that mistake by allowing Australian distillers to supply the public with inferior whisky. I do not think that that is a right course to pursue. </para>

                    <para>. - I yield to no man in my desire to encourage the establishment of Australian industries, and I see no reason why the whisky-drinking public should not be supplied with Australian whisky. But I would be the last to suggest that encouragement should be afforded our whisky distillers to produce an inferior article. Everything that Australians manufacture should be of the very best quality. If this Bill represents an attempt to encourage our whisky distillers because they have not enjoyed a sufficient measure of protection, I say that the Government are going the wrong way to achieve their object. Is the matter one of such urgency that its consideration cannot wait until the Tariff is being dealt with in a general way ? I recollect that on a previous occasion the distillers of Australia were singled out for special consideration. Our agricultural implement makers and our distillers were selected for special treatment because they urged that if Parliament did not go to their rescue their industries would be strangled. Apparently the whisky distillers of the Commonwealth have only to make known their desire in order to assure that desire being granted. I say that they are entitled to no more consideration than is any other manufacturer. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> that the measure represents an attempt to extend protection to our whisky distillers who are dissatisfied with the protection they at present receive. If we pass the Bill, the quality of the whisky produced in the Commonwealth will not be as good as it is supposed to be to-day. Seeing that we are nearing the festive season, when the weather is usually warmer than is that experienced during the winter months, and when whisky is not so largely consumed, it appears to me that this matter cannot be one of extreme urgency. Before granting special consideration to our distillers at a time when the importation of spirits is more limited than it was a few months ago, we should consider the position very carefully. The matter, I repeat, is not one of urgency, and I see no reason why the Australian distiller should be singled out for special consideration. Seeing that the Bill will affect the consumption of Australian whisky, we ought to hesitate before we pass it. </para>

                    <para>. - In view of the expressions of opinion by honorable senators, I thought that the Assistant Minister would have endeavoured to meet the general desire. But as he apparently intends to force the measure through this Chamber, there is another argument that I propose to address to the Committee. By interjection just now the honorable senator endeavoured to institute a comparison between imported and Australian whiskies. As we are now invited to raise the strength of whisky from 35 to 45 per cent, overproof, I would like to ask what are the figures in regard to imported whiskies. As I understand the position, they still stand at 35 per cent. In other words, our Australian whiskies are to be of lower quality than are imported whiskies. Until further information, upon this matter is forthcoming, I hope that the Bill will not be pressed. Seeing that the existing Tariff has been in operation for two or three years, and that no complaints have been received under this heading, I would suggest that the consideration of the measure should be deferred until we meet again. </para>

                        <para>- The assumption that the Government intend to reduce the standard of whisky ought not to be accepted for a moment. Whilst I am not prepared to say that Australia is a large consumer of whisky, there is, nevertheless, a fair quantity of that spirit consumed in this country, and the consumption of Australian whisky in (proportion to the total whisky consumption suggests that our distillers have not been sufficiently protected. It is exceedingly regrettable that whisky drinkers turn up their noses at the Australian article. From the very best information obtainable, I gather that this is chiefly due to an excess in Australian whisky of the by-product known as fusel oil. In framing the existing Tariff, Parliament fixed a period within which whisky has to be matured in wood, namely, two years. It has been conclusively proved that Australian whisky will not mature in wood in that period. </para>

                    <para>.- I am not opposed to the establishment and encouragement of Australian industries. It is extraordinary that the distilling industry should be singled out for special consideration. What is the explanation ? Since we passed the last Tariff seven years ago our distillers have been enjoying the protection given by it, and now, on the eve of an adjournment, we are asked to consider a measure giving them further protection as a matter of urgency. Why is it urgent ? Has the necessity just been discovered? There is a shortage in our importations, mainly owing to the war, and that ought to be sufficient encouragement to our distillers ; but, not satisfied with that, they want Parliament to allow them to make and sell whisky at 45 per cent, instead of 35 per cent, over-proof. I am curious to know why the Bill is introduced. Are we to understand that it is to give greater protection ? Are the distillers in such desperate straits that they cannot wait, as everybody else has to do, until the Tariff is considered next year? </para>

                <para class="block">The object is to continue the existing Act for eighteen months, until 31st December, 1915, in continuation of the policy of giving a bounty to the iron industry. An additional &#163;30,000 is provided for the purpose, but whereas the bounty was previously 12s. a ton, it now becomes 8s. a ton. Under the old Act, manufacturers were not allowed to use any scrap iron in the production of pig iron made from Australian ore for the purpose of claiming the bounty, but under this Bill it is provided that the bounty may be granted so long as not more than <inline font-style="italic">6</inline> per cent. of scrap iron is added. The bounty may be withheld by the Minister if the standard of wages paid is lower than that determined by the  President  of the Federal Arbitration Court, and if at any time Parliament imposes an import duty to protect the iron industry this Bill will simultaneously cease to operate.

We have iron deposits in a number of States which have never been previously worked, and we should encourage their use, and not the use of iron or steel which has been produced elsewhere. </para>

                    <para>. - I understand that it is not claimed that the pig iron will be rendered superior in any way by the using of a small quantity of imported iron; but the market is limited, and the industry has not reached a stage at which it can be kept going in full blast. Old scrap iron, including old horse-shoes, and, I believe, even old nails, is available, and the manufacturers do not think the use of a limited quantity should disqualify them from getting the bounty. The Government think that, in order to help the Australian industry, it is as well to be a little generous in that regard by not preventing the manufacturers throwing a few old horse-shoes into the smelter. </para>

                            <para>- At the present time we axe in a much more serious position, and, owing to the war, the necessity of summoning both Houses of this Parliament at an earlier date than the 14th April next might arise. I think that this is a convenient time to say that, speaking for my honorable colleagues and myself, we desire to return to you, sir, the  Chairman  of Committees, the Temporary Chairmen and honorable senators generally, our sincere thanks for the courtesy and kindness that have at all times been extended to us. Though the session has been a short one, we have passed some valuable legislation. The consideration meted out to the members of the Government in the Senate has been such as to justify us in feeling grateful to honorable senators on both sides. I should like also to bear in mind the work of the officers of the House and the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff, who have at all times carried out their duties well and given us every assistance. May I, in conclusion, wish you, sir, the  Chairman  and Temporary Chairmen of Committees, honorable senators generally, the officers of the House and the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff, a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. I trust that we shall return early in the new year reinvigorated. I express a hope, which I am sure finds an echo in every heart, that we may return under happier circumstances, that the cloud which now lies over the Empire may by that time have lifted, and that brighter days may be in store for everybody. </para>

                        <para>. - I rise for the purpose of indorsing and reciprocating the remarks which the Leader of the Government in the Senate has been good enough to address to us. The Senate is under an obligation to you, sir, for the assistance and guidance you have given it on all occasions, and for the kindly control you have exercised. Our obligations extend also to those in subordinate positions in the Senate. I can only say it must be a source of satisfaction that, however much we may differ&#34; in political views during this session, although some contentious measures have been presented for our consideration, there has been no evidence of any personal ill-feeling amongst honorable senators. I therefore, with additional pleasure and sincerity, extend to my honorable friends opposite, on behalf of all the honorable senators on this side, those very kindly seasonal greetings which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was good enough to extend to us. </para>

                        <para>- Before putting the motion I desire, first of all, on my own behalf, to thank the Minister of Defence and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> for the kindly references they have made to me and to the conduct of business in the Senate during the session. I have endeavoured to discharge the duties devolving on me as fairly and as impartially as I could, and to protect the interests and rights of every individual senator. If I have in any way fallen short of that ideal, it has not been from any want of will to attain it. I shall always do my best to maintain good relations between the members of the Senate. I thank honorable senators for their kindly assistance and cordial co-operation, which has made what would otherwise have been an onerous task a light and pleasing duty. On behalf of the staff of the Senate, who cannot express their opinions on the floor of this Chamber, I thank the Minister of Defence, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> and honorable senators on both sides for the kindly way in which the; have been referred to, and for the kindly treatment which has always been meted out to the officers and servants of the Senate and the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> stall. From my close association with them, I am in a position to say that no Legislative Chamber could be better served than the Senate has been by the officers and servants of the Senate and the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff. They have at all times been most willing to place themselves at the disposal of honorable senators, and to do all  they  possibly could to assist them. I can assure Senators Pearce and Millen that their good wishes for a pleasant Christmas and a happy and prosperous New Year are heartily reciprocated. I re-echo ...- hope that when we meet again there will be a bright and cheery prospect before us, and that we  shall  be able to look back upon great achievements accomplished by our race during the interval, with the result that it will not in the future be called upon to face such trials as those to which it is subjected at the present time. I extend to the Ministry, the Leader of the Opposition, and every member of the Senate the most cordial greetings for the Christmas season, and I hope that we shall return rejuvenated at the close of the special adjournment. To come to purely official business, in view of the fact that it is impossible to say when the necessity for summoning Parliament together may arise, I should like honorable senators, if they are away from their usual place of residence during the adjournment to be careful to keep myself and the officers of the Senate informed of any change  in  their address, so that I  may  be able to communicate  with  them in the shortest possible space of time. If it should be necessary, I shall not only summon honorable senators by telegram, but if time permits I shall summon them by letter as well. In order that I may do so, I ask them to keep me informed of the address at which they can most readily be found during the adjournment. Question resolved in the affirmative. </para>

                    <para>. -  I am sorry to have to detain the Senate, even for a few seconds, but I feel that a statement having been made in the Chamber recently, and appearing on record in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> I am justified, even at this late hour, in asking the attention of the Senate for a couple of minutes whilst I make reference to it. The statement was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> that certain land in South Australia had been purchased by the Defence Department for the purpose of a rifle range, that on the land were several very valuable buildings, and that although the land and the buildings were entirely suitable for the purpose for which they had been bought, they were resold to a private individual for a sum much less than the value of them. The honorable senator went on to say that he was quite sure that a Labour Government would not have been guilty of this act of re-sale of land to a private individual. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> affirmed - the statement is there in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> - that it must have been a Liberal Government which did it. The simple facts are that a previous Labour Government did purchase this land with its buildings for the State Government, but the area was greatly in excess of that which was required by the Defence Department. The State Government, however, would not sell a portion, and therefore the Defence Department had to purchase, during <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> previous term of office, the whole in order to obtain the portion it wanted, and so was left with an excess on its hands. Then the question of disposing of the excess came up, and it was finally determined by the Defence Department to surrender that portion, and the Department of Home Affairs was called upon to take action. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior&#39;s</inline> statement was that the whole area had been resold for &#163;1,000. I find that it was the surplus area only which was sold, and the decision to sell it was arrived at by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> O&#39;Malley, who was then Minister of Home Affairs. Applications were invited from persons willing to purchase, but there was no response to thf advertisements. A little later, offers <inline font-style="italic">were</inline> again invited - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly</inline> was then Assistant Minister - and an oner was received, which the Minister regarded as too low, and, as a consequence, other negotiations took place with the tenderer, who finally agreed to make his price &#163;1,700. I only wish to say that the inaccuracies in the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior,</inline> no doubt made without a full examination of the whole matter, do, as they are printed in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> make it appear that there has been some wrong action on the part of the Defence Department. The disposal of that land had nothing to do with that Department, and the facts given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior,</inline> are, as shown by the replies to my inquiries at the Department, totally inaccurate. It was not the whole of the land, but only the portion which the Department did not want which was sold, and the price obtained was &#163;1,700, not &#163;1,000. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to make a few comments on this case, because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> is not here to speak for himself. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> gave me a hint that he intended to speak on this matter by the fact that he asked the Department for certain information which was supplied to him by me. Seeing that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> had raised the question, I anticipated that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> would raise it too, and so I obtained the file. I find that part of the history given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is correct, and that the approval for the sale was given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly.</inline> It is not, however, to be inferred that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> O&#39;Malley had given an indication that if that sum could be obtained he would approve of the sale. All that he had committed himself to was that the surplus land should be sold ; he had not committed himself to any price. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior&#39;s</inline> remarks which I read in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> were rather directed to the assertion that the land had been sold for less than it is worth. I do not intend to read the file - it is here, and the remarks of the property officer are here. In justice to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> it ought to go on record that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> O&#39;Malley did not commit himself to any price. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly</inline> approved of the sale for &#163;1,700, which was the offer of Elder Smith and </para>

                        <para>- I am not positive that he said that. Anyhow, whether he said that the Department sold the whole or a part, the purport of his charge was that it was sold for- less than its value, not simply that it was sold. I have read his remarks, and that  is  what he was driving at right through. </para>
