          <para>SenatorRUSSELL. - Seeing that the rolls now&#39; exhibited at post-offices and other public places are somewhat ancient, and may be misleading, inasmuch as people, seeing their names upon those rolls, may be led to believe that they will appear on the rolls for the election, though they may have since been struck off, I ask whether the Vice-President of the Executive Council will see that a  placard is prominently exhibited with the rolls in all these places, intimating to the electors that wherever there is any doubt they may inspect the rolls at the Registrar&#39;s office. </para>

            <para>- I wish to ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council whether it is a fact that, as reported in an interview with him in the daily press last week, he stated that the number of electors on the rolls in Victoria at the forthcoming elections would be considerably less than the number on the rolls on the 31st May, 1913, and, if the statement be correct, how does the honorable senator reconcile it with the fact that during the last twelve months, by immigration and in other ways, there has been a considerable increase in the population of this State? </para>

            <para>- Before asking the Vice-President of the Executive Council a question, I desire to say that complaints have reached me from a place called Noggerupp, which forms a part of a timber district in Western Australia, that the names of electors are being struck off the rolls, and that when voters apply at the local post-office for enrolment cards they are informed that none is available. It is further stated that the postmaster is a Liberal partisan, and is doing everything he can to prevent the men employed  in that locality from getting their names upon the rolls. Will the Vice-President of the Executive Council make inquiries into this matter with a view to ascertaining what truth is contained in these complaints ? </para>

              <para>- The honorable senator will see from the statement what has taken place. The Prime Minister advised  His Excellency,  in accordance with the provisions of section 57 of the Constitution, to dissolve simultaneously the Senate and the House of Representatives, and assured him that the requirements of the Constitution had been complied with. The Prime Minister also pointed out to  His Excellency  the almost equal numbers in the House of Repre sentatives and the small number supporting the Government in the Senate, and that in consequence the Parliament was unworkable, that it was impossible to manage efficiently the public business, and that, in his (the Prime Minister&#39;s) opinion, a dissolution of both Houses should be granted.  His  Excellency&#39;s reply was to accede to the request, and grant an immediate simultaneous dissolution on condition that a definite assurance was given that the financial position was such that adequate provision could be made for carrying on the public service during the period of time covered by the elections. </para>

            <para>- I ask the Minister of Defence whether his attention has been called to statements published in the Melbourne press to the effect that the Government contemplate altering the Electoral Act by means of regulation, so as to restrict the exercise of the absent vote in such a way that many thousands will be practically disfranchised? The press reports affirm that at the forthcoming election absent voters, instead of being permitted to vote at the nearest polling booth, will be obliged to make application to the Registrar prior to polling day for an absent voter&#39;s certificate. I desire to know whether any such alteration in our Electoral Act is contemplated, and, if so, what is the reason for it? </para>

              <para>- In anticipation that this question would present itself to-day, I have prepared a brief statement on the position which exists at Cockatoo Island. It is as follows :  - Some few days ago the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> announced that a confidential report on the condition of affairs at Cockatoo Island Dockyard had been forwarded by the manager of the yard <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. King Salter)</inline> to the Minister; and appended what purported to be a summary of the contents of this document. Generally, the facts set out in the press announcement have been known to me for some time. Before I took office, even, the then acting manager <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cutler)</inline> had reported upon the deficiency of labour at the establishment, and, from time to time, reports were received upon other aspects of the matter. Before taking any action in the matter, however, it seemed highly desirable, indeed necessary, that the new manager should be allowed sufficient time to make himself thoroughly acquainted with the existing state of affairs, in order that he should be in a position to speak from actual experience as to any changes that might be regarded as necessary or desirable. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> Salter took up duty in early March, but since then there have been certain disputes between different unions, whose members are employed at the Dockyard, regarding the demarcation of work as between one union and the other. I considered it of paramount importance to endeavour to adjust these disputes before proceeding to the consideration of any comprehensive change in the conditions of employment at the Island. My efforts to adjust these differences met with some measure of success, but, in one case, owing to the failure of the union to observe a decision which it had previously agreed to accept, one section of the work was, and still is, held up. It was in the course of interviews with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> Salter at this time that he acquainted me of the necessity for some important changes at the yard. The position of affairs disclosed was so serious and the remedy suggested such a considerable departure from existing practice, that a decision could not be arrived at without very serious consideration. Two courses appeared open to me : the first to approve of certain suggested alterations and announce them as representing the practice to be followed in future, or, secondly, confer with the men and frankly place the position before them, drawing their attention to the seriousness of the matter, its probable effect on the establishment, and on the industry of warship-huilding, and on their personal welfare as employes; and, by so doing, endeavour to enlist their co-operation in the introduction of changes necessary to the permanent efficiency of the establishment. I decided to adopt the latter course, and have only been prevented from taking the initial steps by sheer inability to find the time necessary for the undertaking. I hope before long I shall be able to take the first step in that direction. I should like to add that I am both surprised and indignant that the information contained in confidential reports has been furnished to the press. Unfortunately, this is not the first time that there has been flagrant violation of that responsibility to observe strict silence imposed upon officers in the Public Service. There has been quite a series of such leakages of official information from the Navy Department. So far, inquiries have not resulted in identifying the officer guilty of such a serious breach of confidence. I regret this, not only because until such officer is discovered it is obvious that furtherconfidential reports are liable to be made public, but for the further reason that quite a number of innocent officers are placed under suspicion through the default of one of their number. </para>

              <para>- I am quite aware that, at a farewell demonstration to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cutler,he</inline> expressed the hope that a number of those who were employed at Cockatoo Island Dockyard would make their services available at the new establishment of which he was to take charge. I am, therefore, not surprised to hear that the invitation given on that occasion has been responded to. </para>

            <para>- Has the attention of the Minister of Defence been drawn to the case of a lad named Roberts, who refused drill at the command of his parents, they being members of the Society of Friends? Is he aware that this lad was tried by the civil authority and sentenced to detention, and that, subsequently, he was again tried for the same offence by a court-martial, and sentenced to solitary confinement for one week at Swan Island, commencing last Saturday? Is the Minister carrying out the Defence Act in permitting any trainee guilty of an offence to be subjected to the barbarous punishment of solitary confinement? If not, what steps does he intend to take to abolish this atrocious practice, which, even in dealing with criminals, has been abandoned in most of the States? </para>

I did not use the word &#34;report,&#34; but I can see now that you were quite right in interpreting my words in the way in which you did. My reason for asking the question Was to ascertain if it would be possible to discuss the report, because I was anxious to make a statement regarding it, which I did not think I could do on a mere motion for printing. It seems to me that there is no opportunity for discussing the contents of the report now. </para>

        <para class="block">In submitting the motion, I take the opportunity to go more fully than I could have done in answering a question into the matter upon which information was sought by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae.</inline> The honorable senator referred to the case of a cadet named Roberts, at present undergoing detention at Queenscliff. I wish to give honorable senators all tho facts of the case, as they were reported to me. This lad was, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has stated, committed by the civil authorities for twentyone days&#39; detention for failure to render the -services required by the Defence Act. There was some representation made that this boy&#39;s health was such as to render it undesirable that he should undergo the drill. When that representation was made to me I gave special instructions that every precaution should be taken in the way of a medical examination to see whether there was the slightest justification for that plea. The boy was examined by the principal medical officer here,  Colonel Ryan,  who distinctly stated that in his opinion Roberts was fit to serve, but, to make sure, he recommended the postponement of his going into detention for three weeks. The boy went into detention, and the report from there is that he is a strong, healthy boy. When there, he refused to do any drill or to render any service, although ho was offered the choice, usually offered in such cases, of non-combatant duties - physical drill, flag signalling, and other duties of that kind. The boy refused for reasons which, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has indicated, are conscientious ones. When the question is put to me as to whether I am prepared to do anything in the case, I wish, first of all, to assure honorable senators that it is not a pleasure to me in a Ministerial position <inline font-style="italic">-to</inline> insist upon the carrying out of a law which has disagreeable consequences to certain individuals. </para>

            <para>- Yes, he is there now. For refusing to do his drill, he was given, as was done in many cases during my predecessor&#39;s time, seven days&#39; solitary confinement. That may seem harsh, but it seems to me to be necessary unless we are going to make some special provision for exempting those who object to drill on conscientious grounds. There must be some provision to meet a difficulty of this kind. Quite recently some seventy-nine boys &#39; were at Queenscliff. One of them refused to do any drill. He was allowed for a day or two, until some decision in his case could be arrived at, to wander aimlessly about avoiding the drill, which the other seventy-eight boys had to do. But seventy-eight young Australians are not slow to size up a position like  that.  When they saw that one boy could go on strike with impunity, it would not be long before the whole seventy-eight had intimated that they also were prepared to make a picnic of it. The position at Queenscliff then became serious. When it was pointed out to the boys that very unpleasant consequences would follow if they did not immediately do their drill, there was no further trouble with regard to the seventy-eight. I want honorable senators to acquit me, at any rate, of being unnecessarily harsh in the administration of the law. But I wish them also to ask themselves what they propose to do if they allow any boy to elect for himself whether he will obey the law or not ? That is the only alternative. </para>

I am not finding fault with the ration prescribed by my predecessor, but I made it a little more liberal than it was in his time. </para>

            <para>- Exactly. I have thrown out the invitation to representatives of the Society of Friends, Seventh Day Adventists, and others on more than one occasion to bring before me a practical provision which will enable me to meet their objections without, at the same time, opening the door to fraud, and said that, if they did so, I should be prepared to take the responsibility of. submitting it to Parliament, and consulting Parliament about it. They have been candid enough to admit to me that they cannot suggest such a provision. Much as we may sympathize with them, I want the Senate to understand that unless an alternative can be suggested to the mere granting of exemptions in the case of those who decline to obey the law, we shall break down the whole system. I am sure that everybody is keenly anxious to see this law carried to a successful issue. </para>

            <para>- What they attempted to do in New Zealand was nothing, and they did it most successfully. I have it from one of the highest authorities there, that, although Parliament passed a law, that law is not being carried out, and the result is that the Dominion is drifting into a system which, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has said, is very much of a voluntary system. If this Parliament desires a similar result to be brought about here, very well. But it is not right for the Commonwealth Parliament to pass a law, and then call upon the Minister to evade the consequences of it by granting exemptions. It has pained me more than once to know that these boys are placed in this position, and I shall appreciate any suggestion which will enable me, without violating the integrity of the Act, to meet such special cases. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator RAE</inline>(New South Wales) &#163;4.26&#93;. - The Minister of Defence has related some oi the facts concerning this matter, and has stated that he is in a difficulty in regard to it. I believe that, if we have a compulsory military system, we cannot allow conscientious objections to be merely a matter of statement. I am quite at one with those who urge that we cannot make exceptions in the case of persons who entertain religious objections any more than we can make exceptions in the case of persons whose conscientious objections are founded upon other grounds. But that does not free the Government, or any Government, from reproach if they allow the barbarous and mostly discarded punishment of solitary confinement to be inflicted - and inflicted in particular on a youth.

            <para>- I am not going into details. I merely wish to explain what I know about solitary confinement. When I had the distinguished honour of tenanting one of  His  Majesty&#39;s gaols, there was a man undergoing solitary confinement in a cell specially built for that-purpose. He had been there for a fortnight when I entered the general division. : This is no laughing matter, and I am not relating it with the idea of gaining personal kudos. As honorable senators are aware, I was imprisoned because I had stood up for the rights of unionism, and by so doing had inflicted wrong on nobody. When I had been there a fortnight, the man who had been suffering solitary confinement was released. He was a big strong fellow. I believe that our present comrade, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> was Minister of Injustice at the time. </para>

            <para>- Yes; because all rule under the old political party was practically injustice. That man had a much more limited ration served to him than is served to prisoners now. He received one pound of bread and a jug of water every twenty-four hours. From the yard in which I was exercising I witnessed a warder, accompanied by a goodconductprisoner, visit his cell in the morning carrying a pound of bread, an iron jug containing water, and a broom. When the warder unlocked the door, the goodconduct man handed the broom to the prisoner. The prisoner swept his cell until he approached within 2 or 3 feet of the door, and then, in order that he should not be permitted to see outside, the good-conduct man ha3 to step forward and sweep out the remaining part of the cell. The prisoner undergoing solitary confinement was then handed the jug of water and a pound of white bread - the least nourishing kind of bread - and was left locked up with that amount of food to satisfy him till 8 o&#39;clock the following morning. He saw and spoke to no one. He had no books and no light, except what crept through a narrow grating about 1 foot in depth and 2 or 3 feet in length, at the top of a very high cell. It would merely be a kind of twilight that he enjoyed, even at the best. The effect of this solitary confinement, and of being prevented from having intercourse with his fellows, was to injure his intellect to such an extent that he was never quite sane again. Similar results followed in the cases of other individuals so treated, and especially in the cases of those who were subjected to lengthy terms of solitary confinement. I know of two men who did nine months&#39; solitary confinement - or what was called &#34;separate treatment,&#34; which was practically the same thing - at the commencement of a sentence of two years for an alleged  riot, and these men were never perfectly sane afterwards. I mixed with them for two years subsequently, and I can honestly make that statement. </para>

            <para>- It is not the restricted diet which is the matter of chief concern. It is rather that a youth has to feed entirely on his own thoughts, being denied any opportunity of conversing with any fellow human being. That is an infliction which is most likely to throw anybody&#39;s intellect off the balance. At any rate, if it does nothing else, such treatment must absolutely crush the spirit of any youth. My contention is that, if the Minister of Defence and his Department are so absolutely destitute of brains that they cannot find a better solution of the difficulty- </para>

            <para>- I will, presently. If this kind of thing is to continue, to be logical, it ought to be followed up with another sentence if, at the termination of his period of detention, a boy still steadfastly refuses to conform to the law. We have to bear in mind that this is a doubledyed system of prosecution. In the first case, the civil authority sentenced the ,ad to twenty-one days&#39; detention. </para>

            <para>- I quite admit that. Acting upon his conscientious objection, which, whether we believe in it or not, is to be admired rather than reprobated, if it be insisted upon - the lad refuses to perform even non-combatant duties. He rightly argues that there cannot be anything in the nature of non-combatant duties other than what are aids to the whole military system. He says, in effect, &#34;If I am helping to cook the tucker for the soldiers who are going to fight, I am performing just as necessary a part of military operations as I would if I were handling a gun.&#34; </para>

            <para>- They do it voluntarily, in order to alleviate human suffering, but refuse to be made a part of the military system by being compelled to do it in a military camp. And there is a broad distinction in every walk of life between what one does voluntarily and what he is compelled to do. Coming now to a consideration of the position in which the Minister finds himself, what will be the effect of the decision of this court martial which, after the lad has been sentenced by the civil authorities to twenty-one days&#39; detention, subjects him to solitary confinement because he still refuses military duty, not in any offensive and truculent spirit, but acting on the instructions of his parents? If the military authorities find that they cannot break down the lad&#39;s spirit by resort to the barbarous system of solitary confinement, they should then, to be logical, resort to flogging, and, if the lad was still obstinate, end up the punishment by hanging or shooting him. If it is found that one punishment is not severe enough, and a military tribunal can by mere regulation inflict a more severe punishment, to be logical you must go to the greatest extreme possible in order to break down the opposition of any youth. </para>

            <para>- But the Minister has not proposed to limit the quality as well as the quantity of the punishment. I assert that there is irrefutable evidence, on the authority of medical men of the highest standing, of criminologists, and of other people who have given this subject the deepest consideration, that solitary confinement is an utterly barbarous  and indefensible form of punishment. It is absolutely torture, and as such it is universally denounced. </para>

I should say that refusal to do a thing is one offence, but to continue to refuse is not another, but the same, offence. I would graduate the punishment according to the degree of guilt, but I would certainly say that there should be a maximum term of imprisonment, and when that maximum term had been inflicted, the fact that the individual had endured it should be proof enough that his objection was a conscientious one. If we have a punishment for the breaking of a law, once that punishment is inflicted the offence is disposed of. </para>

            <para>- I say that there should be a maximum punishment, and once that punishment has been inflicted the offender should be regarded as having purged his offence. There is no other way of working the Act, because the alternative is that a boy, who, after release, is again put on the rack and still refuses service, is to be subjected to solitary confinement, and, possibly, still worse punishment, if that does not succeed in breaking down his objection. There is no justification in this age for an offence of this kind being met by such barbarous punishment. I do not advocate the voluntary system, which I know is one under which the friends of the Conservative party would shoot down the friends of the Democrats, and for that reason I hate it. I believe in the compulsory system, but I will lend my aid to any endeavour to wipe it out altogether if it is enforced by such a barbarous method of punishment as solitary confinement. </para>

          <para>. - I desire to ask the Minister of Defence a question before the Senate adjourns. In connexion with the statement made by the Federal Treasurer that taxation is pretty severe on the people of Australia, I asked the Munster what steps the Treasurer proposes to take to relieve the pressure of that taxation. The Minister&#39;s reply was that he would forward the question to the Treasurer, but lie did not say when he would forward it. If he has done so already, I hope he will be able to give a reply to the question at the next sitting. The Treasurer was very straightforward in his statement that the public of Australia are suffering from severe taxation, and, connecting that with the number of people who are availing themselves of the Maternity Allowance Act, he stated that, on account of the severe taxation, it was right that they should seek the benefits of the maternity allowance. I am glad to know that the mothers of Australia are availing themselves of the humane provisions of that legislation, but I want to know when and how the Treasurer of the Commonwealth is going to relieve the people of Australia from the severe taxation which, he says, they are enduring. I hope that the Minister, with his usual courtesy, will, on the next day of sitting, furnish the Senate with an answer to that question. One other matter I wish to mention. You, sir, have just met the representative of the King,  His Excellency  the GovernorGeneral, in the Library, where you presented to  him the Address-in-Reply from this </para>

That has been the usual custom during my connexion with the Senate, and I was surprised to-day that, when you, as  President  of the Senate, walked into the Library to present to  His Excellency  the Address-in-Reply to the Speech of his predecessor, there was not present one of the representatives of the Government in this Chamber. </para>

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> refused to move the usual motion that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President</inline> should present the AddressinReply, and to-day he has proceeded further than that. I regret to say he practically insulted the representative of the King by refusing to be present when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President</inline> presented the AddressinReply. Where does loyalty come in? Evidently it is lip loyalty. Even if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl.</inline> were a little perturbed because the Senate in the exercise of its constitutional rights amended the Address-in-Reply, at least the Ministers might have acted as men, and gone as men to the presentation of the Address-in-Reply to the GovernorGeneral. They have set an example which is not worthy of emulation, and I think that some explanation is due to honorable senators, which I trust will be given when the Minister of Defence is replying. </para>

          <para>. - In the event of the Treasurer finding it difficult to formulate a policy for lightening the load of taxation the payment of the maternity allowance is creating, I suggest that he could very materially lighten that load by foregoing the handsome pension he draws from the Government of Western Australia, namely, &#163;500 a year. It would lighten the load of the taxpayers of that State, or it might be arranged that, instead of the money being paid to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest, it should be paid to a fund to supplement the maternity allowance. As he has frequently complained about the great cost of the maternity allowance and oldage pensions, would it not be well to cut down the pensions of the rich before we touch the pensions of the poor? I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> who seems to have taken umbrage at the action of the Senate in amending the Address-in-Reply, that he was the first member of the Senate to move an amendment to an AddressinReply. That was during the first session of the first Federal Parliament.  His  little move at that time was to have immediate action taken to put an end to the employment of kanaka labour in Queensland. It was a pretty little party move for the purpose of taking advantage of a position without making a direct attack, for the purpose of inconveniencing those in power who were taking effectual steps to put an end to the kanaka traffic. The Government of the day knew that their proposals were ample, but the honorable senator wished to take direct action, if I may use the language of Syndicalists. However, the good sense of the Senate prevented it. I have been wondering whether, had the amendment then moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> been carried, the Government of. to-day would have acted in. the same spirit of. pique that appatently influences members of the present Ministry.. </para>

          <para>. - I wish to have a few words to say on the matter brought forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> concerning the fact that a youth under the drastic Defence Regulations has been subjected to solitary confinement. I believe in compulsory training; I have on all occasions unhesitatingly supported the principle, because it is essential for the future welfare of Australia; but if we wish to injure it we could not do it more effectively than by those responsible for the administration of the Defence Act allowing such cases to occur as those the Minister of Defence referred to in moving the adjournment of the Senate. The Minister asks what punishment should be placed upon drill-shirkers. I maintain that we should not inflict punishments that are out of date in enlightened countries in regard to the treatment of criminals. No one should undertake  fo criticise a punishment unless lie is prepared to submit an alternative. The alternative I suggest is that drill-shirkers should be compelled to do double time, and should be kept standing at attention on the parade ground while the others are at drill. It is just as easy to keep these youths at attention on the parade ground as to keep them in solitary confinement. It is merely a matter of a file of men marching them out. In the case of those who conscientiously object there would be no resistance to this punishment. Having to stand at attention on the parade ground and watch others drill would be punishment harder to bear than solitary confinement, and yet would have no serious results. Or let tlie youth be kept standing at ease or lying down on the parade ground. The ordeal of watching tlie other boys drilling would be enough. , There would be no more shirkers. </para>

            <para>- I have a better opinion of the Australian boys. There are thousands who enjoy the training. It will always be difficult to manage the Australian youth with English officers. We should have officers who are accustomed to our youths, and understand them. I am proud that there are some boys who are prepared to undergo punishment for the sake of their consciences. They are not a bad class. Looking for something in the shape of drastic punish ment is repugnant. To introduce solitary confinement, particularly under the circumstances, is to inflict a punishment that has been discarded even in our gaols. In New South Wales the prison authorities actually issue a newspaper for theinmates; and, no doubt, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> and others who think with him, would say that such a course must result in the whole of the people of New South Wales finding their way into gaol. Year after year, however, as more humane treatment is accorded, the gaol population is decreasing rapidly, showing that the. more enlightened system has the effect of keeping down crime. Those who would now impose seven days&#39; solitary confinement on a boy with pluck and spirit enough to fight against constituted authority, would, a few centuries ago, have advocated the ducking-stool or the rack. </para>

            <para>- I am now speaking of punishing people for something that in itself is not an offence. Punishment must always be commensurate with the offence, or we shall provoke opposition to our system of compulsory training. Here we actually have a boy sentenced to seven days&#39; solitary confinement for acting on conscientious beliefs which he has learned at his mother&#39;s knee; and such a punishment is1, in my opinion, out of the question. Of course, a boy who refuses to drill should not be put in a better position than that of his fellows, but, as I have already suggested, he should be compelled to remain on the parade ground for double the time if thought necessary. Solitary confinement under the most luxurious circumstances is a very severe punishment; and I do not believe there is one senator who does not, in his heart, feel a little respect for a youth- who is prepared to suffer for conscience sake. I recognise that these lads are difficult to handle, but a great deal of the difficulty arises from the abrupt and gruff methods adopted by men who are accustomed to treat one portion of tlie people as in no way their equal. </para>

            <para>- He is rebelling for conscientious reasons, and that makes the punishment all the more severe. We have a system of compulsory training, and if we do not succeed in carrying it out, we shall certainly lose Australia; but, at the same time, we have no right to inflict harsh, drastic, or unreasonable punishments. The system has not been adopted very long, and what surprises me is that there are not very many more objectors. It has worked very well, and will work all the better if we do not hear of such sentences. </para>

With regard to those who profess conscientious objections to fighting in defence of their property, I have this to say, that I have known such apostles of peace and harmony to be the most rabid defenders of proprietary rights in the Law Courts. To be logical, they ought, when struck on the one cheek, to turn the other, but they do not do so, and their conscientious objections to fighting apply only when they think that their skins are likely to be in danger. I have no sympathy with such persons. The best thing to do with them, if it were possible, would be to send them all to some other country, if one could be found, where their ideas would be more appreciated. </para>

He was placed in a room in which the gunners on duty at the fort used to sleep.

            <para>- Some lads under detention escaped, and on being recaptured were sent to Swan Island, from which they could not escape. I think that they there slept, not in cells, but in the ordinary sleeping quarters of the soldiers who are guarding the island. There should be no brutality or barbarous treatment in the punishment of offences under the Act, nor should the punishment be such as could injure the moral or physical health of those to whom it is applied. What the Department has aimed at, and I hope is still aiming at, is to get the lads to do their drill. If a lad will not do his drill in the ordinary way, he is made to undergo a period of detention ordered by a magistrate, and during the twenty-one days for which he is detained, he goes through the drill for the year, and some extra drill by way of penalty. But what about the boy who, when under detention, says, &#34;I will not drill&#34;? All that the law has behind it is force, and the penalties for the infraction of any law must in the last resort be enforced. In this case, the penalty is exceedingly humane. It cannot be said that detention and drill - healthy physical exercise - is inhuman. Those who are detained are given a liberal diet, and, in many cases, live in tents. I visited Fremantle to see a lad who was there undergoing detention, and found that he occupied the same quarters as the permanent soldiers, and there are now in the permanent garrison artillery at Fremantle three men who, after they had served a period of detention, enlisted in the regular forces. Evidently they did not consider their treatment inhuman. I do not think any of us would say that a Tad should be confined under the conditions pictured by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> as those of solitary confinement in our gaols. But there must be some form of punishment. While the Act remains on the statute-book I shall support its proper administration. If we are going to say that the time has arrived when we should not enforce it, then we ought to be honest enough to move at once for its repeal. Its administration, of course, should be characterized by justice, tempered with mercy. Youths should not he treated as criminals. They should not be subjected to treatment calculated to make criminals of them, and solitary confinement of the character referred to by the honorable senator would undoubtedly make criminals of many. I hope that the Minister will make an investigation, and let us know the facts leading up to the sentence and whether the sentence was imposed by court martial. </para>

            <para>- I hope that the Minister will let us know by what authority it was carried out, and whether or not the boy was placed in a healthy, well-ventilated cell. If he would not drill, it would have been absurd to allow him to remain with the other boys, and to sit still while they went out to do their drill. The effect would have been demoralizing. The other boys would have said at once: &#34;We have only to say that we will not drill, and we, too, shall be allowed to remain idle.&#34; When this boy refused to drill, he was separated from the other detainees, put in a cell, we are told, and taken out for an hour&#39;s exercise twice a day. Could that be said to be solitary confinement such as takes place under our penal laws? It is something totally different. If honorable senators are going to say that lads who refuse to drill should not be separated from the detainees who are prepared to drill, then they should tell us what ought to be done with them. </para>

            <para>- It should be the civil power; the military authorities should not be permitted to impose it. A boy, having been ordered into detention by a magistrate, the military authorities should not have power to send him into solitary confinement if, while suffering that detention, he refuses to drill. When he refuses to drill, he should be brought once more before the magistrate, and the magistrate, after hearing the facts, should state in open Court what further punishment should be imposed. Those who raise conscientious objections to drill are taking up an attitude reconcilable only with the immediate repeal of the Act. Nothing short of that will satisfy them. I said to those who interviewed m&#60;? on the subject, &#34; You will agree that it is a good thing that a large section of the community should be trained how to render first aid - how to deal with accidents or cases of sudden sickness. In the ambulance corps that instruction can be given, and where there is conscientious objection, to a lad carrying amis, we a re prepared to train him only in respect of ambulance work in the ambulance corps.&#34; Their reply to that was, &#34; We object to that just as strongly as we do to the use of arms.&#34; </para>

            <para>- Such an attitude is utterly irreconcilable with the Defence Act. The Act can be reconciled with the views of these people only by wiping it out altogether. Many of the placards which are being circulated all over the country, and also overseas, are being put out by people who take up the attitude I have just detailed. Most of the cases have been exaggerated. I am prepared to go as far as any one in securing the humane treatment of detainees, but whilst the Act is on the statute-book it will have my support. I see no reason for its repeal ; but nothing short of its repeal would satisfy those who are now organizing a campaign against universal service. </para>

            <para>- No. I have had some experience of the attitude which certain persons have taken up towards this Act, as mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> and of their desire to escape from their duties and obligations. Conscientious objections for refusing to drill are sometimes put forward, and these one has to accept; but I have discovered in certain instances that there has not been anything in the nature of a conscientious objection to the service. I have also discovered, when punishment has followed, that in its quality and character that punishment has been entirely misrepresented. It fell to my lot, on the very first day of the present session, to ask the Minister of Defence if steps would be taken throughout the Commonwealth to coordinate the action of the civil power - that is, the action of the magistrates - where persons were proceeded against for noncompliance with their public responsibilities under the Defence Act. Apart from that, I had been going into the matter with the object of securing the fullest information as to what was taking place in the Commonwealth. I discovered that it had been arranged, by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> I think, that sentences imposed upon youths for non-fulfilment of their obligations as trainees should not be served by them at ordinary gaols or prisons, and that &#39;&#39;detention &#34; rather than &#34; imprisonment &#34; was the proper word to describe their treatment. In Victoria, this detention, I understand, is carried out at Queenscliff. </para>

          <para>.- I do not think that solitary confinement should be meted out to lads for non-compliance with the requirements of the law as to drill. If it has been done, it is a wrong perpetrated by the officers who have sentenced him to this punishment. There is a lot to be said for the argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that there should be a special tribunal to deal with these cases. A number of questions have been asked about the interference with the electoral rolls which has resulted in <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> electors being deprived of the privilege of exercising the franchise. The Government have stated their intention of having a clean roll. I am sure that we are all in favour of a clean roll, but, unfortunately, the Government&#39;s idea and mine as to what constitutes such a roll are very different. Their idea of a clean roll is to leave out as many Labour voters as possible; mine is to give everybody an opportunity of recording a vote at the forthcoming election. It would be very wrong for me to say this if I were not prepared to prove it. I am prepared to prove that in one electorate in New South Wales a candidate at the last election had been a paid canvasser of the Liberal party for, I believe, two years, and is again the selected candidate. He has been in the electorate every day, and his sole duty has been to clean as many names of Labour voters off the roll as possible. He has succeeded to such an extent that it is possible for him to wipe out the deficiency of votes by which he was defeated at the last election. That is grossly unfairand unjust to the people of New South Wales. This is a farming electorate, which the Liberal party think should not be held by Labour, but it has been held by Labour for many years. In it there are a number of men whose duty it is to travel long distances in order to support their wives and families. During their absence, notices have been sent to them to show cause why they should not be struck off the roll. The latter has been unopened by their wives, or perhaps lefti in the boardinghouse, and they have returned from their employment to find themselves too late to appeal against being struck off the roll. I do not think any man with an idea of political honesty or fair dealing would lend himself to that sort of practice, but it has been done with the full knowledge and approval of the Liberal party of New South Wales. Any Government that will hurry on an election, and stand by an organization whose hands are soiled by those practices, deserves the severest censure of the people. The Minister, in giving replies to certain questions, I have no doubt gave them to the best of his ability. He said the police in New South Wales had no instruction but to put people on the rolls who were entitled to vote, and to put off those who were not entitled to vote. I know, as a fact, that the police who called at my house told me that they had instructions only to verify the rolls. They have gone to places that I could name in the city of Sydney, and to one in particular in the electorate of Wentworth, where an unfortunate widow, who is compelled to go out to work to keep her children, has been struck off the roll, although she has been living in the house for a great number of years. She received a notice, and understood it, and had her name placed on the roll as she should be, and yet she had been struck off. These tricks are detrimental to any country, and unworthy of any party. </para>

There is no doubt that the party behind the Government today have plenty of money to pay these organizers and canvassers to go round and do work of this description, which, in any other place, would be called dirty work. I do not say it is, but I say that the man who would accept payment from any association to do work of this description can never have clean hands. I am sorry to have to draw the attention of the Senate to this scandalous state of affairs, but I have enough faith in the honesty of the Government to believe that, even at this late hour,  they  will do something to retrieve their lost laurels so far as honest intentions in the administration of the Electoral Act are concerned. </para>

          <para>.- I recognise that we have to secure finality in regard to the training of boys and dealing with those who will not train, but I have never been over enthusiastic in regard to military affairs. My experience has been that what ought to be a good and effective system of compulsory training is being made unpopular, not altogether by what is done so much as by some of the terms that are used. For instance, we have had a discussion to-day about solitary confinement. I believe that the bulk of the public and most modern reformers are absolutely against this form of punishment, but the discussion to-day is only another illustration of the fact that we use here expressions which have absolutely no application to the facts. Generally speaking, the boys in Victoria who fail to do their drill have -the opportunity of going to Queenscliff, and it is quite a joke amongst a considerable number of them to talk about their annual seaside trip at the expense of the Government. They rather enjoy it. To show that the administration of the Act generally is too harsh, I will give an instance that came under my own notice. I have a young brother, who grew about a foot last year into a fine type of young Australian. He was provided with a uniform, and continually applied for a new one, but could not get it. The sleeves of the old uniform gradually worked up to his elbows and the trousers to about his knees, and naturally he could not stand what is called the &#34;  chyacking  &#34; of his pals in the regiment. The next thing that happened was that he. went on strike. He became a rebel, and turned up at drill without any uniform at all. Consequently he was faced with the  alterantive  of putting in two days&#39; drill at the High School near this building, in lieu of his one day&#39;s drill, or going to Queenscliff. He did his two days, not wanting to be fined, although he was undoubtedly innocent. He simply objected to walking about the streets with his pants up to his knees and his coat sleeves up to his elbows. </para>

            <para>- He was made to do two days&#39; drill, and did it in uniform. My idea is that the area officers are not competent to administer the law, or are administering it too harshly, or not using sufficient tact in dealing with the boys. I know that an area officer is not made in a day. I do trust that a general instruction will be given to the Area Officers to use as much tact as possible, and not to strain the law merely to make the boys do certain things. I hope that no system of confinement will be resorted to. We are lacking in intelligence if we cannot devise a reasonable system of punishment. Any confinement to a youth is bad, both mentally and physically. I object to such treatment, and will not give it the slightest support. In the first place, a boy has to put in twenty-one days&#39; drill. He probably earns from &#163;1 to 25s. a week. That makes the equivalent of a minimum fine of &#163;3. I think that the difficulty can be got over. For instance, if a boy will not do the training outside, let him be detained for double the length of time inside. </para>

            <para>- Let him be detained for twice the time. I admit that a monetary fine would be of no use, because the parent of the wealthy boy would simply pay the fine. Take the case of a poor working boy, who says that he has conscientious scruples. If he will not drill, he will not, and that is an end of the matter, as far as he is concerned; but if he were detained inside for double the time, the fine would be equivalent to &#163;5 or &#163;6 in wages. He would lose the time, and the system would not enable the rich boy to get out of his obligation. </para>

If revenge is the object of the Minister, give the boy full solitary confinement. </para>

            <para>- The Minister spoke about a twopenny-halfpenny penalty to the State, and said that the State would have to buy for the boy a few loaves of bread. In my opinion, the State would gladly buy the bread. We recognise, of course, that there must be some restraints put on a boy. I desire to ask the Minister a question on another subject as nicely as I can. For a long time Australians have been penalized in regard to certain schools of instruction which they had to go through prior to getting promotion. I understand that a little time ago the Minister informed the Senate that he intended, and very correctly, in my opinion, to abolish these instructional schools, for the purpose of putting the Australians competent to fill the positions on exactly the same footing as the men who have come from the Imperial Forces. The result has been that a number of ambitious Australians, who are duly qualified, have made application rather early, and have been informed that they are not eligible. I understand, too, that in connexion with the impending change there is a possibility that these men will not be eligible for a number of months. Seeing that under the Act the Australians are disqualified, and that it is to meet a temporary difficulty, will the Minister, for the present, refrain, as far as ^possible, from making these appointments, so that eligible Australians will not be merely paying a penalty because they are Australians? I understand that the amending Defence Rill is to be dropped, and I hope that some action may be taken to find a practical way out of the difficulty. </para>

          <para>. - While the main discussion on this motion has centred round a boy who, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> has been harshly and outrageously treated at Queenscliff by the military authorities, and whilst the case is important and interesting to all of us,  a matter of more serious moment, I think, is to ascertain, if possible, what tho intentions of the Government are in respect to tho printing and publishing of the rolls on which the next elections are to be conducted, and their attitude in regard to the statement in a newspaper to-day that they intend to amend a regulation to prohibit persons from voting as absent voters in the way they did at the last general election. After that event, the Vice-President of the Executive Council made, at Fitzroy, outrageous statements which he afterwards withdrew. </para>

He said, &#34; To prove the statement that I made at Fitzroy, I have three cases of dead men being voted on at the last election.&#34; When he was asked to give the names and addresses of the three allegedly dead men he refused then, as he does now, but he fastens the statement on to the Labour party that, although he alleges, and is prepared to prove that the names of three dead men were voted on, these votes were given to and used by the Labour party in order to bring about a victory. Of all the men in the Cabinet I should say that he was the last Minister who should have been picked by the Government to take charge of the Electoral Department. I am satisfied that he is such a violent partisan, and hates and detests Labour to such an extent that he would not stop at anything in order to bring victory to his side. </para>

            <para>- The Act provides that a man who removes from one part of an electorate to another must, after a month has expired, make application for a transfer; but the organizations to which I have referred do not wait for that. There are many men who follow migratory occupations, and are away from their homes for three or four weeks, and sometimes for months. It was never intended that the Act should apply to them, and that they should be called upon to make application&#34; for transfers in every electorate to which they go for employment. What I am concerned about is that the coming elections will not be contested on the old rolls. There are new rolls in course of preparation. Many of them are in the hands of the Government Printers of the different States. I want an assurance from the Government that, when the new rolls are printed, they will be open for inspection for at least three or four weeks, in order that the thousands of people whose names have been removed from the old rolls will have an opportunity of seeing whether they are to be disfranchised or not. </para>

If it is found that they are disfranchised on the day of election, those responsible for it will go down politically; but it will be too late to deal with them at the coming contest. The Government should be as anxious as are the Opposition that every citizen of Australia over the age of twenty-one years, and outside the walls of a gaol or lunatic asylum, shall have an opportunity to record a vote at the coming elections. That should be the desire of every fair-minded man on either side in this chamber. </para>

            <para>- It is dishonest, according to the Electoral Act, for can didates to spend more than a certain amount upon their candidature, and it is as certain as that night follows day that more than the amount fixed by the Act was spent in Ballarat at tlie last election. It is impossible to get an army of men and women to work for the so-called Liberals unless they are paid, and well paid, and it is equally impossible to have a hundred and one motor-cars running here, there, and everywhere without making some recompense to the people who supply those cars. I am not concerned with that for the moment, but with the state of the rolls. I wish to get from the Government a definite statement that the citizens of Australia will be given the fullest opportunity to record their votes. I want to get from them a promise that when the rolls are printed every citizen shall have an opportunity to see whether his name is on the newly-printed rolls, and if it is not, shall be given an opportunity to become enfranchised. When the attention of the Leader of the Government was called to a proposal to amend a certain regulation to prohibit absent voting he said that the Government had the matter under consideration, and he would later inform honorable members in another place of the intentions of the Government in respect to that regulation. I am not so much concerned as to how honorable members in another place will be informed, but I wish <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> as Leader of the Government in this Chamber, to make a definite statement that the Government will submit the amended regulation to Parliament. </para>

            <para>- It is the duty of every member of either House to be prepared to go before the electors whenever the emergency arises. We know perfectly well that Parliament is absolutely unworkable. I quite agree with the statement that every elector should be afforded an opportunity of recording his vote, and every adult should have a chance of seeing that his or her name is upon the roll. But as the law renders it incumbent upon every man and woman in the community to become enrolled, it is obviously his or her duty to look after his or her interests in that respect. If an objection be lodged to any person&#39;s name appearing on the roll, a notice is forwarded to him. </para>

When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> attacks the Vice-President of the Executive Council he exhibits a gross desire to injure him politically, or else - but I do not like to put the alternative. When honorable senators opposite do not respect their opponents, they do not respect themselves. When an honorable senator charges the Minister with corruption it is his duty to prove the truth of his charge. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley&#39;s</inline> statement in regard to the Vice-President of the Executive Council be true, every Commonwealth officer holding an important position must have allowed himself to be corrupted. </para>

            <para>- Exactly. The whole of my honorable friends opposite will repudiate any charge against the electoral officers, and yet they will make accusations against the Minister. In regard to taking names off the roll, we know perfectly well that it is the duty of the electoral officers to see thatthere are pure rolls - that is, rolls which are not unduly inflated. A roll is not clean unless it contains the name of every individual who is entitled to vote. It is not clean if it contains the names of persons who are not entitled to vote. Of course, duplications will always occur, and mistakes will always be made in regard to striking off names. But the Electoral Act provides that when an elector changes his residence it is his duty within a month of so doing to obtain a transfer. Of course, if a man follows a migratory occupation, and thus has occasion to leave his wife and family for several weeks, or even months, there is no necessity for him to obtain a transfer. In such circumstances, he should vote in the electorate in which his home is located. I should like to say one or two words in regard to the detention of cadets. I am very glad to know that the picture <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> drew of the horrors of solitary detention docs not apply in any respect whatever to these cadets. And while it is all very well to make attacks and complaints, there is a difficulty, as has been pointed out by the present Minister of Defence and the exMinister of Defence, in making people observe the law if they are disinclined to do so. There must be some sort of punishment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> spoke as if an enormity had been perpetrated in the case of these cadets. But the honorable senator did not state how we are to enforce the law. It is easy to find fault, but when we pass a law we must take steps to see that it is observed. </para>

            <para>- If the punishment were mere isolation, would the honorable senator say that that was torture? If we were to say that we would not allow one lad to mix with other lads for seven days, would that be torture ? It will be seen from all that has been said in this discussion that these boys are simply detached from others; they are kept in a well-lit cell; are given meat five times a week, and they are given very liberal rations in all other respects. That is the only thing that is done to these boys in order to punish them for not observing the law. It may be that a boy thinks that his military service is a mere bagatelle, and does not care anything about it. It has been said that before separate treatment is ordered a boy should be again brought before a magistrate. I do ask honorable senators to realize that there must be some authority to deal with these matters rapidly and expeditiously. It might be possible to have a magistrate brought in to hear the case against the boy, but even that would not suit honorable senators, because they want all such cases to be heard in open Court. It is better for the boys themselves when they disobey instructions, and refuse to fulfil their duties, that there should be some person responsible for meting out such punishment as will be commensurate with the offence, and will tend to correct it as far as possible.I suppose the Commandant determines these matters, and he would surely take care that he was not acting unfairly towards the boys. In any case, there is always the right of appeal to the Minister in the event of anything unfair taking place, and, until an abuse has been shown to have been committed, why should not that right of appeal be sufficient? I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> made a mountain out ofa molehill. He allowed his mind to dwell too much on what solitary con finement means in an ordinary criminal gaol, and he was under the further disadvantage of speaking of conditions which obtained many years ago. Since then many reforms have been effected in all our gaols. Whilst I approve of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae&#39;s</inline> endeavour to make the punishment less severe, and certainly to prevent it being harmful to a boy&#39;s body or mind, I deprecate these matters being brought up in this way when they could be dealt with either by correspondence or by personal interview. Then, if the Minister would not do anything, the honorable gentleman would be doing right in bringing them forward in this Chamber. If that course is not followed, I do say that it would be more conducive to the dignity of the Senate to allow these complaints to be dealt with outside. </para>

            <para>- I am not to be drawn from my statement by a red herring of that description. My charge is, that a member of the Government gave this broadcast invitation some months ago to organizations to object to names on the rolls, and said that the organizations would not be asked to deposit the 5s. which, the Act provides, may be forfeited if an objection is found to be frivolous. It is an outrageous thing that any member of a Government should make a state- ment which practically means that he is willing to allow the law to be broken. For what reason?

            <para>- And it was made a dead letter practically at the invitation of the Attorney-General. It was nothing short of a scandal that the AttorneyGeneral, tlie responsible legal adviser of the Government, should have issued such an invitation to outside organizations, and that he should have told them that they would not be asked to make the deposit. Why did not the Attorney-General and the Government have the courage to proceed with the Bill which they first introduced into another place ? And why have they not the courage to make a definite proposal in a Bill to do away with this deposit, and see if they can get that measure through both Houses of Parliament? Because they know they could not do it. I blame, not the Vice-President of the Executive Council, but the AttorneyGeneral, who is supposed to be the actual, although not the nominal, head of the Government. I desire to call attention to a reply I had from the Minister of Defence this afternoon. I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> if it was intended to give the Senate an opportunity of voting on the regulation, which, it is said, is to be made in connexion with absentee voting at the coming election. I was not satisfied with the answer I received, nor do I think any honorable senator was satisfied. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> said that the Senate would be informed of what it was intended to do; but this Chamber and the country have a right to know, and will know, something about the regulation which the Government intend to frame, in order to practically kill absentee voting.

          <para>I fear that there will always be difficulties under the existing absent voting system, but I think that the right to vote at any polling place, subject to regulations, is of the greatest possible advantage to the community, and that it ought not to bo withdrawn. I think a method can bc devised which would be more satisfactory to the Department, whilst at the same time giving the electors greater security than does the present one. I refer to the system of requiring the elector who desires to vote as an absent voter to make application for his form of declaration and ballot-paper after the issue of the writ and prior to the day of polling. </para>

        <para class="block">If that system comes into effect we might as well sweep away the absentee vote for all the use it will be in regard to allowing electors who are travelling to exercise their franchise. The very spirit of the absentee vote is that the man who is travelling, who has to leave his place of residence suddenly, and finds himself on the clay of election in another part of the country, may be able to record his vote. He may have to leave his district only a day prior to the election. If we are going to change the existing system and bring in one providing that a man who is travelling must carry with him a certificate issued by the Returning Officer, it will take away from more than half the absent electors the right to exercise the franchise on the day of election. How many thousands are there in Australia every day of the year who are travelling, wl to, perhaps, are suddenly called upon to leave their districts, and have not the opportunity to go to Returning Officers and get absent voting certificates? Wc should have the absentee vote in a form which will be. of some use to absent voters or not have it at all; and if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oldham&#39;s</inline> evidence is to be accepted as an indication of &#39;the intention of the Ministry in this regard the Senate should demand that the new regulation be laid on the table, so that honorable senators may discuss it, and see what effect it will actually have. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oldham&#39;s</inline> evidence continues - </para>

          <para>He could bc required to make his application in writing, and to have his signature duly attested. The Divisional Returning Officer would then, subject to regulations, issue the ballot-paper and declaration, and file the application for future reference. The elector could walk into any booth outside his own subdivision, exhibit his ballot-papers in blank, make <inline font-style="italic">his</inline> declaration, and vote as an absent voter in the ordinary way. </para>

        <para class="block">We must not lose sight of the central fact that the elector will need to have his voting paper with him. The absent voting provisions were not put in the Electoral Act with that idea. The idea was that electors who on election day find themselves away from the subdivisions for which they were enrolled should be able to record their votes. What is there wrong in that system? Despite all the talk about corruption and irregularities at the last election, nothing has been proved, practically speaking. </para>

            <para>- We have not heard or read of a large number of prosecutions against persons for having used the absent voting provision corruptly. What is wrong about an elector away from his subdivision who wishes to vote being able to walk into the nearest polling booth on election day, and record his rote ? Tlie idea at the back of the provision when it was adopted was that if circumstances suddenly arose which took an elector away from his subdivision, he was to have every facility to record his vote; but if we can accept the statement in the newspapers, the Government intend to alter this provision. If the alteration is on the lines laid down in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oldham&#39;s</inline> evidence, the Government are seeking to take away from the absent voters a facility which they had at the last election, and a facility which they should have, and without which the absent voting provision is practically null and void. </para>

            <para>- lt is obvious that the names are supplied to the Department by interested persons. The actual operation of striking the names off the roll is, of course, performed by an officer of the Department, and without any desire or thought of doing anything unfair or unjust. These objections are lodged too skilfully to give an officer the opportunity to judge as to their fairness or otherwise. </para>

            <para>- The officer does it. A notice of objection may be sent to the address of a man who is 150 miles away from that address, and has not the chance to attend to answer; and I do not see how an officer of the Department can be accused of doing anything wrong, in removing the name or names, seeing that he is bound to remove the names when, according to his judgment, the Act has been complied with. The Minister ought to accept the responsibility; and I ask by whose authority this section of the Act has been violated - by what right have objections been lodged without the 5s. fee ? I hold the view, which I give for what it is worth, that every such objection is absolutely invalid, and that the person  objected  to is entitled to vote. Notwithstanding the special pleading of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> the Vice-President of the Executive Council cannot shield himself under a charge, levelled against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley,</inline> of making a &#34; vicious personal attack.&#34; The Vice-President of the Executive Council has accepted the responsibility, serious and grave as it may be, of administering the Act, and he ought to take full responsibility for that administration instead of trying to place the responsibility on the officials of the Department. </para>

          <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> this afternoon brought up the pathetic case of a brother of his who grew about 12 inches in the course of a year. This was an excellent performance, and the honorable senator must not be surprised if it has outstripped the regulations. I know of no regulation so elastic as to keep pace with a youth who grows an inch per month. Even here <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> did not quite state the whole case. There has been in the Department a very laudable practice of serving out uniforms to cadets only at certain intervals, and I suppose it never entered the heads of those who framed the regulations to have a special one for abnormal cases. I suppose young Russell grew faster than the time allowed to him to be entitled to a new uniform. Until quite lately new uniforms were issued once in two years, but it was found in quite a number of cases that even this was an unnecessary issue, as the boys used them so little that, except where they grew out of them, the uniforms were still quite good. The whole of the difficulty in this case has arisen because the conditions were entirely abnormal. I am rather surprised that Cadet Russell, having a brother a senator, did not think of the simple expedient of a note to head-quarters to draw attention to the extraordinary position in which he was placed. If that had been done I have no doubt the difficulty would have been remedied. </para>

            <para>- That is not so. There is scarcely a member of this Chamber who has not brought matters before me in my capacity as Minister, and I am sure that no exception has been taken by myself or any of my predecessors. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> also drew attention to one portion of the Defence Act, repre senting a disability on Australian officers seeking to join the Instructional Staff. Non-commissioned officers are required under the Act as it now stands to go through a course of education at a school of instruction before they can be appointed to the Instructional Staff, while a British officer, upon satisfying the Chief of the General Staff of his qualifications, can be appointed without going through the school of instruction. That is the law which many honorable senators helped to pass in 1910, and no fault can be found with me if the disability is there. I am not responsible for it, but it frequently ties my hands, to my disappointment, in making these appointments. </para>

The Senate, in the exercise of its undoubted right, attached to the Address-in-Reply a vote of censure on the Government, of which I am a member. I took no exception to its action in that regard. </para>

            <para>- I did not think that I was bound, as Leader of the Senate, to assist to pass a vote of censure on myself, who was so little entitled to censure. With regard to the case of Cadet Roberts, I take no exception to the frequent expressions of sympathy we have heard today; but it is a little marvellous to me; that these sympathetic gentlemen had no sympathy during the last three years for any other cadet similarly placed. It is only now when, apparently, their friends are not in office, and when, perhaps, the shadow of a pending event is beginningto? stimulate their sympathy, that they come forward and occupy the time of the Senate to show how brutal they think the treatment meted out to Cadet Roberts. </para>

I take no exception to these matters being brought up, but I point out that I have not introduced any new system, and therefore am not entitled to condemnation. All I have done has been to carry out the same system as I found in vogue when I took office, with the exception that I have made the rations a little more liberal to the boys who are awarded this punishment. </para>

            <para>- If two or three officers met together, and adjudicated in the case, I should regard that as fulfilling the honorable senator&#39;s statement with regard to a court martial. I will place the result of my inquiries before the House. If an irregularity has been committed I am anxious to prevent its repetition. If any unnecessary hardship has been inflicted I shall do my best to see that it is not repeated, so as to prevent any possible complaint either in this chamber or outside. Let me now turn to many of the statements about the Electoral Office. We have heard some very wild statements here - so wild that I really must express surprise that they were uttered in this chamber, familiar as it is with statements which are not always moderate. </para>

            <para>- I know that, but I think that there is an obligation upon honorable senators professing only a common desire to see that we have a reasonably efficient electoral system to give proof, which will enable us either to rebut the charges, or if a wrong has been done to sheet it home to the responsible individual. </para>

            <para>- I do not want to be drawn off the track. Here is one definite statement which a responsible senator makes, and it is that instructions had been given to wipe out as many Labour voters as possible. When a member of the Senate makes a serious statement of that kind, and one so clear in its terms, it is fair to ask him, for his own reputation, and in order that we maymeet the charge, if true, to give us the particulars, to say by whom the instructionswere issued, and who received them. </para>

            <para>- No. The honorable senator made that statement, and went on to say what a policeman had told him in his house that his business  there  was not to put names on the roll but to verify the list. That does not in any way support the statement that instructions had been  given  to wipe off Labour voters. </para>

The statement is applauded here, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> does not deny that he is trying to create the impression that something corrupt and wrong is going on. I have a perfect right to ask honorable senators who make these statements to bring forward the proof in order, if they have the proof, that we may be convicted, or, on the other hand, to give us the opportunity to which we are entitled of inquiring into these things and seeing what is going on.

            <para>- Exactly, and it was not my fault that I was drawn away. The electoral officer has thrown upon him the responsibility of satisfying himself as to whether a man&#39;s name ought to be taken off the roll or not, and the mere complaint by me to an electoral officer that I think that a name ought to be off the roll is not sufficient, nor does it exonerate the officer from satisfying himself on that point. </para>

I am not now concerned as to whether officers are discharging their duty efficiently or otherwise - personally, I believe that in the main they are doing their duty - but I want to say that, as the responsibility is theirs, these wild accusations that names are taken off the roll merely because some organization has lodged a protest are absolutely groundless. </para>

So far as the Registrar was concerned, I was an ordinary elector; since I had given no notification that I desired to be enrolled for that particular division, and having left the place for a couple of months, it had become my duty under the Act to become enrolled for another division. I did not paste up a placard to say that I would in due time come back to the place at which I had been living, and in the circumstances I could take no particular exception to the removal of my name from the roll. </para>

            <para>- I cannot help thinking that human nature is spread as thickly to the square inch in one State as in another, and it has been impossible to avoid the conclusion that honorable senators have introduced into the discussion of this matter a personal and political element. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> has made persistent attacks upon my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl,</inline> and I venture to express the opinion that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> were the representative of some State other than Victoria, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> would not have tinged his remarks with the bitterness which, in the existing circumstances, he has thrown into them. </para>

            <para>- I have no objection to the honorable senator&#39;s criticism. I am merely referring to the persistency with which the honorable senator during the whole of this session has attacked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl,</inline> and to the fact that his attacks have displayed something more than warmth and bitterness, and have approached viciousness. I feel that the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> has been an opponent of the honorable senator in the past, and will probably again be a competitor of his at the next electoral contest, has influenced him in what he has had to say about that honorable senator. I say, without hesitation or equivocation, that the one desire of the present Government In this connexion is that when the next appeal is made to the people, it shall be made in such a way as to insure the fullest possible expression of public opinion. We have no desire to curtail the electoral rights of any person. We are anxious that all who are entitled to vote shall be afforded facilities for doing so, but we are also anxious that names which ought not to be there shall not appear on the electoral rolls. </para>

A great deal of the duplication arises in the first place through the great ease with which any person can secure enrolment, and in the next place from the fact that a large number of people have not a clear recollection as to what they have done in the matter of the enrolment of their names. </para>

            <para>- The removal of electors from one division to another would not add to the difficulty if in all cases they recollected what they had done. It is quite a common thing when one asks a man whether his name is on the roll to receive the answer, &#34;I think so; I do not know.&#34; The electors are sometimes confused between the State and Federal rolls. </para>

            <para>- I can only say what I . should do if I were in the position of a Registrar. The steps which an officer will regard as necessary to satisfy himself of the validity of an objection will differ in different cases. If I were an Electoral Registrar and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> lodged with me an objection against the name of a man I knew, and who had lived next door to me, I should not bother to make other inquiry. I should know personally whether the man had left the division. But if a protest is lodged against the name of a man of whom the Electoral Registrar knows nothing, we can assume that to satisfy himself he may make inquiries of the local postmaster or police. We have a right to assume that the Electoral Registrar will be anxious to do his duty, and will obtain supplementary evidence to support the objection to the appearance of a name on the roll. </para>

            <para>- I cannot say whether that is so. The Act throws that responsibility upon them, and I can only give honorable senators the assurance that no instructions have been given to them to act in any other way. I not only give that assurance, but I say that if any honorable senator in this Chamber brings evidence to the contrary, I shall see that it is sifted, and that we shall know what the facts are. </para>

            <para>- There cannot be uniformityof practice, though there should be uniformity of principle. We cannot lay down hard and fast rules as to the way ill which Electoral Registrars shall satisfy themselves as to the validity of objections. The Electoral Registrar must accept the responsibility as to whether the inquiries he makes to satisfy himself are sufficient Or not. It may be that some are negligent, or are easily persuaded, but the Act throws a certain responsibility upon them, and we are entitled to assume,until evidence to the contrary is submitted, that these officers are fairly carrying out the duties imposed upon them. </para>

            <para>- Then the honorable senator must compose his differences with my honorable friends opposite who say that the officers are not involved in this matter. It does not signify who lodges the objection. The responsibility of taking any name off the roll rests with an electoral officer. If corrupt practices are being followed, I ask my honorable friends for specific instances. If it can be proved that the Government have instructed their officers to do a wrong thing, then the Governmentshould meet with the punishment which they merit, but if it cannot, it is up to honorable senators&#39; opposite to give  us  the necessary information to enable us to examine any particular cases thoroughly. </para>
