                    <para>I have made inquiries, and have ascertained that tenders were not invited in the public press. It is not usual to advertise  for  tenders for piece-work in connexion with small railway earthworks. The practice in most railway undertakings is for any one wanting small piece-work to go to the Engineer-in-Charge and ask for work, and agree upon a price at which the cutting, or whatever the work is, shall be done. Of the six tenders for clearing which were received, that of Wm. Morris was the lowest. </para>

Whatever opinions we may have on the question of preference to unionists, no one &#171;an claim that a Bill dealing with either the establishment or the abolition of the principle will affect the question of favoritism one way or the other. You &#171;an pass fifty Bills to abolish and prevent preference to unionists, but no such Bill will prevent favoritism, and I know of no Government more likely to use favoritism than a Government constituted such as the present one is. I think it&#39; was very bad taste, and extremely inadvisable, apart from the party issue, for such words as these to be placed in the mouth of  His  Majesty&#39;s representative in opening this Parliament. Again, an attempt is made to create the impression that a large number of measures on many subjects have been held up by the Senate. The Government apparently did not read the Speech a second time, otherwise they would have seen that in paragraph 4 they contradict themselves, because they say - </para>

                                <para>- The Government themselves recognise that, because in paragraph 4 they are forced into the statement that it was only these two Bills that failed to pass. These paragraphs bring us face to face with an issue far more important than the two test Bills, and that is that, under cover of those measures, an attempt is being made to alter the constitutional position of the Senate in the Federal Parliament. It is to that issue that I propose to address my remarks, because I consider that it transcends in importance any particular measure that may have been before us at the time. The Senate was constituted as it is, after long fighting, prolonged discussions, many compromises, and many concessions on the part of the various shades of political thought throughout the Commonwealth, and it stands there in the </para>

                        <para class="block">Constitution in a position that has no equal in any Legislature throughout the world. The Senate occupies a peculiar position, and a strong position too, and ve to-day see an attempt being made, not by a direct attack, but by a side issue, to destroy its status in the Constitution. It is well, I think, that we should look at the means that are to be adopted to achieve this object. We should examine the constitutional position of the Senate. We should make it clear that we recognise that position, and are prepared to defend it, and that if it is to be altered, that must be done in the way laid down in the Constitution; that is, under section 128, which provides a straightforward method of dealing with both the power and the constitution of the Senate if the people of Australia so desire. The Government say that when they have passed the two test Bills through the House of Representatives by the casting vote of the  Speaker,  and that when the two Bills have been rejected by the Senate, or have failed to pass the Senate, or the Senate has made amendments which the other House refuses to accept, they will have complied with the provisions of section 57 of the Constitution, and Will therefore be entitled to a double dissolution. It is that claim which I propose to examine. I must crave the pardon of the Senate in advance for being obliged to make a large number of quotations from various parliamentary and constitutional authorities in order to establish my contention that the Government have no right to ask for a double dissolution, and that when the so-called test measures meet the fate which they so richly deserve, the Ministry will not have complied with the provisions of the Constitution. The first quotation is from a gentleman who took a very prominent part in most of the sessions of the Federal Convention, who has made a study of Federal Constitutions, who is a recognised authority on our own Constitution, who has the advantage of being associated with neither political party today, and who has recently set down his views in a very valuable volume entitled <inline font-style="italic">The Making of the Constitution</inline> I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. B.</inline> R.

                                <para>- I will make it quite clear myself. It will be noted that section 57 follows immediately upon those very important sections of the Constitution which deal with the financial powers of the Commonwealth. The framers of our Constitution dealt first with the control of the purse, and endeavoured to fit in the Federal system of government with responsible government. They endeavoured to ingraft on the United States of America&#39;s Federal system of government the British system of responsible government. In attempting to do that, they found that they were up against one of the most difficult propositions which they could tackle. They recognised that if they made the House of Representatives all-powerful in matters of finance - that being the House to which the Government would be responsible - they might be faced with the opposition of the smaller States, which would refuse to subordinate their position in the Federal Parliament because the two big States would have such an overwhelming majority in representation. Thus it came about that, whilst safeguarding responsible government, the delegates to the Federal Convention had to make the Senate so nearly equal in power to the other House as to assure the smaller States that their position would be secure if they entered the Federation. If that problem had not been solved, Federation would never have been an accomplished fact. If honorable senators will carefully read the Convention debates, if they will note the fight which took place over the finance sections of the Constitution, they will recognise that it was the endeavour of that body to give the Senate almost co-equal power with the other House in financial matters. They will see that this Chamber was to exercise the power of suggestion in the case of Money Bills - it has since been established by precedent that that power of suggestion is equal to the power of amendment - and if they recognise that finance is government, and that the Government are responsible to the House of Representatives, they will realize that the framers of our Constitution, in effect, said, &#34; Having made the Senate so powerful, and having established the system of responsible government, it may happen that if a majority in the Senate are hostile to the Government, that Chamber may use its power to bring the government of the Commonwealth to a stand-still. To obviate this, section 57 was inserted in the Constitution. It is evident, therefore, that what the framers of the Constitution had in their minds was the possibility of a dead-lock in respect to finance bringing responsible government to an end. If one entertained any doubts on this subject, they would be dispelled by the first words of section 57 of the Constitution, which reads - </para>

                        <para class="block">Why is the House of Representatives specially mentioned there? The Government introduce Bills in the Senate just as they do in the House of Representatives. Why, then, is the other Chamber specially picked out in this section ? Because it is there that Money Bills must originate. The very opening words of section 57 indicate that what the framers of the Constitution had in their minds was that a dead-lock might arise in respect of financial Bills. </para>

                                <para>- No. One of the biggest Bills ever submitted to this Parliament was originated in this Chamber - I refer to the Navigation Bill. To my mind, section 57 of our Constitution is supplementary to sections 53 to 56. In sections 53 to 57 the Convention delegates dealt with a set of circumstances of which they had had experience in State Parliaments, and what that experience taught them was likely to arise in this Parliament. Every one of these gentlemen had had experience of State Upper Houses which, when hostile to a Government, always embraced the opportunity of hitting at that Government through their financial measures. In the history of Australian State Parliaments, not a single case can be cited of a dead-lock having arisen on any question other than that of finance. Recognising that, can we doubt what was intended by the framers of our Constitution when they inserted section 57 ? </para>

At the same time, he was one of the sturdiest Democrats Australia has produced; and throughout the Convention, wherever he could do so consistently with his advocacy of the rights of the smaller States, he championed the cause of the people. I refer to the late Right Honorable C. C. Kingston. </para>

                                <para>- The Senate established a very valuable precedent in regard to that Bill. I would suggest to those honorable senators who entered this Parliament at a later period, that it would be well for them to study the negotiations which took place between the two branches of the Legislature in respect of the first Commonwealth Tariff. On that occasion the Senate established the precedent that it had a right to return the Bill with suggestions at any stage. That contention was severely combated in another place. At length, however, this Chamber sent back what might be termed its ultimatum to the House of Representatives, and the Government were then faced with the position that they had to take the responsibility of dropping the Tariff and of&#39; calling another session, and taking advantage of the provisions of section 57 of the Constitution to make an appeal to the country. That was suggested in the debate which took place elsewhere. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> - as will be seen by reference to <inline font-style="italic">Barnard</inline> for 1902, page 15,682 - on that occasion said - </para>

                        <para class="block">The point I wish to make is that if the Government succeed in obtaining a double dissolution in the present circumstances they will have reduced the Senate not merely to the position occupied by the Upper Houses of the States, but to a lower position, and they will have done so without any appeal being made to the people, because the appeal will be made only after the precedent has been established. If this House and the other go to the country in such circumstances the Senate will have been reduced to the position, and will have the powers, if a municipal chamber. </para>

                                <para>- It would do nothing of the kind, because whatever the decision of the people may have been this position would have been established: That if ever this House dared to disagree with another place in two consecutive sessions on any Bill, no matter how small or trumpery, it would do so knowing that the Government of the day could claim a double dissolution and send it back to the country. No Upper House in Australia, or in the world, is in that position&#39; to-day. An Upper House in that position would be merely a recording chamber - a body which had merely to put the imprimatur of another place on legislation without any power to cross a <inline font-style="italic">&#34; t&#34;</inline> or dot an &#34; i.&#34; It would never dare afterwards to take any part in the legislation of the country. Let us now ascertain the view the Government themselves take of these measures, and the view they take of what it is necessary to do in order to establish their claim to a double dissolution. I have pointed out, and have read quotations here, to show that the framers of the Constitution thought that this was a section that could be invoked only on great issues, and that even when dealing with the Upper Houses of the States it would never be contemplated to do such things as this on small and trumpery issues. I am going to take first the Prime Minister, who has the right of precedence by virtue of his office, if not by virtue of the influence which apparently he wields in the Cabinet of which he is the head.

What is the serious trouble which the constitutional machinery is there to solve ? It is a measure upon which the two Houses are disagreed. That is the serious trouble that the Constitution contemplated. The Constitution never contemplated a party election platform; it contemplated a Bill in dispute between the two Houses; it knows no parties, and this section was never put in either to assist or disadvantage parties. Section 57 was framed for the purpose of dealing with a deadlock between the two Houses over a measure or measures. That is the serious trouble that the Constitution recognises. Let us see what is the serious trouble that the Prime Minister recognises. Are these Bills the serious trouble ? Let us hear the Prime Minister on the point.

Who, in the name of Heaven, ever suggested that we should go on that alone? The notion is preposterous, and how it should have got into the brains of the people I cannot understand. I think it would be absolute folly for us to go to the country on such questions as these.....

Can we believe that a set of lunatics drafted the Constitution, or that they were not in possession of their senses when they put in section 57 ? Can we believe that they were contemplating a set of conditions of which the two Houses would be ignorant, or that the issue upon which the two Houses were to be dissolved was &#39;one they had never heard of and knew nothing about, but that was in the brains and locked up in the cabinets of the respective parties working under the , Constitution? Can we believe that? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> apparently believes it, but will he get the Governor-General to believe it? I have my doubts on that point. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> there is no dispute except over a simple unimportant measure.

The reply to that assertion was contained in his unanswered challenge to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> and which he now repeated. Was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> prepared to pledge his party and himself that if returned to power again they would not resort to this practice ? If so, he, for one, would be prepared to withdraw this Bill. (Cheers.) The framing of the Bill would prevent a Labour Government giving preference in future behind the back of Parliament. The Bill was chosen as a test measure because it represented a clean cut difference between the two parties. </para>

I do not know whether he will disown the speech delivered by him at Echuca, as reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of 13th May. It is very interesting as showing that what was running in the minds of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Irvine</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> has got into the mind of the Vice-President of the Executive Council. He has thrown in his lot with them, and goes about the country practically saying the same thing. This is what he is reported to have said - </para>

The point in regard to this is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> admits that the Government have not brought their policy forward. He admits that it is not their policy that is in dispute between the two Houses. That has not yet been brought forward, and yet the Government propose to go to the Governor-General and say, &#34; There has been a great dispute between the two Houses.&#34; When they are asked about that dispute, and whether it has arisen in connexion with their policy,&#39; they have to answer, &#34;No; we did not let the Houses know our policy. We did not know what it was. The dispute is over two measures which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> says it is absolute nonsense to think involved great issues.&#34; When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> gets upon the platform, he becomes very much excited. He gets into a wild and whirling state, and apparently does not know exactly what he is saying. When he reads what he said in cold print afterwards, he says, &#34; Good gracious, did I say that? What could I have been thinking of?&#34; But when the honorable senator is asked a question in this chamber, of which due notice has been given, and submits an answer in calm blood, we are surely entitled to assume that he speaks after consideration, and will not seek to withdraw a statement trade under those conditions.

The Governor-General is there told by the Government. &#34; We have a policy to deal with this very in*,portant question of the reduction of the cost of living, but nobody yet knows what it is. Nobody has seen it, and it certainly has not been submitted to Parliament.&#34; They further say to the Governor-General, &#34; If you grant a double dissolution, and bring both Houses of the Parliament before the people, we shall have a great fight, not over the measures upon which we ask you to dissolve Parliament, but over some measures which you have <inline font-style="italic">not</inline> seen, and which Parliament has not seen.&#34; Could the most vivid imagination consider that a compliance with section 57 of the Constitution ? That section provides for a deadlock over some particular measure, and it is upon the measure which has given rise to the deadlock that Parliament is to be sent to the country. The present Government say, &#34; We have not the slightest intention to send Parliament to the country on these measures, which we regard as trumpery, but upon something about which we have not yet made up our minds.&#34;  </para>

                        <para class="block">It is argued that the word &#34; may,&#34; as here used, means &#34; shall.&#34; It is argued that the Governor-General has not to take into consideration the measures which have given rise to a deadlock, and that if it is established that there is a deadlock, he shall dissolve the two Houses. It is said that in legislation we do not insert words which bind the Crown, and that the word &#34; may,&#34; when it applies to the Crown, always means &#34;shall.&#34; That is the sort of argument that is being used, and I propose to look into that question. First of all, I bring the opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr., now Mr. Justice,</inline> Isaacs before honorable senators. &#39; In a speech on the question with which &#39; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. 1</inline> Deakin dealt, namely, the dispute between the two Houses over the Tariff Bill, it will be found at page 15686  of Hansard for  1902 that  he  said - I  say that as far as the Constitution makes any express provision it must be followed. But there is behind that Constitution . . . the whole bulk of British and Australian tradition relating to Parliamentary Government. What I mean is that we have first to look at the Constitution, but if we find anything in it which is inconsistent with what I term the common law of Parliamentary usage, precedent, and tradition, we should be guided by that as well. For example, we find nothing in the Constitution regarding the prerogative of the Crown . . . but it is there all the same. It is embodied in our practice, and the Constitution must be read in conjunction with that  practice. </para>
                        <para class="block">I intend now to refer to some well-known authorities on parliamentary practice as to the use of the prerogative of the Crown by the King, the Governor-General, or a Governor. The use of these words was rendered necessary by the fact that there is no parliamentary precedent for a double dissolution, and it was unnecessary to set out in the Constitution what should be done in connexion with the dissolution of one House; because, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Isaacs</inline> said in 1902, we have parliamentary tradition and usage behind us, and in such a matter the representative of the Crown would be guided by parliamentary usage and practice. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Isaacs</inline> contended that where we find something in the Constitution which affects parliamentary tradition, usage, and practice, it must be read with it, and in the light of it. When we read the constitutional section in the light of parliamentary usage and tradition, we shall then know whether the word &#34; may &#34; does or does not mean &#34; shall.&#34; As to parliamentary usage and practice in this matter, I refer honorable senators to Todd&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Government in the British Colonies,</inline> second edition. In chapter xvii., at page 760, I find the following - </para>

                                <para>- It is interesting to find on page 778 of this authority that after this dispute had gone on for some time, at the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Grey,  the whole correspondence that passed between the Governor of New Zealand and the Ministry was forwarded to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and submitted by him to the law officers of the Crown in Great Britain. I find that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Michael</inline> Hicks Beach minuted the papers to the effect that he entirely indorsed the Governor&#39;s attitude. What does that mean ? It means . that the Government cannot claim to possess the confidence of the House of Representatives when they exist by the casting vote of the  Speaker.  That has been asserted by the Crown law authorities of Great Britain. That being so, the present Commonwealth Government cannot claim to have passed the test measures, and to have created a dispute between the two Houses, when those measures are passed by the casting vote of the  Speaker. </para>

If they can bring forward those measures they can bring forward their whole policy, and if they do I hoy may be able to show that there is a grave and serious dispute between the Houses. I confess, if I may assume the <inline font-style="italic">rae</inline> of a prophet, that they would be able to do it. Unless the Government take that course they are not in a position to say that there is a dispute between the Houses. All that they are in a position to say is, &#34; There is a dispute between two parties, and we are seeking a party advantage to get a double dissolution in order that we may have a sporting chance in the House where we are in a minority at present.&#34; </para>

It means that where the House of Lords has repeatedly opposed and delayed a Bill for which the people of the United Kingdom have been clamouring, that House has in the long run been compelled by public opinion to give way. What Dicey has in his mind is not a question of party advantages or party fighting at all, but a measure of importance which the people badly need aud desire, which the people&#39;s House has put forward, and which the other House has continuously blocked. Can the Government say that there has been any clamouring for either of these test Bills? Can they say that there has been any demand for them? Can they say anything but that they are the result of party machination ? Can they say anything but that they have been merely conceived in the mind of the clever Attorney-General for the purpose of securing a party political advantage? There are people outside who are absolutely indifferent to both of the Bills, and do not care a snap of the fingers for either of them.

                        <para class="block">On this point, let us see whether the Government can establish the fact that this section of the Parliament is antagonistic to the wishes of the people of Australia. It is rather significant, in scanning the returns of the last election, to find that in the Senate, where the Labour party have a majority of the members, they were returned by a minority of the votes cast - arising, of course, from the equal representation of the States - while in the other House, which is supposed to be elected by the popular will, they got a majority of the votes cast. I intend to be quite frank as to how I arrive at these facts. At the Senate elections in New South Wales the candidates included Socialists, so-called, while in South Australia, Tasmania, and Victoria there were Independents. In the case of each State I took the figures of the highest Liberal and the highest Labour men. I added to the Liberals in Victoria and South Australia and Tasmania the vote for the Independents, while in New South Wales I added to the Labour vote the Socialist vote. I think that I was fair in adopting this method, and if there is any advantage it goes to the Liberal party, because the Independent vote in the three other States is greater than the Socialist vote in New South Wales. </para>

                                <para>- Yes, because I think that electors who would support <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Renwick,</inline> a single taxer, would support a Labour man in preference to a Liberal. However, I adopted this method, and the calculation goes for what it is worth. </para>

                                <para>- Yes, it is a matter of opinion, and we have to decide one way or the other. Let me now explain how it works out. The Labour votes given to the highest elected and highest defeated candidates numbered 948,168 for the whole of the States. The votes given to the highest elected and highest defeated Liberals and the Independents came to 958,122, so that there were 10,000 more cast for Liberals and Independents than were cast on this side, and, of course, the difference in the .representation arose from the equal representation of the States here. Let me now &#34;give the figures for the other House, which is supposed to represent the people. </para>

                        <para class="block">Wherever there was a straight-out contest, I took the Labour man or the Liberal, but there were several cases where there was no contest, and in these cases I took the Senate vote for the Liberal and the Labour candidate, and put that down for the constituency. That,. I think, is fair, because, generally speaking, the Senate vote is a few hundreds below the vote for the House of Representatives, but it runs pretty well on the same party lines. The epitome of the whole position is that Labour in the other House represents 993,893 votes, while the Liberal party represents 953,654 votes. </para>

                                <para>- The Independent candidates, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wise,</inline> and Miss Goldstein, I put with the Labour party, because they ran practically on the Labour platform, and both <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wise</inline> announced their intention, if returned, to support the Labour Government. As regards the other Independent candidates, in every case I added their votes to the Liberal votes. An Independent stood for Adelaide, and there were several Independents in other parts of the Commonwealth. I believe that at Corio, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> was a Labour man. Anyhow, I added his votes to the Liberal vote. I made the Liberal party a present of all the Independents other than <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wise,</inline> and Miss Goldstein. I have accounted for all the votes given for all the candidates, and the position is that, while 993,893 votes were cast for the highest Labour candidates, 953,654 votes were cast for the highest Liberals, including the Liberal Independents. There is a difference practically of 40,000. </para>

                                <para>- A number of figures were quoted previously by the press, but in every case they left out the constituencies where there was no contest. That is manifestly unfair to our party, because it assumes that there is no Labour vote in the constituency.

That is to say, the party who happen to be in power, although in a minority of 40,000 of the votes cast, expect that, they being in office by the casting vote of the  Speaker,  and able only to pass these Bills with his casting vote, the Governor-General will give them a double dissolution in order to bring both Houses before the people.

                        <para class="block">There is no reservation there as regards section 57 of the Constitution. There is only one other point with which I wish to deal, viz., whether or not the Governor-General has to look beyond these so-called test Bills. Are the Government entitled to say to him, &#34;Although these measures in themselves do not give us the right to a double dissolution, we ask you to take cognisance of the condition of Parliament. We ask you to take a hypothetical view of what Parliament will do in the circumstances&#34;? That is practically what the Minister of Defence meant by his interjection to-day. Evidently the Government think that because they have a narrow majority in another Chamber, and an overwhelming majority against them in the Senate, the Governor-General should grant them a double dissolution. If that be the case, so far from section 57 of the Constitution being used only in exceptional circumstances, I say that, in view of party vacillations in Australia, it will be used every two or three years unless the Senate is content to become merely a register of the decrees of the other branch of the Legislature. Members of Parliament are very human - more human, perhaps, than is the ordinary man in the street. In the other Chamber they would be able to discharge their duties without any fear. The Government would know that, provided they had a majority there, they could proceed with legislation. But how different would be the position in this Senate ! We have to recollect that, in order to safeguard the constitutional position of the Senate as representing the States, this Chamber must not be open to be squeezed. Otherwise, at any time the two big States cared to exert their power it would be placed in a position of subserviency to the other Chamber. I admit that no great outstanding question of State rights has yet arisen, but if ever the Senate is placed in the position to which I have just referred, the question of State rights will arise. It Will arise if ever the Senate is driven into a position in which it dare not defend State rights for fear that, in accordance with the precedent which would have been established, it would be dissolved, and honorable senators would be sent- to the country. I now wish to quote again from Keith, in order to show what, in his opinion, led to the insertion of these sections of the Constitution. Upon page 633 of his <inline font-style="italic">Responsible. Government in the Dominions,</inline> volume 2, he says - </para>

                            <para>In the case <inline font-style="italic">ot</inline> the Commonwealth, the provisions of the Constitution are, no doubt, in part due to the fact that the Upper House is a body which represents the States as well as the people, &#34;and has thus a power such as&#39; no other Upper House has ever possessed or is likely to possess. </para>

                        <para class="block">What will be the position, of the Senate as compared with the Upper Houses of the States if a double dissolution be granted in the present circumstances? Take the Legislative Council of Victoria as an example. It is a Chamber which is absolutely non-representative of the people. If a Bill be sent up to it; - say, a Land Tax Bill or a Factories Bill - it can proceed with its consideration absolutely untrammelled by any thought that it may be dissolved if it amends that measure. It proceeds to discuss it, careless of what the other branch of the Legislature may do, and careful only of the view which the few persons who are entitled to vote for its members will take of its action. That Upper House to-day is regarded as being infinitely weaker than is the Senate. But I ask honorable senators to assume that a double dissolution is granted, and then to compare the Senate with the Upper House of Victoria. In such circumstances, I say that the Legislative Council of this State would have the strength of a giant, while the Senate would have only that of a child. I could understand this proposal being brought forward by a Government that had been formed as a result of an overwhelming desire on the part of the two big and populous States to rob this Senate of its equal representation - to rob it of the powerful position it occupies in the Constitution. Suppose, for instance that these two big States became overwhelmingly Protectionist, and the small States were almost entirely Free Trade. One could understand then a movement arising in the two big States to find some way of destroying or crippling the Senate in order Ito bring about Protection. They would say, &#34; We cannot get sufficient representation in the Senate to achieve our ends. We cannot destroy equal representation under section 128, because we cannot touch that unless the small States themselves will give it up, and we know they will not do that.&#34; I could understand a Government in such circumstances saying, &#34; We must proceed by a roundabout method. As we cannot destroy the representation, we must destroy its power.&#34; That is what they are going to do, and that is what this will do. </para>

                        <para>SenatorPEARCE. - How many times have we seen conferences between the two Houses in the State Parliaments, when a Government have seen that a Bill before the Upper House was likely to be rejected, and have suggested a conference before the final stage ? In this case, however, the Government showed that they did not want any agreement. They were simply trying to manufacture a dispute, and never tried to avail themselves of the opportunity to have a conference between the two Houses. I would suggest that they do so on this occasion to dispose of these small measures. I do not know whether they will, but their action last session showed that they were simply trying to use the machinery of Parliament, as they thought, for a certain end. It is well that we should look at what is to be the effect of these proceedings on the position of the Senate in the Constitution. We are here representing the small, as well as the large, States. We are not responsible for the Constitution being as it is, but we have to be faithful to it, and it is our right and duty to see that is is not frittered away. If it is to be amended, it should be amended straightforwardly and openly. If equal representation is to go, by all means let us appeal to the people, and ask them to sweep it away. The Minister of Defence threw in an interjection about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was honest and straightforward. When the Constitution Bill was before the people, <inline font-style="italic">he</inline> told them that he was opposed to the equal representation of the States in the Senate, believing that it was undemocratic, and he asked the people to reject the Bill. He has not reiterated those views since the people accepted the Bill ; but now, after the Constitution has been working for years, the Attorney-General, not possessing the courage to head his Government in an open attack on equal representation iu the Senate - because if he did the people would at once see the hypocrisy of their talking about being champions of State rights - says, &#34; Let us cripple the instrument by which equal representation safeguards the States. As we cannot take the instrument away, let us blunt its edge; let us make it ineffective.&#34; So he and his Government propose to try to achieve their purpose by using these two trumpery measures, passed without having the confidence of the House in which they sit as a Government, to move the Governor-General to prostitute section 57 and give them a double dissolution. </para>

                            <para>. - I am somewhat at a disadvantage in speaking after the most able and lucid speech of my colleague, who has put the position in a way in which it has not been put before during this debate. We all join in the expressions of regret that the Governor-General lias seen fit to resign his position. We have learnt to honour him during the time that he has been here, and felt yesterday that we were parting from a friend. When listening to him yesterday, I could not help contrasting the freedom in his speech with the restraint which he has to exercise in the document which is called his Speech, as presented to this Parliament. The latter is, of course, prepared for him by the Government, and iu it they refer to questions that will not come before this House for a considerable time because of the trouble over the two test measures, as they are called. The other subjects mentioned comprise State Debts, &#34;Uniform Railway Gauge, Distribution of Murray Waters, and many other questions that are to a large, extent merely in the academic stage, and not in any way practical. One could not help noticing the divergence of opinion that obtained at the recent Premiers&#39; Conference, showing how far we are from reaching the .stage at which those big measures can be brought before this Parliament for confirmation. We are really, therefore, brought down to the narrow point that this Parliament has been called together for no other purpose than to decide on the acceptance or rejection of the two so-called test Bills. We are told that the exigencies of public affairs require our attendance, but I can see no urgency in those two measures. The Government have absolutely failed to show that there was any need to call Parliament together before the usual time. We rejected those two Bills last session, and the Government have again put them forward as serious propositions, by this means retarding important public business. To my mind they could be quietly shelved and solemnly buried, and no one would miss them or regret their departure. They would not even need a monument to be erected over them, because they themselves are a monument to the folly of the Government that presented them. No important public business has been placed before us of which we are within reasonable reach. The whole &#34;show&#34; is entirely given away by the next paragraph in the Speech, which reveals that the only public business before this House this session is to be the two test measures,  and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has made it quite clear that there is not the slightest chance of the Government bringing about what they are aiming at by those means. How our minds have become obsessed with the idea that the Government will be able to get a double dissolution on those two measures I cannot understand, because any student of constitutional history and procedure must admit that there is not the slightest ground to warrant such an extreme course being taken on two such trivial matters. It may be argue-d that the two Houses are not iu agreement, but there must surely be some reason for having two Houses. I cannot get a much better authority on the question of the bi-cameral system than the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> because it is such a stickler for having two Houses. With regard to the Senate, however, its attitude is most inconsistent. It advocates most strongly the retention of the Legislative Council of Victoria, just as its sister organ, the South Australian <inline font-style="italic">Register,</inline> defends the South Australian Legislative Council, and the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> barracks for the New South Wales Legislative Council.

                        <para class="block">On that dictum how can a party that take the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> as their political bible bring forward a measure which to all intents and purposes, if it succeeds, must result in the absolute destruction of the Senate for all time? Are the Government sincere in their proposals ? The Leader of the Government himself has said that these two measures are brought forward to create a position by reason of which the&#34; Governor-General may dissolve both Houses. If that attempt succeeds it will become a precedent for all time, and whenever the Senate takes exception to any measure, no matter what its scope, design, or intention, it will always be faced with the threat of a dissolution.

                        <para class="block">I contend that we have in the Senate exactly what the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> is craving for - a strong Chamber of review. It cannot be said that this Chamber is a fluctuating, variable body. If it comes to the question of which is the stronger Chamber, it must be admitted that there is a more definite expression of public opinion in the Senate than there is in the House of Representatives. This safeguard is more strongly entrenched in the Senate than in the more flexible House, which may be influenced by popular clamour at any time. The argument &#34;which the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> applies to Legislative Councils in the State Parliaments may be justly applied to the Senate. On the 6th February it was announced that the Commonwealth Parliament was to be called together early in April, and the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> expressed its delight on that account, and because we had in existence a Government that had a backbone. I do not wish to say that the present Commonwealth Government have not a backbone, but I must say that, so far, they have given no evidence of the possession of a backbone. They seem to be composed of most plastic material, which is moulded by the hands of some irresponsible individuals altogether outside Parliament. They are as plastic as a lump of clay in a potter&#39;s hands. We can trace day by day and hour by hour the effect of the influences that have been moulding that clay. The <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> itself has taken its part in moulding the clay, and many political associations outside have also made their impress on this precious Government with a backbone.

The two Houses have different functions to fulfil. The point I wish to establish is that the Senate fulfils a most useful function in the protection of the smaller States as against the larger. </para>

I may add to what he has said that Federation could not have been brought about if the smaller States had not agreed to come in. The protection of the real essence and spirit of Federation, which our opponents have lauded to the skies, rests with the Senate, and the removal of that power of protection from the Senate must involve the destruction of the Federation itself. Who was it that, during the referenda campaign, went through the length and breadth of Australia denouncing the Labour party for destroying the spirit of Federation ? </para>

They said, &#34; The Constitution is a sacred thing. Let no man approach it with his boots on. Let. every man uncover his head before it.&#34; But we now find the same set of individuals bringing forward two Bills which they cannot defend, and which they admit are nothing to the point, and declaring their determination, by means of these measures, to destroy the spirit and effect of Federation. </para>

                                <para>- If a double dissolution is brought about by the fate of these measures of minor importance, a similar thing must follow in. connexion with more important measures. My honorable friends cannot reason downwards from the greater to the lesser in this case. If they can accomplish their purpose by such measures as these a similar purpose may be brought about in time to come by more important measures, and the usefulness of the Senate will be gone for all time. The Senate has proved itself to bc a very useful Chamber. I regret that our honorable friends opposite, when they go outside, ar.e frequently disloyal to the Senate, and are not loyal as representatives of the different States to the constituents they represent. I realize that my outlook to-day is entirely different from what it was when I sat in the South Australian House of Assembly in Adelaide. I had to deal there with matters of a comparatively parochial character, but I deal here with national questions. There I had to consider the interests of districts and of South Australia; here I have to deal with questions which affect the whole of the States of the Commonwealth. I have to consider how any particular matter may affect, not merely the State from which I come, but Australia as a whole. If I am a party with the Government to anything which will have the effect of weakening the Senate, I shall, like them, be false to the Constitution and to my pledges to those who sent me here. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable senator&#39;s suggestion backs up my contention, and I say that even if the measures which have been referred to were brought forward honestly by the Government they would still achieve the same disastrous results. When they are brought forward with a sinister and dishonest motive, the evil of the course followed is intensified. It is important to remember that no great national issue is at stake, and that no fundamental principle between the political parties is at stake. </para>

As a gage of battle the measure may be important, whilst as a Bill it is absolutely worthless, inasmuch as the effect intended could be, and indeed has been, brought about by administration as well as by legislation. </para>

                                <para>- If the honorable senator will not contend that it was done illegally or surreptitiously, he admits that the Bill which the present Government have introduced is without foundation. The honorable senator admits that it is simply a gage of battle. Driven from the ground that there is any strength or force in the Bill, the honorable senator must admit that the Government are, for party purposes only, creating a quarrel with the Senate, and intend to ask the Governor-General to send this Parliament to the country on that issue. That is about the weakest position that any Government could take up. I have not been in Parliament for many years, but I have made myself acquainted with parliamentary history, and in my experience or reading I never came across a weaker position than that taken up by the present Government. There is nothing to justify them. They have shrank from point to point, and have to admit that the Bill which has been referred to is nothing but a gage of battle. I thank my honorable friends for that admission, because it will be useful to submit to the electors. </para>

                        <para>- It is not, I repeat, simply a cryptic utterance of the Prime Minister or a disjointed and individual utterance of certain members of the Liberal Union, but almost saturating the whole of the speeches which are delivered throughout the country I find the same principle enunciated distinctly. There is a definite aim, a united decision, a consensus of opinion to bring about a position which must result as I have said in undermining the constitution of the Senate. I desire to lay special stress on this very vital point, because if we find that to accomplish a party aim the Government are ignoring the constitutional position of the Senate and endeavouring to emasculate the Senate for the purpose for which it was created, I think it can be shown conclusively that, whatever claim Ministers may have at present to support outside they cannot expect on returning to their constituents to have any response to their call again. The effect of the test Bills and their value as represented by public opinion is discussed by one organ, published in Melbourne, in terms I propose to quote. Writing on the 27th April the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> says - </para>

                        <para>The one and only tangible outcome of the censure debate up to the present has been to show the people that the Cook Government are firmly resolved to force a double dissolution. </para>

                    <para class="block">That might be a resolution in their own mind, but I wish to trace the matter further back, and to prove that it was expressed definitely that their intention was to bend towards this goal, and not to further public business. Yet, according to the Governor-General&#39;s Speech, we have been called together for the purpose of expediting public business. Later, in the same article, the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> says - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>But the Cook Government appears to have no other aim immediately in view than to press forward with its two so-called &#34;test&#34; Bills, which were rejected by the Senate last session. In other words, it is blindly intent on fabricating what it supposes to be the constitutional pre-requisites of a double dissolution. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">In the mind of the Minister these may be pre-requisites to a double dissolution. If it can be proved that the insertion of u large quantity of gunpowder under a rock is a pre-requisite to an explosion, and if it can be found that with intent to destroy a certain building individuals connived together, and in collusion determined to insert the powder and bring about <inline font-style="italic">a.</inline> condition that would lead to an explosion, and consequently to the destruction of the building, I contend that, although they might not have been parties to the ignition, yet, if they created the pre-requisites of an explosion, they must, in public opinion at <inline font-style="italic">any</inline> rate, be adjudged guilty as though they had directly forced the explosion. That is the point I want to make. When the Government say that they are bringing about certain conditions, they are attacking the Constitution and warping it from its direct intention in order to entirely destroy the force and the power of the Senate as part of the Parliament.  They are doing more than they wish,- in fact, and they are doing something for which the people will condemn them for all time. It remains for me to show that the test Bills have been the subject of ridicule by their own party. It is a marvellous thing that we can suppose that any gentleman holding the exalted position of Prime Minister of the Commonwealth would be a party to sending to the Senate, where the representatives of the States gather, two measures which, admittedly from his own language, arc worthless, and about which he makes jokes. It is a travesty on legislation to send the Bills here; and to go into the country and deride the Senate for rejecting them is practically tantamount to stating that it has sunk as low as he has sunk - a supposition which, of course, could not for a moment be entertained by honorable senators. I can distinctly prove, from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook&#39;s</inline> own language- </para>

                            <para>- I thank my honorable friend for the interjection, because again and again across the table there has been thrown the imputation that on this side there is no understanding of the English language and no ability to draw a plain inference from words. There is, seemingly, an idea possessing the minds of the gentlemen now occupying the Treasury bench that they alone can understand the English language. When the Ministry was formed it was proclaimed as a Ministry of gigantic intellects. It was held up to Australia as a model Ministry. Ministers proclaimed that their advent to office meant the restoration of responsible government, but the very first thing they set their minds to do in earliest was to break down the Constitution. &#34;Responsible government&#34; was another phrase I heard used in this connexion. To whom were the Government responsible if not to the people of Australia? Shall we for a moment entertain the idea that there is any other motive behind the introduction of the test Bills than the desire of Ministers to break down responsible government, to practically prostitute the trust placed in them, and to violate the Constitution with unholy&#39; hands? In the whole history of true constitutional government in Australia there has never been, to my knowledge, so deep laid a scheme as this, and yet, it is apparent on the surface of it, that it is a scheme so trivial that its very father makes it the subject of ridicule; so trivial that he hopes that no one for a moment will entertain the idea that the Bills are of any value; so trivial that he has not the slightest conception that any one will be serious about them outside, although he expects us to be serious in our treatment of them here. It seems to be one of those blatant attempts which nobody but a person suffering from past indiscretions would contemplate unless he had a bad night&#39;s dream. I wish now to call attention to what the purpose was. Addressing the Australian Natives&#39; Association at Wangaratta, the Prime Minister used these words - </para>

Boiled down, one measure cannot affect any person who is in private employ. It contains no power to compel a private contractor to either accept or reject a trade unionist, nor does it empower the Government in any sense to either accept or reject trade unionists. The Bill is valueless, even more valueless than the piece of paper on which it is printed. </para>

He knows that, outside the Labour party&#39;s platform, I am free to say what I like. The caucus has no terrors for me. Evidently it was lack of courage on the part of my honorable friend which caused him to forsake the rule of the caucus. It would have been better for him had he remained where he was.

                    <para class="block">I wish to know if there is anything else upon which we are asked to go to the country ? The Prime Minister exclaimed, &#34; In the name of heaven.&#34; I need scarcely remind him that the use of such language is forbidden in decent society. Disingenuous allusion has been made to certain Bills which were before us last session. One of these was the Pine Creek to Katherine River Railway Construction Bill. &#39;I recollect reading a speech delivered by the Prime Minister, in which that measure was held up as one of the awful examples of the action of this Chamber. It would seem that we are not to criticise a Bill, or to eliminate anything from it, without first gaining the consent of the Prime Minister. We are to go to him and say, &#34; Please, sir, may we consider this measure ? May we think as we like upon it, or are we compelled to think upon it only just as you do? &#34; I submit that there is no reason why the Senate should be involved in a quarrel that is not its own. I have no hesitation in saying&#39; that the Pine Creek to Katherine River Railway Construction Bill&#39; was returned to the other Chamber in a very presentable form. For twenty-four years past, there has been no Upper House in Australia which has returned a measure of that description to the other branch of the Legislature with&#39; less alterations. Another Bill which the Prime Minister has charged us with mutilating is the Loan Bill. I say that, the Senate acted perfectly within its constitutional rights when it made requests in respect of that Bill. But, apparently, we must take our orders from a gentleman,  who, because of a mere freak of fortune, happens to hold a very exalted position. Ministers were not prevented from giving effect to their wishes in respect to the Loan Bill, except on definite lines, which were in harmony with the platform of the Labour party. The people of Australia knew that we would do exactly what we did. According to the Prime Minister, the so-called test measures, to which I have referred, are not great measures in themselves. Yet in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech we are told that Parliament has been summoned to deal with public business. By the Prime Minister&#39;s own admission, it has not been called together to do that. We have merely to oblige the Prime Minister by occupying time in discussing these measures.

                    <para class="block">That is a strange admission for the Prime Minister to make. He declares that the Government have not held office because the consensus of public opinion is behind them. They have not held it by reason of the policy which they have propounded, because, as a matter of fact, they have never propounded one. The Prime Minister says that the reason no policy has been propounded is that such a proceeding would cause a split in the party. After all, the honorable gentleman is admittedly remaining in office, and earning his livelihood, by his wits. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable senator has read much about constitutional history, he cannot be prepared to say that &#39;those two test Bills create the position of dead-lock that was contemplated by the framers of the Constitution. The general public would condemn the Labour party most strongly if they attempted anything like what the present Government are attempting. There would be no language in the dictionary severe enough for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to use against us if we did what the Government are doing now. The honorable senator, therefore, ought to condemn himself and his Government for making up their minds, as he and other Ministers admit that they have done, to create a position which will bring about a double dissolution. They have presupposed that the Governor-General would grant it on those terms. Can my honorable friend deny that? </para>

That is all that we can do on this question.&#39; The honorable senator knows that the whole of the press of Australia is on the side of his party. We have no means like they have of getting our views before the people. The fact remains that the Government have created the present position with the definite object of bringing about a double dissolution. They made up their minds to do it when they took office, and all the way through they have been conniving at a deliberate attempt to undermine the Constitution. </para>

I believe they were entirely oblivious of parties, Labour or Fusion, when they framed the instrument for the Federal government of Australia. The evil of the action of the Government lies in this, that for purely party purposes they are using the constitutional machine in a way that will lead to its absolute destruction. </para>

                            <para>- That is not an answer to my question. I know not where my honorable friend may dwell, but I venture to say that every letter he posts is carried to its address by the employ&#233;s of a socialistic post-office. Every telegram he sends is conveyed along a socialistic telegraph line. I venture to say that he did not reach this Parliament without riding in a socialistic train, and if in doing so he met with an accident, it is possible that he would take advantage of the opportunity to be treated in a socialistic hospital. The honorable Senator no doubt lias a motor car in which he rides along roads that are socialistically maintained, and to quench his thirst he takes water supplied to him from a socialistic reservoir. In spite of all this, my honorable friend will stand upon a platform and denounce Socialism. He moves, breathes, and has his being in Socialism, and were he removed to some place in which he would be deprived of all these socialistic advantages, which come to him as a boon and a blessing through life, he would say, &#34; Take me back to a Socialist State.&#34; These are the gentlemen whom we hear prating about Socialism. I am sorry to have to say to my honorable friend, who is such a genial, good-hearted man, that he does not know the A B C of Socialism. </para>

                            <para>- Snowden is the writer I referred to, and not Snow. 1 have here one of the first pamphlets that were circulated in South Australia on the subject of Socialism. This is the document which the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tom</inline> Price held in his hand at Mount Gambier one night when a great stir was created. I handed it to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Price</inline> on that occasion, and he handed it back to me. This is the thing which he denounced in such strong terms, and I say now, emphatically, that it is an absolute and gross misrepresentation of the Labour party. Yet this Is one of the publications which are fathered by the Liberals. Is there no ethical standard amongst Liberals to prohibit them from bearing false witness against their neighbours? Are they so dead to all the best traits of human nature as to circulate a thing of this kind? I have here also another of their celebrated pamphlets which was used to win an election. It is one of the vilest things that any party could issue. It is a diabolical misrepresentation, and endeavours to charge a man with something of which he was absolutely guiltless. This pamphlet was circulated in South Australia in hundreds on the eve of an election. It represents the Honorable J. &#34;Verran taking a mask from his face, and so disclosing the face of a murderer, who has in his teeth a knife dripping with blood. This is one of the things fathered by the Liberal Union in order to gain an election. A party that requires to depend for support upon such things should be condemned by all right-thinking people, and every man who has a spark of humanity, and any idea at all of ethical conduct, should forsake such a political institution. I have here also a card that was issued at election time. The first time I saw a card similar to this it was in the hands of a gentleman who occupies a position in the South Australian Ministry. It was taken from the gentleman&#39;s coat pocket surreptitiously as a thing to be shown only in the dark. It differed only from the card I have in my hand in the fact that it was gilt-edged. I believe that this card was circulated throughout Victoria. What was the purpose of it ? Was it to elevate the standard of politics, and to make Parliament respected ? </para>

                        <para>Whether they admitted it or not, these exponents of real Socialism, whom his. Labour friends here were weakly and half-heartedly following, had no film over their eyes. They proclaimed openly that it meant absolutely the destruction of what had hitherto been regarded as the unit of national life. In every country possessing civilization worthy of the name the social system was based on family, on the maintenance of family ties and responsibility. Now it was proposed that these should be farmed out to the State. </para>

                    <para class="block">I say that such ideas are absolutely foreign to the thoughts of the Labour party. No one who knows the members of the Labour party could for a moment charge them with belief in such doctrines. There has been nothing associated with the Labour party in Australia from which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Irvine</inline> could draw such conclusions. I hold that since the advent of the Labour party in Australian politics their influence has tended to elevate rather than to debase society. If we enter our legislative halls in Australia to-day, I say, without wishing to make invidious comparisons, we shall find that the influence of Labour has been to make politics purer and raise their tone in every way. When we go forth amongst the people in the different States we find that the effect of Labour teaching has been not to demoralize, but to uplift. It is unfortunate that a gentleman occupying the position of Attorney-General should associate himself with the infamous pamphlets that have been circulated in Australia solely for the purpose of defaming the Labour party in order that their opponents might secure a snatch political victory. I will go even farther than that. There is a much more serious thing hanging over our heads if the present Government should be retained in power. I desire to utter a word of warning to my honorable friends on the other side, though, perhaps, they may say that there is no need. I predict that if the Liberal party should ever gain power in the Commonwealth - which God forbid they should - the system of old-age pensions will go. </para>

Does he know that long before it was introduced into any State it was on the platform of the Labour party? It was the point towards which they were aiming, and every goal they made tended to make its introduction possible. By the imposition of the Federal land tax, the Labour party pointed out to the Deakin Government that the way had been made possible for instituting a scheme of old-age pensions in the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- Absolutely, they did. lt was not until the Labour party presented an ultimatum to the Deakin party, and made them fearful of losing their Ministerial positions, that the introduction of the principle was made possible. To the Labour party belongs the sole credit of instituting the payment of old-age pensions. Indeed, it is the only bulwark that stands between the maintenance of the system and its annihilation. </para>

                            <para>- I searched the records until I became convinced as to the true history of this social movement. If my honorable friend can produce contrary evidence, I shall be prepared to believe; but never do I believe anything except on evidence. It cannot be denied that the present Attorney-General, when he was in the Legislative Assembly of Victoria, moved to reduce the amount of the old-age pensions. It cannot be denied that in a Supply Bill it was proposed to reduce the annual vote for this purpose from &#163;216,000 to &#163;150,000, the effect being to reduce the amount paid per week. It may be said, of course, that this proposal went no farther than an introduction; but, as a matter of fact, a division was called for. Forty-one members voted for the proposed reduction, while thirty-three voted against it, the majority including the present Attorney-General. It should be made known to old-age pensioners that he has always been against old-age pensions. Even at the present time he is reported to be dead against the system, for it was only at Sandringham the other night that he expressed his opposition to it. Unmistakably, it is the Labour party whom old-age pensioners have to thank for the introduction of the system and its preservation. </para>

                            <para>- This is very entertaining; but, fortunately for the Labour party, the public records show that my remarks are absolutely correct. It is of no use for the Minister to endeavour to get behind my impeachment, or to attempt to take the sting out of it. I hope that the truth will fasten itself upon the minds of those who, unfortunately, are dependent upon the old-age pension. I know that again and again in South Australia the Liberals said to the old people, &#39; &#39; But for the Liberals you would lose your pension.&#34; The pensioners were persuaded that the Liberals were the advocates of the system; but when I came to search the records I found that the very persons in whom the pensioners trusted were those who were likely to lead them to destruction. The Governor-General&#39;s Speech, which tells us that we are met to expedite public business, contains no platform. It is a marvellous thing to have in power a party who have no platform. We never hide our platform under a bushel, because we have no fear as to what the results will be when it is published. Where is the Liberal platform ? Is it in the waistcoat pocket of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Oakes,</inline> who is smiling genially at me? I think that before any party seek to obtain a double dissolution, they should take the public into their confidence sufficiently to say that if returned they will do this, that, and the other. But the present Government are silent on this point. Where is their platform, I should like to know ? It is not here from want of repeated attempts to formulate one. In May, 1912, for instance, there was a convention held to form a platform, and certain decisions were come to. These decisions were based upon the resolutions of a conference held in the previous year. Here is the fighting platform to which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> referred on a memorable occasion.

                            <para>- That is the answer of the old procrastinator over there - at a more convenient season. The two senators on the Treasury bench, Senators McColl and Oakes, were pledged! to carry this platform into effect. Two years have gone by, but the platform has not yet seen the light) of day. Months ago it was announced with a flourish of trumpets. A big drum proclaimed its coming, and, for all I know, guns roared to tell us of its approach. The orators said that it was a policy of &#34; bold contour, comprehensive, vital and national in character,&#34; and that the Liberals were proud of it. Are they proud of it to-day 2 Have they evinced any pride ? They are ashamed, apparently, that the platform has not seen the light of day. It is still hidden in darkness. They are ashamed of the future. They seem as though they want the nation to forget the platform. Some persons may say that the Liberal party have a platform. But how do I know whether they have or not? Again and again have I not challenged them to produce a platform, even offered a reward for its production ? But no platform is forthcoming. Here is a political party with views that are as misty and nebulous as the belt of Orion. I am criticising a party who exist practically on a .nebulous policy, a policy that has never been brought down until it could be crystallized into a single sentence. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to direct attention to a matter arising out of a reply given by the Vice-President of the Executive Council to a question which I put to him to-day. My question related to the letting of a contract for clearing at the Kalgoorlie end of the transcontinental line. The Vice-President of the Executive Council informed me that no tenders were called for that work for the reason that it was not usual to call for tenders for works of such a minor character. I wish to show that that work is not a minor one. Upon the 7th May, I asked the Minister representing the Minister of Home Affairs - </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to emphasize the point which has been raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> The contract is really one, not merely for all the earthworks on the Western Australian end of the railway, but also for a portion of those works in South Australia until the parties working at either end of that line meet. The contract stipulates prices which, although they are less than those being paid to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith, are higher than were paid when the Government were carrying out this undertaking by day labour. They are sufficiently high to enable higher rates of wages to be paid by the Government than they have been paying. We all know that the employ&#233;s on the line in Western Australia are on strike simply because the Government will not pay the same rates as are being paid by a private contractor who does not desire to sweat his men. Thirteen shillings and four pence per day is the minimum rate being paid by him. The fact that the Ministry refuse to pay the wages current on the gold-fields of Western Australia, and have let another contract without calling for tenders, is one more illustration of the beautiful system which they have inaugurated. </para>
