                        <para>- Is the Minister representing the Postmaster-General aware that, in connexion with the contract for the mail service between Tasmania and the mainland, when a steamer leaves the wharf at Launceston provision is always made on the gangway for the receipt of late letters? Is he also aware that when a steamer does not leave the wharf at the advertised time, but a tender is provided, no such provision as I have referred to is made, and that, as a consequence, a large number of late letters have to be placed in the hands of some individual who is apparently not responsible to the Department, and the persons who post the letters in that way have no great certainty that they will reach their destination ? Will he require the contractors, whenever they provide a tender, to supply the same facilities for the reception of late letters as are provided when a steamer does leave the wharf ? </para>

It was ascertained that the cost of holding the competitions at one centre would amount to about &#163;600, whereas, if held in each State, the total expense would be limited to about &#163;50.

                            <para>.- There is a Government in office, but not in power, which is possibly the most devious, dubious, doubly dissolute set of deceivers and deluders that have ever occupied the Ministerial bench. It could well be termed the &#34; Big Bluff &#34; Government, and the &#34; False Pretences &#34; Government. In view of the fact that since they took office they have openly resorted to bribery of their own political supporters, I want to place on record one or two cases which will prove that the statement made in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech is the most hollow piece of transparent hypocrisy ever placed in the mouth of any representative of the King in these dominions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> rightly took exception to the words &#34; or favoritism &#34; in the following sentence, &#34; Those subjects comprised Bills dealing with the prohibition of preference or favoritism in Government employment.&#34; I like that statement coming from this Government, in view of the revelations regarding the Teesdale Smith contract. Of course, there was nothing that could be called favoritism there ! </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para>Another matter was the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> Swinburne, a prominent party politician, to a high office, but that, of course, was the recognition of due rights, and not favoritism. It is different when we turn to the discharge of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryland,</inline> an officer whose capabilities no one questioned. </para>

                                <para>- In two cases only. In the other cases the verdict was &#34; not guilty.&#34; The honorable senator should be ashamed of the interjection. Both men were discharged because they happened to be Labour men, and dozens of other cases could Be found to illustrate the fact that the Government had been absolutely devoid of a sense of elementary fair play and justice. I propose to give an instance to show that they have been guilty of gross and deliberate favoritism to their own supporters, although during the election campaign they went through the country talking about tyranny and corruption on our part. I refer to their action with regard to advertising. They have deliberately given preference and shown favoritism to one of their political supporters and political pimps. During our Government&#39;s term of office we heard a good deal about advertisements being given to Labour newspapers. As a matter of fact, it was given equally to both sides, in that spirit of fairness which was characteristic of that Administration, but the newspapers on the other side thought it was a crime to give advertisements to a Labour newspaper, and a great song was made about it. </para>

                        <para>The present Government, however, have actually given a direct subsidy to a paper which has not a large circulation, and cannot claim to have much influence, although it is a direct and indirect supporter of the Government. This is the <inline font-style="italic">Fruit World,</inline> issued in Melbourne, and claiming to be representative of the fruit industry of Australia. Many of the fruit-growers of Tasmania have turned it down because it is known to be the petty pimp and supporter of the big fruit exporting agents who dominate the fruit trade of the Commonwealth, and to be subsidized by them by means of advertisements. </para>
                        <para>When the Labour Government appointed a Royal Commission to inquire into the fruit industry, this paper at once opposed the proposal, and, assuming the usual Liberal attitude, condemned the Commission before it had taken much evidence. On one occasion it published an article headed &#34;Who is Whittles?&#34; which was a deliberate and wicked perversion of the truth. This referred to a Tasmanian witness. It deliberately suppressed half the evidence, giving only that which supported its particular point of view, in order to damage the reputation of the Commission in the eyes of the fruit-growers. The Labour Government, when in office, through representations made by its Liberal owner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Davey,</inline> a very pushing gentleman, gave the paper two contracts for the supply of a number of copies to be distributed abroad. On those occasions the paper was supplied to the Government at exactly the same price as it was issued to anybody else. No discrimination was made against the Government as a purchaser, but directly the present Government came into office, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Davey</inline> put before them a proposition which every newspaper man will at once condemn as unfair and unjust. </para>

                                <para>- Yes; the issue for March. There are in the special copy five pages of illustrations from ordinary blocks, which I suppose could be purchased for 6s. a dozen. They appear to me to be Government blocks. Dealing with the matter published, there is in the ordinary issue seventy-four pages, but in the special issue only sixty pages, so that for the special issue fourteen pages less paper and printing were required. I come to another point which makes the transaction even blacker. For the special issue most of the ordinary advertisements were cut out. </para>

                                <para>- Most of them. These clever gentlemen went to the Governments of the different States, and secured from them nice advertisements for the special issue, for which I suppose they received fine figures. There is one from Victoria, Western Australia, South Australia, and New South Wales respectively. They cut out fourteen pages of the ordinary issue, and put in five pages of cheap illustrations, whilst they secured lucrative contracts for advertising from the State Governments. Then they said to the Department of External Affairs, &#39; &#39; Take this attenuated edition ; here it is, 9d. per copy.&#34; That is the price that was paid by the Government for the Commonwealth. Will honorable senators say that that is not an example of corruption? </para>

                                <para>- I say that the reply contains an untrue statement inasmuch as the special issue was smaller rather than larger than the ordinary issue. Any news agent can buy the ordinary issue of this publication for 4d. per copy, which is, I think, the trade rate, but the Government were mulcted to the extent of 8d. per copy, making allowance for postage and extras. I hold that this is a most glaring instance of incapacity, unfair preference, and favoritism. I wish now to make the Government an offer. I am a shareholder in a newspaper, and if the Government are prepared to give 50 per cent, more than the ordinary price charged for publications of this kind, I do not see why I should not get some of the pickings. There is a newspaper in Tasmania, the proprietors of which are quite prepared to take a contract to supply any number of copies- </para>

I hope that honorable senators will inspect these issues of the <inline font-style="italic">Fruit World,</inline> because this advertising contract is, I think, about as fishy a contract as any that was ever let by a Government.

                        <para>I come now to another instance of favoritism shown by this pure Government, the members of which are out to prevent &#34; Tammany&#34; and corrupt practices. This case was brought before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> when he was Minister of Defence, and it is a clear case of favoritism and preference connected with the Defence Department. There is in Launceston a Doctor L. Clarke Webster. He is not a Labour man. He has always been a big Australian, and is known to have very high ideals of Australian nationalism. He has taken a deep interest in our Defence Forces. In view of the interest he had displayed, he was asked, in 1910, to accept the position of medical examiner of Senior Cadets, but he refused to do so. In January, 1911, he was asked to apply for a commission in the Army Medical Corps as Area Medical Officer, at a salary of &#163;25 a year. He refused, and told the Department that his professional duties did not allow him to take the position. On 1st May, 1911, he received a wire from  Lt. -Colonel Giblin,  Chief Medical Officer in Tasmania, in these terms - </para>

                        <para>In these circumstances, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Clarke</inline> Webster wired &#34;Yes&#34; in reply to this telegram. He accepted the position at the low remuneration of &#163;25 a year, and there were not many doctors after it at that price. A little later the matter was taken up by the medical men of Australia, who got up an agitation against what they considered the low rate of remuneration paid to Area Medical Officers. </para>

                                <para>- Exactly. The doctors have to work in Tasmania, and this particular officer was passed out. He received his discharge on 10th May, 1913, and applied for an appointment in a new area on the same day. He continued to act, however, pending the receipt of news as to whether he was to be reappointed. He even travelled as far as Beaconsfield, where he conducted examinations, and generally carried out the duties of his office. No word came from Hobart for some time, and the next intimation received was that Doctors Thompson and Newell had been appointed to the positions on the 25th July, 1913. </para>

                <para class="block">That is a crushing reply to the statement that the boy was unfit for training.

Here, therefore, was a successful attempt to throw an officer out of our Military Forces merely because he had done his obvious duty.

I suppose that they consist of the Audit Bill and the Loan Bill, which were introduced last year.

If the Government tell the country of the big and important tilings which they intend to do, and refuse to do anything, I take it that the path of this party is clear, and that our duty is at once to introduce the legislation which the country wants, and show at any rate that our responsibility is fulfilled by passing measures through this Chamber. </para>

                            <para>- That is so, and they also knew that we had amended the Tariff twice. But suppose that we had done nothing, would that absolve them of their responsibility or their duty? Their excuse for continuing their neglect is that we did not act. There can be no argument there, and the hollowness of their action stands transparent to the electors. Let me bring forward the things which I consider the Government have neglected, and which are vital to Tasmania. The ex-Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> promised a Commonwealth line of steamers oversea. That was one of the most important features in his proposed policy when he went to the country. It would have been a very big step in the emancipation of the producers of Australia. Some very striking instances were given quite recently of the depredations of the Shipping Ring as regards some comparisons of rates and freights sent out by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> M&#39;Call, Agent-General for Tasmania. I do not want to deal with these comparisons, but if we had had an oversea line of steamers now ordered we would have been able presently to carry our mails, and to save the subsidy of &#163;170,000 a year that we give to the Orient Company. We could have entered into competition with the Shipping Ring, provided cheap freights and cheaper fares, and set a standard as regards up-to-dateness and modern fittings and appliances which would have had a very beneficial effect upon the traders and the producers of Australia. But the friends of the farmers on the other side have opposed our project. </para>

                    <para>Against the advice of the majority of the Tasmanian members of this Parliament the Government gays a contract to the Union and Huddart Parker Steamship Companies, members of the Shipping Combine, for a service between the mainland and Tasmania, which, although slightly improved, will not effect the great reforms in transport to which we were looking forward. The people of Tasmania are thoroughly roused on this matter, and there is a feeling of resentment that, when we came to a decision here, Senators Keating, Bakhap, and Clemons voted against the proposal, and voted against it, too, with practically no excuse. These . honorable senators turned down a proposition which was not put forward by the representatives of the State in the light of asking for a favour from the Commonwealth. It was a business proposition. It would not have meant any loss, because the service would have been self-supporting even in the worst circumstances, considering the subsidy that we now pay. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> did not go to Tasmania and condemn our proposal. He was too clever to go there, but since the elections he went to a border town in New South Wales - Albury - and made a speech which I do not believe he ever thought would reach Tasmania, and in which he made this statement - </para>

                        <para>The Labour Government had proposed to establish a steam-ship service - little better than a ferry service - between Australia and Tasmania. For &#163;2,000 extra his Government had provided for an up-to-date steam-ship service which would give better accommodation, and at the same time give a quicker mail service throughout the whole of Tasmania. (Applause.) This alone would mean a saving of hundreds of thousands of pounds, as compared with the proposal of the Fisher Government. </para>

                    <para class="block">When I brought this matter before the Senate, I found that South Australians, Western Australians, Victorians, Queenslanders, and New South Welshmen were quite prepared to support it. The Senate, although the States House, was quite prepared, after the case of weak Tasmania was put up by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long, Senator O&#39;Keefe,</inline> and myself, to accept the principle of the Commonwealth running these two boats. Although the States House was in favour of the proposal, and although our colleagues were in favour of it, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> has congratulated the people of New South Wales because his Government have saved hundreds of thousands of pounds in not carrying out the proposal. They have not saved hundreds of thousands, but have added hundreds of thousands of pounds to the burden of the people of Tasmania during the next seven years. They have betrayed its best interests, and where we should have had two boats under our flag crossing the strait, and providing speedy communication at reasonable fares, and with up-to-date methods, we are to get another steamer of the <inline font-style="italic">Loongana</inline> type; and, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> told the Senate the other day, we probably will have to put up with more restricted conditions, and there may be increased fares charged in a roundabout way, because the combine is bound under the contract not to increase the fares. </para>

                        has quite forgotten that utterance now, as he has forgotten or swallowed many hundred other utterances, and his whole anxiety is to force both Houses before the country by means of a legislative fraud. The Government are doing this because they realize that there is a big financial difficulty looming in the background. Their only chance is to force both Houses to the country. They realize that it is the gambler&#39;s last throw of the dice, or they would hang on to office like a limpet to a rock.

                            <para>- During the four years that I have been in the Senate I have never gone back on a single political principle. The honorable senator cannot say the same. I hope the time will never arrive when I shall have to look back on a political record like that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl.</inline> Here are some other matters which the honorable senator and his party will probably repudiate. According to <inline font-style="italic">The Fighting Line,</inline> there is in Sydney a big Liberal debating club, with headquarters in Pitt-street. The subjects discussed there may fairly be taken as an indication of the trend of political thought in Liberal circles in New South Wales. I notice that at the last meeting one of the subjects debated was &#34; That the policy of a White Australia should be abandoned.&#34; This was moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ashton,</inline> and opposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watkin.</inline> Is not that a fitting subject to occupy the attention of a Liberal debating society ? I believe that a good many of the so-called Liberals of Australia would actually jettison the White Australia policy if they got a chance. Another subject debated was, &#34; That the next Federal election should embrace a referendum to remedy the undemocratic representation of the States in the Senate.&#34; This was moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watkin,</inline> and opposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pitt.</inline> That is interesting news to the representatives of Tasmania, because we are assured by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atkinson,</inline> M.P., that the great Liberal party have no designs on the principle of equal representation. I should have liked to see the divisions on those two subjects. I am quite prepared to believe that both motions were carried, but in neither case, strange to say, is the result of the voting given. I have another little extract here, which will show how the members of the Ministerial party wobble. This is taken from the report of a speech by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atkinson,</inline> the honorable member for Wilmot, on May 8th, 1913, delivered in&#39; his own electorate. The honorable member was asked, &#34; Do you believe in the Federal Arbitration Act?&#34; and he replied - ~T cannot say that I do. I think it has lent to the artificial creation of disputes in order to get to the Arbitration Court. </para>

                    <para class="block">I suppose that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> will not agree with that. The honorable senator agrees only with what suits him.&#34; When any one says anything that he thinks is calculated to injure his party, the honorable senator is quite prepared to repudiate it. </para>
                    <para>I wish to deal now with the financial spectres that are looming behind the Government. I wish to know why the Government are anxious to get to the country. The reason is that they are already more than half discredited, and every month&#39;s delay in going to the electors adds to their danger. They know that if they retain office very much longer they will be obliged to make some attempt to adjust the finances of the Commonwealth, and that will be sufficient to hurl them from the Treasury bench. This accounts for their present display of false courage-. It is the courage of the toper, with a few beers in him, who is prepared to do anything. The Government are now at the inebriate stage. They are prepared to make a deadly plunge, and do not bother very much about whether they fall or not. They are forced into their present desperate position by their knowledge of the financial outlook, and of their inability to deal with it. </para>

Turning to the latest statistics issued by the Department, I notice that the Treasurer&#39;s estimate of revenue for this year was &#163;21,000,000, whilst his estimate of expenditure is &#163;24,000,000. I am informed that the estimate of expenditure is likely to be largely exceeded, especially in connexion with the Defence Force. But on the figures given, a deficit of over &#163;3,000,000 is foreshadowed. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. Their statesmanship has been exemplified by the Teesdale Smith contract, and by looking after their own supporters in the way I have shown. They have not so far given Parliament any information as to what are to be their financial proposals. How do the Government propose to meet the deficit? Do they propose to commence a red-hot borrowing policy ? . If the Tariff is revised by this Parliament, it is inevitable that it will be made more highly protective, and this must at once result in a fall in the revenue. Revenue duties will have to .go, protective duties must be increased, and the result must be that the revenue through the Customs will drop, it may be, to the extent of from &#163;1,000,000 to &#163;3,000,000. </para>

Will the Government start a borrowing policy ? If that is their intention, I am satisfied that they have not the courage to tell the electors so. They will keep that intention in the background. No matter what Government may be in power in the Commonwealth, it is certain that in a very, short time we shall have to face an extensive borrowing policy, or must obtain more revenue by taxation. There is no way out. Honorable senators, whether Labour or Liberal, will have to make their choice and say whether they will support a proposal that the Commonwealth should make a seventh and extensive Australian borrower, or a proposal to extort from the wealthy, people of Australia a little more of the wealth they have confiscated. </para>

                            <para>- That would indirectly mean greater production, and increased consumption. So far as a wealth tax is concerned, I believe that we should adopt further direct taxation, and adequately tax wealth. Our taxation to-day falls very largely on the wage-earner. In my opinion, we nave never yet adequately taxed the big wealthy interests in Australia. I have gone into some Tasmanian figures on the subject, and to me they are very interesting. I find &#39; that public taxation in that State is&#39; very heavy. We pay in Tasmania &#163;462,000 a year in interest on the national debt of about &#163;11,500,000. In addition, we have private taxation, estimated by reliable authorities as follows: - &#163;600,000 per annum mortgages on land; &#163;500,000 rents from land; &#163;300,000 interest on banking and -other securities. There is, therefore, private, taxation on producers and workers of Tasmania, apart from the taxation imposed by the public debt, to the amount of &#163;1,400,000 a year. There is a dividend tax and an income tax, and I am glad to say that, in connexion with the income tax, a distinction is made between incomes from personal exertion and incomes from property, the latter paying a higher rate. The Government taxation on the private taxation of &#163;1,400,000 is about &#163;60,000. I find that there are 60,000 workers in Tasmania, and their average wage, when I went into the figures with a friend, was &#163;?0 per annum. I admit that there has been some increase since. From the 60,000 people who produce the wealth of Tasmania, &#163;1,800,000 is taken in the way of unearned income. If this sum were divided amongst the wage-earners it would represent a 50 per cent, increase on what they at present receive, and would raise the average from &#163;70 per annum to a little over &#163;100. </para>

                            <para>- I do not suggest anything so silly. It is very hard to obtain definite estimates of what is really paid in rent and interest in Australia, but, from an estimate made by a Victorian actuary, I find that the wealth of Australia is &#163;1,000,000,000. It is estimated that 8,500 persons own over &#163;810,000,000 of the total wealth, leaving &#163;190,000,000 for the rest of the community. We receive from Customs and Excise duties about &#163;15,000,000 a year; and, to show the hollowness of the present system of taxation, it is estimated that those persons who possess only one-fifth of the -wealth of Australia contribute no less than &#163;12,000,000 of the &#163;15,000,000 derived from Customs and Excise. To put this in another way, a writer in Tasmania recently showed that on incomes of from &#163;100 to &#163;120 a year, the income of the wage-earner, the indirect taxation amounted to over 4s. in the &#163;1, whereas the indirect taxation on incomes over &#163;1,000 a year amounts to 2s. and 2s. 6d. in the &#163;1. If we are getting 4s. in the &#163;1 from the worker, and only 2s.6d. in the &#163;1 from the capitalist, it is obvious that the latter is escaping&#39; his just share of taxation. In the circumstances, we might, without imposing a burden which the taxpayers could not bear, impose a tax on all Federal incomes from investments, with an exemption of &#163;1,000. </para>

                        <para>- I have some figures which may interest the honorable senator. I find that <inline font-style="italic">Knibbs</inline> says there are 17,894 persons in Australia who draw incomes aggregating &#163;80,000,000 a year. If we taxed these people at the rate of only1s. in the &#163;1, the impost would return &#163;4,000,000 per annum. </para>
