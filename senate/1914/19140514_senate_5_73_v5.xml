                        <para>- Has the attention of the Minister representing the Minister of External Affairs been called to an article in to-day&#39;s Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> headed, &#34; Slavery in Papua. A Grave Scandal. Boys Forcibly Indentured. Hundreds of Victims. Native Police Employed. Savage Coercion. Threats to Burn Villages. Government Acts Firmly.&#34;? The article, I may say, goes on to mention that the records of the incident are carefully pigeon-holed in the Department of External Affairs. In the face of these startling headlines, will the honorable senator lay on the table any papers dealing with this grave question ? </para>

                        <para>- I have seen the article referred to by the honorable senator. I have but very little knowledge of the matter under discussion, but such as I have justifies me, even now, in saying that the statements are inaccurate sensationalisms. I shall endeavour to obtain from my colleague the information to enable me to make a statement to the Senate, if possible, to-morrow, but, if not, at the first sitting next week. </para>

                            <para>. - I have, in ordinary circumstances, religiously refused to. take part in the debate on the Address-in-Reply, believing that it has often proved a great waste of time, and has seldom had any enlightening influence upon either the affairs of the country or the state of the House. My only excuse for rising in this instance is that I consider this one of the most extraordinary occasions, and one of the most extraordinary Addresses, that have been presented to us, particularly when the surrounding circumstances are taken into account. In the Speech the Governor-General is made to say that he has been practically compelled to call us together earlier than usual because it was thought unadvisable to have a long recess, owing to the Government having in view the expediting of the country&#39;s business. But when we read the Speech, apart from the business indicated in paragraph 2, we find really nothing in it that has any bearing on the expediting of the business of Parliament. Most of the Speech is devoted to something that has taken place between representatives of the Federal Government and representatives of the States; but we have been left in blissful ignorance, up to the present, of what that something really is. Later on the Government may be prepared to reveal to honorable senators what they intended to indicate by the paragraphs in the Speech referring to the Conference which has been held. When they have done so we shall be in a position to say whether the matter referred to in those paragraphs warranted the calling of Parliament together on the date on which it met. If there is any business for which the country is hungering and any particularly important legislation which the Government propose to submit, it is strange that it does not appear in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech. </para>

                            <para>- I wish to refer to one or two matters that have arisen in the course of the debate. My main reason for taking part in the debate is that I desire to refer to the action of the Government in reversing all the arrangements made by the previous Government for the construction of the transcontinental railway. I wish, among other things, to refer to their substitution of the contract system for the day-labo.ur system in the construction of public works. I direct attention to the position indicated by an interjection I made when the Minister of Defence was replying to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> on the subject of the Teesdale Smith contract. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> after having traversed the whole length of the section on which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale.</inline> Smith has been carrying out this contract, made a very strong speech on the subject; </para>

                            <para>- That is so. The Minister of Defence, in his reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> endeavoured to cast some doubt upon the veracity of the statements made by the honorable senator in regard ito the nature of the country in which the contract is being carried out. For the information which he has submitted <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has earned the gratitude of honorable senators who have not had a similar opportunity to traverse the country. We have had reports submitted from time to time, and we know that this contract was let to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith under conditions such as I venture ito say have never before been associated with any contract let iri Australia. No body of sane men would let a contract under such conditions. The Minister of Defence said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> inspected the section only after a certain amount of work had been completed, and he personally preferred the opinion of two of his officers as to the character of the country to that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline> It is quite right that a Minister should be prepared to depend upon the opinion of his responsible officers, but as a hard-headed, practical man <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> must admit that these officers made the greatest blunder that could be made in advising the Government to enter into a contract with a private contractor on a purely speculative basis. I say that it was upon a speculative basis, because members of&#39; the Government and also their officers have confessed that they were absolutely ignorant of the nature of the country through .which the line was to go. That can be proved by reference to a- report received from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hobler</inline> after the con- tract had been let, and from which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> quoted in contradiction of the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline> After work under this contract had been commenced <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hobler</inline> paid a visit ito the scene of operations, and he says that on the top at a certain place there was soft sand, but that underneath there was hard sandstone - disjointed, he calls it. I had an opportunity to inspect some of it today, and I am prepared to say that it is not at all disjointed. It is just about the finest-jointed stuff that I have seen in my life. It is so jointed that I question whether very much would require to be blasted at all. Most of it is in such a condition that it would be easy to pick it out even if one could not pick it out with his toe nails. </para>

                            <para>- I saw a specimen of it, and I made that point quite clear. The honorable senator knew per.cisely what I was driving at, because he happened to be in very close proximity to me &#39;when I was looking at the specimen. I do not say that&#39; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith&#39;s contract price was too high. That is a matter of total indifference to me. If he as a contractor could get &#163;40,000 or &#163;50;000 as the result of the blindness and imbecility of the Government and their officers more power to him. That would merely serve to show that he is much smarter than are the Government or their officials. I make no complaint in that respect. But I do complain that the Government should depend on the reports of their officers, who have done absolutely nothing to prove the nature of the country which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith had to traverse. There is no private individual in Australia or elsewhere who would have adopted the course of action which has been pursued by the Government. Having said so much in regard to the contract, I wish to add that, in my opinion, the Ministry in changing the policy which has been hitherto adopted in connexion with railway construction made a mistake. Certainly there is strong evidence in that direction, as was shown by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> last night. He proved conclusively that work of this character has always been carried out by day labour. Such undertakings have not only proved to be cheaper in the first instance, but they have undoubtedly been proved to be cheaper from the standpoint of maintenance. I remember when the present Prime Minister was advocating the system of day labour in connexion with all Government contracts. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; but the moment <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Cook assumed the office of Postmaster-General he cut out the whole of the contracts and ordered that Government works should be carried out under the day-labour system. The result of this was that during the few years that he remained in the position of Postmaster-General he effected a saving of nearly  &#163;1  per foot in the matter of tunnelling for the Government of New South Wales. This is the Prime Minister who is now discarding the day-labour principle entirely. Having proved to his own satisfaction and to that of everybody concerned that the Government of that State were being robbed under the contract system, and that the work could be done more cheaply and show greater durability under the day-labour system; he now turns round and declares that he will go back to the old boodling system of contract, regardless of what may be the consequences. We now have a Government consisting of men determined to adopt a principle that has been proved reckless and bad ; and we have every cause to regard their acts with the greatest suspicion. </para>

                            <para>- I think it was slightly later; while he was Postmaster-General he did not, so far as I know, say anything about abolishing the crowned head. The superintendent appointed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> came from Lithgow, and was regarded as a good man in connexion with municipal works; hence, I suppose, his selection. However, what I wish to deal with is the Teesdale Smith contract. At every step in the construction of the transcontinental railway cause is given for suspicion; and it is almost worth while suggesting that Parliament should meet from day to day near the work, so that we might be able to see for ourselves what is going on. Of course, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> declares that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> was appointed by the Labour Govern-  merit; and, thereby, he practically seeks to shirk the position. The Labour Government might have been responsible for that appointment. </para>

                            <para>- Poor &#34; little Willie &#34; ! Probably the Government will  &#39; sack &#39; &#39; him when they are done with him. I now desire to say a word or two as to the Government business that has been placed before us. That business, according to  His  Excellency&#39;s Speech, consists mainly of two Bills, one to prohibit preference, or favoritism, in Government employment; and the other to restore the electoral provisions for voting by post. Does it come well from a Government of Tories - so-called Liberals - this declaration that there shall be prohibition of preference, or favoritism, in Government employment? If we could for a moment dig up the history which those Tories have made and moulded - if we could know the particulars of the appointment of every public servant in every State, and in the Commonwealth, many of whom occupy high and honorable positions, and trace their relationships and connexions - what a horrid mess there would be in Australia! People would stand aghast at the revelation. Yet we and the people are asked to believe that the Government have acquired such a keen sense of fairness, and of their public duty, that, in order to relieve their conscience, it is necessary to pass a measure providing that there shall be ho preference to unionists in Government employment. I remember the time when the present Prime Minister and myself used to take the platform side by side to advocate preference to unionists. I am still fighting for the principle. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. I am very anxious to see this Bill, in order that I may have a kick at it, and vote against it. From early manhood I have been a staunch believer, not only in unionism, but in preference to unionists; because of my knowledge of the history of unions, and because of my knowledge of the times when unionists were very much more persecuted for being unionists, and days were very dark indeed, when men had to fight their way to every bite of bread. When we compare the ten and fourteen hours per day that we used to work for10d. a day, with the hours we have been able to enforce by combination in trade unions, and give unionism due credit for the efforts it has made in the advancement of civilization, for all it has done in the cause of education, and for all it has done to advance men socially and intellectually, and to advance the national welfare as well, we must regard trade unionists as being well worthy of every preference. The non-unionist is a &#34; thing.&#34; </para>

To that kind of man preference should be given; to the man who has made life much easier for his fellow-beings to-day. I shall welcome the appearance of the Bill in this Chamber, for then I shall have pleasure in recording a vote to knock it out. &#34; That is just what we want,&#34; the Government say, &#39; &#39; for we shall then have a double dissolution.&#34; I shall not argue the question of a double or a single dissolution. I simply make this declaration - that I do not care whether it is to be a double dissolution or a single dissolution, I am prepared to meet whatever emergency may arise, believing that when the dissolution, single or double, is past and gone, there will be very few Conservatives left in this Chamber, and probably many less in another place. The Government are also going to introduce a Bill to re-establish the postal vote. </para>

                            <para>- Not if my vote will prevent it. In connexion with that Bill, I shall take up the negative position that I have adopted in connexion with postal voting on every occasion the matter has arisen. If I can be assured that some system can be arranged which will give sick people a vote without affording the extraordinary opportunities for abuse that were afforded by the postal voting system in force some years ago, I shall be prepared to consider very seriously any such proposition ; but I candidly confess that so far I have not been able to see any method that is likely to prove effective in that regard. The moment I am able to see it, I am prepared to adopt it, but I shall never be a party to adopting a system of voting by post that will lay our electoral law open to such tremendous abuses as existed when the system was previously in operation. The Government would have been better advised if they had faced both positions that I have indicated in a manly way, and with a bold fighting front, and had declared that at the instance of one or two men - one, I believe - they were opposed to trade unionism tooth and nail, every vestige of it, not only to preference to unionists, which is a mere get behind, but also to the right of. working men to organize, and that their real object was the impossible task of abolishing the organization of the workers. In that case, they would never have come forward with such a blithering thing as the measure they have submitted to Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> as well as the Prime Minister, has had a very close connexion with trade unionism, but all that is past and gone. I do not think the people of Australia will mistake the real meaning of the present attitude of Ministers. Surely the people will realize that the fight of the Government is not against preference to unionists, but against the right of a unionist to exist at all. The Government do not want unionists; they want men who. as individuals, will be continually at their beck and call, without any organization or power of concentration. Above all things, they want to wreck everything in the nature of organization which is likely to be. effective at the ballot-box. Why do not the Government say straight out, &#34; We want to do away with the Arbitration Courts, and take out of the Act the very provision for which your leaders, and, in fact, the leaders of every party in the House, have fought.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin, Mr. Reid, Mr. Watson,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> all came to an agreement on the question of preference to unionists, and the insertion of that section in the Act was practically a triumph of the unity of those three parties on that question. </para>

                    <para class="block">Act possesses. So, too, in regard to the postal voting; why do the Government not come straight out with a proposal to amend the whole Electoral Act? Why not bring forward that Act which they put into the waste-paper basket last session? At the very first sound of adverse criticism, they dropped the Bill like a hot spud, and it has not been seen or heard of since. Now they come along with a little meek sort of a thing called a Bill for the restoration of postal voting. What do they want it for? Only to restore the opportunities for abuse and the possibilities for men and women practising wrong-doing in their electoral operations. That is all that the Government are seeking now, and I hope it will not be long before both of those measures reach us, because I am very anxious to treat them in the same way as I did on a previous occasion. </para>

                            <para>.- We have often heard the superstitious saying that thirteen is an&#34; unlucky number, and it seems to me that the number &#34;thirteen&#34; on this document, which is called the Governor-General&#39;s Speech, is likely to become an unlucky number for the gentlemen who at present occupy the Ministerial bench. Honorable senators may have noticed that, during the last few days, the journal whose support is largely responsible for the present Government being in power has begun to beat its own joss; and, whilst many of us find it difficult to follow that journal, which we admit to be powerful in influencing and moulding public opinion in this State, at least, we must admit that some of the criticisms passed on Ministers within the last few days are certainly deserved. I speak as a Protectionist. </para>

                                <para>- If the honorable senator can get any change out of it, I will admit that I was not satisfied with the attitude of the Labour Government in regard to Protection, and the honorable senator knows that many members supporting his Government are not satisfied with what the present Ministry are doing. Since 1901, the people of Australia have, time after time declared that there should be a thoroughly effective Protective policy for Australia. Yet, what do we find when we look at the statistics available to the end of last year ? I have taken the trouble to cull a list of the chief articles of import during the last two years, and, whilst I admit that for the year ended 31st December, 1913, some of the main lines of imports show a decrease as compared with 1912, I contend, and I am satisfied that the majority of Australians will agree, that that decrease is not great enough. We have been long enough established as a Federation, with power to impose a thoroughly Protective policy for Australia, to have reduced that volume of imports in far larger measure than we have done. I find that, in the year 1913, the value of goods imported into Australia totalled &#163;79,743,540, whilst, for the year 1912, the imports were valued at &#163;78,158,000, an increase in 1913 of over &#163;1,000,000. </para>

                                <para>- It is instructive to pick out a few of the items which comprise the main imports. Boots and shoes, other than goloshes, sandshoes, and other rubber boots, to the value of &#163;433,000 were imported in 1912, whilst, in 1913, the value was &#163;495,000, an increase of about &#163;62,000 in the value of imports in that one line of goods alone. </para>

                                <para>- The Minister of Defence is trying to draw the proverbial red herring across the trail. I find that in the imports of piece goods : woollens, flannels, there was a decrease of about &#163;1,000 for the year 1913, the value being &#163;16,756 as against &#163;17,719 for the previous year. There was also a small decrease in the importations of blankets and blanketing for 1913 as compared, with the imports for 1912, the value being &#163;35,869 and &#163;42,656 respectively. Rugs, n.e.i., likewise showed a decrease. I come now to a large item of apparel - that of hats and caps - in respect of which we ought to have a very big local production. In 1912, however, &#163;447,800 worth were imported, whilst last year the value of the imports was &#163;503,482, an .increase of nearly &#163;56,000. Our imports of apparels of fur in 1912 were valued at &#163;69,853, whereas in 1913 they increased to &#163;76,525. The imports of apparel and attire, n.e.i., in 1912 amounted to &#163;1,978,770, whereas the figures for last year were &#163;1,875,231. I am pleased to notice that the local production in this line of manufacture has increased, although to only a small extent. In the local production of boots and shoes in 1912 there was an increase of about &#163;100,000 as compared with the returns for the previous year, the figures for 1911 being &#163;3,713,948 as against &#163;3,819,371 for 1912. The apparent advance, however, is largely accounted for by the increase in the prices of raw material, and, to some extent, by the increased rates of wages. The local production of woollen, cotton, and tweed mills in 1911 was &#163;860,789, whereas in 1912 the value increased to &#163;930,485. The increase also is to be largely accounted for by the increased price of raw materials and the increased rates of wages. The local production of hats and caps in 1912 was valued at &#163;830,746, as compared with &#163;768,416 for the previous year. The full figures for last year are not yet to hand. Coming to clothing, tailoring and slop goods, we find that in 1912 the value of the local production was &#163;5,807,431 as against &#163;5,486,388 in 1911. There was a small advance in the local output of dressmaking and millinery, but the increase in the cost of raw material and wages will account for it. The same remark will apply to the figures relating to ties and scarfs. There is only one other item to which I desire to refer in detail, and it is one that is of vast importance to Australia. The great timber industry has not received the encouragement that it deserves. It extends over the greater part of the Commonwealth, and gives employment to large numbers of people.; but the volume of our imports of softwoods and hardwoods is much larger than it should be, having regard to the magnificent variety and the extent of our timber resources. </para>

                                <para>- The present Government are looking forward with &#34; great hope &#34; to the efforts of the Inter state Commission. We are to receive the reports of the Commission &#34; later on &#34; - not this year but later on, in years to come. According to the Prime Minister and the Minister of Trade and Customs, we cannot expect to obtain any progress report from the Inter-State Commission. It would be improper, we are told, to interfere with thai tribunal in any way. But I take it there would be no  impropriety  in asking for progress reports, to enable this Parliament from time to time to rectify Tariff anomalies. This Parliament, after all, is the tribunal which will have to deal with the Tariff when the recommendations of the Commission are to hand. In voting for the Inter-State Commission Bill I recognised that one of the duties of the Commission would be to inquire into Tariff matters, but I did not imagine for a moment that it would not only have assigned to it practically the duty of framing a Tariff, but the power to say that there should be no alteration of it until it saw fit to report. The present Government, however, have stated freely that the Commission cannot be interfered with, and that we cannot expect to receive any progress  reports  until evidence has been taken in all the States. Having regard to its present rate of progress, and the infinite variety of details into which it is inquiring, I do not think we shall receive, for at least two years, any reports that will enable us to rectify anomalies. </para>

There are many men in our gaols, for having obtained goods on false pretences, who are. not more guilty of fraud than are Ministers, in a politica-1 sense, for this attempt to obtain a double dissolution. If seems to me that we shall hear no more cries from our friends the Conservatives about the need for preserving- State rights. When the Labour party, in open and candid fashion, asked the people to grant this Parliament larger powers, we were told that we were infringing State rights and encroaching on home rule. The few representatives of the smaller States in this Senate who sit behind the Government must admit that they are now in a pretty tight corner. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> wants to know why, if there is nothing in these Bills, the Labour party is fighting them. The real- question at issue ia much greater than any raised by the Bills, or than the question which party shall occupy the Treasury bench. The Australian Constitution provides for a Federation; our political system is not a Unification. Yet those who a short time back accused the Labour party of desiring Unification are to-day taking a long step in its direction by endeavouring to secure a double dissolution by means of these Bills. To-day we hear nothing from them about State rights. The rights of this Senate, which is the constitutional guardian of the rights of the States, are surely worthy of consideration. The Attorney-General, speaking a few days ago at Sandringham, as the legal mouth-piece of the Government, showed clearly his opinions on this subject. He said - </para>

Many other leading political spirits of the time were with him. What we want to know is, how do public men stand now ? Do Ministers subscribe to the doctrine that there should not be equal representation of the States in the Senate? Those who represent the larger States may hold that view, but would Senators Keating, Bakhap, and demons support it? To resume my quotation - </para>

                                <para>- Yes, later in the year. I have never shrieked very much about State rights. I have never been wedded to the doctrine about which our honorable friends on the other side had so much to say during the last referendum - the sacredness of State rights. We have heard that cry particularly in Tasmania, but I have never said very much about the question, because to me, Federal rights have always been greater than State rights. In considering the question of a double dissolution, there are three points to be considered by a representative of a smaller State, who recognises that at present Australia is a Federation and not a Unification, and who recognises, too, that if the Government can get a double dissolution on issues which they admit are practically of no great importance to many people in Australia, any future Government without a working majority, and relying on the Speaker&#39;s casting vote in one House, and with an overwhelming majority against them in the other place, can bring about a double dissolution in just the same way. Because, as was truly said in another place, we are travelling in an uncharted sea in this connexion. If the Senate can be dissolved on such trumpery issues as these in the present circumstances - and that to me is a greater point than even the importance or unimportance of the issues - at the wish of the party in office, though not in power, in another place, a precedent will be established, and, naturally, it will be followed when similar circumstances arise in the future. This Parliament, as well as the representatives of the smaller States, ought to consider three points. The first point is: Should the strict letter only of the Constitution be considered - that a Bill has to be twice passed by the House of Representatives, and twice rejected by the Senate, as the conditions precedent to the grant of a double dissolution - or, in addition, should not what is known as the alleged spirit of the Constitution also be taken into consideration ? The second point, which seems to me to be one of more importance, is : Should a Ministry without a working majority in one House, and with a majority against it in the other House, be able to obtain a dissolution of the Senate in any circumstances, seeing that it does not represent a majority of the people of Australia? There can be no manner of reasoning brought forward by our honorable friends opposite which could satisfy a fair-minded man that the Government have the support of a majority of the people. </para>

                                <para>- It is all very well for the Minister of Defence to indulge in a cheap jeer or sneer of that kind. We have had that sort of thing for some time; but it does not get away from the fact that the Government cannot by any manner of reasoning say that they have behind them a majority of the people of Australia. As recently as last May, the people, when they were asked to return seventy-five members to one House, returned thirty-seven on one side and thirty-eight on the other. If the figures are added up correctly, the addition will show, I think, that the people voting for the thirty-seven representatives on one side totalled &#39; rather more than those who voted for the thirty-eight on the other side. </para>

                                    would not have continued to retain office for a month under such humiliating circumstances that he would have had to depend upon the casting vote of a gentleman who hitherto has been looked upon as a judge to hold the balance fairly between parties. The Leader of the Government has to buttress his arguments in different parts of the country by making statements that lead people to ask, &#34; What does the Prime Minister intend to convey?&#34; He admitted in a speech reported in the newspapers during the recess that the Government were able to carry on last session only by straining the Standing Orders, and I affirm that, no matter how many things that may be considered harsh have been said by members of the Labour party in Parliament or out of it, nothing so harsh in effect has ever been uttered by a member of that party as that utterance by the Prime Minister. No reflection so serious as that has been made against the gentleman who occupies a position which, from time immemorial in the Parliament from which we have taken our usages and customs, has been held to be high above party fighting.

The Leader of the Labour party would not have hung on to office under such circumstances.

The Government got them through the House of Representatives on the first occasion last session only by outraging the practices of Parliament, and by using the gag in a way that no Parliament in the British Dominions has ever been gagged before, after, by means of a side issue, getting rid of one member of the Opposition from the Chamber. They then sent them up here, and so got the first stage towards a double dissolution. On the face of it, this is an attempt on their part to alter the&#39; Constitution.

Tasmania would never have been in it if it had been a Unification at first, nor would any other small State. Western Australia, which, numerically, is not much larger than Tasmania, would not have come into the Union had it not been for equal representation in the Senate; and yet, for a passing party advantage, which may not last a year, the great professed States righters in the Government are seeking to destroy the power of the Senate; because it will be most effectively destroyed if the Senate can be dissolved at any time on such trumpery issues as those involved in these so-called test Bills, which do nothing, and will be of no benefit whatever to the people. Even if they did involve principles of great moment to the people, it would still destroy the power of the Senate if a Government with a chance majority of only one in the Speaker&#39;s chair in the House of Representatives, and with a majority of four to one against it in this Chamber, elected by the same people, could bring about a dissolution of the Senate at any time. </para>

                                <para>- I did not know it. The honorable senator is supporting a Government which is professedly trying to destroy the Senate by taking away its power. I accept his assurance that that happens to be one of the contingencies attached to party government, and am willing to admit that the honorable senator is not, and would not be, a party to take away the principle of equal representation. He is only supporting the Government because, I suppose, he thinks there are other things in their programme that are of greater importance. </para>

He feels that he is in bad company now, from the point of view of the interests of the States. I wish to refer briefly to the principle involved in the Bill relating to unionists in Government employment. We have just witnessed the departure from Australia for a well-earned holiday of the gentleman who has presided for some years over the Arbitration Court. I am sure that a large majority of the people agree with me that no public official ever better deserved or earned a holiday than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, and he was quite justified in referring with natural pride to the work of the Court in his last utterance in the Court. </para>

                                <para>- He referred, with pardonable pride, to the magnificent work which the Court has been able to do under his presidency. We can only hope that his successor for the time being, or his permanent successor if it should so happen, will apply himself to the work with the same assiduity and thoroughness as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins has done. One important feature of the work of the Court is what is known as the compulsory conference. We cannot appraise the value of the Court if we merely say how many industrial disputes it has settled after those disputes have arisen. We must ask ourselves how many strikes have been averted by the work of the Court under the compulsory conference sections - work which the public does not see or hear so much about. On the eve of the Christmas festivities, for instance, a serious strike was threatened amongst the bakers, over the long-standing question of baking at night or in the daytime; and the dispute had arrived at a stage at which it seemed a certainty that there would be a strike, at least in Melbourne, if not in both Melbourne and Sydney; but a compulsory conference immediately convened by the  President  of the Court did splendid work, and averted what would have been a strike affecting most seriously all the people in and around this great city. That is only one instance among many in which the compulsory conference provisions have done splendid work. It is often claimed by members of our party, and rightly so, that no award of the Arbitration Court made under the presidency of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins has been broken by the employes. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> apparently does not believe that statement. I admit that the claim we make, that no award given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins has been broken by the employes, is disputed by the other side. </para>

I do not justify any body of men who break an award of the Arbitration Court, but I say that where the employes have done so they have done so in the light of day, and where the employers have broken awards, as they have done in several instances, they have done so in the most effective way by taking advantage of the financial strength of their organizations to prosecute appeals from awards of the Court. </para>

                                <para>- I leave the question of preference to unionists with the remark that, whilst Ministers have been declaiming that they will not give preference to any persons in the Commonwealth employ, they have shown that they are not above giving preferences in the letting of railway contracts. Several speakers have gone into detail in connexion with the letting of the Teesdale Smith contract, in connexion with which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith was given a preference. I shall pass that subject with the brief comment that, in my opinion, the letting of the contract was due to the absolute incompetence of. the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs, who was . taken down by the contractor. A schoolboy would have known better than to have assented to what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly</inline> assented to without looking into the question. The Prime Minister is responsible in this matter, because he is the Minister of Home Affairs, whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly</inline> is only an Honorary Minister. If ever an administrative act showed utter incompetence on the part of the Minister responsible for it, it was the act of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly</inline> in signing that contract without looking into it, and without arming himself with the information which any practical or reasonable man would have insisted upon having before he signed it. One of the most prominent cries used by the party opposite at the last election, and one which greatly assisted in their return to power, had reference to the rural workers&#39; log. Something fresh on the subject of the rural workers&#39; log came to light the other day. </para>

                                <para>- Yes. It was used during the last election as an instrument with which to torture the poor farmers. It became a nightmare to them. They felt it rolling over them in their beds, and felt themselves being flattened out and crushed by the tyranny of the Rural Workers Association. It would have been a good thing, not only for the rural workers, but for the farmers, if the claims made by the Rural Workers Union could have been threshed out before the Arbitration Court. It would have been found, had that been done, that a large majority of rural workers wanted only a fair thing, and, while there would, no doubt, be some exceptions, it would also have been found that a majority of the farmers are quite prepared to do the fair thing by their employes. It is a good thing for our honorable friends opposite, in view of a possible appeal to the electors, that the rural workers&#39; log has not yet been settled. It proved an effective scarecrow at the last election, and our friends have no wish to see it removed. We heard the other day that some interesting evidence was taken by the Fruit Commission from rural employers at Mildura, and I can quote from an instructive article on the subject, in which it is reported that the employers have actually admitted that they have got more effective work done since they have been paying wages under an award made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, and it is further admitted that the aggregate cost of production has not increased. I direct the attention of honorable senators to the following statement : - </para>

                            <para>As is generally known, the arbitration award of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins has fixed the wages for harvesting the extensive fruit crop of Mildura at a minimum of 8s. per day for labourers over 18, working 8 hours per day. In the case of dippermen, barrowmen, &#38;c, the wages are 9s. per day of 8 hours, while the 8s. minimum applies to females in the harvesting operations as well as men. </para>

                            <para>These wages have now been in operation for some time, and the result is interesting. It has always been the contention of unionists that increased wages and lesser hours do not necessarily increase the cost of production ; but, on the contrary, it has been correctly contended that with better wages and conditions, a class of more efficient workers has been induced to take up these callings that hitherto paid low wages, and in consequence not only more work, but a better class of work, resulted, while it was done in eight hours instead of twelve hours as previously. </para>

                            of Tasmania, on the question, as follows :  - &#34;You stated that the cost of harvesting and drying fruit was &#163;6 per ton. How many years has the price been &#163;6 per ton? - I have contracted at that price 12 or 14 years ago. &#34; Then, really, the labour cost of harvesting and drying fruit has not increased during the last decade? - It has increased very little, if any, because we have better methods of doing the work than we had then. &#34; So that in spite of the fact that your wages have gone up 33 per cent. for men, and from 100 to200 per cent. for women, the cost of harvesting and drying your fruit has not increased? - It has not increased to any extent. As I have said, we have better methods of doing the work, and I also think we have a better class of men to do our work, taking them on the whole. It pays a good man to come along and do the work; he is well paid for doing it. &#34;Has your experience been that higher wages mean higher efficiency ? - In that respect there is no doubt it is so.&#34;

                                <para>- I do not forget it. But when that same Liberal Government were asked by the Labour Opposition of Tasmania to transfer the whole of their business to the Commonwealth Bank they said that the time was not opportune. Within four weeks of the advent of a Labour Ministry to power in that State the whole of the Government business has been transferred to the Commonwealth. Why? Because they believe in building up and strengthening the Commonwealth Bank, which they regard as the principal bank in Australia. They have set the pace, and I hope we shall find the Governments of other States following in their footsteps at an early date. Not only have they transferred their business to the Commonwealth Bank, but they have been able to secure better terms than they formerly enjoyed. Under the arrangement which previously existed with a private bank in Tasmania, the Government of that State were able to overdraw only to the extent of about &#163;40,000. If they required more they had to ask for it as a favour. But under the arrangement which has been made with the Commonwealth Bank the Tasmanian Government can overdraw to the extent of &#163;100,000, and, moreover, they get the money at one-half per cent. less than they formerly paid. They get it for 4&#189; per cent., whereas previously they were required to pay 5 per cent. On the question of defence, I would like the Minister of Defence and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to put their heads together, and, in consultation with some of the chief officers of our Defence Forces, endeavour to evolve a system which will shorten the term of service of trainees. Of course, we are pledged to the principle of compulsory training. I have been an advocate of that principle for many years - long before it was mooted in this Chamber. But we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that its adoption has aroused a good deal of opposition amongst the community. </para>

I suggest that it might be possible to make the training less irksome than it is. When we realize the enormous number of trainees that we have we  must  admit that the number who are disaffected is very small indeed. </para>

However, I have heard it suggested by many friends of the system that it might be possible to close the term of service a year or two earlier. I admit I have not gone very carefully into the matter, but, as a supporter of the system, who will be glad to see his own boy under training, I throw out the suggestion. </para>

                                    said something about the Meat Trust and the rural workers&#39; log being a &#34; good double&#34;; but all that the Labour party have had to say about the Meat Trust in the last few years the honorable senator and his party are saying now, or will say shortly. They are realizing that what the Labour party pointed out a couple of years ago has come to pass, and that the Meat Trust is here. The best evidence of the changed attitude on the part of the Liberal party is that the Government propose to introduce a Bill to deal with trusts, though I am reminded by an honorable senator near me that the measure will, in all probability, prove just as efficacious as a mustard plaster on a wooden leg. If the promised Bill is to do no more than amend the present anti-trust Act, we must remember that any such measure, under the Constitution as at present, will in all likelihood be found to be absolutely powerless.

                                <para>- Yes; and I do not think it is very difficult to connect  these two items of news with, the fact that there is a trust operating here. We are told that the Victorian Government also intend to introduce legislation to deal with this trust; and, I suppose, the example will be followed by the Governments of those States who are adverse to handing over additional powers to the Commonwealth. In my opinion, it will be found in a few years, when it is too late to effectively curb the operations of the trust, that the State Acts are ineffective, as they have been found to be in the United States of America. We cannot shut our eyes to what is taking place in America ; and these State Acts will prove about as useful as the waving of a scented handkerchief in order to banish the aroma of a pigstye. If the Labour party have to answer the charge that we are wasting the time of Parliament because&#39; we are putting up a strenuous fight against the test measures, it will not be difficult to show that the blame rests with the Liberal party, who, after twelve months of office, have absolutely failed to introduce one measure calculated to benefit, in&#39; the slightest degree, the people, of Australia.  His  Excellency&#39;s Speech is. an absolutely empty document. Before the Government bring forward their programme, which is somewhere in the dim and misty future, they desire to take steps, by dissolving Parliament, to put it out of the power of the Legislature to deal with measures of any kind. The Government have been weighed, and found wanting, and when an opportunity is given on a question on which tie people can form an opinion, that verdict will be returned. The Government have shown themselves utterly incompetent in administration and utterly barren of legislation. The people are asking the Prime Minister and the Minister of Trade and Customs for an effective Tariff - asking why we pay &#163;78,000,000 a year for imported goods, half of which might well be made by our own artisans - and the answer is that the Inter-State Commission is dealing with the matter, and that, when the reports of that body are forthcoming, proposals will be made for the revision of the Tariff. The people of Australia have said to the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs, who is in charge of big national works, &#34; There are railways to be built and extensive works to be undertaken; but, though we recognise that it will be years before they can be made to pay, you are to build them as cheaply as you can.&#34; And the Minister&#39;s only reply is: &#34;I shall do away with the system of day labour which has saved Queensland &#163;2,000 a mile as against the contract system of building railways, and I shall institute the beautiful, old, worn-out system of contracting.&#34; The people of Tasmania have said to the Postmaster-General, &#34; Give us a better steamer service, something like an efficient service, between Tasmania and the mainland, so that we may have a chance of getting speedy transit of mails and passengers, and an opportunity to carry goods to and from the State at a fairly reasonable cost, and thus put ns on the same basis as people in other States.&#34; And the answer to that is, &#34; Yes; we shall tie you up to another seven years of the present HuddartParker Combine,&#34; though the only way of doing it is to have a Commonwealth line of steamers running between Tasmania and the mainland. </para>

                                <para>- Our Government were engaged for a number of years in big national matters, which they put on the statute-book, and there would have been .a Commonwealth line of steamers running now had not the people of Australia made a mistake at the last election. Then we come to that great national asset, the Northern Territory  -  if it is not now an asset it will be to our children in the future - and the people say to the Minister of External Affairs, &#34; This Territory is an incubus on the taxpayer; try to get a move on and induce settlers to go there.&#34; And the answer of the Minister of External Affairs is, .&#34; We have a number of things under consideration. We have discharged a few officials put there to lay the foundation of work in the future. They were put there by the Labour Government, and we have discharged them.&#34; That is all the answer we get. And so it is with all the Departments. The present Government, in the matter of administration, or incompetency of administration, and barrenness of legislation, have been weighed and found wanting. </para>
