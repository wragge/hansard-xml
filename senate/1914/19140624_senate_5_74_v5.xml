                        <para>- In another place the Prime Minister was asked on Thursday last when it was expected that the Victorian, amongst other, rolls would be printed and ready for circulation, and he said it was anticipated that the Victorian rolls would be available within a month&#39;s time. That reply means, if it means anything, that the rolls for Victoria will be printed and ready for circulation about the 20th July next. Can the Vice-President of the Executive Council state what time will be available to enable people to get on the rolls between their publication and the date of the issue of the writs ? Further, can he say what is meant by the statement of the Prime Minister that the names of the persons objected to will be printed and open for inspection - what names are referred to? Are objections to be taken after the printing and circulation of the latest rolls, or are they to be in respect of names on the old rolls? </para>

Will a month elapse before the Victorian rolls are completed, so far as printing and being ready for circulation are concerned? That is a plain simple question. The honorable senator is in charge of the Electoral Office, and ought to be in a position to answer my question. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> said on Friday night - </para>

The police have reported that that number of persons are not living in the subdivision for which they are enrolled, and inquiry is being made as to whether they are still living in the division of Cook, Objections will only be lodged in cases where the officers have reasonable ground for believing that the persons concerned have ceased to live in the division for a period of not less than one month, and are not merely temporarily absent. </para>

                        <para>- The Prime Minister is reported to have stated at Tamworth, on Monday evening, in justification of the letting of a contract to Teesdale Smith, without tenders being called, that the previous Administration led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> had entered into a contract for the supply of wireless and the erection of wireless stations by a certain firm in New South Wales without calling for tenders. Will the Vice-President of the Executive Council call the Prime Minister&#39;s attention to the inaccuracy of his statement, and also inform him that the contract was entered into between the Fisher Government and that particular manufacturing company because it was the only company of the kind in Australia capable of undertaking that class of work ? Will the Minister be good enough to convey this information to the Prime Minister so that he may not fall into the error again ? </para>

                        <para>- I wish to ask the Minister of Defence a question, without notice, following upon a question I addressed to him last Thursday, in connexion with the recent shipwreck off Point Nepean. The captain of the wrecked vessel stated in an interview with a representative of the press that an officer at the fort had treated some shipwrecked sailors in a very unkind way. I asked the question in justice to the officer at the fort, and the Minister promised to make inquiries into the matter. I wish to know now whether he is in a position to give me a reply to the question? </para>

                        <para>The officer referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> is a young bombardier, viz., Bombardier Hennessy. </para>
                        <para>This non-commissioned officer was in charge of the picquet at the entrance gate, Fort Queenscliff, on the night of the wreck. At 12 midnight the light over the gate was extinguished as usual. Some time after this, a knock came at the gate, and Bombardier Hennessy went to the gate, and, looking through the iron grating, could not see any one at first, and no one answered his query as to who was there for some time. A man he could just barely see, owing to the extreme darkness of the night, commenced to mumble in a strange tongue. Bombardier Hennessy thought that either a practical joke was being played on him, or the man was a drunken tramp. He did not recognise the fact that the man was speaking in a foreign tongue, but thought it was &#34; put on.&#34; The idea of shipwreck did not cross the mind of Bombardier Hennessy, and there was nothing to suggest it. The darkness prevented his seeing how the man was dressed, as he could only just discern the outline of a man through the grating. He opened the wicket gate to look, but still thought the man was a practical joker, or drunk, and told him to go away. He then shut the gate. Had he known that the man was one of a party of shipwrecked Bailors, be would immediately have taken steps to relieve their distress. </para>

                        <para>- I have noticed the matters to which the honorable senator has referred, and also that the proposal to increase freights is largely on those lines of communication between Tasmania and the mainland which are not covered by any mail contract. I cannot say whether any overtures have been made by the company, but have no hesitation in assuring the Senate that, so far as I have anything to do with the mail contract, in no circumstances whatever will it be broken. One of the most important conditions of the contract was that there should be no increase in fares or freights during its continuance without the consent of the Postmaster-General. I cannot pledge the Postmaster-General, but am prepared to pledge myself, for all that I can do, and any influence that I can bring to bear, to see that no alteration is made with my consent. </para>

At the time the contract for the carriage of mails between the mainland and Launceston and Burnie was entered into, I made inquiries and endeavoured to ascertain if, in order to prevent any increase in fares and freights, it would he worth while, for that purpose only, to obtain other contracts, say, between Hobart and Sydney, my one idea being then that, if we had a mail contract, we could stop any increase of fares and freights between any port in Tasmania and the mainland. </para>

In reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Oakes,</inline> I may say that it is well known that the regulation to which he has directed attention was in existence before I went to the Defence Department. </para>

                            <para>- There were two regulations in force when I went to the Department, and it is under those regulations that the recent case, of which so much has been heard in this chamber, occurred. In the first place, there is in the Defence Act itself a provision that defaulters may be ordered to &#34; prescribed places&#34; of detention. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> who was Minister at the time, made Queenscliff and other military barracks &#34; prescribed places &#34; for the purpose of that section. These places were under a set of rules and regulations, and every cadet who went into them was subject to the rules and regulations which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> had prescribed. </para>

                    <para>I am advised further that to accede to the request contained in your Address would imply a recognition of a right in the Senate to make the Ministers of State for the Commonwealth directly responsible to that Chamber for ad- . vice tendered to the Governor-General in relation to the exercise of an Executive power vested in him by the terms of the Constitution, and that such a recognition would not be in accordance with the accepted principles of responsible government. </para>
                    <para>Without, however, conceding the existence of any Constitutional obligation to reply to the request contained in your Address, I desire to add for your information, and with the concurrence of my Ministers, that the grounds on which I decided to dissolve both Houses of Parliament simultaneously appear from the communication already made by the Prime Minister with my permission and by my authority to the House of Representatives. </para>

                        <para>. - Surely the Government, who are so anxious to get to the country, are not going to adjourn the Senate now! We have been put in the position of appearing to hold up business, and here we are asked to adjourn. The Government have on the notice-paper a Defence Bill, and we could well go on with its consideration. We might get on, too, with some of their promises to the farmers. There are other things which could be done if the Government would only press the business. We have come all the way over from Sydney. The Government might have sent an intimation to us if they did not intend to carry on any business to-day. We could have remained away had we been notified to that effect. </para>

                        <para>. - I desire to get a little information, if possible, from the Minister of Defence in connexion with the subject-matter of one or two questions I addressed to him last week about the horse allowance to certain warrant and noncommissioned officers of the Instructional Staff in South Australia. I have received a reply containing a recommendation of the Military Board, and an intimation that the Minister has approved of the recommendation. I wish the Minister to explain what the recommendation means. If I briefly state the case, honorable senators will be better able to understand the position. I have been furnished with the following statement of the case, which is briefly a history of the question since the horse allowance was stopped during last year: - </para>

                        <para>The regulations governing the payment of horse allowance to warrant and noncommissioned officers of the Instructional Staff prescribe that those instructors who were in receipt of horse allowance prior to the 1st November, 1910, shall, provided they are required to provide a horse, continue to draw an allowance of &#163;30 per annum. </para>
                        <para>Other instructors, when required to be mounted, to be provided with a horse by the Department, or through a contractor, and not draw the allowance.

                        <para>Garrison Sergeant-Major Marshall, Warrant Officers Denniston and Read, and Staff Sergeant-Major Martin, of the Instructional Staff, South Australia, were in receipt of the allowance of &#163;30 per annum above referred to; but in June last the Commandant directed that the horse allowance for Marshall, Denniston, and Read should cease from 1st September, 1913, and in October directed that the horse allowance for Martin should cease from 1st December, 1913, on the ground that their work was chiefly administrative, and that the value of their parades at which they appeared mounted on their own horses provided at their own expense during the previous twelve months, if paid for at ordinary rates of hire, fell a good deal below the amounts paid as horse allowance. </para>
                        <para>The warrant and non-commissioned officers concerned protested against the withdrawal of the allowance as not being in accordance with the regulations. </para>
                        <para>On 21st November, 1913, Head-quarters issued a circular providing that the horse allowance of &#163;30 per annum should, from the 1st January, 1914, only be granted to those warrant and non-commissioned officers eligible under the regulations to draw such allowance, who actually own a horse suitable for military work. </para>
                        <para>On 23rd January, 1914, the Acting Commandant, South Australia, after reviewing the matter, informed the District Paymaster that the notification stopping the payment of the allowance to the warrant and non-commissioned officers concerned should be rescinded, and that the allowance should be paid as if no such notification had been issued. The District Paymaster, however, declined to pay without finance authority. </para>
                        <para>On 2nd March, 1914, the Commandant accordingly applied for finance authority. </para>
                        <para>On 21st April, 1914, in reply to a memorandum from Sec., Commandant states that the garrison sergeant-major is very rarely required to perform mounted duty, and that the expenditure of horse allowance for the garrison sergeant-major is scarcely justifiable. </para>
                        <para>He also states that Warrant Officer Denniston, since 1st July, 1913, has been mounted at three light-horse camps of eight days each - twenty-four days, one light-horse school of ten days; one squadron camp of four days, and a few ordinary parades. </para>

                    <para>I now come to the recommendation of the Military Board, which is so vague that it really does not recommend anything definite. It is as follows - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Financial Regulation 93 (5) (f) states - </para>
                        <para>If in receipt of such an allowance from the date of coming into force of this regulation (1st November, 1910), a warrant or non-commissioned officer of the Instructional Staff required to provide a horse shall continue to draw horse allowance at the rate of &#163;30 per annum. </para>
                        <para class="block">That is clear and definite enough, but it goes on to say - </para>
                        <para>The foregoing places upon the Commandant the responsibility of determining whether a warrant or non-commissioned officer will be required to provide a horse, and in the event of his deciding the question in the negative, it is clear that the warrant or non-commissioned officer is not entitled to receive the horse allowance. </para>
                        <para>In June, 1913, the then Commandant, after due consideration, determined that Staff Sergeant-Major Marshall and Warrant Officers Denniston and Read, should, from the 1st September, not be required to provide a horse; and in October he similarly determined that from the 1st December following, Staff Sergeant-Major Martin should also not be required to provide a horse. The names of these Instructors were accordingly removed from the list of those to receive horse allowance. </para>
                        <para>The Board considers the Commandant was justified in this decision, unless any one of the instructors concerned could prove that he personally owned a horse, certified as fit, suitable and available, and that the ordinary duties of his position necessitated his being mounted. In such a case the Board considers that the Commandant should have determined that the men were required to provide themselves with a horse whereby they would be entitled to receive the consideration as authorized by Financial Regulation 93 (5) (/). </para>

                <para class="block">The Military Board do not really say definitely whether the allowance has been stopped. They do not say that these officers do not possess horses, and they give no reason why the recommendation of the present Commandant should not be acted upon or taken into consideration as well as the recommendation of the late Commandant, who, at the time he made it, was a very sick man, and died very shortly afterwards. It seems to me on the face of the papers that for some reason or another the paymaster over there is determined that these warrant and non-commissioned officers shall not be given horse allowance. </para>

                        <para>- I have shown from the statement I have read that for thirty-eight days in each year, and in addition a few ordinary parades, these men have to perform their duties, and that should be sufficient to entitle them to be supplied with horses. Whether honorable senators are military authorities or not, it must be clear to them that if an instructor is required to be mounted on parade, he should have a suitable horse. If he has a- horse of his own, it will be trained; it will know him, and will probably know the drill as well as he does himself. If he is compelled to go to a stable to hire any old crock people like to give him, he will be very much hampered in giving instruction, because the horse may be unmanageable. Many, if not all, of these drill instructors are men getting up in years, and it is not fair to ask a middle-aged man to ride any half -broken horse that the keeper of a livery stable may supply. I personally know that one of these officers - though I do not know which of them - bought a horse for which he paid  &#163;25,  and in order that he might be able to look after it properly he purchased an allotment of land at a cost of &#163;100. After incurring all this expense, this new regulation comes along, and the man finds himself debarred from receiving the horse allowance which he previously received. He very naturally objects to the allowance being taken from him when it was distinctly provided for by the military regulations operating when he joined the force. It is a downright injustice that when officers join the force under regulations having the effect of law providing for the payment of certain allowances on compliance with certain conditions, a new Minister of Defence or officer of the Department can deprive them of the allowances which they have earned by providing horses for themselves, without any recompense for the expense to which they have been put, such as in one of the cases mentioned, the purchase of a block of land on which to give the horse a run. I have some figures here showing the cost of keeping a horse in Adelaide. This is the estimate of a man who kept a horse there and knows really what it costs.  -  &#163;18 per year feed; &#163;13 for rent and stabling; &#163;3, shoeing; clipping, &#38;c, 7/6; rug, 12/6. That is to say that it costs &#163;35 a year to keep  a  horse in Adelaide. The allowance they received was &#163;30 a year. Officers very much prefer to incur the additional expense of keeping a horse and drawing the &#163;30 allowance, so that they may be mounted upon suitable horses and will have no fear of being thrown, to being compelled to go to a livery stable to be mounted on horses that are entirely unsuitable. I wish the Minister to show, if he can, the justice of stopping this allowance which these officers were entitled to under the regulation in force in the service when they joined. Perhaps the honorable senator will say &#34;why the recommendation of the present Commandant was not taken into consideration by the Military Board in arriving at their .decision. </para>

                            <para>- I may be under a wrong impression. If I am, it is due to the vague nature of the recommendation of the Military Board, and I ask the Minister to explain what it means. The fact of the matter is that the officers there are suffering under a very real grievance, having been deprived of an allowance to which they are entitled. They have been endeavouring now for nearly nine months to get to the Minister to obtain some, definite reply as to what is to be the result of their protest. The present Commandant has recommended that the men should be mounted on their own horses when it is necessary for them to have them. </para>

                            <para>- The Acting Commandant - I assume that refers to the present Commandant in South Australia - after reviewing the matter, informed the District Paymaster that the notification stopping the payment of the amount to the warrant and non-commissioned officers should be rescinded, and the allowance paid as if no such notification had been issued. The District Paymaster, however, declined to pay without finance authority. The colonel of the regiment - Colonel Rowell - protested most strongly against the action of the paymaster in first refusing to pay the allowance and then putting what he characterized as most impertinent questions to the officers, wanting to know if they had a horse, whom they bought it from, and how much it had cost. This Colonel Rowell regarded as humiliating the officers and prying into their private business, and very properly interpolates that when these questions had been answered by the officers the paymaster, in all probability, would have wanted to know where they got the money to pay for the horses from. Colonel Rowell and the present Commandant are both of opinion that officers who are required to be mounted should have their own horses, and my reading of the recommendation of the Military Board, although it is vague, is that it supports the stoppage of the allowance. I shall be glad to hear from the Minister on the question. </para>

                        <para>.- I wish to express my displeasure and dissatisfaction with the answers given to two plain, simple questions on the notice-paper in my name to-day. I asked them of- the Minister representing the Minister of Home Affairs, and I say emphatically that the answers he read out were not answers at all. I saw a paragraph in the paper to the effect that, in all probability, an action for some thousands of pounds&#39; damages would be brought by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith against the Government for ignoring his contract. The honorable senator, in reply, referred me to some papers which, I believe, are contained in a printed document that has been for some time before the House. If the answers are in that document, ought not the Minister, as a matter of courtesy, to have supplied me with them from it? If, then, they were not to my satisfaction, or to the satisfaction of others who are just as much interested in the matter as I am, I could have followed it up. To say the least of it, it was discourteous to treat an honorable <inline font-style="italic">senator in</inline> the way that I was treated. The contract has caused a good deal of comment, and will cause a good deal more during the elections. It has been said that it was let under conditions not at all creditable to the Government, and that the contractor was treated in a way different from any other contractor in any part of Australia. It is alleged that the Government, who profess to have no time to offer preference to unionists, have in this case offered preference to pals, letting this man in in a way in which they would not let other contractors in. They let the contract without calling for tenders, and it is common rumour that the price he is being paid is such that he will make an immense sum of money, although he is employing unionists under union conditions. It is contract labour, but it is day labour all the same, plus the contract profits which are going into the hands of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith, and other contractors in other parts of Australia were not given the same opportunity as the Government gave him. Is there any likelihood of any action being brought by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith against the Government? Is there in the possession of any member of the Government any document that would indicate that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith, although he has done exceptionally well in respect of the contract, and . will continue to do so for the next few weeks, is, like Oliver Twist, wanting more, and bringing an action against the Government for damages for cutting out a portion of the contract which, according to what I have been told, he says he is entitled to carry out? Do the Government think that in the circumstances people will be satisfied with answers such as were given to me here to-day ? If there is nothing to hide, why try to hoodwink and blind the people? Everything in connexion with the contract should be open and above board. It was begun in darkness, and the Government are apparently anxious to cover up their tracks by withholding information of moment to every citizen. If contracts are to be let, we want to know how they are let, and what conditions are specified. If there is nothing in the possession of the Government to indicate that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith is dissatisfied, and if he has no intention to bring an action against them, why did not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> say so to-day? I enter my protest against these ambiguous answers to plain and simple questions. Unless more satisfactory and straightforward answers are given, I shall follow the matter up on another day. </para>

                        <para>.- The Vice-President of the Executive Council this afternoon read a series of answers to questions relating to the names of persons on the electoral rolls. In that connexion I would again call attention to the hand-hill headed, &#34; Cook&#39;s Latest,&#34; circulated last week in New South Wales, and containing the following statement: - &#34;The police are taking names off the rolls, but will put none on ; 75,000 Labour voters disfranchised.&#34; Much indignation has been expressed by honorable senators opposite with this circular, and yet I find from the answer to the question just referred to that in New South Wales there has been a considerable reduction in the total number of electors enrolled compared with 1913. In every other State there have been increases, perhaps smaller in proportion in some States than in others, but, according to the official figures, there have been over 87,000 names in New South Wales actually struck off the rolls from 1st July, 1913, to 1st May, 1914, and 88,000 names objected to during the same period. That is for only ten months of the year, leaving two months still to run. Adding the number of objections, which are likely to be much larger proportionately during those two months, it is safe to assume that there will be considerably over 100,000 objected to and probably struck off during that time. It may be said that deaths and removals justify action in a number of cases, but after making every allowance for these, it is still remarkable that in a State which has been in as flourishing and prosperous a condition as any other in the Commonwealth during the last year, remembering also that the numbers reaching the age of twenty-one and qualifying for a vote is very large each year, the number of electors enrolled, which was previously growing fast, should be actually less by 100,000 or more inside of twelve months. The fact goes to prove that we are speaking the absolute truth in saying that a concentrated effort is being made, especially in New South Wales, to disfranchise electors. No State has added to its population so quickly, and yet in no other State has there been an actual reduction in the number of electors. We have been- told with a tremendous amount of indignation by members supporting the Government in both Houses that the circular is an infamous lie, and one of the Labour party&#39;s dirty tricks; but there is ample evidence that the only organization largely engaged in the work of raising objections in order to get names struck off the rolls is the organization behind the Government, whose general secretary is hand-and-glove with the Prime Minister. He is everlastingly raising objections to electors, and many of these he knows nothing about himself. He is supplied with lists from the most outlying portions of the State by his subordinate pimps, who are scouring the country and endeavouring by the most infamous falsehoods and accusations to seduce the people from their &#34;Labour ideals. They are sending to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parkhill,</inline> the general secretary, lists of persons to whom they object, and he in turn is putting them in as objections without depositing the 5s. required by law. He is being openly supported in that breach of the law by the Prime Minister, who is acting as a bosom political friend of his. and consulting him whenever they have an opportunity of meeting. This is going on from week to week, and no wonder <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Cook finds it advisable to make as many trips to Sydney as he can to consult his chief factotum, who, together with the rest of the Government, are engaged in an infamous conspiracy to disfranchise as many Labour electors as possible. </para>

                            <para>- Precisely. We know that the party behind the Government provide much more than crowns for this sort of work. We have a perfect right to denounce the procedure which is being adopted in connexion with the rolls from one end of the Commonwealth to the other, because the only organization which is making a trade of endeavouring to get names off the rolls is that which supports the Government, and whose chiefs are in daily intercourse with Ministers. Consequently the Government cannot free themselves from responsibility for the work of this organization. They cannot say, &#34; It does not matter who choose to support us. We cannot help that. We are in no way responsible.&#34; The fact is that they are part and parcel of an organization which is assisting them to make their calling and election sure, and which at the same time is engaged in the work of disfranchising as many Labour voters as possible. </para>

                            <para>- We do not wish to say anything save what is the truth. No doubt honorable senators opposite would be only too willing to get half-a-million electors disfranchised. The official answer given by the Vice-President of the Executive Council to the effect that in the State which is enjoying unparalleled prosperity under the rule of a Labour Government, and which is increasing its population at a faster rate than is any other State, the number of electors on the rolls has so materially declined, justifies the statement that there is wholesale disfranchisement at work. In this connexion I would like to recall to honorable senators that only yesterday the newspapers contained a report of a speech delivered by the Prime Minister at Tamworth, in New South Wales, in which he said that the Electoral Act, whether it was good, bad or indifferent, was the Act of the late Fisher Government. </para>

                            <para>- We are not likely to forget that it was the late Government who gave to the electors of this country advantages under that Act which had never previously been enjoyed by them, or indeed by electors in any other part of the world. But the present Government, by their administration of the Act, are depriving many electors of their rights. From the evidence given before the Electoral Commission and from the independent testimony of electoral officers from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oldham</inline> downwards, it is well known that at the last election there was less corruption, less personation and less blameworthy practices than had been associated with any previous election. </para>

                            <para>- That is an insinuation which comes from an honorable senator who is a supporter of a man who says that the approaching election will be a dirty one. My honorable friend set the example of throwing dirt. No doubt there will be filth used during the coming campaign, but that filth will come from the opposite side and not from us. I contend that just as much depends upon the way in which a law is administered as upon the way in which it is framed. When the Prime Minister declares that the Electoral Act was passed at the instance of the Fisher Government, we are quite willing to admit it. But his statement is just one of those half truths which he is so fond of making. It is in the administration of that Act that his party are doing all  they  can to break down its democratic principles and to disfranchise Labour voters, knowing, as they do, that if we have a  i  square and honest go we shall wipe them &#93;out of existence as a political party. The, only way in which they can hope to come) back to the Treasury bench is by deliberately and wickedly tampering with the electoral law of this country. </para>

                        <para>. - In reply to the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Findley</inline> concerning the Teesdale Smith contract, I desire to say that I have given him the reply which was submitted to me by the head of the Department. The only thing I can infer from that reply is that the letter in question is the only communication which has been received in that connexion. I have no desire to hold anything back. I will make further inquiries, with a view to seeing if I cannot get more definite information. The remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> are the usual fulmination against the Electoral Act. He knows perfectly well that neither the Government nor any member  of it can interfere with claims for enrolment or with the striking of names i off the roll. The whole thing is in the hands of the Chief Electoral Officer and , his subordinates. The charges which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has made are simply slanders  against men whom he professes to hold in high admiration. In regard to the figures  which  were supplied by me to-day, it is well  known  that, at the present time, all those figures are in a state of transition. We cannot regard any of them as being absolutely correct. </para>

                        <para>. - The  Vice-President  of the Executive Council has said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae&#39;s</inline> remarks are the usual fulmination. They may be a fulmination,  but, if so, that fulmination is warranted. I intend to bring before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> the nature of our complaint against the Government. There is a procedure laid down in the Electoral Act under which names that are improperly on the rolls can be removed. The Electoral Registrars can have access to the statistics kept by the Registrar of Births, Deaths, and Marriages for the purpose of removing the names of persons who are dead. As regards persons who have left Australia, the Registrars can remove names if they have documentary evidence to that effect. Private individuals - not officials - who wish to lodge objections to a name on the roll are required to deposit the sum of 5s. with each objection. That is intended as a guarantee of good faith. If an objection is found to be frivolous, the 5s. is forfeited. That provision was inserted in the law because, in the good old days, when my honorable friends opposite were predominant, they used their organizations to get the names of persons who were entitled to vote off the rolls. Every difficulty was placed in the way of persons getting their names on the rolls, and every opportunity was afforded these organizations to get names off the rolls. The deposit of 5s. was insisted upon to prevent these organizations shooting at electors for the purpose of getting their names off the rolls, merely because of their political opinions. Ministers are sworn to administer that law, including the provision regarding the lodging of a deposit. Yet we find the Attorney-General admitting that he has invited political organizations - that is, party organizations - to assist the Government in purifying the rolls. </para>

                            <para>- I am referring to the statement of the Attorney-General. Now what is being done? This invitation having gone out to the world, the organizations representing my honorable friends opposite have seen a glorious opportunity of getting back to the practice which obtained years ago. They are firing in hundreds of names - which are not objections in the strict legal sense of the word - and they are not being required to deposit the 5s. fee with each of them. They are sending to the Electoral Registrars the names of hundreds of persons whom they believe are not entitled to vote. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has in his possession the original letter sent by the Electoral Registrar from his office, and signed by him - not a letter, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> endeavoured to insinuate this afternoon, which was written by somebody else. It is a letter which was written by the Registrar, on official notepaper, and it states that the Liberal Union organizer supplied the information upon which an elector&#39;s name had been objected to. That Liberal Union organizer has accepted, and is acting upon, the Attorney-General&#39;s invitation, and the Electoral Registrar is acting as the Attorney-General said he would act. The Electoral Registrar knew nothing about the elector to whose name exception was taken, because that officer does not live in the district in which the elector resides. He knew nothing about the facts, and had no means of doing so. But the Liberal Union organizer wrote to him and supplied him with information - without depositing the 5s. The Electoral Registrar, who knew nothing of the facts, afterwards coolly said to the elector, &#34; Now that you have established your claim, your name may remain on the roll.&#34; But suppose that the voter had been apathetic, or that he had not received the notice of objection which was forwarded to him. In that case, he would have known nothing whatever about the matter, and would have been disfranchised. The position, therefore, is like that of a man shooting at a flock of ducks. He does not need to take aim at a particular duck. He needs only to shoot into the mob. </para>

                            <para>- After he got the notice that his name had been objected to. This man, in order to meet the objection, sent in a fresh claim. The Minister of Defence is not quite seized of the fact that this was the second interchange between the Registrar and the man. First, the. elector got a notice that his name had been objected to, though he did not know by whom; then he filled in a claim and sent it in; afterwards he wanted to know who had objected, and then he received that reply from the Electoral Registrar. That is what we object to. The only way to get back to honesty in this matter, we contend, is for the Government to say to the organizers for the Liberal Union, &#34; If you have legitimate objections to any names on the rolls; if you have discovered that any persons are improperly on the rolls, we wish you to object to the names,&#34; and we, on this side, invite them to do so in accordance with the law; that is to say, we ask them to put up the fee of 5s. with each objection, and if the claim is established, the money will be returned to them. If, however, these persons are simply using the provision in the Act blindly - very much like a man shooting blindly at a number of ducks - and hoping to disfranchise some electors, it is time that the Government put a stop to the proceeding. That the section is being construed in a vicious manner is shown by the letter read by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland.</inline> There we find the secretary of the Liberal Union of South Australia sending out a circular to the secretary of every branch, asking him to take objection to the names of all Labour voters - and the expression &#34; Labour voters &#34; is underlined - who are not possessed of the necessary qualification or who may have left the district. If this was an honest desire to purify the rolls, was there any need for that specific reference to Labour voters in the circular ? If it was merely a desire to have a pure roll, surely the secretary at Adelaide would have sent round to each branch secretary an intimation in this form - &#34; Please lodge objections to the names of all persons appearing on the rolls who, to your knowledge, are not qualified for enrolment/&#39; But when the words &#34; Labour voters &#39; &#39; are used in the circular, the smallest intelligence can easily read between the lines. To every recipient of a circular the message is in effect - &#34; Use the facilities which have been placed at our disposal by the Government to get Labour voters off the roll, qualified or unqualified.&#34; This is getting back to the old order of things. When <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest was Premier of Western Australia, I had an experience of appearing at the Revision Court for four consecutive months. I lived in one house, and for that period I had to go to every Revision Court to establish my claim. No sooner would I put my name on the roll than it would be removed, and for four consecutive Courts I had to lose a halfday&#39;s work and go up to establish my claim, although I had lived in the same house all the time. That was a common practice in those days, especially towards those who made themselves objectionable. Here is an invitation to reestablish the practice. The only stumbling block in the way is the fee of 5s. with each objection. It is idle for the Prime Minister to say, &#34; The Act is that of our predecessors.&#34; That statement is true; but the administration of the Act is not that of their predecessors. It is their own administration. They are administering the Act neither in the spirit nor in the letter. They are deliberately evading and getting round the provision for the deposit of 5s. with an objection, and whilst that is done, we shall not have honesty or pure rolls, but a number of persons will be left off the rolls who are in every way qualified to vote at the coming elections. </para>

The real trouble behind this wholesale disfranchisement of the people lies in the fact that the Government have wickedly broken one of the most important sections of the Electoral Act. if the Minister were to give instructions that the fee of 5s. with every objection should be reimposed forthwith, we would hear very little indeed of further objections being lodged to the names of electors. The other day <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Oakes</inline> worked himself into a great frenzy over a little circular that was issued by the Labour party in New South Wales. But it was not a circumstance to the circular issued by the secretary of the Liberal Union of South Australia, directly from his office, over his name, to the members of his own party. </para>

                            <para>- We do not want to bring forward trumpery charges or falsified documents. This circular is written on Liberal Union paper. It bears the Liberal Union heading, and is signed by the secretary, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Freeman,</inline> of Adelaide. We are perfectly prepared to show a copy of the circular to any person. For downright wrong-doing, it easily takes first place. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Oakes</inline> has also said that members of the Labour party are doing the same thing as members of the Liberal party, that is, lodging informations against persons who, in their opinion, ought not to be on the rolls. </para>

                            <para>- It is part of the campaign of our political opponents to purge or cleanse the rolls. To the honorable senator who interjects that it is part of the campaign of both parties I will give an instance of what the Labour party are doing in South Australia, and ask him whether it is a fair sample of what his own party are doing in other parts of the Commonwealth. At the present time the Labour party in that State have about twenty men, paid by the industrial unions, going from house to house, and putting on the rolls every person who is not enrolled. They ask no questions when they call. </para>

These twenty men are going from door to door, each with a roll, and asking the persons on whom they call whether their names appear on the roll - not for the house a person lives in, because Labour electors move more frequently than do others. The caller turns up the roll, and, if the person is not correctly enrolled, leaves a card, not as the Electoral Branch are doing - lodging an objection, and not leaving any means whereby the elector can become enrolled. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator does not need to learn any tricks from anybody, because he knows all the tricks in the political game, and how to play them. I merely rose to refute the statement made by him, and to show that all that the members of the Labour party want is a complete roll. We are not at all afraid of our Liberal opponents being on the roll; but we are afraid of the underhand practices which are being adopted. Provided that we get a fair deal, we can beat our opponents every time. What we are afraid of is the influence being brought to bear by organizations such as the Liberal Union in South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parkhill&#39;s</inline> union in New South Wales, and others of that kidney. We are afraid of underhand work, and we doubt very much whether the work which these parties are doing is as good, pure, and clean as it ought to be. My object in rising was to point out that we are no party to anything irregular in regard to purifying the rolls. We fear no purification so long as it is conducted on fair and just lines. </para>

                        <para>. - I listened with a very great deal of pleasure to the statements made by the senators from South Australia, and the reason for my pleasure is that, late as repentance may be, it is always welcome. I am very gratified indeed to find that there is growing up in Labour circles in South Australia such a reforming influence that it induces them to-day to send round in this altruistic spirit gentlemen to collect names from all and sundry. </para>

                            <para>- The Select Committee so found, and reported to Parliament, and the report was held to be so substantial that an effort was made to start the legal machinery by proceeding against the gentlemen who had been guilty of this fraud, and a Labour Government was in office at the time, let it be remembered. The defence taken was that the Government had delayed so long it was outside the six months stipulated in the Electoral law within which a prosecution had to commence. That is all circling around the officials of the Trades Hall. </para>

                            <para>- It does not matter how many. It was done at the instance of the Trades Hall officials. The cards were collected in a mysterious way; they were in an equally mysterious way taken up and left on a table in the Trades Hall, without being placed in charge of any one; and they were then collected in an equally mysterious way and sent on that the names might be put on the rolls. I do not wish my honorable friends opposite to be annoyed about this. I am congratulating them upon the reform which has set in. I am delighted to think that gentlemen who, not long since, were associated with movements of this character, now see the error of their ways, and in electoral matters are trying to live as decent, honest citizens. It is not long since it was discovered in the same region, in connexion with the operation of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, that a number of applications for enrolment were received in blank, except for the fact that there was a witness&#39;s signature attached to them. When the honorable senator spoke of the efforts of his friends over there to leave cards at the houses, I interjected and asked him whether they were duly witnessed. I had in mind the incident to which I have just referred. I can only say that if my honorable friends have found out the error of their ways, Heaven forbid that I should do otherwise than extend to them a welcome now that they have entered on the path of rectitude. I am, however, a little dubious about the conversion of gentlemen who, a little while ago, were,, metaphorically, up to their necks in these nefarious practices, and now come forward with protestations that they are working upon so very high a political level. As for the other statements which have been made, they have recently been repeated so often in this Chamber that I should think that even those who make them should be getting tired of the frequent reiteration of vague and general statements, and of statements which, when they have been accompanied by definite details, have been refuted on the floor of this chamber. </para>

My honorable friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall,</inline> hasclearly allowed his enthusiasm to carry him beyond the limits of accuracy.

I am satisfied that honorable senators opposite can have only  one object in view when they keep on reiterating these statements. They do so in the hope, no doubt, that by degrees they will come to believe them themselves, and will thus be put in a better position latex on to convince other people who may waste their time listening to them from some public platform. </para>

I make that reference because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story</inline> took exception to a change of regulation on the incoming of a new Minister. The honorable senator seemed to think that, because men enter the Service under one set of regulations, an injustice is done them if the regulations are altered during the time they are serving. If that argument were pressed to its logical conclusion, it would be impossible ever to alter a regulation. The honorable senator tried to make out that an injustice had been done to these men because an incoming Minister altered the regulation. I point out that, so far as I am concerned, the regulation remained unaltered. </para>

                            <para>- The regulation, as set out in the paper supplied to me by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Story,</inline> provides that the allowance shall be paid to those noncommissioned officers of the Instructional Staff who are required to provide a horse. The question which came before the Military Board was whether these particular officers were entitled to draw the allowance under that regulation. The members of the Military Board did not know whether these officers had horses or were required to use horses, so they added to their statement of the regulation the direction that under it the commanding officer, the man who ought to know, and who is in a position to know, should say whether these non-commissioned officers had horses or were required to have them. They have decided that the commanding officer must himself take the responsibility, and every one can see the necessity for this, of saying whether the claimants in such cases were required to use horses and entitled to draw the horse allowance. </para>

                            <para>- Because they do not keep the horses. The trouble has arisen because some of these officers have assumed from reading the regulations that they were entitled to the horse allowance. There is no desire on my part to deprive any man of anything to which he is entitled. No man would for a moment give a decision on a case of this kind, the effect of which would be the payment to any persons from the public Treasury of sums of money to which they were not fairly entitled. In this matter there is no attempt to deprive officers of anything that is their due. </para>

                            <para>- The answer to that is that these men are not entitled to draw the horse allowance. The only thing that is new in the matter is the decision of the Military Board that the officer in charge shall take the responsibility of saying whether certain officers are entitled to the allowance or not. If he certifies that they require to have a horse and keep one, they will be paid the horse allowance, and if he does not they will not. That is all I have to say about it. </para>
