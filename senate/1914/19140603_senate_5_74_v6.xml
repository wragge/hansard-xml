                        <para>- It will be obvious to the honorable senator, and to the Senate, that certain information is being sought which I could not possibly supply at the present moment. I suggest, therefore) that the honorable senator should either let me know privately the information he seeks, or put a question in the ordinary way. On the main question, I should like to say that the Board is now making a recommendation to me for a continuance of these duties, and as soon as a decision is arrived at, possibly within the next few days, I shall make the Senate acquainted with it. </para>

Is it the intention of the Minister to abolish, or has he already abolished, such schools, to enable the Australian men to qualify for such positions ? </para>

The party I Belong to has been charged time and again by gentlemen on the other side with opposing the immigration of any people into this country. As a matter of fact, the members of the Labour party are very much alive to the needs of Australia, and well aware that there must be a very considerable addition to its population before it is in a position to become very cheeky to any of the big foreign nations. People are encouraged to come to this country by having it explained to them that there are opportunities for their advancement in Australia that are not to be found elsewhere. </para>

                                <para>- Just so. The State Governments, and particularly the Government of Victoria, are at present landing thousands of people in Australia, although we find in the newspapers every day evidence of the fact that there are thousands of men out of work in Melbourne and in other parts of the State. Only last week the daily press informed us that at a meeting of the unemployed in Melbourne &#34;there were 3,000 men present. It is easy to understand that if 3,000 of the unemployed can be got to attend a meeting in Melbourne, there are many more thousands walking about in this city, and in various parts of the State, looking for work which they are unable to obtain. I had occasion only last week to address a meeting of unemployed at Ballarat, which is always a grievous thing for any one to have to do. Though there are thousands of people out of work in this State, the party represented by honorable senators opposite are following a course which is calculated to intensify the evil of unemployment. </para>

                                <para>- Yes. That is the amount which they pay .them to dump all sorts of immigrants on the ships for Australia. In the circumstances, it is understandable how anxious the agents are to send only persons of the right type to this country. It has, however, dawned upon the Conservatives that the immigrants whom they have been securing from the Old Land qualify for a vote soon after their arrival here, and that they avail themselves of the first opportunity to retaliate by voting against the party whose agents have made such misleading statements to them. That circumstance is exercising a salutary effect upon my honorable  friends  opposite, and consequently they are now turning their attention to securing from abroad individuals who have no votes. Formerly they were in the habit of landing hundreds of farm labourers in Australia, but the latter quickly qualified as electors, so that the Conservatives are now chiefly concerned about bringing only boys to this country. The lads are landed here at about fifteen years of age, and they cannot retaliate by fighting back against the Conservative party on election day for some years afterwards. Only the week before last 550 boys were landed in Victoria, and they are supposed to fill the bill in regard to shortage of labour on the farms of Australia. Any man who takes train into the country will see hundreds of men carrying their swags. Only this morning, in coming from Ballarat, I counted no fewer than twenty of them. That is sufficiently indicative of the number of unemployed there are in this country. It was only to be expected that there would be openings for a certain number of persons from oversea. But the truth is that the country has been so woefully misgoverned that the avenues of employment which ordinarily should be open have been closed. Only the other day a landowner who holds 11,600 acres a little beyond Bacchus Marsh - some of the best land in Victoria - stated that he employs only three men, and that he is likely to employ less. Whilst such a state of things exists, there is not much likelihood of our being able to absorb many persons from oversea. Of course, it is quite understandable that those who desire to exploit labour are naturally desirous of keeping a stock of surplus labour everywhere. But, to my mind, it is very much better for a few employers to lack a sufficient number of employes than that thousands of men should be unemployed. I hope that, in the immediate future, prospective immigrants from oversea will be made thoroughly familiar with the conditions which obtain here.

I recollect that when we asked that this Parliament should be endowed with greater power to control trusts and combines which were affecting, . or likely to affect, the welfare of the people, we were told that there were no combinations which were acting injuriously to the public interests, and that, even if there were, the powers already possessed by Parliament were sufficient to deal with them. I remember that the same statements were repeated in the daily press, which assured the electors again and again that there was no need for an alteration of the Constitution, because the legislative powers of this Parliament were adequate to cope with any such evil. </para>

                                <para>- Yes, but in the long run they have been forced to acknowledge the truth of the statements put forward by the Labour party. During the last election campaign, too, my honorable friends opposite urged that the Labour party bad not attempted to reduce the cost of living. They told the electors that if they were returned to office they would see that it was reduced. Yet, although they have been installed in office twelve mouths, we find that the cost of living has still further increased. As a matter of fact, it is daily increasing. Meat, butter, and bread are continually rising in price, and the Government are making no effort to alter this condition of affairs. I confess that I am not altogether sorry that they are inactive, because these things will discredit them before the people. I would now like to say a few words about the so-called test Bills, of which we have heard so much of late. Last week one of these measures met with an extremely sudden end in this Senate. So far, we have had no indication that the Government are as anxious to secure a double dissolution as they had previously professed themselves to be. We have been told that they were prepared to rush off to the Governor-General immediately, and that they would drag the Labour party before the country at any cost. But, although the Government Preference Prohibition Bill met with the fate which I have outlined, Ministers have not exhibited a consuming anxiety for the dissolution about which they have talked so glibly. Among the charges levelled against the Labour party during the last election was one that we had persistently pursued the policy of spoils to the victors. This  asser-  ti mi would lead any one who did . not know the circumstances to believe that as soon as we obtained power, and found ourselves in a position to do so, we mustered all our friends and supporters and gave them all the good things that we could lay our hands on. As a matter of fact, no definite charge has been brought against the Labour Government to prove that any supporter of our party ever got anything at our hands. </para>

                                <para>- There may be something to be said for that argument, but when the people&#39;s money is being handed out those who have the responsibility must see that the best results are obtained for it. I have only met <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryland</inline> casually, but from what I hear of him from those who know something of his capacity, I believe that the appointment was a very wise one. There is no question that he had the ability to fill the position with credit to himself and those who appointed him. He went to the Northern Territory to carry out the duties assigned to him, and the policy which he had to help to administer was one that our party took some stock in. We believed it to be in the best interests of Australia that this new part of the continent should be settled in a manner different from that in which the other parts had been settled. For that reason it was necessary to get somebody there to administer affairs as we desired, so that our policy would not be strangled. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryland&#39;s</inline> feelings on that point were well known. We knew how enthusiastic he was about the Government policy. When the present Government came into power it at once became evident that, in their opinion, if they were going to alter the Labour policy in the Northern Territory, it would be necessary to get rid of some of the able officials appointed by our Government, and put in their places other men who were more amenable to their wishes. In all probability that is the game the Government have been trying to play. The only charge having any degree of substantiality which was made against the Labour Government on the spoils to the victors question was that we desired to establish the principle of preference to unionists. The Labour party have never dodged that issue. It was a plank of the platform on which they won the elections of 1910, and they gave effect to it so far as they were able. That is the only favoritism, if there is any favoritism in it, that can be truly brought home&#39; to the Labour party. The party gave preference to unionists in the .case of the 9s. a day casual labourer, but in doing so they were depriving nobody of a job, unless the present Government and their supporters were telling the people untruths, because at that time they and all the Conservatives in the country were howling for more immigration, showing that, in their opinion, there were any number of jobs to go round, and any quantity of work for every unionist in Australia, while still leaving room for thousands who might be brought from over the water. One pf the planks in the first programme submitted to the House by the present Government was the amendment of the Arbitration Act. They said they were going to deprive the rural worker of his right of appeal to the Arbitration Court. The rural workers&#39; log question &#34; cut some ice &#34; with them during the last election campaign, and was responsible for the defeat of many Labour candidates in country electorates throughout the Commonwealth, because the people were misled as to the true state of affairs. The Labour party had taken up the position that every citizen was equal before the law, and that what one citizen was entitled to in tEe Courts of the country, every other citizen should be entitled to also. We said that we would give the rural workers the same opportunities of getting the benefits, if any, to be derived from the Arbitration Court as we would give to any other class of worker. At that time the rural worker was a disorganized working element in the community. Since then things have developed somewhat. We now find that the Government have deliberately dropped the proposal with regard to the rural workers out of their programme. Apparently they do not now intend to deprive the rural worker of his right to get justice at the hands of the Court. What is the reason for this change of front? Apparently the Government have found out since last year that the rural worker has developed a punch. As a matter of fact, he showed, during the last harvest, that he meant business. Previous to that, the organization had been fighting for the right to go before the Court; and the farmers, misled by the present Government and their supporters, fought against the possibility of the farm labourer getting his grievances settled in any other way than by a strike. The farm worker had enough sense to take up the attitude that most other labour organizations had taken up. He believed that it would be better for him and his to get his grievances redressed without going out on strike, and did everything in his power to bring about that state of affairs. The officers of his organization approached the officers of the other organizations in an endeavour to get their industry brought before the Court, and their grievances settled there; but they were told by the Farmers and Settlers Associations, which are mostly run by commission agents and auctioneers, and not by farmers, that there was no trouble at all, and that there was no need for action to be taken before the Court. The harvest came along, and the rural worker showed that he had genuine grievances, with the result that thousands in various parts of Australia were on strike for many weeks. According to the Farmers and Settlers Associations, the result of that strike was that they had their work done at the old rates, and under the old conditions, and that they did not employ any of the members of the Australian Workers Union, which now embraces the rural workers. As a matter of fact, we have definite proof from our organizers and officers all over Australia that that was untrue, and that, in reality, most of the farms in the parts of the country affected by the rural workers log rates are worked under log conditions. Those are the real facts of the case. The Government, in all probability, realized that their attitude with regard to the rural workers was going to be resented in the way in which organized labour can resent a grievance. They have found out that by going  to the country with this cry they will alienate a tremendous lot of support. It  hae  had another effect. It has brought the organizer of the Australian Workers Union into very much closer touch with the man on the land, with the result that he understands now much more than he did before. But, after all, the rural workers are only standing for what they believe is right and what they are justly entitled to get. Their notions have been altogether altered, as we see by the action of their association and what they are doing. They are coming to this opinion, apparently : that the members  and the followers of the present Government and their supporters in the press misled the farmer altogether. An indication of the altered opinion of the man on the land in this country is furnished by a Sydney telegram which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of the 22nd May - </para>

                            <para>Interesting reference is made to the general question of industrial arbitration, as it affects the farmer, in the annual report of the  executive  of the New South Wales Farmers and Settlers&#39; Association, which will be issued to members of that body to-morrow. </para>
                            <para>The report says : - &#34; Tour executive is watching with interest for any development of 0&#60;e scheme of Federal control of industrial matters. It is obvious that some such development is inevitable. Already a number of industries are in a constant state of disruption because of conflicting awards - Federal and State. Delegates will understand at once iih.it the farming industry could not be carried  om  under such conditions of confusion if we are to be bound down to the observation of a rigid award that will settle the conditions of the industry for the whole of the Commonwealth. Seeing that arbitration is inevitable, your executive urges upon all delegate and upon local district councils to prepare f&#60;&#34;&#62;r an arbitration contest. Hitherto we have been able to take a stand on the assertion that no dispute existed as between us and our employes, but it would be suicidal tactics to presume that a dispute is impossible, or  even  unlikely. Our time will be far better spent in preparing to put the circumstances of the great industry we control adequately before any tribunal before which we may be called.&#34; </para>

                        <para class="block">Here is a clean reversal of position. Before the last harvest they said that there was no dispute ; that they did not want an Arbitration Court or anything else. But now ;the action of the rural workers, through their organization, has convinced these persons that there is some trouble happening all the time. They know what it was at the last harvest, and they realize that the rural workers will never be content till they get justice done to them, and that at the following harvest there will be men looking for more fight unless action is taken to redress some of the grievances under which they ( have laboured for, God knows, how many  years. What is the position in many of the fruit districts of Australia where the workers are covered by the Rural Workers Association ? We had an instance at Mildura. For a number of years the employers in that settlement sweated their employes as far as they were able to do.  They even induced the Victorian Government to proclaim special holidays for the children of the men who lived there, so that the employers might be in a position to exploit the labour of the children as well as the labour of the fathers and the mothers. But eventually an organization came into existence and fought on until the men got an award from the Arbitration Court. The usual  howl, of course, went up to heaven from the employers that if the award were given they would never be able to pay it. But now we find the employers say that they can pay it. During their recent visit, the Fruit Commission extracted very useful information from some employers. One employer in particular said that the fruit industry could afford to pay the wages now being paid. He even went further and said that since these rates had been paid there had been a better class of workers coming to the settlement than was obtained before, and that they had no trouble with them. </para>

                                <para>- That is a proof of the contention of Labour men that, in this country, there is no trouble in getting labour of any class or character, provided that decent wages and conditions are given. The fruit-growers are now working under an award of the Arbitration Court, and some citizens in the settlement say that the granting of the award marks the beginning of the prosperity of the settlement. If any one goes there now he will find it in a very different position from that it occupied previous to the award; so people who live there tell me. </para>

                                <para>- No; every one is satisfied that the award is all right. The truth is that the settlement could not help progressing when the men got decent pay. The granting of the award meant that money was being spread over a large area. Business men in the town found that the working population had a greater spending capacity, and, of course, they made use of it. The same thing applies to working people in the fruit industry all over the country. They never earn so much that they can pile up a big banking account or buy a motor car, and generally they have to be satisfied if they can buy enough of the necessaries of life to feed their dependants. Because of this, there is always room for them lo reach out after a bigger spending capacity, so that the conditions of their home-life may be improved. In other parts of Victoria there are fruit settlements, and in all probability the conditions are very similar to those which prevailed in Mildura. We were told by no less a personage than the  Chairman  of an Irrigation Trust, when being examined  by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> the other day, that cultivation in Mildura returns to a proprietor from &#163;30 to &#163;40 an acre after deducting all labour cost. In all probability this applies to very many of the prosperous fruit settlements in other parts of Victoria. One can visit various places where people go in largely for fruit growing, and find that employers there are in the same condition as the Mildura employers were years before the award. They are not prepared to give a decent wage to a man - only 15s. a week; and that kind of thing &#34;was the proposition which the rural workers&#39; organizer and members of the union were up against at the last &#39;harvest. Yet these people are continually howling for increased duties and various other things. They are prepared to employ men if they can get them to work for 15s. a week. These are the places to which quite a large number of immigrants who are continually landing .here are drafted. </para>

                                <para>- The employers work the men as many hours as they can during the day, and most of the night. During the last trouble we saw reports of where the organizer for the Australian Workers Union had to visit a place at night to see the men, who, I suppose, were working a bit of overtime to get something near what might be considered a living wage. There is a reversal of opinion altogether, and_ it is outlined in the report of the executive of the employers. They have found out that after all any man is entitled to stand up for what he thinks is a square deal. The man who has courage enough to do -that generally wins more respect from an employer, even though he is a sweater, than does a fellow who is prepared to  crawl and do an injury to himself and to other people too. During the last recess  members  of the Government, like most Federal politicians, were busy in travelling and talking. Of course they were preparing for what they termed a double dissolution - that is, to drag Labour before the electors again. It is interesting now to glance at some of the opinions which they then expressed to the people. A few weeks ago the Prime Minister tried to hearten up the Women&#39;s National League a bit for what he called the coming conflict. He wanted to get them to work. He said to them, &#34; You get the business for the next ten months, and I will go bail for the next ten years.&#34; A gentleman holding a prominent position like that of Prime Minister does not use words that have no meaning. He expects whatever he says to be taken very seriously. On that occasion the Prime Minister expected his audience to take his advice and get to business ; he promised them that if they did get to business he would go bail for the next ten years. I do not know what he meant by this remark, and possibly the Women&#39;s National League are still puzzling their heads over what he meant. But the conduct of the Conservatives during the whole of the time they have had charge of public affairs warrants me in coming to the conclusion that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> could only go bail for the next ten years in one way. If the ladies got busy for the next ten months, and by a miracle the Conservative party got a double dissolution and a majority in each House of this Parliament, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> could then very safely go bail for the next ten years, because he would gerrymander with the Electoral Act, and so arrange matters that there would be no possibility of ousting his Government for a number of years. I am warranted in making the remark by the actions of Conservatives in other circumstances. In Victoria, Labour is not very largely represented in the State Parliament, not because the people who elect Labour men have different ideas from those who elect the members of the Federal Labour party, but because they have no opportunity of expressing their opinions at the ballot box. In Victoria there is a small number of Labour men elected compared with the large number elected in other States. It can be easily understood how the Conservatives keep in power here when I mention  that ten Labour men speak for 150,000 electors, while ten Conservatives speak for 68,000 electors. In other words, a Labour man represents nearly three persons to every person represented by a Conservative. But even that was not sufficient to warrant the people who have run Victoria to believe that they could retain the power, and so they decided only a little while ago to alter the Electoral Act, in order to make a greater discrepancy in regard to the constituencies. The same thing has happened in South Australia, where Labour was temporarily deposed from power, and no doubt <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Peake</inline> ventured to say that he would go bail for the next ten years. He altered the Electoral Act so that now a Labour man represents 15,000 odd electors while a Conservative represents 6,000 odd. That is the only hope that the Conservatives have of holding power in Australia, and in all probability <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> is well aware of that fact. The Conservatives, I believe, did even worse in Queensland, and attempted the same thing in Western Australia. Had <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> the same opportunity he would, I venture to say, follow in the wake of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Peake</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt,</inline> and so gerrymander the Electoral Act as to make it impossible for Labour to be represented in this Parliament in anything like the present proportion. The Constitution contains certain provisions. Its framers supposed that it contained quite a number of powers; but when the Constitution came to be tested we found, very much to our surprise, and very likely they did too, that the powers were not given. In my opinion, the Constitution needs to be altered so that the people of this country may be enfranchised, and there may be no possibility of the Government ever being able to tamper with the franchise. That should only be done when permitted by a referendum of the people. I undertake to say that no Government could carry by referendum a proposal inviting the men and women of Australia to give up their equal rights as electors. It has been said that the Labour party are afraid to face the people, but the history of this Parliament gives no warrant for any such statement. When we came into the Federal Parliament first we had 24 representatives of Labour as against 87 of the Fusion party, or of the Liberal Conservative conglomeration of the time. At the following election the number of Labour representatives was increased from 24 to 39, whilst the number of the other party dropped from 87 to 72. After the election in 1906 the Labour representatives were increased from 39 to 42, whilst the other side dropped from 72 to 69. In 1910 the Labour party increased its representation from 42 to 65, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bornes.</inline> whilst the others dropped from 69 to 46. Even at the last elections, when it was assumed that the Fusion party wiped the floor with Labour, and deprived the Labour party of place and power, the Labour representation went from 65 to 66, and the representation of the other side dropped from 46 to 45. So that the whole history of Federation demonstrates the fact that the more the people know of the Labour party the better they like them. They have been sending Labour representatives to this Parliament in greater numbers at every election. </para>

                                <para>- Yes, a glance at these figures should be very comforting to our honorable friends opposite before they secure the double dissolution for which they are asking. There is one matter which I omitted to refer to when dealing with the question of favoritism. We have been charged by the other side with favoritism, and with handing out billets to our own supporters, but only the other day <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> admitted, in answer to a question by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell,</inline> that some people in the employ of the Post and Telegraph Department who did not belong to the organization which secured an award from the Arbitration Court were being given the wages fixed by the award, although the Court specially laid it down in the award that only members of the organization were to be paid the rates fixed. It seems that the present Government have not very much respect for the observance of law and order, about which they preach so much. They went &#39;out of their way to give the &#39;same benefits to people who were not in the organization as the Court, awarded &#39;to those who were members of it. </para>

The people who did not go to the Court were not entitled to the benefits of the award. They placed themselves in a position in which they were unable to obtain an award. But these people are being everlastingly buttoned to by the party on the other side. The Government are paying the taxpayers&#39; money to non- unionists in the Post and Telegraph Department, who, according to the Court, are not entitled to it. If the Court had considered those people entitled to the rates fixed by the award it would have said that the rates should be paid to all people employed by the Government in that branch of the Post and Telegraph Department. </para>

                                <para>- Of course they do. They pay their share of the expense, and they paid the whole of the costs of their side in making the application to the Court. The other people who do not belong to the organization did not pay anything to secure the award; but they are the pets of the people who occupy the Treasury bench to-day. They are the people of independent spirit who would not belong to a labour organization, and the pets to whom the little doles at the disposal of the present Government are handed out. The Government think nothing of the unionists who are prepared to fight for their cause, and prefer the loafers who have not sufficient manliness to join an organization to enable them to secure an award. If Labour favours anybody in this country it is the men of the country, and not the loafers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl,</inline> as one of the responsible heads of the Government, had a lot to say during the recess about the things he supposed had been done at the general elections; but, in speaking the other day, he was unable to justify the stand he had. taken up. He repeated his statement to the effect that there were 180,000 more names on the electoral rolls than there were electors entitled to be on them., That statement has been blown out time and again by the officials of the Electoral Department. The officials do not say that the names were not on the rolls, but that it is impossible to have rolls containing only the names of those entitled to vote in a particular district. The Commonwealth Statistician has informed us that no fewer than 500,000 persons change their residence every twelve months in Australia. We have no reason to doubt this statement, because we all know that our population is largely a floating one. People follow the opportunities for work from one part of the country to another, according to the seasons for wool and wheat. We know, also, that the population of mining centres is continually moving from one part of the country to another. In these circumstances it is clearly impossible to prevent some names appearing on the electoral rolls which oUght not to be there. The electoral officials allow on this account for a margin of 10 per cent. , and 10 per cent, of the electors of Australia would represent a larger number than the figure stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl.</inline> Still, the honorable senator repeats his statement that there were 180,000 names on the rolls that had no right to be there, with the object of inducing the people to believe that they were deliberately kept there by the Labour Government, so that their votes might be used in duplications when the election day came round. The inquiry made by officers, under the direction of the present Government, has blown out all the stories told about the dishonesty of the electors of Australia. I regret that&#39; a responsible Minister of the Crown should come before the Senate at this late hour and repeat a charge of that kind. During the recess, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> was fighting for his scalp the same as the rest of us, and was very busy in talking to meetings of the Women&#39;s National League. He took it upon himself to criticise the Commonwealth Bank. Even if Ministers were opposed to a national bank for the Commonwealth, we might, at least, have expected them to remember that their personal views might not be those held by the majority of the people. If a vote of the people were taken to-morrow as to whether they favoured the establishment of  a  national bank for Australia there would be very little doubt of the result of such an appeal to them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> publicly stated that the Commonwealth Bank had shown a loss, and that later on the loss would be greater. He has admitted that he made a mistake when he made that statement, and is to be commended for his admission. But a man occupying so responsible a position should never venture to criticise an institution of so much importance to the people of Australia without being quite sure of his ground. Before he made his remarks upon the bank he might have discovered by inquiry at the bank itself that what he had in mind to say to the people was entirely wrong. The honorable senator did not consider the interests of Australia sufficiently to take that course, and if he had done so, as one of its responsible men, he would have been saved the humiliation of having to retract some of the statements he made in regard to that institution. He claims the right to criticise the institution as freely as may any other member of this Parliament. No one will venture to deny him that right. In all probability in years to come the Commonwealth Bank will come under the criticism of Parliament on many occasions. It would be a bad thing for the people, and for the institution, if that were not so. The best intentioned people in the world make mistakes, and criticism may lead to the correction of those mistakes. No one will question <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl&#39;s</inline> right to criticise the Commonwealth Bank, but Australia demands that Ministers and members of Parliament will at least be fair to the people when they enter upon  a  business, and will not endeavour to strangle an Australian institution before it is given an opportunity to demonstrate what it is capable of doing. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> mentioned quite  a  number of other matters to which  I  shall not refer, but I note that the Government have expressed their intention to do something to bring about a uniform railway gauge in Australia. I remind honorable senators that the Government represent the political party that has practically been in power in Australia since the establishment of responsible government here. They knew so little about the possibilities of Australia that the Government in one State built railways on the 4-ft. 8|-in. gauge, in another on the 5-ft. 3-in. gauge, and in another on the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge. They never dreamed apparently that Australia would one day be a nation, and would require a uniform railway gauge, not only for military, but for business purposes. Because the party represented by the present Government so foolishly mismanaged the affairs of this country in the past, they are themselves faced with a proposition to establish a uniform railway gauge at a cost, according to the experts, of &#163;50,000,000 or &#163;60,000,000. That is the debt which Australia owes today as the result of the misgovernment of the class of politicians who are represented by the present Commonwealth Government. There is one other little matter to which I must refer, and that is the Teesdale Smith contract. I cannot refrain from giving the Government a bit of a &#34; jab &#34; now and again on that question, although a lot has already been said about it. It has been stated, in defence of the Government, that excavation work was let to Teesdale Smith at 4s. 6d. a cubic yard because that was about the price which South Australia paid for the same &#39;class of work. They do a great many things in South Australia, and some of them very well. One of the things they do well is to excavate earth. They have up-to-date appliances for the purpose. I have here a report of the Irrigation and Reclamation Works Department of South Australia, which is a State institution. They shift a great deal of earth, but they do not give the work to a Teesdale Smith for 4s. 6d. per cubic yard for excavating, and another 2s. 6d. per cubic yard for putting the spoil on a bank. They adopt up-to-date methods for carrying out this class of work. They have a machine which is ordinarily called a steam navvy, but is described in this report as an Austin Excavator. The report&#39; says that this excavator has shifted 100,935 cubic yards of channelling at 81/2d. per cubic yard. It states - </para>

                        <para>Typo <inline font-style="italic">&#34; A-&#34;</inline> Austin excavator arrived in August, 191.1, commenced work in December of  the  same year, and up to the 30th June, 19.13, has excavated 100,935 cubic yards, 04,059 cubic yards being taken out during 1912-13 from drains and channels, averaging from 4 feet to 13$ feet deep, with a 6-ft. bottom, and side slopes of 1 to 1; the spoil is placed 45 feet from the centre. </para>
                        <para class="block">There is also an illustration given of the cutting upon which it was employed, which is exactly similar to a railway cutting. The channel which was excavated measures 33 feet at the top, 6 feet at the bottom, and is 13-&#163; feet deep, and the cost of excavating it was 3&#163;d. per cubic yard. According to Senators Rae, Gardiner, and others who have traversed the country covered by the Teesdale Smith contract, it is very similar in character to the country which has been dealt with by the Irrigation and Reclamation Works Department of South Australia. It will be seen, therefore, that this particular contract is a very smellful one, and one which the Government naturally desire to relegate to the background. This is the Government whose members have the effrontery to accuse the Labour party of having given spoils to the victors. Yet almost their first act after coming into office was to give to one of their supporters a huge contract at an exorbitant price without calling for tenders. I venture to say that if workmen had been fortunate enough to obtain that job, they would be able to retire long before the transcontinental railway is completed. The figures which I have quoted show that, though the Labour party have not been long in existence, they are yearly receiving more support from the people. Should the second so-called &#34; test &#34; measure meet the same fate as was accorded to the Government Preference Prohibition Bill, Ministers will shortly be afforded an opportunity of appealing to the country, and we shall then see whether the electors will continue in power a Government which is so inept that it allowed one of its members to enter into a contract of this kind without even calling for public tenders. Since their accession to office, Ministers have done so many strange things that, in all probability, they are anything but anxious to appeal to the constituencies. Should the storm come, however - and I doubt very much whether it will - the electors may take it upon themselves to settle who shall govern this country for the next ten years - the period for which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> said that he was willing to go bail. The party which he leads are capable of anything. They are backed by  the worst element in Australia - by those who would flood this country with cheap labour, so that half-a-dozen men might be looking every morning for one man&#39;s job, and so that they might then be in  a  position to charge honest workmen with refusing to accept employment in the country. Only this morning a letter was published in one of the daily papers from the secretary of the unemployed, pointing out why men will not accept work in our rural areas. He gave facts in support of his statements. It appears that a farmer was written to asking if he had any work to offer. His reply was that he could offer one man work all right. &#34; Come along to my farm,&#34; he said, &#34; and if you have any ability as a farm labourer, or if you show any aptitude to learn, I will be glad to employ you, so that in time you will be able to take  a  farm of your own. I will pay you 10s.  a  week if I think you are worth it.&#34; That letter explains why workmen will not go into the country. There is no part of Australia so far distant that labour cannot be obtained, provided sufficient wages are offered, and that other conditions of labour axe satisfactory. The Australian is not white-livered. He is prepared to go to the moon if only the conditions of life are sufficiently attractive. I believe it is better for men to stay in the city than to seek employment  in  the country if by so doing they will be compelled to work for a sweater  at  10s. per week. </para>

                        <para class="block">That seems to me a most extraordinary reply for the Minister to make. Why should he not give a direct answer to my question, even though a hundred companies were in process of formation for the purpose of exploiting this industry? Even if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and others were interested in some of those companies, why should not the desired information have been forthcoming? Why should not the Government make arrangements with those companies to have first call upon the product of the oil-fields when they were discovered. The Government were undoubtedly elected by the people to encourage private enterprise, yet when a favorable opportunity presents itself for them to do so. and at the same time to confer a great benefit on the nation, they absolutely refuse to reply to a question dealing with the matter. I propose later in the session to give the Senate an opportunity of expressing an opinion as to the desirability or otherwise of the Commonwealth Government endeavouring to make provision to secure some control over the oil-fields that Australia is supposed to possess. I &#39;merely refer to the matter now in order to direct the attention of the Government to the importance of taking immediate action, and placing a sum of money on the Estimates for the purpose. The following extract from an article which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Herald,</inline> Adelaide, is interesting - &#34; The fuel oil supply available in England is very limited, as, although the oil-fields of Russia, Roumania, and Galicia are worked largely with British capital, we get but little fuel oil from these sources, and if we did, the closing of the Dardanelles would cut off the supply. At present our chief sources of supply are the East and America, and if the Empire is to maintain her supremacy on the sea, it behoves us to develop the oil-fields of the Empire as rapidly as possible, in order that Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and the West Indies may aid India in supplying fuel oil for naval purposes, and add to the large quantities that will probably be available from Mexico.&#34; </para>
                        <para>These significant words were penned only a few months since by no less eminent an authority than Professor Vivian B. Lewes, F.I.C., F.C.S., in his important work, &#34; Oil Fuel.&#34; They reveal plainly the necessity of following up every possible indication of the presence of petroleum in British Dominions. Up to the present the Australian Governments have displayed a lamentable lack of enterprise in exploiting supposed oil-bearing areas, and the remark applies with particular force to the South Australian Government. True, a paltry bonus of ?5,000has been offered for the first 100,000 gallons of crude oil stored, but when a company has 100,000 gallons of petroleum stored it will be no more in need of ?5,000 than a millionaire is of sixpence. The whole attitude of the South Australian Government and Mines Department regarding our supposed petroliferous areas has been one of scepticism. In view of this, it is of more than ordinary interest to note that Professor Lewes firmly believes in the existence of petroleum in Australia. &#34; Oil undoubtedly exists in Now Zealand, Australia, Egypt, in our West African colonies, in Newfoundland, in Assam, in the Punjab, and in Baluchistan;&#39; and if our Government would institute a department to encourage and, where necessary, exploit and aid oil development in our overseas Empire, the country would soon be independent of supplies that might fail in time of war,&#34; remarks he. No stronger words could be used. </para>

                                was so enthusiastic about the prospects that he would shortly return from California to begin operations on his own  behalf on land over which he had secured options. His syndicate was financed by the oil magnates of California, and Australian money had been refused, so confident was the American in the oil indications he saw in South Australia.

I should not have the slightest objection to American money developing our oil industry if it were not for the fact that by that means we may allow the industry to get into the hands of the trust, which can prevent its development. That is an important matter, because the trust could practically dictate to the Australian Government the price they should pay for their oil, and the quantities they should receive. The following extracts show that the Government have precedents for taking action. - </para>

In the latter colony the Government took up the question seriously, and promoted an investigation under the direction of Mr.E. H.

Trinidad may be said to possess the first oil-field in which a scientific geological examination preceded the rule-of-thumb driller: and there is little doubt that Trinidad will reap the benefit of her enlightened policy. </para>

                        <para class="block">All this shows that in assisting in the discovery of oil and the development of the industry the Government will be doing far more than merely helping private enterprise. They could, as I suggested in my first question to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> by subsidizing these companies, do the same as the English Government have done, and as a return for the subsidy have the first call on the product. That would be a very valuable privilege for them to possess, and by taking that course they would certainly put it out of the power of the private companies to hand over their interests to the great American Oil Trust. I am convinced that in South Australia, Queensland, and Papua, and I believe in the Northern Territory, we have country that is undoubtedly oil-bearing and if private companies cannot get assistance in Australia they will naturally go elsewhere for it. If the American Oil Trust find that oil exists in payable quantities in any part of Australia, they will assuredly be prepared to put down any amount of capital  in order to get control over it, not necessarily for developmental purposes, but to regulate the price of oil as they have done in the past. If the Government really desire to assist immigration, as they announce in paragraph 10 of the Speech, they can do a great deal in that direction by assisting to develop great natural resources such as those I have just mentioned. Later, I hope to be able to lay before the Senate a great deal more evidence to show that this is a question of the first importance, and that the Government are not serving the best interests of the Commonwealth in treating it in the way they, appear to be doing. </para>

                                <para>- I am not complaining; I am simply stating the facts. I have no complaint to make about&#39; the general tone of the debate except to say that where there has been the expression of a personal belief in the existence of corruption, as has happened in the case of one or two speakers, it is regrettable, because insinuations of that description are not worthy of those who make them or of the Senate as a body. If a member has in his possession any evidence that corrupt practices have been indulged in by members of the Government it is his duty to make it known, and prove the charge up to the hilt; hut insinuations are ill timed and unjustified unless a member has something to hack them up. Without making unfair comparisons, it is safe to say that of the speeches made on the other side that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was most worthy of attention. It was a speciously prepared speech, addressed to a particular phase of the Constitution. The honorable senator put a view of the question which some of the persons who helped to draw the Constitution may have suggested to him. At the same time, he argued that it was never intended by those who drew up the Constitution that the view now being taken of it, possibly by the Government and their supporters, is the correct one. He quoted a number of cases to show that there could be no possible comparison between the two positions. He contended that the Government could not possibly hope to get a double dissolution in connexion with the two test Bills, but the cases he quoted went, more or less, to show that it was only on a financial question that the framers of the Constitution ever thought that there would be a conflict to which the dead-lock provision would be applied. While the honorable senator is, of course, entitled to his opinion, he should remember that the Constitution is a legal document which must be interpreted not by what was in the minds of its draftsmen, but by what is distinctly set out in its provisions. </para>

                                <para>- That does not improve the position a bit. The Constitution is a legal document which clearly sets out the functions of the States and of the Commonwealth. If it is clear that a position must arise and that other action must follow, all the special pleading of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and all the cases he cited in support of his argument are worthless to us when certain conditions are clearly laid down in the Constitution. It is impossible for me to follow in detail the speeches on this question from the other side, but there are one or two phases to which I desire to draw attention. For instance, the Savings Bank question was brought up by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Loghlin,</inline> and his view was supported by several honorable senators. While there have been complaints made from the other side that the Commonwealth Government should not have gone into conference with the State Premiers on this question, the attitude taken up generally has been that the Government should have boldly told the State Premiers what they were going to do, and if the latter did not concur, their duty was to walk out of the Conference. That is not the way to treat statesmen who are parties to the working of the Federal Constitution. They have rights, powers and privileges under that instrument just as we have. While we certainly can take a very strong attitude in this regard, at the same time it may be quite politic for us, and proper in the circumstances, too, to confer with the persons who, in the State sphere, are responsible for the activity of the Savings Bank. </para>

                                <para>- I readily admit that. I am only pointing out that it is wise for .the Commonwealth Government to meet the State Premiers and discuss a matter of great concern to them, and that is the handling of the savings of their citizens. It has been said that we had no right to embark in this business for various reasons, but as to whether it is a proper thing for the Commonwealth or the States to handle the savings of the people, it is well to hear, from time to time, the opinions of men who are outside the sphere of politics, and who, therefore, are free from political . bias in regard to the value of the Commonwealth Bank. </para>

                                <para>- They may be scarce. One of the conditions laid down by the Labour party during the electoral campaign was that the Savings Bank business, if taken over by the Commonwealth, would make money cheaper to the people of the Commonwealth. That was a very proper cry for our opponents to put forward if they honestly believed in it. We have had a little experience of the Commonwealth Bank, and it is only right to ask whether it has realized the anticipations of our honorable friends opposite. </para>

                            <para>Judge Heydon yesterday expressed  interesting  views on the tightness of the money market, and its effect upon the shortage of houses.

                            <para>His Honor suggested that the shortage of houses might be due to the shortage of money. Possibly people were getting such a high rate for their money in other directions that they were not disposed to build. The spending habit of the Australian appeared to be punishing him. </para>

                                Honor: Perhaps the banks have not forgotten the years 1892 and 1893, when suddenly confidence collapsed. There may be a boom on now, or beginning, and it is necessary to prevent that. &#34; The banks&#39; business is to lend money,&#34; added  His  Honor, &#34; and if they can lend it safely, I can hardly understand any artificial motive preventing them from doing it.&#34; &#34; Looking at the thing fairly and squarely,&#34; said

                                &#34; one might think that was so, if the banker finds it more to his interest to keep his money from investing with the idea of getting higher rates.&#34;

                            <para>His Honor : *&#39; Then, too, the banks lost the power of issuing notes, this having been taken over for the purpose of carrying out the Commonwealth necessary expenses, public matters requiring money. That would contract the amount of money available by the banks for lending. Then &#39;they looked for deposits to lend, and there has been keen competition for deposits.

                                <para>- Very well. What position on this question do the Labour party in New South Wales take up ? Are they prepared to hand over the State Savings Bank to the Commonwealth simply because that proposal is advocated from the other side of the Senate? There is no bigger champion or better defender of the State Savings&#39;Bank than is the present Labour Government in New South Wales. Do my honorable friends opposite mean to tell me that the State Ministers are not just as keenly interested in the workers of New South Wales as they are ? At any rate they have the responsibility of representing the Labour element there. They were returned pledged to a platform and a policy, and are keenly interested in seeing to the welfare of the workers in the State, and guarding their millions against interference from the Federal sphere, and therefore I think their opinion ought to be respected. </para>

                                <para>- I am speaking of New South Wales. This difference of opinion does not tend, I admit, to make the feeling between the Labour party here and the State Labour party too pleasant, but that is their funeral, not mine. At the last election this was one of the difficulties which our honorable friends had to face, and there was a penalty to pay. As far as one can sum up the present situation in New South Wales - though, possibly, I may be speaking from a partisan standpoint - the Labour party are in no better position there to-day, in view of the recent action of their State friends. The differences of opinion which are expressed from time to time do not tend to improve matters. Let me quote the opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Griffith,</inline> whose views carry some weight in New South Wales. He is a strong personality in the Public Works Department. </para>

                                <para>- It is quite true, I admit. At the same time it does not make for solidarity, if my honorable friends talk about going to the country over this question, when members of the State party take a different view. It cannot make for the success of the Labour party at the poll. During this debate we have heard a good deal of the effect of combines and trusts. This is the usual cry which, of course, we must expect. Very little evidence or proof has been offered. I listened carefully to hear any real solid facts concerning the practical effect of trusts, but I do not think that any honorable senator quoted a figure to show that any increases in prices of recent years can be definitely attributed to trusts. I have heard references to the Beef Trust, and have been told about beef generally rising in price; but I have heard nothing to associate the Beef Trust with the higher prices of beef. Against that contention let me quote the opinion of a gentleman in New South Wales who was intrusted by the State Government with the responsibility of inquiring into the distribution of food. During the electoral campaign it was generally stated, and the statement was made much use of by honorable senators opposite, that there were combines in twenty-four or twenty-five callings, and that the grievance was not so much the actual cost of the primary products as the cost to the consumer and the means of distribution. It was said that there was a corner here and a combine there, and that by the time the consumer got an article he had to pay a very much enhanced price. </para>

                                    Bavin was the gentleman appointed by the State Government to go into the question of how combines affected the prices charged to the public. I quote from his report. He says -

                            <para>Prices are not seriously affected by combinations or rings of persons actually engaged in tha production or distribution of eatables. In the fish trade there is no evidence of combination of any kind. In the meat trade there is evidence that one firm controls a great proportion of the wholesale mutton business at Glebe Island, and that certain firms in the same business which appear to be in competition with this firm are not really so. The firm in question has powerful competitors, however, and there is nothing to show that its power has been used to the detriment of the consumer. </para>

                            <para>Although there is an association of master bakers, which fixes the price of bread from time to time, there is no indication that excessive or unreasonable rates are fixed, or that they would be adhered to if they were, nor is there any penalty for failure to observe them. Flour quotations are fixed by agreement between the city millers. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bavin</inline> could not say whether the prices fixed were above fair competitive prices or not. The price fixed does not always appear to be observed by the members of the association, and in other ways the competition between millers seems to be keen. &#34; On the evidence I have been able to obtain,&#34; says <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bavin,</inline> &#34; I see no reason to suppose that the price of bread is appreciably increased through the combination amongst the millers.&#34; So far as the milk trade is concerned, there is an association of dairymen which fixes prices, but nothing in the nature of a ring or combine which eliminates competition. </para>

No greater hold-up ever took place in the history of Australia. The public were clamouring for coal, and they had to get it to carry on the various industries. The railways, the ferry steamers, the gas companies, and those engaged in other industries, all required coal, and there was not a pound of it being produced. I have gone to some trouble to find out whether my statement or that made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> was true. I assure the honorable senator that if I found that I was wrong in the statement I made I should be the first to apologize to him.

                                <para>- He was leading the Labour party, and the honorable senator took the view that I take now. I would not sign that pledge, for the same reason that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> offered when returning thanks, that it would bind him down to break the bond between him and his constituents. I have proved that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> stood in the interests of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> at that time when they refused to sign the pledge put forward by the Central Labour Electoral League to be signed by properly accredited Labour candidates at that particular election. They were declared bogus by the central body in their manifesto issued over <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson&#39;s</inline> signature. I have therefore proved all I had to prove, that my statement in the first place was absolutely correct. </para>

In the 1894 election, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hanney</inline> was the selected Labour man sent from Sydney by the Labour Electoral League, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kohn,</inline> a Socialist from Sydney, spoke on his behalf.

                            <para>. - The presentation of the Address-in-Reply to the Governor-General has always appeared to me to be an extremely tame ceremony. On this occasion we ought to do the thing properly or not at all. On several occasions when I have accompanied the  President  not more than half-a-dozen honorable senators thought it worth their while to go into the Library to meet  His Excellency.  When there is a large number of honorable senators in the building and they can go without any inconvenience to themselves, it is only right and proper, I think, to do the business in a satisfactory manner. I suggest that on this occasion we should roll up and give the new Governor-General a better welcome in this regard than his predecessors received. I hope that the Senate will act upon my suggestion. </para>

I do make a special appeal to the Senate to allow me an opportunity to present the Defence Bill. It is not a big measure, and I shall not occupy time to any great extent. I feel that after having introduced the Bill there will be the customary request made for an adjournment of the debate to the next day of sitting. If, however, honorable senators persist with the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> they will see that this Bill, small in itself, but still important to the working of the defence system, possibly may go over to next week here and make a belated appearance elsewhere. I tell the Senate that, in the interests of the Defence Forces, I am very desirous of getting the Bill passed into law. I do hope that, in view of this statement, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> will at least withdraw, temporarily, his motion, and enable me to present the Bill </para>

As regards the little Bill to which the Minister has referred, he introduced it here last session; and if he had been a little milder in his temper I have not the least doubt that it would have been passed; but his impetuosity lost him an opportunity. I can assure the Government that there is no intention in the Senate to &#34; stonewall &#34; anything. I hope that the work which we are anxious to see completed here will take very little time, and before the double dissolution comes the Minister will have plenty of opportunities of dealing with his little ewe lamb - the amending Defence Bill. </para>

                    <para class="block">The action which the Opposition have taken this afternoon may appear drastic, but it will be noticed by members of the Senate and the public generally that the Leader of the Government in this Chamber practically abdicated his position when he refused to move a motion in connexion with the Address-in-Reply. When the honorable senator took that course it was necessary in order that we might be able to go on with the business to suspend the Standing Orders, as the Opposition could not take over Government as well as private members&#39; business. The motion I now submit for the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into everything in connexion with the Teesdale Smith contract is very different from the amendment carried upon the Address-in-Reply. The amendment only condemned the action of the Government for letting contracts without calling for tenders. The object of the motion I am now proposing is to make inquiries, not only as to the letting of a particular contract without tenders, but as to the means used by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith to induce the Government or the officials to influence the Minister in giving that contract. Its object also is to ascertain what would be a reasonable price for carrying out the work of the contract; whether, in letting it, the consideration of urgency was the only motive that actuated the Government, and whether any urgency in the matter really existed. There are many other phases of the question on which evidence should be taken in order to test the accuracy of some of the statements that have been made by members and supporters of the Government and by the officers who advised them. One statement made by the late Engineer-in-Chief of the Commonwealth railways was that he requested several influential and important individuals to go to Port Augusta, make inquiries as to the construction of the line, and put in prices. With one exception we never heard of any of these gentlemen, and we should like to get evidence on that matter. As the Minister of Defence is in such a hurry to get on to the large volume of Government business on the paper, I shall not labour this question any further. </para>

                            <para>- I was rather surprised at the attitude the Minister of Defence took up in connexion with the Address-in-Reply. Every member of the Senate, and every member of the community who has followed the debates in both Houses of this Parliament during the last few weeks, must be convinced of the necessity of an inquiry into the Teesdale Smith contract. An inquiry is necessary, because the Government have shuffled and refused information until it was squeezed out of them by all the processes which are available in Parliament. We know that a great deal of information is still required, aud it can be obtained by the cross-examination on oath of individuals. Strange to say, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith and the late Engineer-in-Chief of Commonwealth railways have been very close friends. They have been in partnership to some extent, and we want to get at the bottom of that sympathetic partnership, and find out what part it played in this smellful  contract. We want to know how it is that the Government were so lax in their administration as to permit this contract to be entered into without knowing the facts. These things can only be brought out by putting the individuals who have played a leading part in the matter on their oath. A number of accusations have been made against both of these men, and we are in duty bound to give them an opportunity to put their side and reply to the charges made against them. It would be very unfair that members of this Parliament should make such accusations against them without giving them an opportunity to be heard. The appointment of a Select Committee for the purpose of conducting an inquiry is the proper course to take for the settlement of so controversial a matter. It is only fair to the two men to whom I have referred, to political parties in this Parliament, and to the public, that an inquiry into this contract should be made, and that we should learn what means are adopted by the present Administration to safeguard the public funds. </para>

                            <para>- As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has already stated, there are many other things to be inquired into besides the letting of this contract without tenders being called. The amendment upon the Address-in-Reply merely condemned the principle of letting contracts without the safeguard of public competition. It should be remembered, also, that on the amendment the Senate divided, presumably upon party lines, whilst in the motion now submitted there is provision made for the appointment of three representatives of the party on the Government side. That provides a safeguard against any one-sided or faked verdict by the proposed Select Committee. The representatives of the Ministerial party on the Committee will have an ample opportunity to elicit any information that will tend to bring out the whole truth. It was merely a party statement to suggest that it is proposed to in any way give a prejudged verdict. The publication of the evidence of the Select Committee will render it impossible to suppress the facts, even though honorable senators desired that they should be suppressed. It is a statement impossible of refutation that the motion provides every opportunity for eliciting the whole truth in connexion with this matter. </para>

                            <para>- I must say that I cannot compliment my honorable friends opposite upon their sporting instincts. One would have thought that, placed as 1 am here, they would not have been so supersensitive. I have no sense of obligation to honorable senators opposite for any undue generosity, because, in view of the disparity between our numbers, one would have imagined that they would not have been quite so ready to avail themselves of any advantage which they thought an accidental remark or the use of the Standing Orders would afford them. When I was interrupted I was repeating the statement with which this motion was launched. The Leader of the Opposition said that I had abdicated my position. I want to say that I wish I could abdicate it. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> imagines that I have been filled with a perfect hysteria of enjoyment during the time that has elapsed since this Parliament met, he is making a fatal mistake. I am waiting till circumstances will permit me to abdicate - 1. am anxious for the opportunity to arise. The reason I wish to abdicate my position is that the action taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> to-day is quite in keeping with the policy which he and his friends have followed ever since Parliament met. Without any regard to the condition of the business-paper or the intentions of the Government, they have done nothing but pursue a policy of taking the business out of the hands of the Government-- </para>

I venture to say that this Chamber would not go so far as to affirm that under no circumstances should any contract be let without calling for tenders. There may be circumstances under which such a course of conduct would be absolutely justified. It is alleged by the Government that the urgency which existed for the completion of the work undertaken by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith was a justification for its action. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> says that he wants to inquire into that. In other words, he wishes to inquire into what he has condemned the Government for doing. If that is not recording a verdict first and inquiring into the facts afterwards, I am unable to understand the meaning of simple language. </para>

But I am entirely reasonable under the influence of mathematical considerations. I say that the demand for the appointment of this Committee would have presented a very much better appearance had it been brought forward without the &#34; tack &#34; to the Address-in-Reply to the Governor-General&#39;s Speech. Whatever may be said to the contrary, the fact remains that it is now proposed to create a Committee to inquire into a matter of administration in respect of which this Chamber has already recorded an adverse verdict. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot help thinking that it is sinking into the minds of honorable senators opposite that they would have been in a stronger position if, instead of recording the verdict which they did a few minutes ago, they had first pressed for an inquiry into the facts, which would have enabled them to return an unbiased verdict. I am not going to oppose the constitution of the Committee. A similar case has arisen here before. I regard this proposal as another expression of determination on the part of the Opposition not to devote its great strength to pressing forward with legislative proposals for the good of the country, but to use it for the purpose of obstructing and harassing the Government in its administrative work. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator may put it in that way if he chooses. But I would point out that from the time this Parliament met, the Opposition in this Chamber have done nothing but continually follow the course which I have indicated. By means of motions, by calling for papers, by the appointment of Select Committees, and by taking the control of business out of the hands of the Government, they have demonstrated again and again that their one object is not to proceed with their legislative duties, but to harass and obstruct the Ministry. </para>

There are dozens of things in connexion with which there is nothing to conceal, and in connexion with which there is no cause for an inquiry. However, as I recognise that the Senate intends to appoint this Committee, I can only express the hope that those who have been nominated from this side of the chamber will see fit to take part in its proceedings. I express that hope because it seems to me that this is a matter of public importance, and that the work of the Committee will be largely nullified if there are not upon it those representatives, who will, by the exercise of their right to cross-examine witnesses, be able to elicit information upon all points, and thus insure that the inquiry shall be more exhaustive and impartial than it otherwise would be. </para>

                        <para>. - I am surprised at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> endeavouring to confuse an amendment on the Address-in-Reply with the verdict that this Committee will give. The two things are as wide apart as the poles. The amendment to the Address-in-Reply expressed condemnation of the Government for letting a contract for railway construction without the safeguard of public competition. There can be no inquiry into that aspect of the Teesdale Smith contract, because the Government have admitted in both Houses that they did let a costly contract without the safeguard of public competition. The Government have pleaded guilty to that charge, or have pleaded urgency as an excuse. If I thought that my action in voting for that amendment would conflict with my duties as a member of the Committee, or if the Government had any one to put in my place, I should willingly stand down. I do not regard the question which the Committee has to consider as a party matter. The question of the contract will be inquired into, and all the questions which the Government themselves have brought up will also be considered. In the press within the last day or two <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly</inline> has instituted a comparison between this and the Queanbeyan railway. It will therefore be essential for the Committee to inquire whether the work in the two cases is similar. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly</inline> is evidently under the impression that it is. </para>

                            <para>- That, also, will come within the scope of the inquiry. If all these contracts are similar, then presumably this contract will be justified. I have taken an active part in trying to find out the truth in regard to it, and I am convinced that we must have a properly appointed tribunal to take and sift the evidence of all the people interested in it. There is no ground for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> &#39;s complaint that, in deciding that the granting of contracts without calling for public tenders deserves condemnation, we have already arrived at a verdict, the honorable senator apparently thinking that the verdict will be arrived at on party lines. He referred to other Committees that had been appointed; but he has very little to complain of with regard either to the appointment of Committees or the transaction of business by the Senate. We have frequently suspended the Standing Orders to enable the Government to bring business forward. I suppose, for every occasion on which our side - which consists of twenty-nine members - has asked for the suspension of the Standing Orders, the Government have asked for it six times, and got it. The Senate has expedited Government business; and if the Minister has any business on the paper that he thinks urgent, I shall be prepared to sit till any hour to give him an opportunity to get on with it. </para>

                            <para>- I regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> should have gone out of his way to complain about the business being taken out of the hands of the Government. I regret, also, that the Senate appears almost to have adopted the practice of expediting its business by suspending the Standing Orders. I find on running through the <inline font-style="italic">Journals</inline> of the Senate that the Standing Orders were suspended last session an extraordinary number of times. In fact, Ministers secured the suspension almost every time they asked for it. I put that fact forward in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> querulous complaints. The honorable senator, when we ask for the appointment of a Select Committee, should do the Senate the credit of believing that any honorable senator appointed to the Committee - no matter which side he sits on - will be prepared to be guided in the decision that he arrives at by the evidence that he hears. It is unfair for a gentleman holding the position that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> holds to endeavour, because he happens to be in a minority, to reflect on the Senate in a way which must tend to belittle its reputation. I do not claim to have often gone out of my way to treat <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> generously, but I have frequently complained about other members of the party treating him too generously, and his unjust and querulous complaints tonight are not a fair return for the generous treatment that he has received. I believe the majority of the Senate will continue to extend generosity to the Government in order to facilitate public business. Judging by the division lists, the Government have not had a quorum of their own supporters in the Senate since the beginning of this Parliament - that is their misfortune, not their fault - but during the whole of the tedious session of last year there was only one count-out, and that was due to an honorable senator on the Ministerial side using his position to insult other senators. If the Committee is to report by 24th June, it should be constituted as soon as possible by the method proposed by the Leader of the Opposition. If it gets to work quickly, I see no reason why it should not report by the date appointed. No matter what party constitutes a majority of the Committee, I firmly believe that it will investigate the question altogether free from party bias. While I remain a member of the Senate I hope I shall always keep myself free from giving the public an opportunity to condemn us by condemning ourselves. I protest against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> unfair and ungenerous attitude on this question, and assure him that his complaint is not based on facts. We have allowed the Government to adjourn at 9 o&#39;clock at night. Whenever there were reasonable grounds for an adjournment the honorable senator has never had to ask the Leader of the Opposition twice for his consent. My complaint against the Leader of the Opposition has been that he has given more concessions to the Government than to members of his own party. &#34; There is no justification for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> statement that the Committee has already arrived at its decision. The Committee is moved for by one member of the Senate, the Leader of the Labour party, and the amendment to the Address-in-Reply was moved by another member of the Senate, whom I may call the leader of the small party. There is a distinct difference between the two questions, as I have already shown. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae&#39;s</inline> amendment was moved before the motion for a Select Committee was placed on the business-paper. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> with his trickiness - for which he has earned a widespread reputation throughout New South Wales, where he is noted for the skilful and unscrupulous manner in which he twists words and positions - has tried to make it appear that we are endeavouring to do something that should not be done. I feel so little personal interest in the Committee that if any member on the Ministerial side objected to my presence on it I should be quite willing to stand down. I am not interested in what the verdict of the Committee will be, except so far as it deals with a matter that concerns the interests of the public. I stated my opinions on the contract in the Address-in-Reply debate. I did all that any man could be reasonably expected to do to ascertain the truth of the matter, because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> and I walked for 30 miles after leaving the railway to the end of the contract and 30 miles back, and what we saw during that walk justifies me in saying that the Government will be well advised to send their own members to take part in the investigation with open minds. I hope the Government will not object to the motion. If they do it will weaken their position, because it will make it appear that they are afraid to have a. contract into which they have entered inquired into. There are good reasons why it should be inquired into. There is a short stretch of railway on the Queanbeyan line where there are hard cuttings. None such exists on this line. There is on the Queanbeyan line a steel bridge spanning a stream 60 or 70 feet across. There are also four or five steel-girder overhead bridges, with embankments made up, and yet the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs says that that work is on all-fours with the contract for earthworks on the transcontinental line. The contract given to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith was not a contract for building a railway. It was merely a contract for earthworks. It will be well for the Committee to get to work quickly and energetically, and furnish a report to the Senate showing exactly the position of the earthworks, the sort of contract that was entered into, and the sort of business methods the Government have adopted in dealing with a matter which is not their or our immediate concern, but that really concerns the general public, who have to foot the bill. </para>

Personally, I do not object to an inquiry being held into this or any other thing which the Government have done. If a mistake has been made, let us know where it lies. The Opposition have been so gravelled for matter for charges against the Government that every single member of it has run as far as he could go in regard to this contract. Every member of the Opposition whom it is proposed to place on the Select Committee has spoken in the strongest terms about this contract. Indeed, some of them have not been above imputing unworthy motives to the Government. The Leader of the Opposition in another place went throughout the country speaking of the contract, talking about side doors, and charging us with doing the thing in secrecy, even charging the Attorney-General with being a party to the matter, in order to convey the impression to the public that this had been a very iniquitous transaction. </para>

                            <para>- I do not deny the statement, nor do I affirm it, but it is a wrong issue to raise when we are dealing with a purely business transaction. The Leader of the Opposition should have been the last man to propose to go on to a Select Committee, because he went round the country and told the people that the Government had let a contract under which they were paying 4s. 6d. a yard for work which was worth only 6d. or 8d. a yard. I think that here he said it was worth only 9d. or10d. a yard. </para>

I am told that this demand for an inquiry is not a party matter. It has been a party matter from the very beginning. The whole reason for raising the question has been to try to damage the Government. It is not the Government who are on their trial in this matter, but it is the members of the Opposition, who have been making these charges. They cannot prove the charges, and, therefore, they want to try to find out if there is any ground for them. Another object they have is to try to damage <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane.</inline> We all remember the Chinn inquiry, and the attempts that were made day after day to damage the reputation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane.</inline></para>

                            <para>- We have heard a great deal about the iniquity of the Government letting contracts without calling for tenders. Where were these honorable senators who are so supremely virtuous to-day when the Labour Government let a contract for &#163;4,000 to the Wireless Ltd. Company without calling for tenders; a contract for &#163;37,500 worth of powellised sleepers to a Victorian company without calling for tenders; and a large survey contract without calling for tenders? These particularly virtuous gentlemen had nothing to find fault with then. </para>

I have no objection to an inquiry being held into the letting of this contract to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith, but if it was desired to have a perfectly fair and impartial inquiry, why was not an outside authority proposed in the shape of a police magistrate or a County Court Judge, or some other person who is absolutely aloof from anything which has taken place, and who would bring in a verdict that would be without challenge? I think that the public will not take much notice of the verdict from the proposed Committee. I do not fear the result of an inquiry. It will be found that if a mistake has been made it has been an honest mistake, and that both <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> and the Minister are absolutely free from blame. </para>

                        <para>.- It is a most extraordinary thing that when members of the Opposition call public attention to some of the mistakes of the Government, and follow up their action in the public interest by asking for an inquiry, because they are strong enough to force an inquiry from the Government, the gentlemen to conduct the inquiry are referred to as a biased or a packed Committee. Our honorable friends have gone even so far as to call a Judge of a State Supreme Court, who was Chairman of a Royal Commission, a &#34; chartered bully.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- For a great wonder the honorable senator has not done that. But he knows that the gentleman whom he follows so loyally in this Chamber has indulged more than once in all the expressions I have just quoted. If he is as anxious as lie  professes  to be for an inquiry, why does he not let us have it? Why does he not court the fullest possible investigation from every standpoint? Notwithstanding the sneers and the jeers at the idea of honorable senators on this side properly arid judicially carrying out the inquiry, I am confident that they will go thoroughly into the matter on behalf of those who  sent them here, and make their recommendations as honest, fair, fearless, and clean minded men. We can afford to pass by the jeers that so frequently emanate from the Government, who are in a wretched minority here, and who are constantly appealing for mercy - a mercy which is too frequently extended to them. </para>

                            <para>- We get insulted for our pains and our  genorosity.  The Government are not entitled to a moment&#39;s consideration.  If they had any political decency, if they had a spark of manhood about them, they would not be on the Treasury bench. I am sick and tired of hearing these recriminations from the other side against the members of the Opposition, who have been actuated solely by a sense of public duty. I want the Select Committee to ascertain if there were not in Australia other reputable contractors - and no doubt <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith is one - who would have been glad to tender for this work had an opportunity been given to them. We know of two reputable contractors who would have been only too anxious to compete for the work which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith has carried out. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has said that the Labour Government let a contract for the erection of wireless works without calling for tenders, knowing, as well as I do, that there was no other firm in Australia capable of undertaking the task, and that, therefore, there was no other firm able to send in a tender. </para>

                            <para>- The Shaw Wireless Company Limited imported, as the Minister knows, special machinery, at a cost of nearly &#163;40,000, to take up the wireless work of Australia. The company were well equipped to undertake any class of work in connexion .with our wireless system ; but they are not getting any work from the present Government. It only shows how hard pushed our honorable friends opposite are to justify their action in the present case, when they have to call to their assistance an instance of the kind I have mentioned, although they know they are misleading the Senate, and indulging in statements which are nothing short of misrepresentations. I would not have risen, had it not&#39; been - for the remarks made by the Vice-President of the Executive Council. I am delighted at the attitude which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Oakes</inline> has taken up in this matter. He realizes that, as a representative of the people, he has a duty to perform, and he has announced his intention of taking a seat on the Select Committee, and seeing that the whole matter is thoroughly inquired into. I feel sure that honorable senators on this side will be glad to see his action emulated by those honorable senators on the other side whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has nominated to sit on the Select Committee. </para>

                        <para>.- -I am rather astonished at the  ungracious  manner in which the representatives of the Government have  received  this motion. In the ordinary curse, if a man is charged with a misdemeanour, and knows that he has done nothing wrong, the one thing he welcomes is an inquiry. If we judge the Government by that standard - and I think it is a very fair one - we ought to be all the more zealous in pursuing this case. If there is nothing to hide, if the Government have been perfectly fair and aboveboard, then the more deeply the matter is inquired into the better will they appear before the people. For that reason, the Government ought to welcome the appointment of a Select Committee; but, instead of doing that, we find the Minister of Defence trying to prejudice the Committee in the minds of the people by making an assertion which is without the slightest foundation, namely, that the Senate has already pronounced the verdict. It has done nothing of the kind. If the honorable senator will only read the motion which the Senate agreed to this afternoon, he will see that the one thing in connexion with this matter which is dealt with in the motion, is the letting of a contract &#34; without providing the safeguard of public &#39; competition.&#34; Shortly after the present Government took office, it was given forth with a blare of trumpets that every work conducted under the auspices of the Government was to be the subject of a contract. When one hears of a contract he associates with it immediately the idea of tendering and public competition. It is not assumed that a contract will be let in some office without the knowledge of any body, and at the contractor&#39;s own price and conditions. It is assumed that the contract will be submitted to the ordeal of public competition. That was the declared policy of the present Government. I need hardly say that the Opposition were against the policy of constructing public works by the contract system, and believed in the day-labour system. The present Government said, &#34; We will have no more of this costly system of day labour; we will go in for contracts.&#34; We find the most extraordinary allegations made with regard to this contract. If I were a member of the Government, and felt as virtuous as some members of the Government appear to be, the one thing for which I should ask in this connexion would be an inquiry, and I should not rest until I got it. If some of the references to the contract have even a shadow of truth about them, something has taken place in connexion with it which is far from the strict path of rectitude. I may be permitted to refer to the late Chief Engineer, and a certain telegram he received from another contractor, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Timms,</inline> who offered to compete with others for a particular work which he mentioned. According to the printed correspondence, at the very time <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> received that telegram he must have been in communication with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith about the contract, which that gentleman ultimately obtained. What does <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deane</inline> do? He conveniently forgets all about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Timms&#39;</inline> telegram, and lets the contract to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith without offering it to public competition. That story may be true, but it does not look very true. Here is a man who has held a high public position, who has been in charge of railway construction by the Federal authorities, and his memory is so defective that he entirely failed to remember the receipt of an important telegram in connexion with a very substantial piece of work which he, as the agent of the Government, was at that moment contemplating. The story seems to me to be an &#39; extraordinary one. Then when we come to the Minister we find that he consents to conditions in the contract which promise <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith, if &#39;he performs the work under it to the satisfaction of the Engineer-in-Chief, more work of the same kind. </para>

                                has done me the honour of proposing my name for the Select Committee, and I am prepared, in acting upon it, and to keep my mind as open as possible in order to see that justice is done. But when an honorable senator in advocating the appointment of the Committee takes it upon himself to read extracts from the printed correspondence laid before Parliament, he should not have carefully suppressed the telegram by
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly</inline>
                                which specially and definitely refers to the matter which he mentioned. That is putting honorable senators in an unfair position. I asked the honorable senator to read

                                telegram of the 26th February, 1914, which was written directly after the contract was submitted to him for signature.

He took the recommendation as applying to the section from 92 to 106 miles. He remembers that the recommendation in question was handed to the Minister shortly after he and the others arrived, and that, after reading it, the Minister asked the Engineer-in-Chief whether he had satisfied himself as to the rates asked for being, if anything, slightly less than the rates paid by the Government of South Australia to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith for similar work, and that on receipt of the Engineer-in-Chief&#39;s  assurance of this fact, 1 stamped my approval on the papers. </para>

He suggested that, because Senators Gardiner, McGregor, Buzacott, and myself had given a vote against the Government on an amendment dealing with the question, we were, therefore, going on to the Committee committed to a certain verdict. If that is true, is it not equally true that Senators Oakes and Gould are committed to an opposite verdict, for did they not vote against the amendment? What an absurd conclusion for any man to come to. He must have thought he was speaking to children. Perhaps he thought he was at his old game of throwing dust in the eyes of the electors, and forgot that he was talking here to people who have their eyes open. I am going into this question with an open mind. I have not spoken on it, nor do I intend to do so, and I propose giving a fair and honest vote according to the evidence submitted. </para>

                        <para>. - The Senate must be obliged to both <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Oakes</inline> for their little homilies on party morality. I should not have spoken in reply but for some of the remarks of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, who, like a certain little animal in America, when put into a tight corner, always endeavours to make the atmosphere as unpleasant as he possibly can. He quoted some remarks of mine from a Benalla newspaper. He had no need to go to that authority for them, seeing that I made them in the Senate, and if he had been in his place at the time he would have heard them. I still say that for ordinary earthworks in side cutting and side drains the prices paid are from 6d. to 101/2d.  per yard. I did not say anything about what ought to be paid for centre cuttings or things of that description. It must be evident to all who have listened to the debate that some investigation into the prices that wo are told have been agreed to in connexion with the contract is necessary, no matter what we did to-day in regard to the Address-in-Reply. We have heard contradictory statements from senators quoting from papers that have been laid on the table of the House, and we are not certain that all the papers are here yet. They have come in in dribs and drabs to both Houses, so that, like Oliver Twist, we are still anxious for more, and we do not know whether there are any more to come or not. We think it necessary to find out. One honorable senator reads an extract from the papers showing the course of action taken by the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs; and an honorable senator on this side reads another quotation wherein that gentleman denies that he did a certain thing, which he subsequently admits that he did do. I cannot make it out myself, and that is one of the reasons, why the appointment of a Select Committee is necessary. I should like to ask those honorable senators who made insinuations about prejudice and party bias on the part of Senators Mullan, Buzacott,. Gardiner, and myself, whether they have been in any Parliament where, in the appointment of Select Committees, the party element has not been recognised as far as possible? Can they remember one- </para>

                            <para>- I appreciate the courtesy of the Senate and the restraint which the Government put upon themselves in not opposing the course of action suggested. I am sure it will facilitate the passage of these Bills, and consequently bring us much nearer the consideration of that Government business which the Minister of Defence and the Vice-President of the Executive Council think of so much importance. We all remember the history of these amendments of the Constitution, covering the period from 1911 up to the present time. &#34; When they were first put to the people, the people had very little understanding of what they really meant, and the misrepresentations of those opposed to them so acted on the people&#39;s mind that they were defeated by nearly a quarter of a million votes; but when, after two years&#39; further experience and consideration, another opportunity was given to the people to vote on them, the majority against them was reduced by over 200,000 votes. Those who support them conscientiously believe that the people are so aroused to their own interests that if they get another opportunity of dealing with them, they will carry them by a majority almost equal to the majority against them in 1911. The Bill dealing with trade and commerce may be considered the most important and far-reaching of the six. The trade and commerce of a country affects not only every man, woman, and child, but almost every animal and article in it. We have endeavoured by legislation so to regulate the business of Australia, so far as the trade and commerce powers of the Constitution allow us, that an honest deal shall be given to every member of the community. We know that legislation of that kind in the United States of America has, up to the present, been a failure. We endeavoured, in passing our Commerce Act, to make the commerce of Australia an example to the rest of the world. Every one knows that by means of our Customs and Excise powers we can deal with a great many things that are imported into this country. We can examine goods, and see that they are true to description, but as soon as they are landed and go from the control of the  Customs Department into the various warehouses of the great cities, anything can be done with them. In fact they can be distributed to the retailers in a shape entirely different from that in which they pass the Customs at the ship&#39;s side. I shall not labour the question, but it has become abundantly evident to almost the whole community that our power as exercised up to the present by means of the Commerce Act has been a failure, and that we are not in a. position to protect the public. The States may do it. They have the power probably to do it, and some of the States have done a great deal in connexion with foods, drugs, and things of that kind. But until the power is given to the Commonwealth Parliament to make Federal laws of that description we shall not have fulfilled the true object of Federation. I might point out a simple item. We have a great industry known as the dairying industry. Under our commerce legislation, the Commonwealth has power to decide the amount of moisture that shall be used in butter produced for export. We can see that the foreigner is protected against fraudulent methods in the dairying industry, but, as regards the Australian consumer, those who are prepared to manipulate the butter industry can fleece the public as much as they like in connexion with moisture and other frauds, as was proved by a Royal Commission that sat in Victoria some years ago; and ho doubt the revelations then made are still fresh in the minds of many people in Australia. Seeing that we are desirous of assisting the Government to get the vast amount of business they have to do put through in as short a time as possible, it would be folly on my part to deal exhaustively with any of these measures. Consequently, I will proceed to explain the object of the second Bill, just to initiate a debate that may be carried on, I hope briefly, by honorable senators in connexion with the six measures. The second Bill deals with corporations. Those who are informed on the financial and industrial affairs of Australia, and the company-mongering that has been going on here for the last twenty or thirty years, must realize, I feel sure, that it is nearly time that the Commonwealth took a hand to protect the innocent public from the fraudulent machinations of some of those who are prepared to prey upon the people. The third Bill relates to trusts and monopolies. I could very probably occupy the time of the Senate for the rest of this evening and part of to-morrow in dealing with these institutions. It has been stated by the supporters of the Government, and, for that matter, by the Government too, that the Labour party are making their election cry that of trusts and monopolies. If the Labour party had nothing else to justify their existence their opposition to trusts and monopolies would be quite enough to bring them into favour with the people. A few years ago, we were told that there was no such thing in Australia; and not very long ae;o <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Oakes</inline> persisted in telling the people, through the Senate, that there was no great harm done by the operations of the trusts and monopolies. </para>

                            <para>- They may not. The fourth Bill deals with industrial matters. I do not think that I need say very much on this subject, because for the last, three or four weeks we have had industrial matters threshed threadbare in another place, and all the people in Australia have probably been taking notice, too. The fifth Bill relates to disputes on railways, , the property of the States. If there is  anything  that would be in the interests of the States, it would be the. existence of a tribunal which would make? it impossible for the employes on the railways to strike at any time, and which would bring about uniform conditions in the States, as far as possible. The last Bill refers to the nationalization of industries declared to be monopolies. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Oakes</inline> if what we have seen in the newspapers, what we have heard from various platforms, what has been acknowledged by nearly all the people in Australia is true - that a Beef Trust is amongst us ? Various reasons have been assigned for the increased prices of meat. Scarcity of . stock, increased wages, improved conditions - all these have been referred to as the prime causes for the increased prices of meat to the consumers. Although they may have had a very insignificant influence up to the present time, or are likely to have in the future, there is some other influence that is to a considerable extent hampering our meat consumers. I want to give one instance. The sum of 2s. was paid for the killing of a beast in the abattoirs of some States, and that rate distributed over the weight of a carcase would not be the thirtieth part of a penny on a pound. To talk of the influence of increased rates of wages or improved conditions on the price of meat at present is very much like comparing the action of summer breezes with the hurricanes of the Pacific. I desire to give the Senate the result of a few inquiries I have been making recently in connexion with the effect of the increased prices of meat on the public of Australia, and as an indication of how much combines, trusts, or monopolies in the meat industry can afford to destroy the competition of almost anybody out of the profits it is possible for them to make. I find that the Australians are the greatest meat-consuming people in the world, consuming almost double the quantity that is consumed in any other country. In the United States of America, approximately, the annual consumption per head of the population is 150 lbs. ; in Great Britain, it is 117 lbs. per head; while in Australia in 1912 - the latest year for which I could get information - the consumption, approximately, was 276 lbs. per head. An increase of $d. per lb. in the price of meat consumed in Australia amounts to &#163;2,750,000 per annum. That would be a nice little revenue for any institution that could partially corner the meat industry in this country. An in crease of Id. in the pound amounts to &#163;5,500,000; an increase of 2d., to &#163;11,000,000; and an increase of 4d., to &#163;22,000,000. Honorable senators may base their calculations on these figures, and can be certain of their accuracy, going  up to any price they like. When we learn that the small increase of Jd., or Id. or 2d. in the lb., means such a large amount of money, I ask honorable senators what is the taxation of the States, or of the Commonwealth, compared to the taxation which can be levied by monopolies or trusts of the description that the sixth measure is supposed to deal with. If the Commonwealth gets the power to deal with industries that have got into the hands of destructive monopolists, and have the courage to use the power, it will to a very considerable extent curtail the viciousness of these institutions. But I have heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Oakes</inline> and others say that all monopolies, trusts and combines are not injurious. No Labour man ever said that they were all injurious. </para>

                            <para>- That is what really happens. But, as I have stated, there are combines that are not injurious. The greatest combines -in America to-day were not originally injurious. So long as they treated producer and consumer fairly they were not injurious, but as soon as they acquired a complete monopoly, and began to fleece consumers and sweat producers, their monopolies became destructive. The only way to deal with such monopolies is to nationalize them. The Government should take them over. There is no power in the community in a position to compete with them, except the Central Government. In the United States of America some of these monopolies have grown to such an extent that it is doubtful whether even the Central Government can now deal with them. But in Australia, where they are commencing, it is our duty to act in the interests of the people, and see that they never acquire here the power which similar combines have acquired in the United States of America. I have gone briefly through these various measures. Though the discussion upon each, if it were judicious to go into details, might occupy a whole evening, I desire to save time, and so content myself by moving the second reading of the Bill. </para>

                            <para>- I shall judge that when I see what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae&#39;s</inline> attitude is as it develops; that is to say, we shall see whether a debate can proceed without the honorable senator finding some points of difference with other honorable senators in this Chamber. The first amendment proposed is one which I venture&#34; to say will receive very general support. There is a section of the existing Act which provides that when an Australian, irrespective of any qualification or experience, seeks to join the Instructional Staff of the Defence Force, he is required to pass through an instructional school, whilst a man of equal or even lower rank in the British Army is not called upon to submit himself for examination or to undergo that course of instruction., but has merely to satisfy the Chief of the General Staff that he is qualified for the position he seeks to fill. It seems to me that that is decidedly unfair to a number of Australians who are as qualified as their British brothers-in-arms. I propose in this Bill an amendment of the existing Act to put them on one footing. Section 21b of the existing Act makes provision for an applicant for appointment to the Instructional Staff undergoing a course in an instructional school, but contains the proviso - </para>

                        <para>Persons who have acted as instructors in the British Army or who have served in the British Army and satisfy the Chief of the General Staff, may be appointed without passing through such course. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>It is proposed by this Bill to make this proviso read - &#34; or who have served either in the Defence Force or the British Army.&#34; </para>
                    <para>That will bring both on the same footing in this particular. .It will still be necessary for those who have been previously unqualified to submit themselves for examination and undergo the course. There are in the Defence Force warrant officers, such as sergeant-majors, who have served quite a number of years. They are under the existing Act unable to get on to the Instructional Staff without going through an instructional school, whilst a corporal in the British Army coming here may, without examination, secure a position which is denied to an Australian, who is better qualified to fill it. </para>
                    <para>The next amendment proposed is a comparatively simple one, and is designed to give the Department greater security in dealing with members of the Defence Force who fail to hand over property which belongs to tha Department. Section 79 of the existing Act reads at present - </para>

                    <para>The use of the word &#34; refuses &#34; is held by the legal advisers of the Crown to require an absolute  point-blank  refusal bv the person charged. It is proposed in clause 3 of the Bill to omit that word &#34;refuses,&#34; with a view to substituting for it the word &#34; fails.&#34; Under the existing Act, though a demand verbally or by letter may be made upon a man to return property, such as his rifle, and so on, belonging to the Department, so long as he holds his tongue he cannot be proved to have refused to return the property. </para>

                    <para>By clause 4 of the Bill, it is proposed to amend section 135 of the principal Act. The effect of the proposed amendment would be to remedy an omission which occurred in the passing of an amending Bill introduced some time ago by my predecessor in the Defence Department. That Bill endeavoured to effect a reform, which bad, I think, the hearty approval of every honorable member of this Parliament. It was a proposal to avoid the sending to gaol of those who had committed offences against the universal training provisions. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> introduced a Bill he was under the impression, as I think the Senate was generally, that the amendment he then submitted, and which was drafted, I suppose, by the parliamentary draftsman, would accomplish what he had in view. But it has been found that whilst it did exclude from the penalty of gaol those who were convicted of certain offences, it did not include the whole of those offences. The amendment that is proposed in this Bill is designed to stop that little gap which is due to faulty draftsmanship. Under this proposal nobody will be liable to  be sent to gaol for a breach of the training regulations under the Defence Act. </para>
                    <para>The Bill contains another amendment which is designed to limit the period for which any offender may be detained. At present there is practically no limit imposed, owing to the fact that an offence in itself is not wiped out by any punishment. For instance, a cadet who refuses to drill can be subjected to detention for a certain number of days. Upon his release, however, he is liable to be again proceeded against after he misses his first drill. It seems necessary, therefore, to limit the period during which he may be detained. In this connexion I am reminded of the case of a boy who, on three counts, was sentenced to be detained for a period of fifty days. A week after his release upon the first count he was again proceeded against. However, I stopped that second prosecution. It will thus be seen that, unless we are prepared to detain a lad for the term of his natural life, we must prescribe a limit. </para>

Before one can obtain a commission in the Army Medical Corps he must be a fully-qualified medical man, and it is not possible to obtain such men from the ranks. The same remark is applicable to the Army Veterinary Corps. There are no ranks upon which we can draw, and we cannot get from the ordinary ranks men who are medically qualified. We must, therefore, go outside, and invite medical men to come and accept these commissions. </para>

                            <para>- I am not prepared to say that the Department moves with unnecessary speed. But in a big continent like Australia it often happens that irregularities do not come under notice for a considerable time after their commission. I have given the Senate an instance in which I certainly feel that, as the result of the operation of the Act in its present form, there is retained to-day upon our active list a junior officer who is no credit to the Forces, and who ought not to be there. The particular offence alleged against him was not brought under notice until five months after its commission. There was a little preliminary knowledge in regard to it which set an inquiry going. But by the time the matter had gone through the ordinary channels, the six months had expired. In this matter the Senate may very well trust the Department not to use its powers unfairly. It must be recollected that we are now dealing with a force which, as we were reminded last week, is a compulsory one. If it were a volunteer force, and the trainee felt aggrieved, he could leave it. But in the case of a compulsory force he is not free to leave it. There is, therefore, an additional obligation placed on the Department to see that officers accepting positions of responsibility are required faithfully to discharge their duties. It is for that purpose that I am asking the Senate to extend the period during which proceedings may be taken against an offender from six to twelve months. From what I have said, I think it will be recognised that the measure is one which can be better dealt with in Committee. If I can assist honorable senators by giving them any further information, I shall be only too happy to do so. </para>

                        <para>. - I should like to bring under the notice of the Minister of Defence the position which obtains in the Federal Capital Territory. I wish to emphasize the languishing condition of affairs there. I have recently visited the Territory, and it seems to me that a number of necessary works are proceeding very slowly. In saying that, I am not casting any reflection on the Administrator. It appears to me, however, that money is being spent in a very niggardly fashion there, so that works are not progressing with the speed at which they ought to progress. It will be admitted, I think, that there should be some continuity of policy pursued there, and that a fairly even rate of expenditure should be maintained. Works ought not to be carried to a certain stage, and then a number of hands paid off because there are no funds available. The administrative expenses are the same whether operations are in full blast or otherwise. To my mind, matters are progressing in a way that is not conducive to the observance of business methods or to the attainment of that perfection which we might reasonably expect. I hope to have the assurance of the Minister that whatever works are to be undertaken in the Territory will be carried out with reasonable expedition. </para>

                        <para>. - - During the debate on the appointment of a Select Committee this evening, the Vice-President of the Executive Council said he had expected me to reply to-day to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith&#39;s letter published in the two morning papers of yesterday. I saw no particular necessity to drag on to the floor of the House a controversy started in the press, but as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> has referred to the matter, I take this opportunity of putting the facts before honorable senators. As soon as I saw <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith&#39;s</inline> letter I replied to it at once. It is not necessary for me to bring all the correspondence before the Senate, but in order to show what some members of the public think of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith&#39;s</inline> claim to have paid higher wages than he should, I may mention that between yesterday and to-day no fewer than three individuals, none of whom I had ever seen in my life before, so far as I remember, although one of them tells me that he met me in &#34;Western Australia some years ago, called here to give me information regarding the matters contained in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith&#39;s</inline> letter. I was careful to get the names of those three gentlemen, and informed them that in all probability they would have an opportunity, if the Select Committee was appointed, to give evidence before it. I do not know whether the Committee will have, power to inquire into <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith&#39;s</inline> other contracts, but, if they have, the evidence of these gentlemen should be interesting. The first of them was a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCulloch,</inline> who was an inspector on the railway in New South Wales on which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith had a contract. He came to me absolutely voluntarily yesterday afternoon, and told me that in connexion with that contract, on which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith</inline> claims to have paid more than the district rate of pay, the most shameful piece of sweating that has ever come under his notice was conducted. </para>

                            <para>- I think the contract was at Narrabri, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCulloch</inline> said that some of the men had actually to sue <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith</inline> in order to get 6s. a day out of him. According to the conditions of the contract there was to be no sub-letting on that railway. Mr Smith had the contract, and did sub-let in defiance of the terms of the contract. These men, in their sub-contract, were really not able, at the price he was paying, to make 6s. a day, and they had actually to go to Court before they could getit. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCulloch</inline> says that the records of this matter can be found in. the Police Court. The second gentleman, whose name is Busch, comes from Port Hedland, Western Australia, The Port Hedland-Marble Bar railway was constructed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith,</inline> who claims in his letter to have paid workers on that line 13s. 4d. a day. I am not going to contradict <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith&#39;s</inline> statement, but this man assured me that before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith</inline> paid that amount he endeavoured to get the work done at lis. 8d. per day, and it was not until there was a stoppage of the work that he paid the district rate of 13s. 4d. Port Hedland is in the northwest of Western Australia, and no work of a heavy kind is done in the north-west under &#163;4 a week, and a stoppage of work actually took place on the line until <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith</inline> paid the district wage. I mention these things to show how much&#39; credence can be given to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith&#39;s</inline> statements. The Government might well take a note of the 13s. 4d. per day rate. That is what the men at the western end of the transcontinental railway are endeavouring to get from the Government at the present time, and they certainly should get it, seeing that it is paid, not only by contractors at the western end of this line, but was even paid by such a notorious sweater as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith</inline> in the north-west. The third gentleman to call upon me to-day gave the name of Flegeltaub,  114 Gore-street, Fitzroy. He also gave me a lot of information about the sweating that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith</inline> was responsible for in the timber trade of Western Australia. Here are three independent witnesses voluntarily coming forward and giving me information in contradiction of the very  statements which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> said I ought to contradict. I do not desire to paint even the devil in any darker colours than are his due. I am merely stating the merest every-day opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Teesdale</inline> Smith when T say  that he is a well-known sweater. He is so well known in that character in Western Australia that it would be ridiculous for him to publish there the claim that he now puts forward to have paid more than he need pay for work done by him on his various contracts. </para>

                        <para>This year we purchased 5,000 copies at &#163;30 per 1,000, or a little over 7d. per copy. Of this number 3,000 copies were posted direct to farmers in America, as special efforts are being made to attract suitable settlers for the irrigation areas in New South Wales and Victoria.

                            I believe, desires to know why the Government paid 7d. per copy for a publication sold for 6d. per copy in Australia, especially as the matter is almost the same in the &#34; ordinary &#34; and &#34; Commonwealth &#34; issues, and the Government is so large a purchaser.
                        </para>
                        <para>Hitherto we have paid &#163;25 for 1,000, or 6d. per copy. This year &#163;5 per thousand more was paid, as we were furnished with a signed statement by the printers that their factory costs had increased by 30 per cent. </para>
                        <para>The reason why 7d. per copy is paid when the ordinary issue is sold for 6d. is this : </para>
                        <para class="block">Although the matter in the ordinary issue is used for the Commonwealth issue, the matter for that particular issue is, to a large extent, specially prepared, and it is profusely illustrated. It is the Commonwealth order that makes this possible. </para>

                    <para class="block">I denied that at the time. I have here three copies of the paper of different dates, and I think it will be found that there are very few more illustrations in the special number. In fact, I think there is as much, if not more, matter in an ordinary number, and in March in particular, the ordinary number contains twelve or fourteen additional pages. Therefore the Government bought really a smaller issue; and as for the special matter it contains, anybody could write it up from any guidebook of any fruit-growing State. </para>

He made an accusation against a firm whom I have always considered to be honorable; a firm who have spent a large amount of money in producing their article in Australia, and trained a lot of persons to produce the article. The statement was that they represented as their own an article which was manufactured elsewhere; that they filed the name off the article and put their own brand on it : I refer to the Shaw Wireless Company. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McColl</inline> said that he had seen a sworn statement to that effect.

                            mentioned that he had been to the Federal Territory, and that the public works there were going on very slowly. I do not know whether he made that statement as a consequence of his visit, but I shall endeavour to ascertain if there has been a slowing down there, and, if so, the reason. I quite subscribe to the doctrine laid down by the honorable senator that there ought to be, as far as possible, a continuity of work on big national undertakings. I come now to the matter brought up by

                            and I am very glad he did so, because the other day he made the statement that an officer of the Department had admitted to him that it had made a mistake. That was a very serious matter, and therefore I took steps at once to inform the Department of the statement in order to get an official reply. The reply from

That, if it were a fact, would be disloyalty to that officer&#39;s chief; and I say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready,</inline> in my judgment, committed an indiscretion when he stated in the House that he had been informed of something by an officer of a Department who is not the responsible head of that Department. </para>

I do not see that I can ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to withdraw those words. If I were to lay down a rule of that kind, it would have to apply to every member of the Senate, and it would unduly restrict the rights of members in debate. Such a ruling would compel them to pick and choose their words with regard to the probable effect of the actions of any responsible head of the Department and with regard to the actions or words of any honorable senator. It has never been held that a senator cannot criticise the probable effect of an action, but it has always been ruled that no senator may impute improper motives, or assert that another honorable senator is guilty of anything wrong or dishonorable. Therefore, I think this matter might be allowed to drop, because to proceed with it in the direction that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready</inline> desires would be to establish a rule which would unduly restrict the rights of honorable senators in discussion. </para>

                            <para>- In certain circumstances I would certainly agree with your ruling, sir. But in this case an officer of a Department came to a member of the Senate and placed certain facts before him without any request or intimation from that honorable gentleman. Is it not the officer who is placing himself in a false position, and not the honorable senator who was making use of the information voluntarily given to him? </para>

I desire to inform the Senate that, so far as Ministers and the Department were concerned, there was no attempt to withhold information, or to give contradictory information ; nor, indeed, would any Department be foolish enough to within a few days give contradictory information. I have here the letter that sets out the price as 7d. per copy. The answer which </para>
