I am informed that an officer in the Postal Department was elected at the top of the poll to a position in a local governing body, and when that fact was brought under the notice of the departmental head the officer was immediately called upon to resign the office to which he had been elected, in order to retain his position in the Public Service.

                        <para>- Yesterday afternoon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> brought before the Senate the question of the infliction of some fines, which, in his opinion, were unduly heavy, on three persons in Adelaide for offences against the Electoral Act. I have made an inquiry into the matter, and have been furnished with the following information :  - </para>

                    <para>I suggest to the honorable senator that a petition should be sent in to the Attorney-General, stating the facts, and asking for the exercise of some leniency. The matter does not come under my control at all. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Loghlin</inline> asked me a question yesterday with regard to an admission by a person before the Electoral Commission that, in direct contravention of the Electoral Act, while in one of the places provided for recording his vote, he directly removed the partition between that and another, and looked in to see what was being done there. I have been furnished by the Chief Electoral Officer with the following statement: - </para>

The elector in question, hearing voices in an adjoining compartment, stated that he pulled aside the cloth screen sufficiently to enable him to see whether two persons were in the compartment. It has not been alleged that he interfered with any elector in regard to the marking of his vote. The act was injudicious and improper, but does not call for action under the law. </para>

                        <para>As the honorable senator is aware, the Act deals mainly with general principles, leaving the details to be dealt with by regulation. There are nearly 100 different matters requiring to be so dealt with, and the regulations are now being drafted. These and their accompanying instructions to officers will occupy many pages of printed matter. So far this work has been efficiently carried out by the Departmental Oflicer, who assisted at the passage of the Bill, with the necessary clerical assistance. Now, however, a staff of expert officers is being formed. As a first step a Director of Navigation is being appointed. The applications for the position close on the 18th instant, and an early appointment will be made. Expert nautical and engineering officers will then be appointed to deal with the technical work of their several departments. </para>
                        <para>Apart from the above, a great mass of detail work has to be attended to in connexion with the questions of exemptions of foreign and other ships provided for in the Act, the formation of staffs in the ports throughout the Commonwealth, the taking over of the pilotage services and properties, and other matters too numerous to mention. </para>
                        <para>There is no desire on the part of the Government to delay the operation of the Act. The preparatory work is being pushed on with, and so soon as such can safely be done, the proclamation bringing the Act into operation will be issued. </para>

                            <para class="block">The Engineer-in-Chief for Commonwealth railways represented that it was necessary that a suction of the earthworks on the railway line, where it crossed the tablelands, should be done immediately; that the contractor for an adjacent State railway was just finishing, and was ready with men and plant to take on the work at slightly lower rates than his contract with the State for similar work in similar country. He recommended that in view of the urgency of the matter and the report of the Supervising Engineer, that he could not do the work in the time, and the prices were justified, the opportunity of having the work clone immediately be seized, and a contract let to the State contractor at below State rates, which was done. </para>

                            <para>- It was by my authority that the question was not inserted in the notice-paper. The honorable senator asked, without notice, yesterday a question of, I think, the Minister representing the Minister of Home Affairs. I have a copy of it here, and the Minister asked him to give notice. I am responsible for seeing that the business of the Senate is conducted in a proper fashion, and -in accordance with the rules and practice of Parliament. Questions are only permissible when they are asked for the purpose of eliciting information, and, in addition to that, they should be couched in proper parliamentary language. It was quite obvious to me that this question was not framed in such a way as to elicit information; it was framed for quite a different purpose; and for that reason I, in pursuance of the authority vested in me, accepted, the responsibility of refusing to allow it to be placed on the notice-paper. </para>

                    <para>. - I suppose we must take notice of coming . events, and an adjournment such as this is what usually occurs about this time, but in fixing on the. 29th as the date for re-assembling little consideration is shown for those senators who represent distant States, particularly those from Western Australia. I would suggest three weeks as a fair adjournment, and if the Minister will propose to adjourn for that period, I am prepared to second his motion. I would point out that it takes a week for Western Australian senators to return to their own State, and another week for them to get back to Melbourne, and if the adjournment is merely for a fortnight, they will be precluded from visiting their constituencies. In that respect their position is entirely different from that of senators representing other States. </para>

                        <para>- It is a reversal of form by the Minister. When, last session, the Opposition desired an adjournment of the Senate from day to day, until a certain motion was disposed of in another place, he refused that adjournment, and he did so in defiance of what he himself pronounced to be the universal practice. Personally, I fail to see why we should play second fiddle to the other Chamber by acting in this way. But, in accordance with what the Minister declared to be the usual practice when a motion of censure was submitted in another place- </para>

                        <para>- The fact remains that the Minister is proposing an inconsistent and anomalous course by reversing the form which he exhibited last session. I wish to point out that if we decided to adjourn from day to day, we would then be in a position to resume the consideration of business the moment that the censure motion in the other Chamber was disposed of. What right have we to assume that the debate upon that motion will occupy two or three weeks ? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator does not. All the referenda Bills which have been introduced by his leader appear upon the business paper, and if the honorable senator does not say that their consideration involves work, he does not know what work means. This Chamber should meet as early as possible to consider those proposals, in order that they may receive that amount of attention which their importance merits. Of course, it may be urged that we shall have an opportunity of dealing with them at a later stage, but I am one of those who desire to give full consideration to all Government measures which may be brought forward. For that reason, I say that we ought to remain here, and as we cannot possibly say how long the motion of censure will be pending, we ought to be in ,a position to resume work the moment it is disposed of. I enter my emphatic protest against the proposed adjournment. </para>

                        <para>- I did nob rise to cross the Minister in any way. If there is one thing more than another which is calculated to weaken the Government it is the willingness of the Opposition to conduct its business for it. I am anxious to support the Minister of Defence all that I can, within the brief period that is at our disposal. As the honorable gentleman and his colleagues understand what business they have to transact, it might, perhaps, be just as well to accept the motion which he has submitted. But when a request is made for an adjournment for a week longer, it is for the Minister to say whether or not he will go a little out of his way to accede to it. The date upon which we shall reassemble in this Chamber is a matter of absolute indifference to me. I will not use the forms of the Senate to criticise the Minister in any way. </para>

We know that a certain motion has been submitted in another place, and I venture to say that it will take the Leader of the Opposition and his party there quite three weeks to say all that they have to say of the Government and their works. Even then they will have omitted a great deal which ought to be said. Seeing that it is proposed that the Senate should adjourn for a fortnight, we might as well go the whole hog and extend reasonable consideration to the representatives of distant States in this Chamber. The Minister will be well advised if he accedes to the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch.</inline></para>

However, that battle is over, and I am confident that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Oakes</inline> is so satisfied with the result that he does not want any more holidays like that. The second ballots are all over in New South Wales, and we are quite contented. I repeat that I do not wish to have any adjournment at this stage, and should like to see the Senate meet again next Wednesday. </para>

                    <para>. - This appears to be a very important question, and is receiving a considerable amount of discussion. I have always been opposed to these adjournments. I have thought it most desirable that the Senate should continue to transact its business, even though a vote of no-confidence in the Government may have been moved in another place. But the force of other opinions has become too strong for me, and I am now, I suppose, a convert to this old-fashioned idea. In any case those of us who opposed these adjournments hitherto have not been able to make any impression upon members generally. The question to-day is between an adjournment for two weeks as proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and an adjournment for three weeks as suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> and other honorable senators. Probably <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has inside information as to how long the debate in another place is to be allowed to continue. Probably the Government have come to some conclusion that honorable members in another place are to be allowed to blow off steam for about two weeks, and then the play is to end. We have no information on that point. If at the close of an adjournment for two weeks we are summoned back here and find the other House still hammering. away  at  the  no-confidence  motion, we shall be among the unemployed once more, with this difference, fortunately for us, that our pay will be going  on  all the time. I think there is  a  good deal in the statements of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> and other honorable senators that  a  two  weeks&#39;  adjournment is of  no  use  to  honorable senators from Western Australia and Queensland. Honorable senators from New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania are almost  at  home when attending this Parliament. They  go  home every weekend, and sometimes stay  at  home over the following week. It seems  to  me that they are altogether  too  near their homes, and very often put other members of the Senate  to a  great deal of inconvenience. I favour  a  three weeks&#39; adjournment. I  am  sure that honorable senators from Western Australia desire  to go  home. Seeing that  a  double dissolution is pending, they want  to  interview their supporters. I  am  sure, also, that honorable senators from Queensland think in very much the same way. I should like very much  to go to  Queensland, but two weeks is  too  short  a  time  to  enable  me to  do so. I do not know why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> did not move  an  amendment  to  give effect  to  his suggestion, or why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> who was so anxious  to  support  a  three weeks&#39; adjournment, did not move such  an  amendment. There may be some reason for their unwillingness that does not appear  on  the surface. It is certainly not evident  to me.  When I think that  a  thing is right,  and  I want it, I  am  prepared  to  move  to  get it. I therefore move: - </para>
