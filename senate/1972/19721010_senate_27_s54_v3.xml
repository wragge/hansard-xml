            <para>- I report to the Senate that this morning, in the Senate club room, J accepted on behalf of the Senate a dress sword for the ceremonial use of the Usher of the Black Rod. The sword v/as presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr G.</inline> S. Boag on behalf of the Wilkinson Sword Co. Ltd. The father of the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Justin</inline> O&#39;Byrne, supported me in accepting this beautiful gift. The sword has been designed to match the ceremonial uniform of Black Rod, with which H will be worn. It is based on the pattern of the British diplomatic corps sword with solid silver fittings and a silver bullion knot. The shellguard is engraved with the Commonwealth coat of arms, with the words &#39;Australian Senate&#39; below, and the blade is embossed with n -wattle pattern along both sides. I am sure honourable senators will join with me in expressing our appreciation of this gift. </para>

          <para>I make one observation which has no political implications. I believe that all honourable senators recognise that during the life of this Parliament, the Senate, in its role and function, has taken on responsibilities which have broader horizons and wider perimeters than has been the case ever before in our history. We are all very proud of what we have taken on but it has put an added burden of responsibility on all honourable senators. It has put an added responsibility on you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> as Presiding Officer. It has put an added responsibility on leaders - myself, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> - and on Ministers. In my own case I have had to look at the burden of responsibility which I have carried as Leader of the Government in the Senate and its implications in regard to my health. It is a wonderful feeling and a very proud moment to sit again at this table as Leader of the Government in the Senate, and to sit with equality with all honourable senators at this time. </para>

          <para class="block">It is true, as the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition has said, that recently there have been newspaper reports on the dangers of fall-out of radioactive iodine, iodine 131, following nuclear testing. The document on which these news items are based is the 1972 report to the United Nations General Assembly of the Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation, which has the rather extraordinary alphabetical name UNSCEAR. The report is a complex technical document and some of the published interpretations have not been entirely accurate. I am informed that iodine 131 does pose special problems as it becomes concentrated in the thyroid gland after ingestion by humans and, therefore, irradiates that gland especially. The intake is mostly through milk. The report notes the presence of radioactive iodine in milk in 14 countries and regions of the southern hemisphere, based on data supplied by these countries. Even the highest annual doses were well below that recorded in the northern hemisphere as far back as 1963. Australian figures for 1970 and 1971 are included in the Scientific Committee&#39;s report. However, these figures have already been published in detail in Australia in the reports of the National Radiation Advisory Committee which are freely available. The Advisory Committee has assessed the figure as presenting no hazard to the Australian population. It is incorrect to say that the United Nations report made any reference to the French nuclear tests of 1972. When 1972 figures become available they will be evaluated as to their potential health effect in the usual careful way. </para>

            <para>- I ask a question of the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry following representations by orchardists in the Goulburn Valley. Is the complaint correct that to obtain a tree pull grant under the present Government proposals, orchardists in Victoria&#39;s Goulburn Valley must forfeit their cannery shares? Are such orchardists being told that the cannery shares are valueless, although within the last 12 months such shares were valued for probate at $3 a share and a widow concerned was forced to pay at that rate although in indigent circumstances? Are the conditions so rigid for a tree pull grant that only those in extreme poverty can benefit? </para>

Although the Bill involves certain details of the scheme it does not refer to shares in a cannery. I have only just heard of this matter and would have to make an investigation through the Minister for Primary Industry before saying more about it. I shall do that.

My question is: Why is it necessary for the Usher of the Black Rod to be armed with a symbol of war and death, namely, a sword? Was the arming of the Usher of the Black Rod a matter of discussion by the House Committee? If not, who was responsible for the decision to allow an officer of the Senate to be armed?

Indeed, today he will be preparing a statement for release to all country broadcasting stations throughout Australia. Finally, as the  Chairman  of the Committee, I hope to attend the conference and seminar of the Isolated Children&#39;s Parents Association which is to be held at Bourke tomorrow and which the Minister for Education and Science will attend.

            <para>- 1 am able to say that the Government has very little knowledge of the French plans for further nuclear weapons testing in the Pacific. But we do expect that the French Government will continue with its plans to develop thermo-nuclear warheads for its missile forces. The Australian Government, of course, strongly opposes any such programme. This year, the Government has continued actively to oppose atmospheric nuclear testing in the Pacific, particularly by mobilising international opinion against the French testing programme. At present, Australia is, with New Zealand and other Pacific countries, acting at the United Nations in New York to prove the extent of international opposition to nuclear weapons testing, especially in the Pacific area. That is the point, I think, that responds to the question asked by the honourable senator. </para>

As he knows, and as we are all aware, the Mirage aircraft presently in service in the Royal Australian Air Force were built under licence by Australia in conjunction with the French. The Mirage has proved to be a magnificent aircraft. The honourable senator then connects discussions that apparently have been taking place with the French aircraft industry in relation to the future requirements of the RAAF with the question of an alleged increase in nuclear testing. Here the honourable senator enters an area of policy which, quite obviously, I am not competent to answer and which, in any event, it would be contrary to traditions and practice to answer. I do not suggest that the question should be put on notice, but I will refer it in the appropriate way to the responsible Minister. </para>

Can the Minister explain to the Senate why it is that an answer has not been forthcoming to the questions put to the Minister some weeks ago which asked for, firstly, the date on which Australian suppliers and manufacturers were given a final specification for the supply of steel, and, secondly, the date on which Australian manufacturers were asked to tender for 34- inch pipe?

Insofar as the description of it by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> is a protest about inflammatory editorials in newspapers, I think we must recognise that in this country, providing the incitement involved in the newspapers does not offend against the law, there is an essential freedom of speech which we know does not exist in Yugoslavia. With regard to whether or not there is monitoring of Croatian and other Yugoslav newspapers in Australia I have ascertained from the Commonwealth Police Force that there is a periodic but occasional monitoring. There is in no way a regular monitoring. The basic problem in this regard is the proliferation of such newspapers and the inadequate translation facilities available to the Commonwealth Police. With respect to the matter relating to Sweden I recall that the honourable senator asked me a question about this some time ago. I have received some information subsequently. I am not sure of its details but I have taken notice of his question and will endeavour to supply him with an answer either tomorrow or on Thursday. </para>

            <para>- 1 direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry. With drought conditions in many areas in Australia, resulting in greatly reduced wheat production this year and an anticipated small endofseason carry-over, has the Minister heard comments from some individuals that wheat quotas should be abolished? Will the Minister make a statement that quotas will remain to protect the smaller farmers from being squeezed out by the big corporations and syndicates and also to prevent another wheat explosion and huge surpluses? Will the Minister also announce wheat quotas for the 1972-73 season as soon as possible in order to assist farmers in making their necessary arrangements? </para>

            <para>- Because of prevailing seasonal conditions, it is very likely that many wheat farmers will not reach their quotas in the coming season. Although there has been an improvement in the wheat situation in terms of overseas sales, to my mind we should not return to a policy of unlimited production. I think it has been proved, and proved quite fully, over recent years that the wheat industry has a greater chance of survival if it continues to adopt a realistic approach to stocks and policy, that is, if we tailor our supplies to market opportunities. 1 ..e Minister for Primary Industry will be meeting the leaders of the wheat industry and the Australian Wheat Growers Federation very shortly. In addition, the Australian Agricultural Council, comprising the State Ministers for Agriculture and the Minister for Primary Industry, together with other representatives, will be meeting on 16th October and no doubt the question of wheat quotas will be discussed. It has been the usual practice for the wheat industry to make recommendations regarding quotas to the Commonwealth Government, and if the recommendations are accepted by the State governments it is the usual practice for the Commonwealth to adopt the recommendations. I feel quite sure that, following meetings with the Wheat Growers Federation and the Agricultural Council, the Minister will be in a position to make a statement, and no doubt he will make it without any delay. </para>

            <para>- It has come to my notice that there is a current shortage of petrol supplies in Queensland. It occurred in circumstances where undue pressure was put on the Ampol cracking plant to meet the calls for supplies during the oil dispute, and it was necessary to run the plant beyond the period after which ordinary maintenance is carried out. Just after the termination of the oil dispute a breakdown in the plant occurred and this caused a shortage of petrol supplies. My information is that full petrol supplies can be expected in a period much shorter than 6 months; they can be expected in some 2 to 3 weeks. </para>

Necessarily, it takes account of those matters to which the honourable senator has referred, lt is very difficult to give an answer to the honourable senator&#39;s question as to what general criteria are taken into account by the Government. The Government appoints to the Commission - I think its record of appointments bears this out quite convincingly - responsible persons who are interested in and capable of carrying out the Commission&#39;s functions.

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister for Health, More rightly it might come within the province of the Minister for Social Services. I preface the question by saying that no doubt the Minister is aware that capital grants are made by the Federal Government towards the establishment of hostel training centres for retarded children. However, is the Minister aware that the running costs of these hospitals is becoming an increasing burden and that the gap between Government assistance, together with voluntary aid and the total running costs is becoming extremely difficult to cover? Will he say when some increase in Federal Government assistance can be expected in the way of a major increase in the Commonwealth bed rate subsidy? </para>

As the honourable senator points out, there is an inter-change of administrative responsibility between the Department of Social Services and my own Department, the Department of Health.

In the period when Parliament was not sitting there was a Press report, completely without foundation, that I was supposed to have delayed the sending of a protest note. At the time that Press report appeared I had not even seen the protest note. I imagine that that is the reason why the question which is wholly within the responsibility of the Minister for Foreign Affairs has been directed to me, I suggest that if the honourable senator requires information he should direct his question to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. </para>

Has the Minister noted the concern which has been expressed by Japan and at least one other country which has been a customer for Australian wheat that regular supplies of wheat to them as customers might be interrupted if Australia resumes the large scale sales of wheat to Communist China which occurred some years ago? Can we have an assurance that the Government will ask the Australian Wheat Board to bear in mind the importance of having diverse markets for Australian wheat rather than the old position which caused Australia such considerable trouble when the overwhelming amount of our wheat was sold to one customer? </para>

            <para>- I think the honourable senator would be one of the first to admit that over the years the Australian Wheat Board has done a tremendous job, particularly in the last few years, after cessation of continued sales to Communist China. I feci sure and I think honourable senators can be assured that the Wheat Board would not have made this present commitment if it were not certain that it could meet it. People look at the present harvest and the carryover and say that we cannot meet our commitment. But wheat is always coming in from following harvests which, in some cases in the northern area, begin as early as October next year. No doubt the Wheat Board will be looking at this early delivery of wheat to meet this commitment and the commitments for the following year. </para>

The conditions upon which unemployment benefit is available to students is a matter within the administration of my colleague, the Minister for Social Services, to whom I shall see the question is referred.

            <para>Has the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry been drawn to a Government paper headed Federal Government Plans for the Fruit Industry&#39; which was presented by a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr E.</inline> Kronborg on behalf of the Minister for Primary Industry at an Australian Institute of Agricultural Science seminar on reconstruction in the fruit industry which was held at Leeton on 28th September this year? What right is given to the Government to appoint any person who is not a member of the Government parties to make a policy pronouncement on behalf of the Government at such a function? Is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kronborg</inline> the Country Party candidate for Riverina at the forthcoming Federal election? Is the Liberal Party, the major partner in the coalition, also running a candidate to contest that electorate at the forthcoming Federal election? Under the circumstances why was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kronborg</inline> chosen to make on behalf of the Government a statement on Government policy on such a vitally important rural matter? </para>

          <para>- I have not seen the paper to which the honourable senator referred. I would be glad if he would show it to me. lt is true that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kronborg</inline> is the Country Party candidate for Riverina - 1 am very proud of that fact - and he is being supported by a very good Liberal Party candidate. I shall make certain inquiries because I have no information on this matter and I will give him a reply at a later date. </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Labour and National Service. I refer again to the critical situation with regard to petrol supplies in Australia. What is the Department of Labour and National Service doing to anticipate any further conflict  between the unions and the oil companies, particularly in view of the low level of petrol supplies in this country? Is the Minister aware that further awards are about to be negotiated? Will the Department ensure that the fullest co-operation is given to both parties to prevent a further confrontation? Will the Minister investigate the report that overseas oil monopolies are witholding supplies of refined spirit in anticipation of such a confrontation so that when it occurs the nation will be crippled? </para>

            <para>- I have u further question which this time I direct to the Minister for Health who I presume has been given some reading material during his convalescence. Is it a fact that the Northern Territory Legislative Council has just completed a report on the operations of the Minister&#39;s Department in the Territory? Was this report extremely critical of the Department&#39;s operations and did it describe the system as domineering, cumbersome and outmoded? Will the Minister explain why the Northern Territory Director of Health, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Langsford,</inline> was suddenly transferred back to Canberra when this report was presented? As the report shows a state of chaos in the Department of Health in the Northern Territory, what steps will be taken by the Minister to restructure and re-form the Department since the Aboriginal mortality rate continues unchecked and dedicated doctors continue to resign? </para>

          <para class="block">There are, of course, a number of inaccuracies inherent in the question as posed. The inquiry mentioned by the honourable senator was not confined to the activities of the Department of Health but was related to health matters generally in the Territory. Obviously the honourable senator is unaware that these matters were not entirely within the responsibility of the Department of Health. I commend to the honourable senator a statement which I issued on 3rd October, and which was circulated at that time. The honourable senator should have received a copy of that. Obviously he has not read it so far, but I hope he will read it. In that statement which I made on 3rd October and which I commend to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> and other honourable senators I pointed out that as at July this year, in response to representations which I made to the Government, health services in the Territory were brought under the control of the Department of Health. 1 mentioned also that the Department of Health will now have far wider responsibility than it had before for health in the Territory. 1 think I have said in this place in relation to other health matters, and certainly 1 put this view in my representations on this issue, that one does not have to be a medical practitioner to be able to say simply and with complete confidence that prevention is better than cure. As a consequence of the decision of Government as at July this year the Department of Health will be taking over not only the administration of health in terms of hospitalisation and the like but also it will be taking over responsibility for health in people&#39;s homes and particularly in the settlements. </para>
          <para>The honourable senator mentioned that the Director of Health in the Northern Territory had been transferred back to the Canberra office. I remind the honourable senator that the report which has been mentioned comprises about 200 pages and contains about 150 recommendations of various kinds. In saying that I point out that I am speaking off the cuff on my first day back. Very properly the Department of Health and other departments will have to examine the recommendations contained in the report. In the same way as the honourable senator has a right to ask questions about the report, the Minister and officers of the Department must obtain reports on the recommendations which number closer to 150 than 100. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Langsford</inline> is in Canberra. I am sure that everybody will agree that at the head office of the Department of Health he and other senior officers are very properly examining the report which has been submitted. At a later date I hope to be able to make a supplementary response on this issue. Nevertheless I want it to be abundantly clear that I have already issued a statement. I pointed out in that statement what we are doing in terms of providing new hospitals in the Alice Springs and Darwin areas. I also pointed out that the Department of Health has been since July accepting far greater responsibility in relation to health in the Northern Territory. We are going through the administrative changeover at the present time but of course it will take a certain amount of time. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Douglas</inline>McClelland will recall that I indicated earlier today that the inquiry into the education of children in isolated areas would take place as soon as parliamentary circumstances allowed. I want to say the Committee does not propose to conclude its inquiry into all aspects of broadcasting and television before embarking on the reference relating to isolated children. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland will be aware that the reference concerning all aspects of broadcasting and television is a very comprehensive one and that the Committee will take some time to conclude the inquiry. It is a reference of a very detailed and diverse nature. Because the nature of the reference concerning isolated children is, by contrast, one which, while having a wide range of interests and inferences, is capable of receiving attention much sooner than the prevous reference, it is therefore proposed that the 2 references proceed concurrently. I repeat my earlier statement that submissions have been invited and some have  been  received. As soon as circumstances will allow the Committee will undertake the first steps of its inquiry into the reference put to it by the Senate relating to isolated children. </para>

          <para>As 1 have indicated in answers to parliamentary questions, the Commonwealth and State Governments received the Report of the Commonwealth-State Officials&#39; Committee on Decentralisation in June of this year. I also indicated that the Commonwealth was agreeable to the publication of the report and that I was seeking the agreement of the States to this course. All the States have now indicated their agreement to its public release and the printing of the report has now been completed. In undertaking its task the Committee commissioned a number of studies - in some cases involving outside bodies - which are listed as attachment A of the report. The printing of the studies in a separate vo in me is proceeding, but because of their size and for technical reasons it will be some time before the printing process is completed, /n the meantime, arrangements have been made for copies of the individual studies to be made available in the Parliamentary Library. </para>

I also said that we propose to establish a ministerial council, consisting of the Prime Minister and Premiers, as the principal body for consultation and coordination in the fields of urban and regional development. The Premiers have bee advised of the Commonwealth&#39;s initiative in this area of urban and regional development. So far as Commonwealth machinery is concerned, we will be introducing interim legislation shortly to establish a statutory organisation to be known as the National Urban and Regional Development Authority&#39; - I move: </para>

              <para>- This report results from an inquiry which was conducted at the direction of the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Alan Hulme)</inline> by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board into the possibility of frequency modulation broadcasting in Australia. The inquiry attracted a great deal of interest, and the Board heard 70 witnesses and considered some 150 written submissions. In addition, the Board itself undertook, through its Technical Services Division, an exhaustive examination of the technical problems involved, which are unique to this country. The result is a comprehensive report which the Government accepts as a blueprint for the introduction of frequency modulation broadcasting in Australia. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Briefly, the Board recommends that frequency modulation broadcasting be introduced in this country in the UHF band, where there is sufficient space for the service to be utilised to its full potential. The Board notes that this decision means that a great deal of fundamental planning will have to be done to prepare adequate technical standards, and the Government has asked the Board to put this work, which is estimated to take 3 years, in hand immediately. The Government has accepted in principle the Board&#39;s recommendation that frequency modulation broadcasting should provide a second regional service for the Australian Broadcasting Commission, planned as far as possible to cover the entire population. The introduction of this service will overcome a serious deprivation which has been suffered by country listeners, who have available to them a less comprehensive service from the national broadcasting organisation - the Australian Broadcasting Commission - than do city people. This lack has always been of concern to both the Government and the Australian Broadcasting Commission, and I am very pleased to announce that it will now be overcome. </para>
          <para>Opportunity will also be taken to provide an FM station, devoted mainly to the broadcast of fine music, to be operated by the Australian Broadcasting Commission in the capital cities. The Board has also recommended, and the Government has agreed in principle, that provision should be made for commercial FM services throughout the country. The Board has put forward proposals designed both to ensure that these services will be economically viable, and also to encourage new managements and new ideas. These proposals will require careful consideration. The Board has also recommended the establishment of a new kind of broadcasting station - to be known, it is suggested, as public broadcasting stations. These stations, it is proposed, would be conducted on a non-profit basis, to cater for educational, professional, musical, religious, and other like interests. The Board has proposed that the transmitters for these stations should preferably be operated by the Government, with time apportioned between interested groups by a representative committee of management. The Board has not attempted to spell out the method of operating these stations in detail at this stage. The Government accepts the fact that there is a demand in the community for the services of such stations, and will look to the Board to put forward detailed proposals in due course. </para>
          <para>As I said, the preliminary technical work to establish an FM service in the UHF band will take approximately 3 years, and this will start immediately. Contemporaneously with the technical investigations, the Board will develop, in association with the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department and the Australian Broadcasting Commission, coverage plans for the national service, and will also prepare proposals for commercial stations and for the public broadcasting stations. As soon as the technical standards have been promulgated, it is hoped that the Government will be able to invite applications for licences for both commercial and public stations - and the first of the necessary public inquiries should be held in 1976. With regard to the national service, it is proposed that it should be developed as the work of converting the Australian Broadcasting Commission&#39;s television stations to colour is completed. </para>
          <para>Finally, I should emphasise that the introduction of FM will not be permitted to hinder such further development of the present medium frequency services as may be possible. As the Postmaster-General 1 have often stated, the possibilities in this band are very limited, but there is no doubt that the existing AM stations will be the principal source of radio service for many years, and they should be developed to the maximum extent possible. However frequency modulation broadcasting represents a significant advance in broadcasting techniques, and, when it is developed, as it will be, in the UHF band where sufficient space is available for many stations, it will offer a broadcasting service which the Government is confident will serve this country&#39;s needs for entertainment, information and education for very many years. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- by leave - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> on the 24th May last I announced to the Senate a number of proposals for strengthening the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, for establishing a monopolies commission and for the control of anti-competitive mergers that would be contrary to the public interest. I take this opportunity to inform the Senate of the Government&#39;s intentions with respect to the Bills to give effect to those proposals. Two Bills will be introduced in the current sittings. One will provide for a number of amendments to the Restrictive Trade Practices Act. The other will provide for the establishment of the proposed monopolies commission and will empower the commission to consider whether particular monopoly conditions are operating contrary to the public interest. The drafting of the provisions for the control of anti-competitive mergers is a particularly large and complex task. Many matters of important detail have to be specifically provided for. It has now become clear that the drafting of these merger provisions will not be completed in time for them to be introduced in the present sitting. Accordingly these provisions will not be able to be included in the 2 Bills which I have indicated will be introduced in the present sitting. Apart from these provisions, the Bills to be introduced express in legislative form the pro- posals which I announced. To the enactment of the principles embodied in those proposals the Government is committed. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>However, the Government regards it as important that there should be adequate opportunity for the detailed provisions to be properly studied and assessed. They are comprehensive and far-reaching in their impact. It does not consider that legislation of this character should be passed through the Parliament without there being a proper period for those affected by its provisions to give consideration to what is proposed and. if it is so desired, to make appropriate representations to the Government and to members of the Parliament. </para>
          <para>Accordingly, the Government proposes that in the current sittings these 2 Bills will be introduced only. It will then be possible for the detailed provisions to be studied. It will be the Government&#39;s intention to invite Parliament to pass the 2 Bills in the first sittings next year. The provisions enabling the monopolies commission to examine mergers and takeovers which may operate against the public interest will then be available and they will be incorporated in the second of the Bills. Certain amendments to the overseas cargo shipping provisions in Part XII of the RestrictiveT rade Practices Act have been the subject of a separate announcement by the Minister for Trade and Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony).</inline> The scope of these amendments is relatively limited and there is no reason why they should not be passed through all stages in the present sittings. The amending provisions will accordingly be included ina separate Bill, which Parliament will be asked to pass in the course of the next few weeks. </para>

            <para>- I do not propose to say anything about the delay in making this statement. 1 think enough has been said inside this place and outside. I again raise the question of representation of Western Australia in the House of Representatives. This matter was adverted to when documents were tabled in this Senate which disclosed that Western Australia was entitled to one more representative than presently it has in the House of Representatives. I then asked that an opinion be obtained from the Solicitor-General as to the proper course and entitlement. I think the Senate is entitled to know what is, in the opinion of the legal advisers of the Commonwealth, the constitutional position in relation to the representation of Western Australia and whether, in fact, one more representative should be elected at large from that State or whether some other method needs to be adopted in order that the requirements of the Constitution can be met in relation to this election. </para>

              <para>- I sent a telegram to the Attorney-General yesterday and I sent him a detailed letter very early this morning. It went straight to his mail box and undoubtedly straight to his office. If he has not had an opportunity to peruse it I trust that he has been able to take some action on the telegram at least. I point out that our friend <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Nielsen</inline> - the gentleman to whom I have referred - claims to have some qualifications. We are not sure where he obtained his religious training but he leads  a  church known as the Universal World </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para class="block">Church. This church is based at the Australian Workers Union hall, Denham Street, Townsville. The founder-pastor is <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Nielsen.</inline> I shall mention some of the things he claims he is able to do. He claims that we can experience the miraculous annointing of the holy spirit of resurrection power and see the most beautiful sight in any church, the regal splendour of the transubstantiation robes. The transubstantiation robes are made mostly of satin but some are of a much cheaper material. The learned gentleman claims that he is a prophet of God whose message on life and the science of the body is unquestionable, and that his power in God, even to the raising of the dead, is unquestionable. </para>
          <para>He suggests that people attend the Universal World Church where every disease, affliction and pain disappears and where divine help and healing flow into the bodies of every believer as God&#39;s body is incarnated within the whole entity of man. He claims that he has international experience in 40 countries, including Russia, and that this qualifies him for any type of ministry. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Nielsen</inline> says that he is an international director of the Universal World Church in Los Angeles and that he is patron of the UPF African Church. He says that he is the founder and  President  of the fastest growing church in Australia. 1 might say that this person has been operating in the northern parts of Australian for some years. In published documents he claims to have converted 750 persons during the last 18 months. Conversion is by immersion, lt is said that in the Townsville area he has 300 adherents. To my knowledge there are only 3 white persons associated with this church. At least one of these has died recently in mysterious circumstances, that is, in the last few months. In my view he is a very evil man. He has preyed and battened on the emotion of Torres Strait and other island people and on a limited number of Aborigines. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Nielsen</inline>has allegedly collected large sums of money for the construction of a church which, to date, has not materialised. When he is questioned he claims that he has sent some of this money to America. We are not quite sure how he obtained his doctorate, probably in divinity. We understand that he corresponded with some overseas church and as a result of a short correspondence course he was granted the title of doctor. He claims to have offices in 3 or 4 countries. He has quite a number of addresses. He has an address at Post Office Box 1335, Townsville. He claims an address at 2249 West 24th Street, Los Angeles, California. He claims an address at 80 Balham Park Road, London, and he claims to be international director of the Universal World Church. </para>

              <para>- Well, he says he is God. He claims to have an address at 9 Davis Street, Redcliffe, Queensland, and another at North Ward, Townsville. I mentioned a moment ago that he claims to be a prophet of God, a faith healer, with power to raise the dead. In my view <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Nielsen</inline> is a charlatan preying on the emotions of decent people. Incidentally, he has 3 groups of people: Messengers, priests and other general offsiders. When any of these people dare to question his authority they are immediately demoted. Many people suspect that tens of thousands of dollars have been collected by this man. No receipt is ever issued. I claim that he has a very bad influence on the several hundred islanders with whom he associates. </para>

              <para>- No, as far as we know no income tax is paid either. This is why I appeal to the Attorney-General, under Commonwealth company legislation - he is allegedly registered as a corporation - to prevent any money leaving Australia. At this moment there is a definite break in the church, if one can call it a church. When all else fails he casts an evil curse on people. This is not really a laughing matter so far as Islanders are concerned because they are very spiritual people. Many of them are closely associated with the Christian Church. A few of them are Hammond Islanders who are normally Catholics. Many of them are Murray and other Islanders who are normally followers of the Anglican Church. Some very prominent people in the Anglican Church approve completely what I am doing this evening because of the tremendous damage that has been done to these people. </para>

          <para>He tells his followers to reject modern methods of medicine, and where antibiotics have been prescribed for very ill people they are told to throw the drugs away and to drink only the olive oil which is blessed by him in his church in the Australian Workers Union hall. The regrettable part of this is that 10 days ago a middle-aged Islander died.  His  family feels that he died because he was subjected to sorcery by this alleged leader of a religious organisation. This man and his quasi religious teachings have created a great social problem. He has divided families and caused bitter quarrels among relatives and friends.  His  insistence on the regular payment of moneys to the church at a rate beyond that which families can economically afford has led to many cases of physical hardship. </para>
          <para>Let me cite the case of a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr X</inline> and his family. I will not state the names of the Islanders involved but they are available if the Attorney-General wants to follow this matter through. I sincerely hope that he will. A respected Anglican priest or I will be able to give him the names of the families which have been affected grievously by this man&#39;s activities. The breadwinner in this family, who is in regular employment, has produced no money for the keep of his family from the day that he joined the church. Not only does this man demand 10 per cent of their net income per week, but from time to time he places on the. family a special levy of up to &#167;25 a week. As most of these people are not craftsmen - they are mostly labourers - their average weekly wage would not be much in excess of $40 a week. </para>
          <para>I contend that the great number of people who follow this man and his church do so out of fear - fear of the unknown and fear of sorcery. In our community there is room for every church but there is no room for an organisation which leaves its adherents virtually penniless and in a state of subjection because they dread the spells that may be cast upon them if they do not comply. I will not go into great detail about all his other alleged qualities and the other things that he has done. There are many more that I could recite. A number of us have watched the activities of this man over a number of years. Recently, respected trade union leaders have told me that on jobs where there have been industrial problems he has had a tendency to get one of his messengers to go on to the jobs and provoke the people belonging to their race to continue working. He is not directly involved. A messenger in this church gets a nice little enamel badge and a type of uniform to wear. So far, the Islanders have been very strong in the face of this and they have not broken down. The obvious reason why this man is doing this is that he cannot afford not to get the $5 or $10 a week that the Islanders have to pay him out of their weekly wages. </para>
          <para>I have attended a couple of his so-called religious ceremonies. To attend one of them is tremendously frightening. The Island people are a highly spiritual people. They believe in a God. Because colourful ceremonies are associated with this man&#39;s fake church, they are inclined to be carried away. Partly because of this but largely because of the fear of what will happen if they do not do this, they comply. This man will tell the breadwinner of a family that if he cannot convert the rest of his family and make sure that they go to church, he must throw out his family. There have been instances in which families have been thrown out. I hope that the Attorney-General will be able to say that the many tens of thousands of dollars which have been received without receipts being issued and socked away in banks in Townsville and probably in other places too, can be frozen, until the whole background to this very strange character is investigated thoroughly. I hope the Commonwealth police will be able to do this. If they cannot, there must be ways in which the State police can be requested to do so by the Commonwealth police. I merely ask for action. </para>

            <para>- The matter of fake churches raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe,</inline> is similar to one which has concerned members of the Government parties on many occasions. We would agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> that if the description which he gave is correct, the situation is of great concern. The Victorian Government carried out an investigation into that which was being practised in the name of Scientology. A report was brought down by very respected individuals, which indicated much the same type of thing as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> has stated applies in Queensland. </para>

It is interesting to note that while <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe,</inline> on the one hand, is talking of the type of thing that is taking place in Queensland, his leader in this place is accepting that which has been rejected by most learned gentleman in Victoria. I would hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe&#39;s</inline> attitude in relation to this matter is endorsed by his Party and that there is not the division in the Labor Party which is apparent  by  the 2 different points of view that have been put today. </para>

            <para>-  If strange conduct were the criteria for the taking of drastic and unprecedented action, I am quite sure that many statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> in this place would have precipitated a similar result. I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe&#39;s</inline> allegations are correct, but I suggest to him that he has used this forum in a way that,  if  his allegations are not sustained, may cause great hardship and suffering to people who are entitled to follow a religion  if  they wish to do so. On the other hand,  if  his allegations are able to be sustained, he has performed a notable public service. I am surprised that the matter has been raised in this way. 1 had not heard of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Neilsen</inline> and I certainly do not know him. I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe&#39;s</inline> statements are true. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Having read the letter which he sent to me, and having listened to what he has said tonight, I imagine that what he has passed on are allegations made by other people. That is a way in which people can be injured grievously. I say that advisedly. To my knowledge, on previous occasions in this chamber <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> has made allegations which, when investigated, have not been substantiated. That is why I am cautious. I cannot see  how  the Commonwealth Attorney-General  has  any role to play in regard to conduct of  the  character alleged to be occurring in Queensland. In  the  first place, there is no Commonwealth companies legislation in respect of which an Attorney-General  has. any  functions to exercise. There is no other apparent basis upon which the Commonwealth Attorney-General can act. There is no other apparent basis upon which any Commonwealth official could act. I do not know whether the allegations made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> have any substance, but if he is saying - how he would have proof of it I do not know - that this man has not paid any income tax he ought to give some basis for his allegations so that investigations may be made by the taxation authorities. I do not know how it can be said that this person has not paid income tax. </para>
          <para>Any allegation that this man has taken a lot of money and in fact misappropriated it is a matter which should be brought to the attention of the police authorities, with some substantiation, for them to investigate. That is the appropriate course to adopt where there is a belief or a fear that a person is acting contrary to the law. The police forces of this land, in particular the police force in Queensland, are the appropriate bodies to which these allegations should be taken so that the necessary investigations may be made. If, after those investigations, there is some cause for complaint, let the matter be aired on the basis of something solid, factual and substantial and not on the merest allegation, without a tittle of evidence provided to support it. I do not know whether what has been alleged has any basis in fact or truth. It may be that it has; it maybe that it has not. But I deplore the fact that it may not and that this chamber has been used in the way in which it has been used. </para>

            <para>-  I rise simply because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> took the opportunity of injecting my name into the debate, apparently in order to introduce some kind of a red herring into it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> spoke apparently about some incident which was aired about 6 weeks or 2 months ago on which there was a good deal of discussion and in relation to which finally I went on a national television programme and explained - I think to the entire satisfaction of all - that if the constitutional rights which are guaranteed to citizens were to be vindicated a certain course of action ought to be taken. I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> and the Senate generally that he was referring to the case of a body called the Church of the New Faith Incorporated, which was apparently lawfully incorporated under the laws of South Australia and certain other States and in respect of which there were certain proceedings before a magistrate exercising federal jurisdiction in the State of Western Australia in which a citizen, in proceedings against the Commonwealth Government as represented by the Minister for Labour and National Service, established to the satisfaction of that tribunal that that body was a church and a religion within the meaning of the National Service Act and that the person concerned was actually a minister of religion and so exempt under the relevant clauses of that Act. That being so, apparently the Commonwealth Government is precluded, certainly in respect of matters under the National Service Act, from contending other than that body is a religion, unless it seeks to recontest the issue in some way. One would think that while it is not an irresistible conclusion, it is a very strong conclusion that if that body was a religion for the purposes of one Act it probably would be a religion for the purposes of other Acts. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I will say no more than that.

One of the statements he made was that I had made an allegation in this chamber at some time in the past which was unsubstantiated. I have never done that. I never level a charge in this chamber against anybody or any organisation unless I have evidence to substantiate it. I would respectfully suggest, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> that those words are offensive. I do not intend to ask for the Attorney-General to withdraw them, although they are offensive. But I do feel that the responsibility is on him to do something about this matter and not to burke the issue, as he is trying to do. </para>

              <para>The figures published in the Labour Force bulletin are estimates based on a sample collection and are therefore subject to sampling variability. When the total numbers in a particular category are small it is consequently difficult to provide a meaningful breakdown into smaller groups. It is the Statistician&#39;s practice not to publish estimates from the labour force survey which are lessthan 4,000 because, as explained in the Labour Force bulletin, very small estimates are subject to such high relative standard errors as to detract seriously from their value for most reasonable uses. </para>

          <para>For February 1972 an attempt was made to provide as much information as possible about a number of separate groups of migrants (males, married women, all females and persons) according to country of birth and period of arrival in Australia, but because of the relatively small numbers of unemployed migrants only 20 of the 52 principal estimates provided for in the published table formats could be shown, the remainder being below the 4,000 limit referred to above. </para>
          <para>Between February and May there was a substantial fall in the level of unemployment. The May 1972 Labour Force bulletin contained separate particulars of the numbers of unemployed persons born in Australia and of those born outside Australia, which showed that the numbers of Australian-born had decreased by 18.5 per cent, and the numbers of overseas-born by 19.8 per cent. </para>
          <para>With a decrease in the total number of unemployed migrants the possibility of a meaningful breakdown into smaller groups was further reduced, and in fact only 13 of the 52 estimates referred to above were publishable, and a number of those were close to the 4,000 level. </para>
          <para>It was explained in the May bulletin that because of the introduction of a new sample the standard errors of changes from February to May 1972 would be greater than those usually associated with changes of corresponding magnitude and that care should be taken in placing significance on any changes in estimates between these 2 quarters. </para>
          <para>Therefore, in view of the circumstances that firstly, three-quarters of the estimates were too small to be published, and secondly, the remainder were generally so small that any changes which had occurred between February and May would very likely have been accorded a significance that would, on statistical grounds, have been unjustified, the Statistician decided that particulars for separate countries of birth and periods of arrival in Australia should not be included in the May 1972 Labour Force bulletin. </para>
          <para>In order to expedite the issue of the bulletin the textual matter had been prepared in advance, and when the foregoing decision was made the reference to the inclusion of estimates by year of arrival was crossed out on the printed copies in order not  to  delay the publication of the May statistics. </para>

Our principal Southern Hemisphere competitors in the European apple and pear market do not subsidise freight rates and any move by the Australian Government to introduce a subsidy could well result in retaliatory action which could place the Australian apple and pear industry in a less competitive position. The Commonwealth Government&#39;s concern at the serious export problems of the Australian industry has been manifested by the provision of substantial financial assistance to the export sector, initially through devaluation compensation and since 1971 through a5-year Stabilisation Plan. An amount of $2.6m was provided to the export sector under the plan for the 1971 season, and a provision of$3. 15m has been made in the current Budget to support the 1972 season exports under the Plan. Additional assistance will also be available to the industry through the recently introduced Fruit-growing Reconstruction Scheme. </para>

            <item label="(1)">
              <para>There are no plans to provide lists of call details for local calls, within Australia or any other country in the world. Details of trunk calls made through the operator have always been and will continue to be provided on request at a nominal charge. With the multi-metering system we have in Australia, lists of STD call details cannot be provided. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>The multi-metering system is similar to systems used in the great majority of countries in the world where subscribers are able to dial their own trunk calls directly. A notable exception is the U.S.A. and Canada where the system does provide for a printed record to be made of each directly dialled trunk call, but the charges for calls are precisely the same as for operator connected calls i.e. a minimum of 3 minutes. Therefore the cost savings to subscribers available from the multi-metering system, where charges are more closely related to the actual duration of the call, are lost to the subscribers in those countries. </para>
          <para>There arc basic differences in the type of telephone exchange equipment in Australia which preclude, at present, adoption of the automatic ticketing system used in North America. If it were decided to introduce this system in Australia, it would take a good many, years to carry out the necessary modifications to the existing equipment. </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>Yes and this is done to the extent practicable within the limits of our present system. </para>
