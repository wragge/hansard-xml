            <para>- No doubt honourable senators will be aware of the circumstances which cause me to make this announcement. Yesterday afternoon there died a man who had served this Parliament for a long time and most honourably. I, refer to the late John Murphy. He joined the Joint House Department and therefore became a servant of the Parliament in 1944. He died yesterday afternoon, and so ended a long life. I have taken the necessary action to convey to his widow and his daughters the regrets of the Senate and the understanding and appreciation which exist among all honourable senators of the long service that he rendered to this Parliament. </para>

Of course, the international terminal adequately caters for passengers. At the present time I am studying in some detail the problem of domestic terminals and what might be done to expand them and to provide improved faclities and better protection from the weather, as the honourable senator has mentioned. I will be able to make an announcement before very long, and if Parliament is in recess when I do, I will ensure that my statement is sent to him. </para>

I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lawrie&#39;s</inline> question yesterday regarding the refusal of insurance companies to cover property damage caused by sonic booms. The Minister replied that he was astonished at the report. Does the Minister remember his answer to an almost identical question from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laucke</inline> on 12th April, which apparently did not astonish him? Can he tell the Senate the results of the inquiries which 6 weeks ago he promised <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laucke</inline> had already been instituted? </para>

            <para>- Not having the benefit of the question before me, I think the word &#39;promise&#39; is probably not an accurate statement of what I would have said at the time. At the time of his question, what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laucke</inline> referred to were rumours. 1 was unable to establish that there was any accuracy in this rumoured position. The only firm announcement took place on Monday. Following that, I gave an answer yesterday. Inquiries are still proceeding. The only illumination I have at the moment is that an insurance company rang the office yesterday in Canberra and said that it knew nothing about the matter. </para>

            <para>- I ask the Attorney-General a question. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I am afraid that I must ask you to bear with me in this because it is quite a lengthy question. Yesterday I asked a question seeking the correct number of draft resisters, the number for whom warrants had been issued, the number who had failed to attend medical examinations as well as the number for whom warrants had been issued for such failure. I am not interested in the polemics of the situation between the Opposition and the Government I am interested in the facts. In his most verbose reply, the Attorney-General stated that there were 695,000 registered and that 14,000 of those required to register had not registered; of those required to register, 2 per cent or 14,000 had failed to register but there were probably more. In regard to medical examinations, he stated that the number required to attend for this purpose was 147.000 and that 441 had failed to attend for this purpose. The Attorney-General concluded, after giving a lot of detail that I did not ask for, by saying: </para>

All I can say is this: I did not mention the figures of 14,441 and so on, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turnbull</inline> mentioned today, in the course of my answer yesterday. What I gave him yesterday was the number of persons who had registered over the period that the National Service Act had been in operation since 1.964 and the percentage of those required to register who had not registered. That is 2 per cent of the total. I also gave to him the total number of persons who had been required to attend for medical examination and I indicated that, of that number, 0.3 per cent had failed to attend for medical examination. Of those required to report for service - some 55,000 people - there had been 0.2 per cent who had not complied with their call up. These figures re clear. The consequences flowing from what I said were that there was a very high level of observance of obligations under the National Service Act - </para>

But I would suggest that he put his question on the notice paper so that he can be given an answer which he can understand. All I desire to say in conclusion is that there are not, as has been suggested in many places, thousands of persons who are alleged draft resisters in default of their obligations. The figures have been given repeatedly in this Senate by the Minister representing the Minister for Labour and National Service and by myself. I shall take advantage of this opportunity to collate all those answers for the particular benefit of the garrulous senator who asked the question. </para>

I could not go any further than that for it would be improper for me to do so. I am very hesitant about making comment on Treasury matters of this character particularly just before a budget session. But I shall do what I can to seek greater information on the subject for the honourable senator. </para>

            <para>- It will be recalled that in the statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, which I read to the Senate on the 9th of this month, it was said that Australia&#39;s position was that we were willing to recognise the People&#39;s Republic of China and exchange diplomatic representatives in accordance with normal international practice. The statement then went on to say that certain conditions were stipulated by the People&#39;s Republic of China, one of which was that we should acknowledge it as the sole legal government of China and as having sovereignty over Taiwan. Reference was made then to that fact. Further in his statement the Minister said: </para>

Is it also a fact that one of the purposes of the deficiency payments scheme was to ensure that wool growers would receive adequate remuneration for their product so that they would not have to go to banks and wool brokers for extra loans to cover their costs? </para>

As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maunsell</inline> said, the reason for the introduction of the deficiency payments scheme was to assist people who were hard pressed with commitments at that time. If the people concerned lowered their debt to storekeepers, banks or broking houses then I do not think it could be justly said that by this action those firms have been the only ones to reap something from the deficiency payments scheme.

Has the Minister&#39;s attention been drawn to an article in today&#39;s issue of the &#39;Canberra Times&#39; which makes serious allegations to the effect that some business enterprises are forcing up prices by withholding leases from the market and that others who normally would be content to deal in houses are virtually forced to make large extra profits out of leases because of sharply rising prices? Is the Minister aware that unrestricted and group auctions of land have increased by 79 per cent and 81 per cent respectively in the past 16 months? In view of these price increases and the allegations I refer to, will the Minister request the Minister for the Interior to refer this matter to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Australian Capital Territory for a full investigation into all matters referred to in this Press article? </para>

As I understand the newspaper reports, after the matter had been reported to him the magistrate stood down. That, as I have said, is what the newspapers say. I repeat to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> what I said to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy:</inline> Until 1 have received advice, which 1 will receive in due course from the Secretary of my Department, I do not propose to say anything further on the nature of the events or what might be the future action that is involved. </para>

            <para>- I doubt very much whether there will be any travel delays. There should be no problems associated with the Qantas company operating in the way in which lt began, that is, by taking the initiative. It will be recalled that the proposal had strong Government support. It has taken time for the company to get full approval. It has succeeded in doing so and I think our congratulations should go to it. Qantas is still working on expanding the general ambit of its concessional fare operations to the benefit of the travelling public. I would not want to say any more than that. I see no problem in Qantas being able to carry out a programme of flying passengers at increasingly lower rates, but occasionally it takes time to be able to do so. </para>

With the proposed intrusion of supermarkets into the field of certain pharmaceutical lines previously regarded as specialised chemists&#39; lines, can he say what steps can be taken to protect pharmacies, particularly the small ones, against the unwarranted intrusion of big chain stores which could have a serious effect upon the livelihood of chemists who render such a valuable service to the community? </para>

            <para>- It must be appreciated that the nature of pharmacies has changed over the years and that in addition to the traditional work of the apothecary there has now been added the work of the retailer who dispenses stock proprietary lines. I think that in regard to stock proprietary lines the events which are currently occurring in the range of pharmaceuticals may well be found to have their origin in the resale price maintenance legislation which this Government introduced and the Parliament passed last year. One might also recall that the pharmaceutical industry did not proceed before, I think, the Trade Practices Tribunal seeking an exemption from the provisions of resale price maintenance. Following that event - I cannot say as a result of it - there has certainly been a lot of movement in this area. If the result of competition is to ensure that the prices at which stock proprietary lines are made available to the community are reduced, I am sure that that is something which the Government welcomes. I would hope that people conscious of the need to keep prices down would also welcome it. I have read articles which indicate that chemists themselves have a very competitive spirit and that a great number of them have formed a co-operative under which they will be able to combat what they might regard as the competition of the supermarkets. All I say is that if competition is the result of what is happening, and that results in lower prices, it is to be commended. </para>

            <para>- I feel that I am not in a position to commit the Acting Minister for Health, whom I represent in this place. Doubtless he would wish to consult the Minister for Health. Analgesics have been on the market for a very long time. No State legislation restrains or controls their sale. It must be respected that the matter is one for State legislation, if there is to be legislation. The issue has been before the National Health and Medical Research Council on a number of occasions, and various suggestions have been aired as to what steps might be taken. No decisions or specific recommendations have been made by the Council. I think the general pattern of Commonwealth and State Health Ministers* conferences in the general area in which the honourable senator asked his question has been to rely upon the decisions of the National Health and Medical Research Council, it being an expert body representative of the Commonwealth and the States and it being well equipped to make the necessary decisions. Insofar as competition in involved, where there is no problem of injury to health I think we can allow the ordinary processes to take their course. If there is a need to maintain public health, I think the National Health and Medical Research Council would be well acquainted with what has to be done. I will refer the honourable senator&#39;s question to the Acting Minister. </para>

Prescinding entirely from the disgrace of allowing the vessel into our ports at all, is it a fact that the Russian freighter named &#39;Ho Chi Minh&#39; recently had a black ban placed on it by the Australian Council of Trade Unions or other organisation? Was such black ban placed upon the vessel because the Russians insisted upon doing work usually done by Australian workers? Is it a fact that such black ban has now been lifted? If so, can the Minister advise whether any legal steps were taken, and by whom, to have such black ban on the Russian vessel lifted, or were any extra-legal steps taken? Is the control of vessels entering our ports a Federal or State responsibility? </para>

            <para>- Quite apart from my interest in the word &#39;prescinding&#39; with which the honourable senator commenced his question, it appears to me that the question could have been addressed equally to the Minister representing the Minister for Labour and National Service or to myself. I am not aware of a black ban having been imposed or, if it was imposed, whether it was because of an objection to the non-employment of Australian workmen. If the circumstances hypothecated by the honourable senator are correct they certainly raise an interesting question as to the means by which the black ban was lifted. I am not aware of any legal steps being taken. (Opposition senators interjecting)- </para>

              <para>- Since I have attempted to answer the question there has been a lot of interjection and comments from a few Opposition senators who probably know a lot more about the circumstances than I do. Having regard to the militancy of the political protestations which they utter so frequently, it may be that they can shed on this matter light which the Australian people should have given to them as to how such an event could have occurred, accepting what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hannan</inline> said as a basis. I will have inquiries made as to whether Commonwealth police took any action, but I am not aware of any such action having been taken. Usually in matters of this kind, if black bans are imposed, they are imposed by unions who want to use extra-legal means. If the black ban in this case was lifted by extra-legal means, I think the political implications are quite significant. </para>

            <para>- I have had occasion to say before that it is an unobservant person who would not realise that there is a State election about to take place in Queensland. We have heard questions such as this one asked over a period of some weeks in which this chamber has been used by some honourable senators from the Australian Labor Party in the hope of getting some publicity to impugn the current Government in Queensland. I certainly use those words advisedly because I gave an answer on notice to this question within the last week which . indicated that there were proceedings, as I was aware, taking place in the courts and that such  were  (he places where allegations of this sort ought to be aired and decided by a tribunal which is equipped to handle them. I can only deplore the departure from traditional standards by members of the Labor Party in seeking to use the publicity of this forum for the purpose for which they have. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Attorney-General and relates to the answer the Attorney-General gave to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young</inline> in which he referred to the failure of chemists to apply to the  Registrar or the Trade Practices Tribunal, especially in reference to resale price maintenance. Is it a fact that many industries have withdrawn their applications to the Registrar because of the  Nakasa  Case in which it cost that company $12,500 to present its application which was lost? I might add that as that company and many others believe that the Registrar&#39;s opinion was not correct according to law it may cost that company another $15,000 to $20,000 to take the case to the High Court. </para>

            <para>- I am unable to confirm or challenge what the honourable senator has said. As I understand the position, I had earlier said  in  answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young</inline> that the pharmaceutical industry had not pursued its application for exemption from resale price maintenance provisions. I feel  in  the whole area to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> refers that if an industry felt it has a genuine case for exemption from the provisions  it  would be well equipped to put and sustain that case before a tribunal. If it does not proceed with  it  I would have thought that  it  was because it had some lack of confidence in its case. </para>

I would be grateful to him if he would let me have any particular knowledge he has in his possession. I cannot guarantee whether the Ministers concerned - the Minister for Trade and Industry and the Minister for Customs and Excise - can let us have a statement prior to the Parliament rising. We are watching this matter closely. An investigation is taking place. As I said earlier, I would be glad to have anything which the honourable senator has which he thinks might aid the process. </para>

            <para>- In fairness to the honourable senator I think that I should ask him to put his question on the notice paper so that a full and correct reply can be given. He will appreciate that there are aspects in the question which turn upon legal considerations which I would prefer not to give - quite apart from any consideration of the Standing Orders - without some reference to the exact position. Generally the position is that the Minister has a discretion which is vested in him under, I think, section 8 of the Passports Act. 1 think that is the only section which deals with this general power that he exercises. </para>

No doubt the Minister for Primary Industry will contribute to that debate. In regard to the latter part of the honourable senator&#39;s question, the Government, through the Prime Minister, made an announcement on 2nd May that Cabinet would deal with this matter when it had received the Randall Committee report. Since that time the Government has received another Randall Committee report. But it is my understanding that a further report is to be presented. As soon as the Government has that information Cabinet will be making a decision and an announcement will be made later. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- by leave - The Government&#39;s review of restrictive trade practices and monopolisation has proceeded to the stage where I am able to inform the Senate of a number of important conclusions that the Government has reached. In this statement I shall indicate, in some detail and in advance of the Bill that the Government proposes to introduce, the conclusions that have been reached. The review of this legislation has been thorough and comprehensive. In the light of it the Government proposes to make some changes of great </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Importance and a number of modifications to provisions of the existing legislation, which will increase the effectiveness of that legislation. The net effect of all the changes will be both to strengthen the legislation and to widen its scope. </para>
          <para>The Government recognises the impact that the changes it is proposing will have on the future development of this country. It has accordingly concluded that before a Bill is prepared this statement of its proposals should be made to Parliament so that there will be an appropriate opportunity for the proposals to be studied and fully debated. The proposals that I will be outlining in this statement provide for firstly, a widening of the scope of the existing provisions to deal with monopolisation so as to enable monopoly conditions to be fully investigated when there is reason to believe that those conditions are not operating in the public interest; secondly, mergers - including takeovers - that are likely to reduce competition to be subject to inquiry and restraint when this is desirable in the public interest; thirdly, the establishment of a Monopolies Commission which will be separate from and will supplement the work of the Trade Practices Tribunal; fourthly, stronger provisions for the examination of examinable agreements which are registrable and the examinable practice of inducing refusal to deal; and finally, a general tightening up of the legislation in a number of other respects. </para>
          <para>Before proceeding to indicate the Government&#39;s proposal in detail, I propose to advert to the Government&#39;s philosophy in regard to restrictive trade practices and monopolisation. The Government believes today - as it has always done - in a system of free enterprise under which citizens have as much freedom as possible to participate in the production and distribution of the nation&#39;s wealth. In 1962 when announcing proposals that became the foundation of our present legislation, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Garfield</inline> Barwick pointed to the need to ensure the existence of competitive conditions, which, as he said, tend to initiative, resourcefulness, productive efficiency, high output and fair and reasonable prices to the consumer. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Garfield</inline> went on to point out, however, that the lessening of competition may, in some aspects of the economy, be unavoidable and indeed be, not only consistent with, but also a proper ingredient of, a truly free enterprise system. The Act that was passed in 1965 accordingly provided for practices which are restrictive of competition to be examinable to ascertain whether they are contrary to the public interest, and where found to be contrary to that interest to be prohibited. </para>
          <para>In its basic approach to the subject of restrictive trade practices and monopolisation, the Government still adheres to the philosophy I have just described. Indeed, while the 1965 legislation has not unnaturally been the subject of considerable comment in the light of experience, it has been clear that its philosophical foundation has had general acceptance. Let me put that philosophy now into its 1972 economic context. The greatest menace confronting the Australian economy today is inflation. Excessively rising wages have been highlighted, correctly, as contributing greatly to the inflationary trend and the Government has acted, within its powers, to try to alert community consciousness to the problem and to persuade wage-fixing tribunals and employers to act responsibly when confronted by excessive wage demands. The balanced decision of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in the national wage case gives ground for hope that some headway can be made in resisting the inflationary tide. </para>
          <para>The proposals outlined in this statement are an earnest of the Government&#39;s intentions to attack the basic causes of inflation wherever they may be found. Restrictive practices and monopolisation contribute importantly to inflation. There is no question about that. A competitive environment keeps businessmen on their toes; encourages innovation and trying to do better than the other fellow, and, it should be emphasised, through making the automatic passing on of increased costs more difficult, discourages soft attitudes towards excessive wage demands. Conversely, where practices severely limiting competition prevail, the resulting market power is, in effect, a power to pass on to consumers, through increased prices, costs which would not in a more competitive situation have been incurred at all. In addition, restrictive practices and monopolisation can of course lead to high price levels through their effect on the efficiency of the industries concerned or through profit levels that are higher than they otherwise would be. </para>
          <para>Among other things, therefore, these proposals give the lie to those who say that the Government&#39;s anti-inflationary policies are directed only at the wage earner. Of course it would be idle to pretend that effecting these proposals, in themselves, will have marked effects on the price level in the short run. Rather, these proposals are aimed at creating conditions conducive to a more efficient allocation of resources and to higher levels of productivity over the long haul, with consequential beneficial effects on trends in prices and living standards. Increasing productivity is the most painless way for the economy, taken as a w&#39;-&#34;&#34;&#62;&#39;&#34; to slow inflation and this is a basic objective of these proposals. </para>
          <para>Ihese proposals would, of course, complement the other measures which the Government has taken to improve the competitiveness and efficiency of operation of the economy. Honourable senators will recall that last year the trade practices legislation was amended to make the practice of resale price maintenance unlawful. Also, last year the Government set in hand a progressive review of the tariff, designed to ensure that the tariff rates on imports do not go beyond what is necessary to provide adequate protection for economic and efficient Australian production. Recently my colleague, the Minister for Trade and Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony),</inline> announced the steps the Government is taking to speed up this review. All of these measures and proposals have as their objective the more efficient operation and more effective development of our economy. </para>
          <para>I referred earlier to the philosophy of the 1965 legislation. The questions that have arisen since the enactment of that legislation have related not to its philosophical foundation, but rather to the nature and effect of the particular provisions in the legislation. The main task of any legislation dealing with restrictive trade practices and monopolisation is to separate those practices that are against the public interest, so that they can be controlled, from those that are not. The for mulation of provisions to accomplish this task involves formidable problems particularly if, as is desirable, the task is to be carried out with due regard to the circumstances in which a particular practice operates but also with appropriate expedition. </para>
          <para>The approach of the 1965 Act has been to provide for a system of case-by-case examination of agreements and practices within certain defined classes. These public interest examinations are conducted, in the first place, by the Commissioner of Trade Practices, who has the benefit, in the case of agreements, of the information in the Register of Trade Agreements. Where the Commissioner is of the opinion that an agreement or practice is contrary to the public interest, he is required to have consultations about the matter with the parties concerned. If those consultations do not result in satisfactory changes to suit the needs of the public interest the Commissioner is authorised to institute proceedings in the Trade Practices Tribunal, which then becomes responsible for determining, after a full investigation of the matter, whether the agreement or practice is in fact contrary to the public interest, and if so, for making appropriate orders to prevent its continuation. Under this casebycase approach the cardinal principle is that unless and until an agreement or practice has been considered and determined to be contrary to the public interest, it is not unlawful and may be continued without restraint. </para>
          <para>The 1965 Act represented a big step forward in the control of restrictive practices and monopolisation in Australia. Its predecessor, the Australian Industries Preservation Act had proved ineffective partly because of difficulties of constitutional law, but also because the generality of the terms in which it was expressed had led to great uncertainty as to its application. The 1965 Act set out to cover only clearly defined classes of conduct and thus to reduce uncertainty to the minimum. But the Act had to be formulated without the benefit of reliable information on many aspects of the extent, the character and the effects of the practices being engaged in in Australia. By comparison, we are fortunate in 1972 in having a great deal of knowledge concerning these matters. We have the benefit of all the information in the Register of Trade Agreements, we have the benefit of the Commissioner&#39;s experience, covering consideration of many agreements and consultations with parties, and summarised in 4 annual reports that he has submitted. We have the benefit of knowing what in practice is involved in proceedings before the Trade Practices Tribunal, which, in a carefully reasoned decision, has determined that an agreement of considerable significance was contrary to the public interest. We now have, both in and out of government, expertise in this field that was almost non-existent before 1965. With this further knowledge and experience we are in a position to assess the appropriateness of the provisions in the 1965 legislation. We can see where changes can be made to improve the effectiveness of the existing provisions. </para>
          <para>The 2 main conclusions that can be drawn at this stage are, firstly, that the Act does not go far enough in relation to the acquisition and use of dominant economic power, and, secondly, that the procedure for determining the public interest aspects of examinable agreements and practices needs to be reviewed to ensure that it is appropriate for all classes of such agreements and practices. I shall be elaborating on both these conclusions later in this statement. The first stage of the Government&#39;s review, which was instituted early in 1971, related to the practice known as resale price maintenance and, as honourable senators know, legislation prohibiting this practice was introduced and passed last year. The enactment of that legislation constituted a significant strengthening of the 1965 provisions, but the full impact of the abolition of this practice will not be felt until the Act is strengthened in other respects. The Senate will also recall that following the enactment of the resale price maintenance provisions, the High Court gave its decision in the case which has come to be known as the concrete pipes case. By that decision the High Court held substantial portions of the 1965 legislation to be invalid, but in so doing the High Court made it clear that the Commonwealth Parliament had adequate power under the so called corporations power of the Constitution to legislate with respect to restrictive trade practices and monopolies, in so far as corporations are involved. </para>
          <para class="block">And, it was in pursuance of the guidance thus given by the High Court with respect to the corporations power that the legislation presently operating, that is, the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1971, was drafted. But, as was made clear when the Bill for that Act was introduced, it was intended as holding legislation only. It was intended as legislation to overcome the constitutional defects disclosed in the concrete pipes case, and to hold the position until the strengthening legislation now proposed could be passed. The Government&#39;s consideration of the provisions to be included in this strengthening legislation has, of course, taken account of the Commonwealth&#39;s constitutional powers as disclosed in the concrete pipes decision. For example, provisions relating to mergers, which in 1965 would have been regarded as being of doubtful constitutional validity, are now possible and have been included. </para>
          <para>MONOPOLISATION</para>
        <para class="block">
        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President,</inline>when the Restrictive Trade Practices Bill 1971 was before the Senate certain amendments were moved to the provisions in its dealing with monopolisation. Those amendments were unsatisfactory and the Government refused to accept them. They would have provided offences for ill-defined forms of conduct and would have given rise to many questions of interpretation, and of their relationship to other provisions that relate to examinable practices. In refusing to accept the amendments, however, the Government indicated that it was giving full consideration to monoplisation  in the course of the review of the legislation then in progress. The Government has now given this matter careful consideration. At the outset a basic question arises. Is it appropriate in Australia, having regard to the limited size of our economy, that we should prohibit, as is done in the United States of America, any deliberate acquisition or assertion of monopoly power? Or should we adhere to the alternative approach provided in our existing examinable practice of monopolisation, which is concerned only with certain kinds of abuses of monopoly power? For reasons that I shall mention shortly the Government has concluded that in present circumstances neither of these approaches is entirely satisfactory for the Australian economy and that the appropriate course is  to adopt the desirable features of both approaches, as has been done in the United Kingdom. </para>
        <para>Where economic power is concentrated in the hands of a few businesses in an industry, those businesses may not be subject to normal competitive pressures and in the absence of those pressures there is a possibility that the conduct of the businesses will be inimical to the public interest. Businesses in a dominant position in an industry may also be able to use that position to inhibit the growth of competition. On the other hand, concentration of power may be desirable in certain industries in order that economies of scale and other benefits may be realised. In a number of industries the size of our economy may not be sufficient to support more than one, or a very small number, of businesses that are efficient by overseas standards. For this reason, the Government believes that a drastic prohibition of monopolisation on a general basis as has been provided for in the United States of America would be inappropriate for this country. </para>
      <para>The Government believes that the primary need is for the legislation to make provision for the control of abuses of monopoly power. But the Government also believes that the legislation should provide for particular acquisitions of monopoly power to be prevented if it appears after due inquiry they are likely, by reason of their anti-competitive effects, to be against the public interest. The Government has concluded moreover that monopolisation inquiries should not be confined, as they are by our existing legislation, to certain defined classes of conduct. It believes that the provisions should be in terms that are wide enough to cover all forms of abuse of monopoly power. </para>
      <para>The responsibility for instituting monopolisation inquiries of the kind that the Government is proposing and for taking remedial action in the light of such inquiries will be a very important one. The Government has concluded that it is a responsibility that should rest with the Government. That is to say, monopolisation will cease to be dealt with as an examinable practice for which proceedings in the Trade Practices Tribunal may be instituted by the Commissioner of Trade Practices, and provision will be made instead for the Government to be able to refer monopolisation matters to an investigating body for inquiry and report back to the Government. The investigating body for this purpose will be a new monopolies commission. The monopolies commission will be constituted by members with a wide variety of experience and qualifications so as to ensure that the Government receives the best possible advice on these important matters. The commission will have a full time chairman, assisted by other members appointed on a part time basis. </para>
      <para>The Monopolies Commission will be essentially an administrative body to advise the Government. While the Commission will to a large extent control its own procedures, those procedures will inevitably differ in certain basic respects from the procedures of the Trade Practices Tribunal. In the Trade Practices Tribunal the Commissioner of Trade Practices initiates proceedings and he is thereafter a party to the proceedings, which are adversary in character. That is to say, the Commissioner and the parties to the agreement or practice in question are opposed to one another and it is for the Tribunal to make the necessary determination. This procedure will not be appropriate for the proposed Monopolies Commission because its role will be to inquire and report rather than to determine. The Monopolies Commission will be left free to determine its own working procedures. It will be able to gather its own information, call for written submissions or hold public hearings as it may think appropriate. The Commission will be provided with appropriate staff to enable it to conduct its inquiries effectively. The Government believes that the type of inquiry that the Monopolies Commission will conduct will be more appropriate for the wide-ranging matters that will fall for its consideration, and also more expeditious than the adversary type of procedure. Expedition in such big inquiries is of course a most important consideration. The matters that will be able to be referred to the Monopolies Commission will not be closely defined. The Government will be able to refer to the Commission any question whether monopoly conditions are operating in a manner that is contrary to the public interest. Amongst other things, it will be possible in appropriate circumstances to have the Commission consider practices such as exclusive dealing, full-line forcing and refusal to supply that may be operating in an industry in which monopoly conditions prevail. For the purpose of the legislation monopoly conditions will exist if one third of the relevant market is concentrated in the hands of a single business or a number of businesses which are acting in such a way as to restrict competition. </para>
      <para>In considering questions of the public interest in relation to monopolisation the Monopolies Commission will bc required to have regard to relevant considerations generally along the lines of those that the Trade Practices Tribunal is at present required by section 50 to take into account in the course of its inquiries, although the provisions of that section will need to be adapted to render them appropriate for the type of inquiry that the Commission will undertake. The Commission will be required to report whether the monopoly conditions do in fact exist and whether they are operating, or may be expected to operate, contrary to the public interest. Where the Commission reports that monopoly conditions are operating or may be expected to operate contrary to the public interest, it will be required to report its conclusions and also to recommend action to remedy the situation disclosed in its report. It is proposed that the report will, upon receipt by the Minister, be tabled in Parliament, subject to the omission of information which, by reason of its confidential character, would be likely substantially to damage legitimate business interests. </para>
      <para>The Government notes that in the relevant United Kingdom legislation there are wide powers under which action can be taken following upon consideration of a report of the Commission. It is proposed that the Government will be empowered to take certain action along the lines available in the United Kingdom by way of orders subject to parliamentary supervision. Where, for example, the Commission has identified a particular type of practice or arrangement which is operating against the public interest, the Government will be able by such an order to render that practice or arrangement unlawful. In form an order will be similar to a restraining order which the Trade Practices Tribunal in monopolisation cases is already empowered to make. In some circumstances, however, satisfactory remedial action may necessitate more than the mere restraint of particular practices and arrangements. Positive action to effect changes may be called for. The nature of such action will be apparent only in the light of a particular report, and specific powers cannot therefore be conferred in advance. In those matters it will be appropriate for the Government to decide on any formal remedial action that should be taken. </para>
      <para>I think I should add that experience under similar provisions in the United Kingdom has shown that resort to formal orders to remedy unsatisfactory situations disclosed by reports of the Monopolies Commission is seldom necessary. In most cases appropriate remedial action is taken as a result of consultations with the Government. But against the possibility that such consultations may not always prove effective the legislation will need to provide for the making of formal orders. A breach of a formal order will be restrainable by an injunction and will give rise to a liability for damages. </para>
        <para>MERGERS</para>
      <para>A great many of the mergers of business enterprises which take place in this country do not operate against the public interest. Some may result in positive advantages in the form of economies of scale and more efficient utilisation of resources. Others may have no effect one way or another on the public interest. But mergers do tend to result in greater concentration of economic power and they can therefore in particular instances lead to an undesirable lessening of competition. It is with these mergers, and these alone, that the Government is concerned in the context of the proposals I am outlining in this statement. The Government has concluded that if there is reason to believe that the lessening of competition likely to result from a merger will be detrimental to the public interest, it will be appropriate for the likely effects of the merger on the public interest to be examined in depth and if necessary for the merger to be stopped. In such circumstances it will be better to prevent the reduction of competition that would result from the merger than to have to deal later with possible abuses of monopoly power that may result from it. The Government&#39;s present proposals accordingly provide for the inclusion in the legislation of provisions which will enable mergers to be examined on this selective basis. </para>
      <para>The proposals are not concerned with overseas investment as such. The issues that are raised by such investment are canvassed in the Treasury paper on overseas investment in Australia which has been tabled by my colleague, the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden),</inline> and the matter is under consideration by the Government. However, the proposed provisions will apply equally to Australian-owned companies and overseas-owned companies. Under these provisions the Monopolies Commission will be empowered to consider the public interest aspect of merger proposals referred to it by the Government. The Government will be empowered to refer a merger that would result in or accentuate monopoly conditions defined in the manner I have already indicated. The Government will also be empowered to refer a merger in which the net value of the assets being taken over exceeds $5m. The Government will thus be able to refer to the Monopolies Commission not only a merger between competing enterprises but also a significant merger between enterprises at different levels of production or distribution or in different lines of business. Such a merger can sometimes result in undesirable reduction of competition even though it does not create or accentuate monopoly conditions, and it is desirable therefore that it should be possible to subject it to scrutiny by the Monopolies Commission. </para>
      <para>The Government proposes that a merger will be liable to be referred at any time within 3 months of notification of it having been given to the Government or of the making of a public announcement concerning it. The Government does not propose that there should be a system under which all proposed mergers would need to be formally notified or registered. Such a system would not accord with the Government&#39;s view that only selected mergers of particular concern will need to be referred to the Commission. Where the Government is considering whether it should refer a particular merger for inquiry it will consult the parties to the merger with a view to obtaining all relevant information as quickly as possible. </para>
      <para>Inquiries by the Monopolies Commission into mergers will be similar to inquiries into monopolisation. In considering whether a merger is likely to operate to the detriment of the public interest the Commission will be required to have regard to the likely consequence of the reduction of competition that will be involved but it will also have regard to benefits expected to flow from the merger. If the Monopolies Commission reports that in its opinion a merger is likely to operate against the public interest and the merger has not already been consummated the Government will be able by order to prohibit the merger from taking place. Such an order will be subject to parliamentary approval. If the merger has already been consummated the Government will be able to require the enterprise concerned to take appropriate divestiture action. An order requiring such divestiture action will have to be approved by both Houses of Parliament before it takes effect. It is proposed to include in the legislation a power which will enable the Government to prohibit a merger from proceeding while it is under consideration by the Monopolies Commission. I would not expect that a need to exercise this power would often arise. But the power should be available so that it can be used when necessary to prevent action which may prejudice an inquiry or impede the taking of remedial action after the inquiry. Quite apart from this power I would expect that parties to merger proposals will often wish to know the outcome of the Commission&#39;s inquiry before going ahead with their proposals. </para>
      <para>The Government is conscious of the need in the interests of all persons concerned in mergers to keep uncertainty to the minimum. Merger inquiries by the Monopolies Commission will accordingly be required to be completed within as short a period as is practicable. In the United Kingdom such an inquiry must generally be completed within 6 months and in practice inquiries have often been completed in much shorter periods. It is proposed that our legislation will contain requirements in this regard similar to those in the United Kingdom legislation. The Government also proposes to establish administrative arrangements under which the parties to a proposed merger that has been publicly announced may seek and where practicable obtain a speedy intimation as to whether the merger will be referred to the Monopolies Commission. Such intimations will not be possible in respect of mergers that have not been publicly announced because it will not in such cases be possible to have regard to the views of all persons concerned. Nor will it be possible to provide for intimations to be given that would prevent a reference being made if the Government were subsequently to receive relevant information not supplied to it before the intimation was given. In practice, however, the system I have described for the giving of these intimations, which will be similar to one that has operated for some years in the United Kingdom, should do much to keep uncertainty to the minimum. </para>
        <para>ENQUIRIES INTO COMMONLYADOPTED PRACTICES</para>
      <para>The main functions of the Monopolies Commission will be those that I have mentioned, that is, to conduct enquiries into particular monopoly conditions and proposed mergers. However, the experience that the Commission obtains in these inquiries will be very considerable, and there could be occasions when it would be most advantageous for the Government to take advantage of this experience by arranging for the Commission to undertake broader enquiries. In the United Kingdom the Government has obtained the advice of its Monopolies Commission in this way in regard to several matters. I mention in particular the Commission&#39;s report in 1955 on collective discrimination, which was the basis of legislation the following year providing for the registration and examination of collective agreements. The Government proposes that the Monopolies Commission in Australia will be empowered, on request from the Government, to undertake similar inquiries into commonly-adopted practices. The purpose of these inquiries will be to assist in determining the need for and nature of specific legislation with respect to practices that are common in industry. </para>
        <para>EXAMINABLE AGREEMENTS AND EXAMINABLE PRACTICES</para>
      <para>The 1965 Act adopted the approach that certain agreements and practices should be examinable to ascertain whether or not they are contrary to the public interest. This approach was based on the recognition that not all agreements or practices restricting competition are against the public interest and that the determination of the question of whether or not a particular agreement or practice was against the public interest could only be made after an inquiry into its operation in the relevant industry. </para>
      <para>To this approach the Government proposes to adhere. It proposes however to make important changes which will reflect the conclusions which are <inline font-style="italic">to be</inline> drawn from our experience of the legislation. </para>
          <para>Existing Procedures</para>
        <para>To appreciate the nature of the changes the Government proposes with respect to the agreements and practices which are at present subject to the scrutiny of the Commissioner, it is desirable for me to outline the existing procedures. I have already mentioned that the Act at present adopts a case-by-case approach to the examination of agreements and practices to determine whether they are contrary to the public interest. Unless and until an agreement or practice has been considered and determined by the Trade Practices Tribunal to be contrary to the public interest it is not unlawful and may be continued without restraint. The agreements and practices which are subject to such examination are referred to by the Act as examinable agreements and examinable practices. I shall indicate the nature of these agreements and practices shortly. </para>
        <para>All proceedings in the Trade Practices Tribunal to obtain a public interest determination are initiated by the Commissioner of Trade Practices. Before he initiates such proceedings in respect of an agreement or practice he is required to examine the agreement or practice with a view to forming an opinion whether it is contrary to the public interest. If his opinion is that it is contrary to the public interest, he is first required to have consultations about the matter with the parties concerned. If those consultations do not result in changes which render proceedings before the Tribunal unnecessary, the Commissioner is then authorised to institute proceedings to obtain a public interest determination by the Tribunal. If the Tribunal determines that an agreement or practice is contrary to the public interest, it may make appropriate orders to prevent its continuance. </para>
        <para>In considering whether an examinable agreement or examinable practice is contrary to the public interest the Trade Practices Tribunal is required to make a balancing judgment in accordance with section SO. On the one hand that section requires the Tribunal to take as the basis of its consideration the principle that the preservation and encouragement of competition are desirable in the public interest. On the other hand the Tribunal must take into account beneficial effects that might be based on any of the matters set out in sub-section (2) of the section. Sub-section (2) sets out a large range of matters, with the consequence that provision is made for inquiries of a particularly wide-ranging character, which tend to be lengthy. Examinable agreements are defined in section 35. Shortly expressed these are agreements between businesses which are or should be competing with each other. They are anticompetitive agreements by which the parties agree amongst themselves that in conducting their businesses they will accept restrictions of one or more of the kinds specified in the section. The most common type of restriction relates to price and related matters such as discounts and concessions. Other common restrictions provide for market-sharing arrangements. Distribution arrangements are also covered if they are agreed between businesses at the same level of the distribution process. The observance of such restrictions is commonly reinforced by agreements to refuse to deal, that is, boycotts. </para>
        <para>The examinable practices are defined in sections 36 and 37. Section 36 covers the practices of obtaining discriminatory terms, inducing refusal to deal and forcing another person&#39;s product. Section 37 relates exclusively to the examinable practice of monopolisation to which I have already referred. It will be appreciated that under the procedures I have outlined not all examinable agreements and examinable practices have to be brought forward for examination by the Trade Practices Tribunal. The only agreements and practices that are to be brought forward for the Tribunal&#39;s examination are those that the Commissioner has concluded are contrary to the public interest and in respect of which the compulsory consultation procedure has not resulted in abandonment or in a variation which has made the agreement or practice acceptable in the public interest. The Act provides for the keeping of a Register of Trade Agreements. The purpose of this Register is to provide the Commissioner with most of the information he needs to perform his functions. All examinable agreements have to be registered except those exclusively concerned with what are commonly referred to as pure&#39; services. The agreements that are exempted from registration on this ground are set out in sub-section (2) of section 41. No practices as opposed to agreements have to be registered. </para>
          <para>Whether These Procedures Appropriate</para>
        <para>We are now in a position in which we can assess in the light of experience the appropriateness of the procedures I have outlined for examinable agreements and examinable practices. We now have the benefit of the information from the Register of Trade Agreements. We know how many registrable agreements there are and the nature of the restrictions in them. We have the benefit of 4 Annual Reports by the Commissioner of Trade Practices and a decision by the Trade Practices Tribunal with respect to one agreement. We also have the benefit of further experience under comparable legislation of other countries with respect to such agreements. The tables on page 15 of the Commissioner&#39;s Fourth Annual Report disclose that the total number of registered agreements as at 30th June 1971 was 13,276. The agreements which tend to have the greatest impact on the competitive climate of the economy are those which are mainly horizontal in their operation, that is, agreements between groups of manufacturers, groups of wholesalers or between groups of retailers. As at 30th June 1971, there were some 3,311 of these horizontal agreements. </para>
        <para>The Government has concluded that many of the agreements on the Register of Trade Agreements are likely to be found on examination to be contrary to the public interest. The Government has reached this conclusion on the information that is now available to it concerning these agreements in Australia and on the experience of other countries with respect to such agreements. 1 mention in particular the experience in the United Kingdom with respect to such agreements. In that country some 2,700 agreements were registered. In only 10 cases in which their public interest implications were examined by the Restrictive Practices Court were agreements found to be compatible with the public interest. The agreements involved in 22 contested cases were determined to be contrary to the public interest, and in the light of those decisions attempts to justify many other agreements on the Register were abandoned. In Australia our experience with respect to such agreements is of course more limited. However, the Government now has information available to it as to the number of the agreements that are involved and the nature of the restrictions in them. The only such agreement that has been considered by the Trade Practices Tribunal was found to be contrary to the public interest. </para>
        <para>The Government has also concluded that, on the basis of experience, the present examinable practice of inducing a person to refuse to deal - which is at present covered by paragraphs (e), (f) and (g) of sub-section  (1)  of section 36  -  is likely in most instances to be contrary to the public interest, lt is a practice which tends to be engaged in in order to force persons to become parties to or to comply with examinable agreements. The Government has accordingly concluded that there should be a stronger procedure for dealing with the examinable agreements that are registrable and the examinable practice of inducing refusal to deal. For the other examinable agreements, that is those relating exclusively to &#39;pure* services, and the examinable practices of obtaining discriminatory terms and forcing another person&#39;s product, the same need for a stronger approach does not exist, but there is a need for certain changes to be made to speed up the action that has to be taken before the institution of proceedings in the Tribunal. In particular, changes are needed to the provisions requiring the Commissioner to form  his  own public interest opinion and to engage in consultations. As I have mentioned earlier, the Government proposes to make special provision for monopolisation inquiries before a new Monopolies Commission and in consequence to omit the existing provisions which provide for monopolisation to be dealt with as an examinable practice. </para>
        <para>Proposals for registrable agreements  and  practice of inducing refusal to  deal. </para>
        <para>At the outset I should point out that some of the agreements that are at present on the register are thought to be probably not subject to registration. Particulars of these agreements have been furnished to the Commissioner for registration in order to avoid any possible liability, without resolving the legal question of whether they are in fact subject to registration. The fact that the agreements have been placed on the register will not operate to their prejudice under the present proposals. Their liability to be referred to the Tribunal under the stronger provisions will depend on whether the Commissioner, after due consideration, has reason to believe that they are in fact subject to registration. The new procedure will provide for all agreements and practices to which it applies to be brought forward for examination by the Trade Practices Tribunal. There will be no need for the Commissioner to form a prior opinion of his own that such an agreement or practice is contrary to the public interest; nor will the Commissioner be required to engage in any consultations with the parties to the agreements. As it will be the Commissioner&#39;s function to institute proceedings in respect of all of these agreements and practices, his discretion in regard to the institution of such proceedings will be confined to the order in which he brings particular agreements and practices forward for consideration. Some agreements and practices are, of course, of much greater significance than others, and considerations such as this will be proper matters for the Commissioner to take into account when he is deciding which ones should be brought forward first. </para>
        <para>The first step in proceedings before the Tribunal will be for the Commissioner to establish the existence of the agreement or practice in question and that it is an agreement or practice to which the new procedure applies. When the Commissioner has done this the Tribunal will have power to restrain the continuance of the agreement or practice unless the parties to it establish that it is not contrary to the public interest. In order to do this the parties will have to establish the existence of one or other of several grounds specified in the legislation. These grounds will need to be drafted with precision, but it is proposed that they be to the following effect: </para>
        <list type="loweralpha">
          <item label="(a)">
            <para>the agreement or practice confers specific and substantial benefits or advantages on purchasers, consumers or users; </para>
          </item>
          <item label="(b)">
            <para>the agreement or practice protects the public against physical injury; </para>
          </item>
          <item label="(c)">
            <para>the agreement or practice enables the parties to it to compete more effectively against larger businesses which are not parties to the agreement or practice; </para>
          </item>
          <item label="(d)">
            <para>the agreement or practice is necessary to support another agreement or practice that is either not examinable or if examinable has been found to be compatible with the public interest; or that </para>
          </item>
          <item label="(e)">
            <para>the agreement or practice does not restrict or discourage competition in Australia to any material degree. </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para class="block">If one or more of these grounds is established the Tribunal will need, in addition, to be satisfied that the agreement or practice would not result in a preponderant detriment to the public interest. These grounds will make proper provision for those agreements or practices that either have beneficial effects or have a negligible impact one way or the other on the public interest. But they will ensure that other agreements covered by the new procedure are identified as speedily as possible and thereafter discontinued. The matters which sub-section (5.) of section 35 at present requires to be disregarded in determining whether an agreement is an examinable agreement will, of course, continue to be disregarded for this purpose. Additionally, it will be provided that agreements which are exclusively concerned with the export trade will be disregarded. </para>
        <para>Under the new procedure the ambit of an inquiry by the Tribunal will be restricted to appropriate matters and this will assist materially in preventing inquiries from being unnecessarily lengthy. Moreover, by requiring all of the agreements to which the new procedure applies to be examined by the Trade Practices Tribunal we will ensure that there will be within a relatively short period of time a number of decisions of the Tribunal which will afford guidance to the parties to other agreements and practices. It necessary, the number of members of the Tribunal and the staff of the Commissioner will be increased. Parties will have this guidance when considering whether they should attempt to establish in proceedings before the Tribunal that their agreements or practices are compatible with the public interest and whether they should enter into new agreements. On the basis of the United Kingdom experience it can reasonably be expected that the parties to a number of such agreements and practices will conclude that such proceedings would not be worthwhile and they will choose instead to terminate the agreements or practices. </para>
        <para>There are 2 respects in which it is proposed to widen the class of agreements which are subject to examination. In each respect this widening will ensure that the class of examinable agreements includes agreements which really have the same objectives as those already covered. If these new examinable agreements are also registrable they will be subject to the new procedure I have outlined. In the first place the class of examinable agreements will be extended to cover what are commonly called price information agreements. Experience both here and in other countries has shown that the purpose of provisions directed at agreements by which the parties accept price restrictions can be defeated by replacing those agreements with agreements by which the parties undertake to notify each other of the prices they intend to charge. The effect of such an agreement is in practice virtually the same as if the parties agreed to conform to the prices notified. Price information agreements were covered by the United Kingdom&#39;s restrictive trade practices legislation in 1968 and the Government has concluded that they should be treated under our proposed legislation as if they were agreements for price restrictions. The other widening of the class of examinable agreements will cover agreements by which the parties undertake to make recommendations to each other in regard to matters of the kind mentioned in sub-section (2) of section  35.  An agreement to make recommendations to each other in regard to such matters will normally achieve the same result as an agreement by which the parties agree to accept restrictions in regard to those matters. In some cases, an agreement to make such recommendations might in fact have implicit in it an understanding that the parties will conform to the recommendations, and in that event it would be covered already by reason of the definition of &#39;agreement&#39; in section  138.  But experience has shown that the position in regard to recommendation agreements is not as satisfactory as it might be and the Government accordingly now proposes to make it clear that they are covered. </para>
        <para>Proposals for other examinable agreements and examinable practices </para>
        <para>Those examinable agreements and examinable practices which are not to be subject to the now approach I have described will continue to be subject to the public interest test provided in section  50-  However, <inline font-style="italic">2</inline> changes are proposed in regard to the steps that have to be taken before proceedings in respect of such an agreement or practice are instituted in the Tribunal. One of these changes will be to dispense with the need for the Commissioner of Trade Practices to form his own opinion that the agreement or practice is contrary to the public interest. The formation of such an opinion necessarily involves a good deal of time, and in the long run it is still necessary for the Tribunal to double up on the function and reach its own conclusions on the matter. The Government accordingly proposes to empower the Commissioner to institute proceedings in respect of such an agreement or practice if it appears to him to be desirable that the question whether the agreement or practice is contrary to the public interest be determined by the Tribunal. </para>
        <para>The other change with respect to such agreements is that, as in the case of the agreements and practices that are to be subject to the stronger approach, the provisions in section  48  for statutory consultations with the parties before institution of proceedings will be omitted. The provisions for these statutory consultations have given rise to difficulties, particularly when arrangements reached in the consultations have not subsequently been observed. The Government has concluded that the more appropriate course is to remove the statutory obligations for the Commissioner to carry on these consultations and to leave it to the Commissioner to decide in the circumstances of particular cases whether and to what extent communication with the parties is desirable before proceedings are instituted. </para>
        <para>CONSTITUTIONAL SCOPE OF LEGISLATION</para>
      <para>It will be recalled that the present Act was passed as a holding measure following the decision of the High Court in the case known as the Concrete Pipes Case. By that decision the High Court held that, due to the way in which the  1965  Act had sought to use all the constitutional powers believed to be available to sustain the legislation, it was open to legal objection. When introducing the Bill for the present Act I pointed out that the provisions in it, other than those relating to overseas cargo shipping, were based entirely on the corporations power. I mentioned that this exclusive reliance on the corporations power was to facilitate the drafting and thereby to avoid undesirable delay in the introduction of the Bill. However, I went on to say that provisions drawing upon other powers had been deferred for consideration in connection with the proposed strengthening legislation. In this connection I mentioned particularly the reference of power from Tasmania. Consistently with what I indicated on that occasion the Government proposes that the new legislation will not be based entirely on the corporations power, but will draw on such other powers as are available. This will be done in a way that will not give rise to the defects the High Court found to exist in the  1965  Act. </para>
        <para>OVERSEAS CARGO SHIPPING PROVISIONS</para>
      <para>Overseas cargo shipping is the subject of separate provisions in Part XII of the Act, which is administered by my colleague, the Minister for Trade and Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr</inline></para>
      <para class="block">Anthony). My colleague has already indicated that certain changes will be made to these provisions. The statement I have made has no bearing on the overseas cargo shipping provisions. </para>
      <para>
        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Acting Deputy President,</inline>the changes 1 have outlined in this statement are being proposed after a most thorough and painstaking review of the existing legislation, in the light of experience since that legislation was enacted. The proposals also take account of the guidance the High Court has recently given as to the Commonwealth&#39;s powers to legislate in this field in pursuance of the corporations power. Many proposals of importance are involved. The Government believes that the changes will greatly improve the effectiveness of the legislation - that they will do much to preserve and encourage competition and thereby benefit our free enterprise system and our way of life generally. Tt is not desirable, however, that changes of this nature should be made without first affording the Parliament and interested persons generally opportunity to study the proposals and to make their views known. This statement will serve the purpose of making the Government&#39;s proposals known. The Bill to implement, the proposals will be introduced as soon as practicable after there has been reasonable opportunity for them to be studied and assessed. </para>

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Acting Deputy President,</inline> the statement made by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Greenwood)</inline> is a disappointing one. This is not unexpected. I predicted that the so-called strengthened legislation would be as useless as the old Act back in November 1971 when the Senate was dealing with the Restrictive Trade Practices Bill 197 1 . We all know that restrictive practices are one of the most powerful causes of inflation. That is agreed upon on all hands. We know that the prevalence of restrictive practices in Australia is one of the reasons for the poor growth rate in Australia. We know that restrictive practices are productive of inefficiency, softness and waste. They are a blot on our community and affect the living standards of lis all. This is well known. It is accepted by the Government because it has no chance of not accepting what is known to bc the case all over the world. This was the subject of a specific inquiry in Tasmania some 10 years ago, and also by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Garfield</inline> Barwick when he was Attorney-General, also about a decade ago. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The duty of the Government is lo introduce legislation which will provide for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth. In this sphere, the Government has deliberately neglected and delayed to perform its clear duly. We have had a history of delays, of disappointments and of pressures being exerted by powerful interests so that today, 10 years after it was clear that we should have had effective trade practices legislation, we still have no effective laws. The proposals by the Attorney-General mean that even if the foreshadowed legislation were passed by this Parliament, we still would not have effective laws. The monopolies commission which he proposes is an advisory body. The other proposals about mergers will not be satisfactory. The attempts to speed up the processes of dealing with examinable practices and agreements may achieve  a  little, but it is clear that they, too, are of  a  nature which will allow the existing bad position to continue. The improvements are minimal. No attempt is made to tackle the problem as it ought to be tackled. </para>
          <para>The Attorney-General undertook that strengthened legislation would be introduced, that the Government was committed to strengthening the legislation and that it would do so after a full study and consideration had been accorded to the work of a committee. He assured the Senate that this objective would be actively pursued. We are now at the end of this period of the sitting. AH we have is this lengthy statement which is really no indication at all of what could be described as strengthened legislation. We cannot drag the laws out of him. He will not even bring in the legislation now so that it can be dealt with by the Parliament. There is no excuse for further delay. </para>
          <para>The Attorney-General laughs. We know from experience that his laughter is always an attempt to cover up a difficult situation in which he has been put. On this occasion, in fairness to him I would venture to suggest that this is not his handiwork. I think that perhaps he meant what he said about strengthened legislation. It is clear that this proposal indeed is a decision of the Government and that the Government&#39;s decision is consistent with what it has done in the past. It is determined not to have effective trade practices laws. We might as well face the fact, as I said before, that we will not get effective trade practice laws until there is a change of government. The people of this country are entitled to protection. The public is entitled to protection against these restrictive practices. The business community is entitled to protection against them. The Government is determined that they will not get it. I think that it is clear that what this Senate wants before it is the legislation on this subject so that it can deal with it. There is not much point in continuing this debate. There will not be much opportunity to discuss this matter in this period. I hope that this document will not be used as an excuse for delays of a kind similar to those that occurred in the early 1960s when, in the House of Representatives, the device of bringing in a proposal of this kind and letting it lie on the table for months and months was used as an excuse for not introducing legislation. </para>

The proceeds of the loan will assist in financing a telecommunications development project in Papua New Guinea planned for execution during the period 1972-75. At the same time, the International Development Association, an affiliate of the International Bank, has approved a credit of $US9.2m ($A7.7m) to help finance improvements to shipping facilities at Port Moresby, Lae and Kieta and the construction of a new small port at Alotau. The credit will be made to the Administration and will be for </para>

The credit will also be guaranteed by the Commonwealth. </para>
          <para>The International Bank loan will be the second loan to the Administration from the Bank for development of telecommunications services. The first loan, for $US7m ($A6.2m), was arranged in 1968 and Covered the foreign exchange costs of a project which has provided a backbone of long distance radio links between the main centres and approximately 10,000 additional lines on local automatic exchanges. The first project is expected to be completed on schedule about the middle of this year. </para>
          <para>The second telecommunications development project was examined by an appraisal mission from the International Bank last year. As a result of that appraisal the Bank offered to assist by providing a loan and the loan documents were settled recently during negotiations in Washington which were attended by representatives of the International Bank, the Commonwealth and the Administration of Papua New Guinea. Work on the new project will commence shortly and will take 3 years to complete. The project is designed to utilise and expand the facilities provided in the first project by the extension of telephone facilities and the installation of modern Telex facilities. It includes the provision of about 13,500 lines of local automatic exchange equipment, including the replacement of 3,300 lines of existing equipment; the associated distribution plant and subscribers&#39; equipment; about 650 additional long distance circuits on existing routes; the installation of Telex exchanges with a total capacity of about 600 lines and the provision of about 500 teleprinters. The total cost of the project will be about $ A 14.4m and the loan from the International Bank will cover most of the foreign exchange component of this total cost. </para>

However, with loans from the International Bank, a formal guarantee agreement is required from the Commonwealth and this must be authorised by specific legislation. The guarantee agreement for this loan, which is shown as the first schedule to the Bill follows the form of the 3 guarantee agreements previously approved by Parliament in connection with International Bank loans to the Administration. The present loan, which was sought by the Government of Papua New Guinea, will carry an interest rate of 7.25 per cent per annum and will be for a period of 20 years, with repayments commencing after 4 years. A commitment fee of <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> of 1 per cent per annum is payable on undrawn balances until the loan is fully drawn. </para>
          <para>The Bill provides for parliamentary approval of the guarantee agreement. It makes consequential provision to ensure the effectiveness of undertakings in the loan and guarantee agreements regarding freedom of payments from Australian taxation or restrictions imposed by Australian law and includes an appropriation of moneys required for the Commonwealth to make any payments under the guarantee. It also provides for the amendment of the Papua and New Guinea Loan (International Bank) Act 1968 to effect certain minor amendments to the loan agreement and loan regulations for the first telecommunications loan as required by the present loan agreement. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

          <para class="block">This Bill arises from the Government&#39;s wish to speed up the progressive review of the Tariff which was initiated by the </para>
          <para class="block">Government last year. It was foreshadowed in a statement made in the House of Representatives on 12th April 1972 when the Minister for Trade and Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> announced that the Government had decided that the Tariff Board Act should be amended to enable the Tariff Board to comprise 11 members instead of the present 9 members. In January of last year, after considering the views expressed by the Tariff Board, the Government decided that there should be a progressive review of the tariff and one of the major tasks for the Minister since becoming Minister for Trade and Industry has been the setting in train of this review. </para>
          <para>The review commenced in May 1971 when the Minister for Trade and Industry referred to the Board 10 references covering those items of the &#39;Machinery&#39; Chapter of the Tariff which were not already under reference. These references were as suggested by the Tariff Board and are to be followed by references in the area of manufactures of metal. It became apparent that with the additional workload, and given the time it takes for the Board to conduct its usual inquiries, it would be many years before the review could be completed by the Board as at present constituted. </para>
          <para>The Minister therefore asked the Department of Trade and Industry to address itself to the question whether fair and equitable procedures could be evolved which would enable the review to be completed in quicker time, without the quality of the reports to the Government being lessened in any material sense and with industry retaining its right to a full opportunity to be heard by the Board. The Minister for Trade and Industry also sought the views of the  Chairman  of the Tariff Board on this matter and at the same time made it clear that he would value the views any sector of industry might have on it. </para>
          <para>It was appreciated that, as well as its importance in connection with forthcoming international trade negotiations, a proposal from the Department of Trade and Industry for an &#39;excess margin&#39; items reference would, in addition, be of value as an interim measure in relation to the review. As honourable senators are aware, the reference, which was foreshadowed in my statement to the Senate on 18th April 1972 and which has now been forwarded to the Tariff Board, seeks a report by the end of the year on whether the General Tariff rates of duty on over 1,000 items can be reduced. However, on the basis of the examinations by the Department of Trade and Industry and the Tariff Board it became clear that the only way to complete in a reasonably short period such a massive task as the progressive review - one which had never been undertaken in Australia before - would be to make additional resources available. </para>
          <para>Accordingly, the  Chairman  of the Tariff Board submitted to the Minister detailed proposals which if adopted would, he believed, complete the review by December 1978. In particular, he proposed that two additional members be appointed to the Board and that the restriction on the number of public-servant members be eased. The present Bill proposes amendments in the Tariff Board Act to give effect to these changes. </para>
          <para>Provision is made for the Board to comprise 11 rather than 9 members as at present. However, to provide for future flexibility, it is proposed that the Act be amended in a way which permits the actual number of Board members to ranga between 7 and 11 members at any particular time. Thus when the progressive review is completed it would be possible for the Board to be reduced in size without the legislation needing further amendment. </para>
          <para>With the enlarged Board the  Chairman  of the Tariff Board has informed the Minister that he has in mind that the Board&#39;s work be handled in the following way: Three 2-member divisions of the Board to be employed full-time on review references; two 2-member divisions to handle the normal tariff-revision inquiries; and one member divisions to handle the normal non-tariff revision inquiries. </para>
          <para>As the Act stands at present, the number of members who were public servants at the time of their appointment cannot be less than 2 or more than 3. The proposed amendment increases the permissible number of such members to 5. With an enlarged Board the existing arrangement would be too restrictive and an easing of the provision will widen the range of choice open to the Government in making the additional appointments. Provision is also made in the Bill for a presiding member of a division of the Board to carry out the functions of the  Chairman,  as set out by the  Chairman  in writing on each occasion and confined to the purposes of a particular inquiry and report. In addition, in line with the general policy applying to statutory bodies, the present salary and allowances of the statutory officers concerned have now been set out in the legislation. </para>
          <para>The Minister was assured by the  Chairman  of the Tariff Board that the appointment of the additional members, as provided for in this Bill, should assist materially in the speeding-up of the progressive review. At the same time I take this opportunity of assuring honourable senators that it is the Government&#39;s intention that the review inquiries be full and thorough and that every opportunity be given to manufacturers to put their case. I should also repeat what has been said by the Minister for Trade and Industry and other Ministers on numerous occasions: The Government itself is responsible for all decisions relating to tariffs. As the review reports come forward one by one the Government will apply itself to the Board&#39;s recommendations in the same way as it does in the case of all Tariff Board reports. They will be examined thoroughly, and action taken to implement or amend the Board&#39;s recommendations only after the most thorough examination and after full account has been taken of the considerations set out in the Minister&#39;s tariff policy statement to the House on 29th April last year. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

          <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is to increase the standing appropriation in the Public Works Committee Act 1969 from $20,000 to $30,000. The appropriation, which is fixed by section 36 of the Act, is designed to limit the upper level of the amount of the expenses of the Committee. The major part of these is the cost of travel for members when on Committee business and the balance represents the sitting fees and travelling allowances payable to the members under the Regulations. </para>
          <para>The Committee has advised that the funds remaining available to it for the rest of 1971-72 will be insufficient to cover the cost of anticipated inspections and hearings, and has accordingly sought an increase in the standing appropriation. The Committee&#39;s 33rd annual general report for 1970 shows that the number of reports presented to Parliament has increased over recent years, as follows: 1966, 13; 1967, 11; 1968, 20; 1969, 18; and 1970, 22. </para>
          <para>The 34th annual report records that the number of references during 1971 has maintained the abovementioned trend of a gradual increase in the volume of Commonwealth works projects. The scope of the Committee&#39;s investigations ranges over Commonwealth activities in all States, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory and it is unlikely that there will be any diminution of the Committee&#39;s activities in the future. A significant feature in 1971 was the preponderance of Northern Territory projects. </para>
          <para>The work which this Committee does in extending the scrutiny of Parliament in the field of Commonwealth public works is of considerable importance. The regular and comprehensive reports which it presents to the Parliament are in themselves evidence of the immense amount of work that the Committee does, and I am sure that there will be no objection to increasing the standing appropriation so as to allow the Committee effectively to continue its activities. </para>
          <para>The Parliament approved the existing appropriation of $20,000 in 1965. It was indicated at the time that that amount would suffice for a number of years. The increase to $30,000 now proposed should make it unnecessary to approach the Parliament for minor increases. The amount will assure the Committee adequate finance to meet the relatively small expenses incurred in the performance of its duties. I commend the Bill. </para>

          <para class="block">The Government continues to endorse the triennial principle for grants to universities and colleges of advanced education, but accepts that during the current 1970-72 triennium there have been exceptional increases in non-academic salaries and wages. Accordingly the Commonwealth decided to join with the States in supplementing the resources available to universities and colleges for recurrent expenditure to assist them to meet these unforeseen increases in cost. Following upon this decision a Bill was introduced and passed by the Parliament during the Budget sittings last year which appropriated additional recurrent grants for the universities. The main purpose of the Bill now before the Senate is to make the corresponding supplementary grants for colleges of advanced education in the States in respect of costs arising from exceptional increases in nonacademic salaries and wages. </para>
          <para>The revised schedule of recurrent grants also provides for some other items. The additional grant to Victoria includes a small component in respect of the increased costs flowing from a salary determination affecting academic staff in agricultural colleges in the Slate. </para>
          <para>A new institution - the South Australian Board of Advanced Education - has been established in 1972. Honourable senators will be aware that the current Act already provides specifically for support of boards of advanced education in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, and similar provision is now being made for South Australia. </para>
          <para>The new amounts shown for some Victorian colleges and Queensland colleges take into account transfers of recurrent funds within these States. These transfers of funds have been requested by the States and do not affect the total grant payable to the State. A a result of the revised schedule of recurrent grants, supplementary Commonwealth grants totalling approximately $787,000 and representing a combined additional Commonwealth/ State allocation of $2,242,000 will be made available for colleges of advanced education in the States. </para>
          <para>In accordance with established precedent the Bill provides separately also for Commonwealth support of McGregor College, a residential college affiliated with the Darling Downs Institute of Advanced Education. Provision has already been made for support of the other affiliated college operating in the college sector, Agricola College, which is affiliated with the Kalgoorlie Branch of the Western Australian Institute of Technology. </para>
          <para>Finally, the Bill incorporates a revised schedule of grants for capital expenditure to accommodate variations initiated by the States. The total grant payable to each State is unaltered, the variations affecting only projects listed for support and the distribution of grants between projects. A new institution listed for preliminary support is the Torrens College of Advanced Education in South Australia which will come into operation in the forthcoming 1973-75 triennium. I commend to honourable senators this Bill which provides for additional Commonwealth grants to the States for advanced education. </para>

            <para>-  Today I feel that I am the victim of the accuracy of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff because on looking at yesterday&#39;s Hansard report I see that I have 17 minutes left in which to speak to the motion for the second reading of this Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. There are many things that should be said about this Bill which time will not permit me to say, although yesterday I spoke about it for 43 minutes. Possibly they will be said by another honourable senator. Yesterday I endeavoured to show, as I did when speaking on the Public Service Arbitration Bill, the development of the trade union movement, its aspirations and ambitions, and the actions of various governments over the years in the industrial field. Throughout my speech I tried to stress that in my opinion the motive of everyone dealing with Industrial questions was the prevention of strikes because they did not benefit workers, employers or the general public. I give credit, in a generous way, to governments since the Conciliation and Arbitration Act was first introduced in the Commonwealth Parliament in 1904 in an effort to prevent strike action. Numerous amendments have been made to the legislation with the intention of trying to save the community from the problems created by strikes. I accept that the many amendments were made in accordance with the earnest wish of the governments of the time which were worried about this strike problem. Even the 1956 amendment, which introduced penal clauses for strike action for the first time in Commonwealth Acts of Parliament, could have been prompted or promoted by the desire of the then government to impose penalties on trade unions in an effort to prevent strike action. That that measure failed, as did other measures, is indicated by the necessity for further amendment of the Act. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>On this occasion, for the first time, amendments are being made to the Act by the present Government not with the aim of trying to settle industrial disputes. One can see that by the very nature of this Bill. For the first time, to my knowledge, amendments are being made to the Act in order to save the political life of the Government in a period of disrepute and Jack of public esteem. It is faced with the danger of losing the preferences of another party. It has introduced this legislation in an attempt to appease another political group, as I endeavoured to explain last evening. My contention is that its action has achieved quite the opposite result. The Government desires to make political gain rather than any contribution to harmonious industrial relationships. </para>
          <para>In the few minutes left to me in which to speak I wish to refer to certain provisions of this Bill. I refer firstly to proposed new section 25. In the event of a dispute occurring, or in the event of a possibility of a dispute, the matter is to be referred to a presidential member who is to decide whether the matter will be considered by a conference of the parties or whether it will go straight to arbitration. The parties involved may never reach the stage of conciliation because this depends on the whim of the presidential member. Proposed new section 25 will give the right for the matter to be submitted straight to arbitration. If the parties to a dispute confer and cannot agree, there will be power, under proposed new section 30, for the unresolved claims to be referred to arbitration but the section provides that anything said during the course of the conference cannot be mentioned before the arbitrator. While one can see some reason perhaps why it should not be used against a party on a privileged occasion when it goes to arbitration, it is contrary to the section 34 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act for everything which went on at the conference to be revealed to the arbitrator so that he would know the action of the parties to the conference. For example, a union may have been striving strenuously to obtain a settlement to the dispute, and its action in seeking a settlement should be something to be considered by the arbitrator but he is deprived of that knowledge at the time of the meeting of the parties to consider it. </para>
          <para>Of course, when agreement is reached and the agreement is signed by the Commissioner an appeal can be lodged against the agreement under the new clauses by persons either bound or not bound by the settlement. Someone with whom the settlement has nothing to do can appeal. Proposed new section 35 provides the right of appeal against a settlement that was reached in the dispute. Surely this must represent a desire to continue a dispute. The authority hearing the appeal has the right, under the terms of proposed section 35 to suspend the operation of the settlement terms until such time as the appeal is heard. An interfering person, not bound by the settlement terms, can prolong a dispute for no other reason than that he does not want a settlement of that dispute. That is contrary to the provisions of the previous legislation which did everything possible in the public interest to settle a dispute. So many of the clauses of this proposed new legislation are designed for the purpose of prolonging disputes. </para>
          <para>I turn now to what is possibly the most important requirement. Previously, disputes were settled between the parties, if possible, with the commissioner taking into consideration the public interest. We now have a new clause which states that in considering the public interest the question of the national economy must be considered by the commissioner who is presiding over a dispute before agreement rs reached. It is proposed to amend section 39 of the parent Act by adding a new sub-section. Section 39 provides: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In relation to an industrial dispute, wilh which the Commission is dealing, the Commission shall, in such manner as it thinks fit, carefully and expeditiously, hear and inquire into and investigate the dispute and all matters affecting the merits of the dispute and the right settlement of the dispute. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Those were the instructions to the Commission as contained in section 39. The Commissioner had to obtain the right settlement of the dispute. His concentration at all times had to be on that. As I have said, in the public interest disputes had to be settled. It is now proposed to add the following new sub-section (2.): </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In proceedings before the Commission under section thirty-one, section thirty-four or section thirty-five of this Act, the Commission, shall, in considering the public interest, have regard, in particular, to the state of the national economy and the likely effects on that economy of any award that might be made in the proceedings. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Therefore, there could well be a conflict between the public interest and the national economy because the public interest may demand an early settlement of the dispute - say, a bus dispute or a rail dispute - but under the amended Act, it cannot be settled except after a thorough investigation into the state of the national economy. Would the settlement of such a dispute have repercussions on another section of the community? Would there be any dangers of inflation? Those are the questions which would have to be asked. Whereas previously a commissioner under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, had the responsibility to settle and prevent industrial disputes, he is now cloaked with the responsibility of government to control the national economy. </para>
          <para>Who can say whether any decision will affect the national economy? If it does, that is the Government&#39;s responsibility. If, because of some agreement, increased wages are granted and this causes increased prices of commodities, the Government can overcome the effects of any such increase granted by arbitration by means of its taxation powers. For instance, the Government can decide that those in the $4,000 to $5,000 wage bracket- those who would be covered by the particular award which the settlement granted - should be taxed an additional amount, thereby nullifying what was done by the commissioner. But the responsibility for an undesirable action would be thrown on the Government and the Government is not prepared to accept its responsibility; and this is its responsibility. The Government throws the responsibility, and the consequent antagonism of the work force, upon the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission or the employer who is not permitted to pay what his industry is prepared to pay because the Commission has to take over the responsibility of government and look after the national economy. </para>
          <para>No-one can say that higher wages affect the national economy. I remember the concern expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lillico</inline> last night about our competing on export markets with the burden of the wages paid in Australia. The greatest exporter of manufactured goods in the world is the United States of America which has the highest wage rates in the world. Japan, which was not a big exporter of manufactured goods prior to World War II, when it had low wage rates has leaped to the forefront of countries which export manufactured commodities even though its wage rates have risen by over 300 per cent. It is not the low wage countries with which we are competing. Our competition is against countries paying wages as high as or higher than those being paid in Australia. The Western world, which is paying wages equivalent to those being paid in Australia, is the exporter on the world&#39;s markets. Australia&#39;s difficulties in regard to exporting are caused by the high transport costs inherent in a big country like Australia situated, as it is, away from the rest of the world. Instead of the Government rectifying this matter by subsidising transport, it is taxing transport at the present time. That is where the economy needs help. The Government takes the attitude that to overcome its bad management in taxing transport and so making exports impossible, it must lower the conditions of the Australian work force so that we oan compete. Its attitude is that the worker must pay at all times. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Rattigan, Chairman</inline> of the Tariff Board, said in a public statement in Canberra that the chief cause of rising prices in Australia last year was the unused tariff protection given by the Tariff Board. In a Sydney newspaper yesterday <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sharp</inline> of Blue Metal and Gravel Pty Ltd was reported as saying that continued immigration would add to the inflationary trends in Australia. Can the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission take these things into consideration? Should it have to take them into consideration? Because of the Government&#39;s inability or refusal to do something about the economy of Australia, the Government has placed on someone else the responsibility of making the workers pay. Under this new legislation, whre there is a conflict of public interest and the economy of the country, the public has to suffer. As I explained last night, supported by the statistics of the Commonwealth Taxation Office, the public will continue to suffer because strikes will continue while there is inequality in the distribution of wealth. </para>
          <para>There is also the question of balance on bans and limitations. If there is a dispute, how long will it take to conduct a court controlled ballot? If the ballot favours strike action, does that make the strike legal? In the Bill is there any attempt by the Government to give the workers the right to say, by ballot, that they are prepared to support strike action? Does a court controlled ballot in favour of strike action make such action legal? We know that under the clauses of the Bill such action is not made legal. The Government hopes that there will be an expression by the workers that they do not favour the strike, knowing that the result of the ballot will have no effect on the settlement of the dispute. As an act of bravado, workers would at all times vote for a continuation of the dispute, if the vote is by secret ballot. That may not be the case if the results of the ballot or the terms of settlement are made known. But if the ballot is conducted for no purpose other than to test the feelings of the workers concerned, on all occasions workers will vote for strike action. This has no result on the eventual settlement. </para>

            <para>- This Bill is one of the important pieces of legislation that Parliament is called upon to discuss. In the matter of conciliation and arbitration, Australia has passed through various stages in a rather short period of history. At one time we probably were far in advance of the rest of the world in relation to the concept of conciliation and arbitration. I think that to some extent we are rather lagging in that regard today. To understand the Bill one has to go back over the history, since the Industrial Revolution, of the need for legislation to control industrial affairs. In the social history of mankind it is not so very long ago that there were no legal rights in terms of employment and no legal rights to organise as a trade union. All these things were subject to chance. One has only to read of the conditions that existed in Great Britain 80 to 100 years a&#163;0 to realise the dreadful conditions that were a manifestation of all that was low in conditions that developed out of the Industrial Revolution. In the coal mines of England there were employed pregnant women, children of  6  years of age and younger. Children who were just out of the babes-in-arms stage were given small tasks in the spinning mills of England of that day. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It is very interesting to go back  100  or  120  years only and read in the Hansards of Great Britain the speeches that were made by members of the legislature of that country when propositions were before the Parliament to relieve the dreadful industrial conditions that had developed out of the first attempts at modern-type industrial produtcion, with no recourse to the legality of controlling wages and conditions in the industrial enterprises. The early legislation was sponsored by reformers. Some had a religious background. Many who had a religious background opposed the reforms because of the poverty that would result in the families in which children of  6  and  7  years of age were holding down jobs for  10  hours a day  6  days a week. These reformers were sufficiently religious to demand that the children be allowed off on Sundays so that they could devote that day to religious devotions. They saw the awful tragedy of poverty that would be aggravated in the families if these mites, these little children, were taken out of industry. I think that quite sincere men in their day and time, with only the knowledge that they had of that period to guide them, made very sincere speeches along those lines. Today we would laugh at the possibility of similar events occurring again and we would cry over the cruelty to these children who were just out of the babesinarms stage whose lives were twisted and sacrified in the interests of manufacturing goods that were leading to the greater prosperity of the people. </para>
          <para>So we progressed from that stage, and Australia was part of the progression because in the early days of settlement of this country some of the people who were sent here from England as criminals were people who had been audacious enough to try to form industrial organisations to protect themselves and their families from the circumstances that can so obviously emanate from a completely undisciplined and uncontrolled community with no laws to guide it in relation to manufacturing and other industries, whether they be coal mines, boot factories, spinning mills or the more modern versions that we have today. Australia&#39;s industrial history probably began with the people who were refugees from the type of oppression that developed against those who dared to organise for as industrial voice and to formulate unions. People like those who were referred to as the Tolpuddle martyrs were sent to this country as criminals because of their audacious activities in trying to form a kind of industrial protection. As trade unions exist today, we would not think that the type of organisation that they were trying to construct was of a particularly militant character. It would probably be criticised today for being an extreme right wing organisation. </para>
          <para>In this country we moved very quickly through the stages of recognition of trade unions to the stage at which the unions were the main campaigners and the main architects of an industrial conciliation and arbitration system. I recognise, as earlier unionists did, their absolute right to organise as a trade union - that right was challenged in this country, too - and to have a legal award, a wage that was theirs by right of legality in the community. They were joined by many in the employer class. Because of the open slather - if I could use the vernacular - in industrial relations, it was easy to illustrate to many employers that ultimately the intense competition to obtain more production while paying less wages to employees reduced their industrial enterprises to a stale of profitability in which the margin very often was not sufficient for them to survive in a highly competitive type community. Certain persons were forced, perhaps by the circumstances of the industry, to pay a higher wage than other persons who could get cheap labour because they had access to female labour in large quantities and so could pay less. This situation applied particularly in the early clothing trade industries in this country. Employers began to realise that this type of competition ultimately reduced their possibilities of success. While there was resistance from employer classes to the setting up of a legal background for the payment of wages and the provision of conditions of labour that was beyond question, the resistance was not total. </para>
          <para>From this situation there was established a system of conciliation and arbitration which, at the point of time of its introduction and for many years after, was probably superior to that which existed in any part of the world. Australia can be said to have led the world in numerical strength of trade unionists per capita and in the arbitration and conciliation structure that it had created. As industry changed as it inevitably will, and as politics throughout the world began to develop along different lines, these things that had been established by labour, by sensible employers and by good governments came under challenge. They came under challenge not necessarily from the employer class because the employer class settled down with arbitration and found that it was not a bad thing for everyone else in their competitive industry to be paying what they paid. If they had conceded specific hours and conditions to the workers in their plants they knew that those hours and conditions also were being conceded in other plants that were competing for existing markets. Therefore, to be profitable they had to resort to increasing efficiency, to regularising production and to embarking upon a programme of development. Employers found that this was much better than endeavouring to find profitability in the exploitation of labour because in the final analysis those who were their labour were also their market. The impoverishment of their labour force to improve their profits was one thing but the impoverishment of their labour force and ultimately their market could very readily create a situation in which the impoverishment was so great that there would be no market for their goods. </para>
          <para>Employers in general settled down with a system of conciliation and arbitration which they considered to be a wise way in which to regulate the tremendous improvement in the standards which were available to everybody and which could emanate from the industrial circumstances of the day, whose beginning has been described as the industrial revolution. It was found in the beginning that challenges to the arbitration system came more from employers than from employees. If we cast our minds back - and I have always been interested in politics - we note that one challenge which was levelled at the arbitration set-up of this country, which was so valued by the workers of the day resulted in the defeat of a Prime Minister of this country. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Bruce was defeated by the then Secretary of the Melbourne Trades Hall Council, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Holloway.</inline> This defeat took place in a blue ribbon electorate, portion of which is represented by the present Minister for Labour and National Service, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Phillip</inline> Lynch. </para>

              <para>-  I am sorry, it was Stanley Bruce. I mixed him up with a Scot of another day. I presume that honourable senators will forgive me for that slip of the tongue. To continue the history of the trade union movement, we began to find that challenges to arbitration and conciliation started to come from another organised force in the community. This was a political force; it was the growing political force of communism throughout the community. That force saw in the stability of conciliation and arbitration which provided legally regularised wages and conditions a reasonable set-up that could not be exploited. In contrast, in some other countries which did not enjoy the system that had been developed in Australia it was an easy matter for communist organisations to batten on the poverty and the disorganised life of the communities that were living without these advantages. The conciliation and arbitration system constituted one of the principal barriers to the success of communism in Australia. </para>

              <para>-  There were many strikes before the advent of the Communist Party. There were many big strikes to establish the arbitration system. There were strikes during the currency of the arbitration system itself before strikes were organised by the communists. There will always be strikes. We can have a strike for an industrial reason or because of an industrial injustice which can even apply under the best regulated systems of arbitration. But it is a different matter when there is a politically inspired and organised strike which is called for no other purpose than to destroy the system which has been created to regularise industry, wages and conditions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> suggested that big strikes took place before communist activity and therefore the communists could not be blamed. </para>

I was an extreme right winger, whatever that may mean, but I remember when employers considered me to be an extreme left winger although I do not think anyone has had the temerity to suggest that I was at any time pro-communist in any way. I want to turn back to a particular period in our industrial history when the first revelations were being made which produced the evidence that the Communist Party, as an organised political force not only in this country but throughout the world, was dedicated to a programme which had as one of its ambitions in this country the destruction of the conciliation and arbitration system that had been developed here. </para>

          <para>I want to refresh the minds of honourable senators on the legislation that was brought down in this country, not by a boss&#39;s government or a conservative government, but by a Labour government. I refer to the time when the last Labor Government under the leadership of the late Ben Chifley was in office. I wish to refer to a quotation from a speech made in this place by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mckenna,</inline> who was at that time the leader of the Australian Labor Party in this chamber. The speech to which I refer was made during the debate on the National Emergency (Coal Strike) Bill that was brought down on 29th June 1949. Even that date is significant because this legislation was in answer to a strike which was called in the coal mining industry of this country by a resolution carried, I think, on 16th June to be put into effect on 27th June. After the strike had been current for only 2 days a Labor Government found it necessary to introduce legislation into this place to protect not only the people of the nation but the arbitration system of this country. After 2 days of a strike the Labor Government had sufficient evidence to justify producing before this Parliament legislation to slop the destruction of the arbitration system of this country by the Communist Party, as Labor men of the day labelled it. and to save the people from the repercussions that could develop from that strike. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mckenna</inline> in presenting the measure before this chamber said: </para>

            <para>The measure which is now before the Senate has been introduced because of the attitude and actions of the unions concerned, which I can only describe as wholly unjustified, entirely unprecedented, and calculated to strike a most serious blow at the entire economy of this country. The circumstances in which the strike was occurred must be viewed against the background of a statement made by the leader of the Miners&#39; Federation a month ago. I have with me a newspaper report of that statement, which, incidentally, has never been contradicted, so far as I am  aware,  by the individual who made it. That statement was as follows:- </para>

Slavish adherence to Arbitration Courts would lead to a serious weakening of unions, since they would depend upon the decisions of judges instead of their own organ.sations.&#39; </para>

              <para>- I am quoting from 1949. I propose to quote further from the speech made when legislation was brought down in that instance because I think it has a very deep relationship to the Bill now before the Senate. Many of the things contained in this piece of legislation were also found necessary under the circumstances of emergency applying at that time. I refer specifically to a matter which I understand received some prominence in the debate in the other place and that is that a registered organisation is required to reveal the circumstances of its banking. This is said to be an unwarranted intrusion into the privacy of the organisation. I do not know that that is a very valid argument. Any organised business has the name of its bank on any cheque which it issues. In most cases a trade union shows the bank with which it banks on any cheque it issues. </para>

          <para>Lel us remember that any union can avoid disclosing these facts. If it has no desire to use the advantages which flow from arbitration and conciliation, it need not register with the Court at all. It can become an organisation outside the ambit of the system of conciliation and arbitration. There is no real compulsion, is there? The Bill only states that if an organisation wants the advantages, it must make certain disclosures to show that it accepts the responsibilities that go with the advantages. I shall quote what was said by an expert who will be acceptable to honourable senators opposite, particularly <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh,</inline> because the expert, on this occasion, is none other than the late Rt  Hon.  H. V. Evatt who introduced the legislation at that time in the other place. He stresses the importance of clause 10. I quote from page 1676 of the 1949 Hansard as follows:   . . the importance of clause 10 which vests in the Registrar of the Arbitration Court, or a person authorised by him, power to inspect any books, documents or other papers of an organisation or branch of an organisation for the purpose of ascertaining whether there has been a breach of any of the provisions of the legislation. For the purpose of such inspection, the Registrar is authorised to enter premises of the organisation if he believes such books, documents or papers to be there. He is also given authority to require a person - that means any person - to produce or deliver to him, in accordance with his requirement, any such books, documents or papers in the possession or under the control of that person. That is all for the purpose of determining and ascertaining whether, in his opinion, there has been a breach of the provisions of the measure. </para>
          <para class="block">The Registrar&#39;s opinion that there has been a breach will not decide the legal responsibility, but these provisions can place the authorities in possession of the necessary evidence. Penalties are provided for a refusal to comply with the requirements of the Registrar. </para>

              <para>- I am leaving it to the ALP to say for itself. I believe that in the course of this legislation it can clearly be shown that many of the attitudes adopted today by the Labor Party are the attitudes that have been adopted by the Communist Party for 20-odd years of our industrial history in its attempts to destroy conciliation and arbitration. This is one of the barriers which exists to the complete takeover of industrial organisations which the Communist Party feels it can accomplish in our industrial movement. The Democratic Labor Party does not suggest that the legislation which is before the Senate is the type of legislation that it would produce. We are not the Government. We believe that there is ample evidence to show that the Conciliation and Arbitration Act at this time requires overhaul and that it should be more or less restructured to suit modern circumstances and to meet the attacks of those seeking to destroy the system. The Government has produced what it believes is a measure that will be effective. Time itself will prove whether it will be. Indeed, we have some reservations as to whether this Bill will be sufficient. We believe that a system of conciliation and arbitration will work only if those within the ambit of the system attempt to make it work. Regulations which are written into enactments will not make conciliation and arbitration effective if those involved set out deliberately to see that it does not work. This legislation by its very nature will attract success only if both sides set out to make it work and enter into the spirit of the Act. We are not sure whether the amendment before us at the present time will do that. In some respects we have reservations. </para>

          <para>However, we recognise that there have been enormous changes in the industrial structure. There have been changes in the work force. The modern computer age is switching labour from what was once broadly described as the blue collar workers to the white collar workers. In industry today white collar workers exceed blue collar workers for the first time in the history of man. This must of necessity make a great deal of difference to the structure of our arbitration system. Today 40 per cent of our total work force are women. That too is a new factor that has to be given consideration. There are those who say that direct bargaining is preferable to arbitration from the unions&#39; point of view. The communists in particular are seeking to destroy the system of conciliation and arbitration. They make very much of the success which can be attained by a method of direct bargaining by unions. They never mention that in the 1930s the unions&#39; power of direct bargaining was practically non-existent because of the economic circumstances of the day. </para>
          <para>Presuming that we always have conditions as we have at the moment perhaps, from a union point of view, direct bargaining could or could not be successful. But while criticising the idea that direct bargaining in its entirety must of necessity play a part in conciliation and arbitration, can it take over from a circumstance of conciliation and arbitration? 1 am reminded of the attitude expressed on 2 occasions by the Leader of the Australian Labor Party in the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy.</inline> He was almost enraged. Certainly here one night he raised, with great indignation, the question of the demands which were being made by the Australian Air Pilots Association. Under modern circumstances, in an industry structured as the airline industry is, with enormous capital outlay, there is tremendous power in the hands of a few to obtain a lot by direct bargaining. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> was tremendously incensed that the Association should have the audacity even to place the claims before the employers. He drew attention to the fact that the success of those claims materially defeated the ambitions of those in the less glamorous jobs in the airways industry of receiving industrial justice. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> in his contribution to this debate will not tell us that direct bargaining is the answer to all the questions of trade unionism as the Communist Party does and as 1 have heard members of the Labor Party in this chamber repeat almost as a slogan. </para>
          <para>The other occasion was only the other night when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> again expressed tremendous indignation that the medical profession of this country had had the effrontery to use its direct bargaining power to suggest that it was entitled to an increase in fees. He failed to produce a logical argument. He did not explain to the Senate how other professions, whose members have a similar educational background to that of medical practitioners, would have acted. Perhaps I could instance <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy&#39;s</inline> own profession. What would lawyers get by way of direct bargaining if they were called upon to visit a client for an hour in the middle of the night to give legal advice? With some knowledge of legal fees, though 1 have been involved only seldom in legal matters, and as a former trade union official, 1 do not think that a Queen&#39;s Counsel- </para>

            <para>- We are all indebted to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Little</inline> for his interesting and valuable survey of industrial history, particularly for having pointed out the activities of the Communist Party in endeavouring to infiltrate and use the arbitration system for its own ends with the object of destroying it. I was pleased that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Little</inline> supported this measure. I think all honourable senators will agree that it is a most important Bill, both because of the question with which it deals and because of its substance. Every honourable senator Who has spoken in this debate has emphasised this factor, as well as the benefits and values of the arbitration system. In particular, honourable senators have stressed the importance of conciliation and mediation as a fundamental aspect of the system; indeed, the real cornerstone of it. I am surprised, in the light of the emphasis that has been given to the conciliation aspects of our arbitration system, that members of the Labor Party, both in the other House and in this chamber, have opposed the Bill. They are opposing not merely certain clauses of it. 1 can understand that they might, have objections to some clauses and might be expected to debate them fully in committee, but that is not the attitude they have taken. Both in another place and in this chamber, they have opposed the Bill lock, stock and barrel. This is a strange approach, for many of the provisions of the Bill are designed to improve the conciliation aspect of the arbitration system. </para>

          <para>In the short time available to me today  1  would like to examine some of the aspects of the Bill which seem to have been overlooked in the debate in another place, the report of which I have read, and so far in the debate here. One of the main objects of the Bill is, as I have said, to improve the conciliation provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The Bill will do that by separating the conciliation and arbitration functions of the old Commission. Instead of the present structure whereby a dispute that is reported is dealt with immediately by a conciliation commissioner in an attempt to reach a conciliated agreement, and if this is not possible the matter proceeds to arbitration before the same commissioner, one of the first objects of the Bill is to restructure the Commission so that the conciliation process is divorced from the arbitration process. </para>

              <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> has not given any reasons for that statement, though he had plenty of time to do so. It seems to me to make good sense that when a dispute is reported to the Commission, attempts to conciliate, to reach agreement, will be divorced from the arbitration process which is more akin to litigation. The whole process of litigation is very different from what occurs in the conciliation process. It is also important for the success of conciliation that evidence and arguments adduced before the persons concerned in attempts to achieve agreement, and doing so as mediators, should not be used before an arbitrator. One of the first objects of the Bill is to improve the conciliation process in this way and to endeavour to facilitate the reaching of agreement between the parties. The Government hopes and I sincerely hope that the effect will be not only to emphasise the importance of conciliation but also to achieve a greater degree of agreement between the parties, which will then be registered in the form of awards within the system itself. We will then have the best of both worlds - agreement between the parties and the benefits of the Act. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>In addition to the provisions for separation of the conciliation side of the Commission&#39;s work from the arbitral side, the Bill will make considerable changes in the composition of the Commission. Here again, these changes are designed partly to improve the quality of the work of conciliation. The presidential members of the Commission will head what are to be known as task forces within industry, which will consist of arbitration commissioners and conciliation commissioners in separate panels assigned to different industries. It is hoped - I believe with justification - that this process will bring the presidential members of the Commission closer to the day-to-day work of the Commission in its conciliation and mediation process. </para>
          <para>As I have pointed out, the measure undoubtedly encourages the conciliation process and the formation of settlements by agreement between the parties and the registration of those agreements with the Commission as awards. One clause in this measure which has attracted a good deal of attention is the one which provides that a conciliation commissioner shall not register such an agreement if he believes that it is against the public interest. The determination of that question is left to the discretion of the commissioner. If he refused to register an agreement, the parties to it could appeal against his decision. But if in the exercise of that discretion he registers an agreement - I would think that it would be a very rare case indeed in which he would not register an agreement - that is the end of the matter. This was a proposal by the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> when he introduced his statement in December last year that the Commonwealth Government could intervene and could appeal against the registration of an agreement. Because of its policy of encouraging the parties to reach agreements by the conciliation process the Government, very wisely I think, has abandoned any such proposal. It would be quite inimical to the whole concept of encouraging agreement between the parties if a third party such as  a  government could upset by appeal such  a  conciliated agreement. </para>
          <para>One of the first and foremost objects of this Bill is to improve the whole process of conciliation. This has always been the policy of this Government. 1 think that it was a couple of years ago that very detailed procedures were agreed on by the Government, the employers and the Australian Council of Trade Unions to deal with industrial disputes. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> said that he fully supported those procedures and, indeed, that the Labor Party has done so. They are procedures which, if they are observed, will prove to be most valuable. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Little</inline> has said, this Act and indeed the whole concept of industrial relations cannot work unless a will exists amongst the parties to make them work. These new procedures do endeavour to strike at the problem right at the factory floor level when a problem first raises its head. </para>
          <para>The Bill itself does endeavour to encourage the use of these procedures or similar procedures. It encourages the incorporation of those procedures in agreed awards or arbitrated awards for the purpose of dealing with disputes as they may arise from time to time in the application of such awards. There again is further clear evidence of the object of this Bill to promote the conciliation process in this sensitive and important sphere of industrial relations. </para>
          <para>The Government quite rightly has pointed out the fact - this is an area where, I think, the Labor Party is most opposed to the provisions of this Bill - that the question of industrial relations does not concern only 2 parties, namely the employer and the employee as represented by his or her trade union. The public interest is involved. That public interest in recent years certainly has been recognised by the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The specific provision that I have already mentioned that an agreement which is presented for registration can be refused registration if it is against the public interest has been embodied in the Act for some time; it is not a new provision introduced by this Bill. I am thankful for and fully support the action taken by the Government in intervening in many of the more important cases before the Commission in order to present evi dence and argument to that body concerning the public interest. One of the provisions of this Bill will enshrine in the Act in legal terms the necessity for the Commission - not in every case but only in the major cases which come before it from time to time, such as those dealing with standard hours of work, the national wage and so on - to have regard for the effects on the national economy of decisions which the Commission takes. </para>

I have no doubt that we will have plenty of time to debate further the effects of that provision.

          <para>One other important aspect of public interest in this whole process is the enforcement of the decisions which are ultimately arrived at by the whole process of conciliation and arbitration. We have heard from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Little</inline> an interesting survey of industrial history. 1 think it is clear not only from what he said but also from any study of the history of industrial relations that we have in the Australian arbitration system an enormously valuable institution of which this country can be most proud as a pioneer in this field, and one which is being followed in some other countries which in the past have relied on collective bargaining. 1 instance in particular the United Kingdom which, in the last 12 months, has introduced not a similar system but a system by which an endeavour has been made to embody some definite arbitration process and some sanctions for the enforcement of arbitrated decisions or decisions which may be reached by agreement between parties. Indeed, in the United States of America which is often held up as a great example of collective bargaining and the values of that system, agreements which are reached between the parties are enforceable by claims for damages in the ordinary courts of the land. Under that system those who breach agreements are visited with far greater penalties, by way of damages, than they would be under the sanctions provisions of this legislation. The Government has said and, I feel, with absolute propriety, that in the last resort any system of arbitration, as we have here, in which any attempt is made to regularise industrial relations for the good of the parties and for the benefit of the community must have some sanctions ultimately. </para>
          <para>We have heard a great deal of criticism of the sanctions provided in the Bill and we know now that after some considerable doubt and dispute within the Australian Labor Party that the Opposition would repeal all sanctions provisions if it were in office. The reasons advanced for such action seem very odd to me. In fact they seem to be nothing more than pious hopes which are invalidated almost every day by our experiences in the industrial sphere.

The Opposition believes that the unions would honour agreements to the letter if the sanctions were removed. Yet in recent weeks we have seen the printing strike which has been affecting almost every daily newspaper in Australia. The printers are under an agreement which does not expire until 1st January next year and they are taking their industrial action at the moment in defiance of such an agreement. That is a very good example of the pious hones of having a system of arbi tration with all its great benefits for the employees as well as for the community and employers operating without some system of ultimate sanctions on those who want to breach awards which are arrived at by the processes of conciliation in the first place. If every effort to reach an agreement fails, then a determination is made by arbitration when everybody has the fullest opportunity of stating his case for and against and then, if the parties are still dissatisfied, the decision can be appealed against. Surely to goodness after that process has been gone through and attempts have been made to be fair to all sides, if anyone or any side is not prepared to abide by decisions or agreements which are arrived at in that way, I am sure that any fair-minded person could only conclude that some penalty must be visited for breaches of agreements or awards arrived at under that eminently fair method. </para>

          <para>There is one other matter which the Opposition has raised in this debate and it was emphasised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> when he spoke in this chamber last night. It is said that this legislation is part and parcel of the Government&#39;s attempt to attack inflation by loading all the responsibility and blame for it on to the wage earner. Here again nothing could be further from the truth. This legislation is rightly concerned to ensure that wages will increase reasonably and not against the community interest. There is always this community interest which must be observed in the fixation of wages. But this legislation is only part of a very broad plan of attack which this Government has been making against inflation. Apart from the Bill which we are debating today we have had 2 other measures introduced in the Senate today which are part and parcel of that broad attack upon inflation which is made in the interests of the community generally and everybody in it. The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Greenwood)</inline> has put down this afternoon a statement in which he indicated the big changes which are to be made in the trade practices legislation. The changes will be enshrined in the legislation and passed in this chamber in the near future. </para>
          <para>Perhaps it is a pity that this session will not last long enough for Parliament to put on the statute book those changes at the same time as the changes to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The prevention of restrictive practices by industry is an important attack on inflation by the Government. This attempt to improve competition is one of the most important ways of containing inflation. We had a Bill introduced in this chamber this afternoon seeking to improve the operations of the Tariff Board in its efforts to accelerate the tariff review. Of course, this whole review of tariffs, particularly the elimination of unused tariffs, will be another important aspect of the Government&#39;s attack on inflation. This Bill is an important part of the Government&#39;s policy. But it is quite wrong to present it in the way that the Opposition has attempted to present it as the only move which the Government proposes to make to attack inflation. </para>
          <para>Before I conclude I want to make one reference to an omission from this legislation about which I am disappointed. When the Minister for Labour and National Service made his statement in the House of Representatives last December in which he foreshadowed this legislation he said that the Government was very concerned with the efforts of some trade unions to bring about compulsory trade unionism in this country. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Government and,  i  believe, the community are opposed to compulsory unionism.  1 wholeheartedly agree and the Liberal Party agrees with the concern expressed then an efforts by some trade unions to introduce compulsory trade unionism. The Minister foreshadowed thatth is legislation would contain some ways and means of preventing the spread of compulsory unionism by certain activities of some trade unions. As 1 have said, it is a matter of some regret to me that some of the proposals that the Minister foreshadowed have not been incorporated in this legislation. 1 have noted that the Attorney-General has said that there are some practical difficulties involved and that disadvantages could result. I accept that. But before concluding my remarks I express my disappointment that these difficulties have not been overcome. There may well be some constitutional difficulties involved in incorporating in legislation some of the proposals that the Minister foreshadowed. 1 agree that there would be practical difficulties involved. However, I think that the Attorney-General, perhaps in replying to the second reading debate, might amplify - at least for my benefit and, I am sure, for that of many other senators on this side of the chamber - what were the practical problems and disadvantages which the Government found in endeavouring : to incorporate these suggestions in legislation. </para>

In this report the Government responds to a number of recommendations made by the Senate Select Committees on Air Pollution and Water Pollution and for that reason it may be thought that the statement should be read to the Senate. I appreciate that it has been read in the other place and the fact that the time available in the remainder of this session is such that we want as much as possible for the passage of Bills. It may be that the Senate will agree to the statement being incorporated in Hansard. If any honourable senator objects and desires it to be read, the point may be taken. Objection by one honourable senator would mean that it would be read. 1 ask for leave for the statement to be incorporated in Hansard. </para>

          <quote>
          <para>In recent years there has been an increasing public awareness of the threat to our environment in Australia and the need to do something about it. My purpose, therefore, is to emphasise the Commonwealth Government&#39;s deep interest in the problems of the environment and our determination to do what we can, within our powers, to help solve those problems. </para>
          <para>In Australia today we live in an affluent, liberal society where we are seeking standards of excellence in all things. Basic to this is a healthy environment in which we can develop a quality of life to satisfy our needs in all fields of human endeavour. It is essential, therefore, that we preserve the great gifts nature has given us and that we keep our environment as free from man-made contamination as human skills can devise. It is  a  fact of recent history that while the technological revolution of the sixties and the seventies has brought great benefits in material good living,  in  national progress and in economic well-being - it has also had by-products which are despoiling our land and polluting the air and the water around us. </para>
          <para>As Galbraith has said: &#39;The greater the wealth the greater will be the dirt&#39;. </para>
        <para>THE CHALLENGE</para>
      <para>The challenge before us alt, as a people, is very real and I am gratified, that, in additionto the concern of Governments, there has developed  a  lively public conscience on this imporant subject. Fortunately action is already being taken on several fronts to deal with pollution, waste disposal and the preservation of our natural environment with its unique flora and fauna. In short the challenge to protect the environment has been accepted. But much remains to be done. What  I  wish to do now is to identify the responsibilities of Government as we see them and to give some details of what is being done by the Commonwealth at the national and international level to protect our environment. The problem cannot be dealt with in isolation from other matters nor can Governments alone achieve success. </para>
      <para>So far as the Commonwealth is concerned the question is one of devising a pattern of national development in which environmental objectives go hand in hand with economic, social and cultural goals. Our philosophy is directed to this end - to devising and developing such a pattern in cooperation with the States, with Local Government, with business and industry and the community as a whole. And therefore we have to consider the environment as a major factor in the planning and management of practically all forms of development from human settlements to engineering and industrial works. </para>
        <para>A NATIONAL PROBLEM</para>
      <para>At the outset  1  should point out, however, that the main responsibility for the environment over the greater part of the continent of Australia lies with the Slates. That is the constitutional position. Nevertheless, when there is a great problem of national pollution, the Commonwealth must coordinate and co-operate with the States. </para>
      <para>I would identify the Commonwealth as having a national responsibility - </para>
      <para>To give leadership in researching the problem. </para>
      <para>To co-operate with others. </para>
      <para>To act within its powers as necessary. </para>
      <para class="block">And to keep before the Australian people the dangers to their environment. </para>
      <para class="block">In various ways concern for the environment is national in character. There are, perhaps, three main reasons why this is so. The first is that pollution of the air, the rivers and the seas is not confined by State boundaries. The second is that various authorities, Government and otherwise, must act in harmony to avoid unhealthy interstate competition arising from different environmental standards. And the third is that national action may be needed to meet specific international situations. With these matters in mind,  I  turn now to what the Commonwealth is doing to discharge its responsibilities. </para>
        <para>ACTION SO FAR</para>
      <para class="block">Our first consideration - having regard to the major role of the States - was to establish a system for close and continuing co-operation with them and make arrangements for the coordination of our various activities where this could be mutually beneficial. </para>
      <para>I believe that we have made considerable progress. Both the Commonwealth and States have set up, or are setting up, administrative machinery to deal with environmental matters. All have a Minister with a specific responsibility for the environment. These Ministers are meeting together regularly for consultation as the Australian Environment Council. The Council has been constituted by agreement between the Commonwealth and the States and after this was ratified it held its first formal meeting in Sydney last month. The council is to draw up standards and guide-lines for its own use and it is hoped that these will have general recognition throughout the Commonwealth. The Council has already begun to study such important environmental problems as waste disposal and non-destructible, non-returnable, containers and packaging generally. The council has also noted the importance of decentralisation. </para>
      <para>Here the Commonwealth itself has been actively participating over several years in the CommonwealthState Officials Committee on Decentralisation. This is all a beginning. And I feel sure Australians will recognise and accept the Australian Enrivonment Council as an important mechanism between the Commonwealth and the States on many matters affecting the environment. I should add that the council will also co-operate with other joint Commonwealth-State Ministerial Councils whose activities and responsibilities bear, in one way or another, on the environment. </para>
      <para>I refer, in particular, to those councils responsible for health, water resources, shipping and transport, forestry, minerals, agriculture and fisheries. They have, for a long time, been active in specific areas of pollution and environmental control. </para>
        <para>IMPACT STATEMENTS</para>
      <para class="block">In this context 1 wish to announce that the Government has decided to introduce a system of impact statements&#39; designed to protect the environment. That is to say that when a Commonwealth Minister prepares a submission to the Cabinet on any proposal that has some relevance to the environment that submission must be accompanied by a statement setting out the impact the proposal is likely to make on the environment. This &#39;impact statement&#39; will, I am sine, become an important element in decision making. I might add that State projects for which Commonwealth financial assistance is sought will also need to be supported by assurances that all  environmental  factors have been considered and evaluated. </para>
        <para>ADVISORY COMMITTEE</para>
      <para class="block">The second announcement I wish to make concerns the membership of the special advisory committee which is to be set up to advise the Commonwealth Government in its consideration of environmental problems. </para>
      <para>This committee will consist of: </para>
      <para>Professor R. J. Walsh, Professor of Human Genetics, University of New South Wales, who will be Chairman. </para>
      <para>
        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr L.</inline>W. Weickhardt, Chancellor of the University of Melbourne. </para>
      <para>
        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr K.</inline>W. Shugg, immediate past  president  of The Royal Australian Institute of Architects. </para>
      <para>This committee will be free to suggest to me as the Minister for the Environment matters that it feels it could usefully examine. </para>
      <para>There are, of course, several research programmes already in progress in Commonwealth Departments and scientific agencies of the Government. They range over a wide spectrum and include such activities as water treatment, the abatement of smoke pollution, the problem of pesticides, the rehabilitation of areas damaged by man&#39;s activities and guide-lines for the preservation of our flora and fauna. </para>
      <para>Increasing importance is being attached to research in the medical and social sciences because of the emotional and medical factors that are inseparable from man&#39;s response to his environment. </para>
        <para>LAND USE</para>
      <para>Hand in hand with conservation, of course, goes land use. The Government has decided to set up a Land Use Advisory Council to advise it in circumstances where environmental considerations arise in the Commonwealth&#39;s jurisdiction which could arouse general concern. For example, when proposed industrial undertakings of national importance might appear to conflict with the preservation of such environmental assets as national parks in Commonwealth Territories the Government will be able to seek independent advice from this Council. Consequently, the Government will be able to refer to this council matters relating to any land under the Commonwealth&#39;s control within Australia. The members of the council and its charter will be announced in due course. </para>
        <para>WHO SHOULD PAY?</para>
      <para>In considering the general question of pollution, contamination and despoliation of the land the question inevitably arises&#39; - Who pays&#39;? It is not easy to make an exclusive identification of liability because environmental damage is the result of many things - of technological successes, of industrial activity and of social habit. A community responsibility has to be recognised. But I think it appropriate at this stage to say that the Government has aready decided that Australia should agree to the guiding principles so far developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, of which we recently became a member. This is only an agreement in principle at this stage because many matters still need to be settled between members of this international body. The guiding principles adopted by the OECD relate to the national and international aspects of environmental policies and their effect on economies and trade. </para>
      <para>In brief they embrace the principle that the polluter pays&#39; - that the costs of pollution control measures should be recognised as part of the total cost of production. They also provide for the principle of harmony - or similarity - of standards to avoid favouring one country - or State - against the other in terms of industrial and trade competition. I believe that the &#39;polluter pays&#39; principle is likely to be adopted by nearly all the developed countries which are our main competitors. This will lead to some increased costs and may lead to some increase in prices. But I venture to say. at this stage, that so far as the Australian public is concerned increased product costs should be outweighed by the reduced social costs which the community is already bearing. New enterprises will be able, more readily than existing ones, to adopt non-pollutiong techniques - for example at the plant design stage. It is encouraging to know that already several of our big industrial enterprises are already taking their own initiatives to reduce pollution and protect the environment. </para>
      <para class="block">SPECIAL ACTIVITIES </para>
      <para>May 1 now refer briefly to a number of other Commonwealth activities in environmental control with special reference to the pollution of the air, our water and our coastal seas. </para>
      <para>I summarise them in this way: </para>
      <para>First, the Department of Civil Aviation sought advice from a special committee of the Academy of Science in the effect on the upper atmosphere of supersonic aircraft, lt has relevance in view of the forthcoming visit of the supersonic Concord to Australia and the advent of the supersonic era. This report has now been circulated. </para>
      <para>Second, a national plan for combating oil spillage at sca is being prepared. The Government has offered to set up for the states stockpiles of materials and equipment around the coast to deal with oil spillage from tankers and other ships. It will contribute $1 million towards the cost and will legislate to apply a single levy to the merchant shipping industry to recoup those costs not recovered from shipowners responsible for identifiable spillages. </para>
      <para>Third, the National Health and Medical Research Council has been doing valuable work on detergents since 1968 and last year negotiated a voluntary agreement with the detergent industry which effectively controlled most domestic washing and cleaning compounds so that damage to the environment has been considerably reduced. It is continuing its investigations in other fields where detergents are used. </para>
      <para>Fourth, the Australian Transport Advisory Council - comprising Commonwealth and State Ministers - has taken action to control carbon mono-oxide emissions from motor vehicles. The measures it has adopted are similar to those established by the Economic Commission for Europe. This council has also endorsed draft regulations to prohibit the emission of crank case gases and to limit smoke from diesel engines. </para>
      <para>I am quoting these details because they are a reminder to everyone who drives on our roads today that action is being taken to cut down on exhaust fumes and keep the air cleaner. </para>
      <para>SELECT COMMITTEES </para>
      <para>I want now to refer to the reports of the Select Committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives on various environmental topics. </para>
      <para>These Parliamentary inquiries have been most useful in drawing public attention to some of our pollution problems in Australia. The Government has carefully examined the recommendations of the Senate Select Committees on Air and Water Pollution and I ask leave to incorporate in Hansard statements of the Government&#39;s observations on the recommendations made by those committees. </para>
      <para class="block">INTERNATIONAL ROLE </para>
      <para class="block">Now, in conclusion, may I mention our involvement in the international aspects of environmental control. The threat to man&#39;s environment is world-wide. It makes no distinctions. There is much to be gained therefore by Australia sharing its problems and the search for solutions with others. Wc do this primarily through the United Nations and more recently through the O.E.C.D. We take an active part in the work of the specialised agencies of the United Nations whose work has environmental overtones. The Commonwealth was an early adherent to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sca by Oil as far back as 19S4 and last year through the U.N. Agency in Maritime Affairs it secured provisions which will provide especially for the protection of the Great Barrier Reef, lt has also contributed to recent Conventions directed towards securing adequate compensation for damage by oil pollution. This participation in international discussion and consultation is a continuing process. </para>
      <para>We are prepared to use all the international machinery at our disposal to achieve the sort of co-operation required for global action and to protect our own interests in problems with environmental implications. Next month we will be represented at an important United Nations conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm. </para>
      <para>The Australian delegation has already been announced and  I  need not repeat the details. Sufficient to say it will be a significant conference. We were among the first to support the Swedish initiative for the conference and we have been closely involved in the preparations since 1968. And while Australia will have much to learn  I  am sure we will also have something worthwhile to contribute. The protection of the environment is a task that has no end. As the inventive genius of man produces new benefits for us all. so, too, will the problems of protecting the environment multiply. </para>
      <para>We cannot leave it all to Governments, lt is as much a challenge to the walker on a forest trail who drops litter as he goes as it is to the industrialist whose factories crowd the landscape. It is as much a challenge to the parent, the educator and the scientist as it is to the manager and the politician. It is a challenge the people of Australia have to take up as their own. </para>

      <para class="block">GOVERNMENT&#39;S OBSERVATIONS ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS BY THE SENATE </para>
      <para>SELECT COMMITTEE </para>
      <para class="block">Legislation within Commonwealth Territories (Recommendation1 ) </para>
      <para>That the Commonwealth should immediately enact legislation for the control of air pollution within its Territories&#39;. </para>
      <para class="block">The Select Committee made this recommendation not &#39;because there is an urgent need for such legislation but because the Committee feels that the Commonwealth should take an immediate and active interest in air pollution matters&#39;. The Committee also staled that the promulgation of Commonwealth legislation in this field could provide a model for future State action. </para>
      <para>The Commonwealth does take an active interest in air pollution matters. Research into various topics of reievance to air pollution problems is carried out or sponsored by Commonwealth Departments and authorities, viz. - </para>
      <para>Department of Air </para>
      <para>Australian Atomic Energy Commission </para>

      <para>Department of Supply </para>
      <para class="block">The Commonwealth is also actively involved in air pollution problems through the National Health and Medical Research Council, the Australian Transport Advisory Council and now through the Australian Environment Council. </para>
      <para>The global nature of man-made atmospheric pollution, first brought to light by the problems of airborne radioactive debris, led the Commonwealth to establish the National Radiation Advisory Committee in 1957. The Committee examines the effects of ionising radiation on the Australian community, including possible effects of fallout from nuclear weapons tests. The Committee&#39;s reports on the biological aspects of the fallout have been published. The NRAC assesses these effects after a study of the data supplied by the Commonwealth X-ray and Radium Laboratory and the Atomic Weapons Tests Safety Committee. More recently there is an increasing concern with the wide dispersion of some chemical pollutants in the atmosphere arising from industrial and aircraft operations, and the possible climatic and other changes these might engender. Some of the Commonwealth agencies referred to above are active in investigating these problems. Monitoring is a key part of this activity and forms one of the important topics to be discussed at the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment. </para>
      <para>So far as the Territories are concerned, the position remains much as the Committee found it in 1969, viz. no pressing air pollution problems have been revealed and the preparation of additional or comprehensive legislation is not of itself an urgent matter. However, in both Territories amendments have been made (as in the States) to the Motor Traffic Ordinance to provide additional controls over motor vehicle emissions. </para>
      <para>The Commonwealth and the States are jointly examining problems relating to air pollution in such Commonwealth/State councils as the National Health and Medical Research Council, the Australian Transport Advisory Council and the Australian Environment Council. It would appear more appropriate for such Councils to work towards uniform Commonwealth/State legislation if this proves practicable than for the Commonwealth to attempt to provide a theoretical model in the Territories where there are few, if any, specific problems at present requiring legislation. </para>
      <para class="block">Commonwealth/State Bureau of Air Pollution (Recommendations 2, 3 and 4) </para>

      <para>The Government believes that these arrangements provide an appropriate framework for Commonwealth/State co-operation. </para>
      <para class="block">Air Pollution Research by CSIRO (Recommendation  5) </para>
      <para class="block">That a Division of Air Pollution be established within the CSIRO to undertake basic research into air pollution problems of particular relevance to Australia: to examine overseas studies and practices for application to the Australian situation; and to undertake studies recommended by the Bureau of Air Pollution&#39;. </para>
      <para class="block">This matter has been examined by the Executive of CSIRO which is convinced that more would be gained by investigating different aspects of air pollution within the Organisation&#39;s general framework than by establishing an overall Air Pollution Division. </para>
      <para>With the object of unifying CSIRO research in the important area of environmental physics the Organisation has recently formed the Environmental Physics Research Laboratories comprising the Division of Atomospheric Physics and the Division of Environmental Mechanics. An example of a specific air pollution problem more appropriately tackled elsewhere in the Organisation is the removal of fly ash from power station emissions which is dealt with in the Division of Mineral Chemistry. In the course of these studies, appropriate consideration is given by CSIRO to the results of overseas research where these are relevant to the Australian situation. </para>
      <para>Aspects of air pollution research are also handled by a variety of other bodies, including the Commonwealth Departments and instrumentalities listed under the observations on Recommendation 1. </para>
          <para>Role of Bureau of Meteorology (Recommendation 6)</para>
        <para>That the Commonwealth Bureau of Meteorology be charged with the responsibility of establishing a national network of monitoring stationsfor the collection of meteorological data specifically for air pollution needs, the continuous measurement of air pollutants, and eventually of setting up a predictive service for the warning of potential air pollution hazards&#39;. </para>
        <para>The Bureau of Meteorology maintains a comprehensive data collection network which gathers information capable of some application to air pollution control. There is a continuing process of development of the network both as to the form of data collected and the extent of the general network. The monitoring of pollution is under examination by the Australian Environment Council and. in the world context, by the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment. The future role of the Bureau of Meteorology will emerge in the light of further developments in these areas. The Bureau is already providing a predictive service for the warning of potential air pollution hazards in Perth and Adelaide and the provision of a service in Sydney is under consideration. </para>
          <para>Motor Vehicle Emissions (Recommendation 7)</para>
        <para>That, in view of the special importance of emissions from motor vehicles in the overall air pollution problem, urgent consideration be given by the appropriate Commonwealth and State authorities to ways and means of bringing about the abatement and eventual control of those motor vehicle emissions which contribute to pollution of the air&#39;. </para>
        <para>The Australian Transport Advisory Council has a committee on Motor Vehicle Emissions continuously looking into this problem. The Council in February 1971 endorsed its recommendations on Design Rules to limit exhaust emissions. One of these rules has already been put into effect by the respective governments. It covers all passenger cars (including station wagons) manufactured after 1 January 1972. It specifies that the carbon monoxide content by volume of the exhaust gases emitted by motor vehicles with the engine idling must not exceed 4.5 per cent. </para>
        <para>The second Design Rule is to apply to passenger cars (including station wagons) manufactured after 1 January 1974 and provides for tests under both idling and traffic conditions, and it lays down maximum levels for both hydro-carbons and carbon monoxide. </para>
        <para>The Rules are regarded only as a first stage for petrol engined vehicles and work is continuing on the matter. Regarding diesel engined vehicles a draft regulation to control smoke emissions of diesel-powered vehicles has been endorsed by the Australian Transport Advisory Council (in February this year). This regulation provides for all &#39;on road diesel-powered vehicles not to emit exhaust smokes exceeding 70 Hartridge Units in opacity. </para>
        <para>The problem of determining what further action is necessary to limit motor vehicle emissions is made difficult by the inadequacy of data on effects. Not only is there a need for continuous monitoringin key areas of ambient air but it is apparent there is also a need to monitor actual emissions from motor vehicles in order to determine as closely as possible the pollution attributable to the motor vehicle. </para>
          <para>Financial Aspects (Recommendation 8)</para>
        <para>That the Commonwealth Government give consideration to the granting of financial relief to industry and others involved in expenditure on air pollution control equipment and its maintenance by means of tax and duty concessions, with particular reference to the extension of the taxation allowance and to accelerated depreciation allowances&#39;. </para>
        <para>While the income tax law makes no reference to expenditure on air pollution control equipment, the full cost to business enterprises in installing, operating and maintaining such equipment would, as a general rule, he allowable as deductions either by way of depreciation allowances or as business outgoings. The proposition that extraordinary financial relief should he provided at the taxpayers&#39; expense to those incurring these expenditures is difficult to reconcile with what has come to be known as the &#39;polluter pays principle&#39;. Briefly stated, this principle holds that the real cost of pollution should be borne by those producers and users of goods and services whose production or consumption brought about that pollution. </para>
        <para>That the taxation laws in respect to allowances for buildings and plant be reviewed, particularly in relation to the definition of chimneys.&#39; </para>
        <para>The general question of allowing income tax deductions in respect of the cost of buildings and other structures, including chimneys, used by manufacturers and other taxpayers, has been examined by the Government on a number of occasions. It has not so far been found practicble to introduce such allowances. </para>

Similarly, special mineral leases which it is proposed to grant in the uranium provinces will contain a wide and detailed range of controls over environmental matters. The Government will also introduce amendments to the prevention of pollution of waters by oil ordinance so as to increase maximum penalties imposed on polluters from $2,000 to $50,000. Action to identify and, if necessary, strengthen other areas to meet existing and foreseeable situations, will continue. </para>
        <para>The view of the Australian Water Resources Council is that maximum uniformity of principles and criteria in legislation seems desirable but some variations are considered inevitable having regard to the wide variation in conditions as between States. The general question of uniformity of legislation and standards is under examination by the Australian Environment Council. </para>
        <para class="block">Education (Recommendation7) </para>
        <para>The Commonwealth Government should, as  a  matter of urgency, examine the facilities available for the education of professional and technical persons in water pollution matters so that the provision of adequate facilities will not be unduly delayed. Pending the establishment of the National Water Commission, the Commonwealth should use such instrumentalities as are available for the collection and dissemination of technical data.&#39; </para>
        <para>The Commonwealth is providing substantial financial support for the education of professional and technical persons generally and is assisting the States to expand their technical training facilities. In general, this support is not given in a way that permits the Commonwealth to identify readily the training facilities and programmes that are now available in the various institutions and which are relevant to specific fields of interest, such as water pollution control. </para>
        <para>It is a matter for consideration as to whether educational institutions should seek to provide courses specifically in &#39;water pollution matters&#39;, or whether they should rely on general education in particular fields. The relevance of various training programmes and facilities now available in the various institutions will depend on how broadly the phrase &#39;water pollution matters&#39;, as used in Recommendation 7, is interpreted. This needs to be clarified to determine if any survey should be undertaken of facilities available for the education of professional and technical persons in water pollution matters. The Australian Universities Commission and the Australian Commission on Advanced Education and also the State authorities could then be invited to comment. </para>

        <para>The Commonwealth is already supporting research by qualified workers in fields bearing directly upon water pollution abatement and the controlled re-use of water through the activities of a number of Commonwealth Departments and instrumentalities, including the Department of the Interior, CSIRO, the Australian Atomic Energy Commission Research Establishment and the Department of National Development, through the provision of funds for the water research programme administered by the Australian Water Resources Council. </para>
        <para>Problems of water pollution must be viewed in the context of overall water use and management. It is therefore the Commonwealth commitment to water research overall that should be considered rather than its commitment to research in the narrower field of water pollution abatement. From this viewpoint, the Commonwealth contribution is clearly substantial, and, in addition, there is  a  considerable expenditure by the States on water research. </para>
        <para>CSIRO - whose expenditure on water research is far greater than that of any other organisation in Australia - is carrying out, inter alia, research into some problems that relate to the detection and movement of pollutants in water and to the treatment of industrial waste effluents and urban sewage with the object of controlled re-use of <inline font-style="italic">water.</inline></para>
        <para>Provision is made for overseas travel in cases where this is appropriate. </para>
        <para>A distinction should be made between research activities and the routine monitoring of pollutants and pollution levels.

          <para>- I join with other Opposition senators in opposing this Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. I might say, in passing, that with my Queensland colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges,</inline> 1 look forward to the debate on the motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson</inline> on the statement on the Australian environment. My predecessors from the Opposition side in this debate on this Bill have argued, quite rightly, that there has been a note of panic in relation to this legislation. The Government is ignoring the cause and seeking to deal with the effect. I think I can do no better than to fortify my argument, and that of the Opposition as a whole, by quoting the text of a statement made by the  President  of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Richard</inline> Kirby, in his report of 13th August 1971. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Richard</inline> Kirby said:  1 am well aware that most Australians accept as a fact that strikes and threats of strikes have been increasing over recent years but I doubt if this acceptance is well based if increased population and work force are taken into account. Nevertheless although there is cause for some concern in this regard it should be remembered that the important thing for Australia as a trading nation is how the rest of the world with which she is competing is behaving in similar fields. Most of our competitors have been plagued by strikes just as much if not more than we have. . . . </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">That virtually endorses the remarks that were made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> earlier today. I want to continue in a broader fashion. The second reading speech made by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Greenwood)</inline> makes comparisons with the amendments made to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act in 1947 and refers to the industrial climate in 1972. One of the problems is epitomised in the speeches made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lillico</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack.</inline> They seized on the trade union movement as a whipping boy and built their entire cases on that. 1 referred earlier to cause and effect. The point I am making is that such advances as containerisation, automation and computerisation are episodes in the industrial life of this country that are having series effects on the work force, whether it be the blue collar section or the white collar section. Honourable senators are entitled to argue about the effect that certain ideological ground swells have on disrupting the continuity of employment. The point is that when people feel that their future is a little uncertain it does not take great oratory from a trade union secretary to get them to agitate for a change. Some disputes are certainly more prolonged than others. No industrial dispute in Australia has lasted as long as the various longshoremen&#39;s stoppages in the United States of America. 1 refer to one such stoppage recently which involved Harry Bridges, who is well known to honourable senators on both sides of the chamber. This stoppage happened on the Pacific Coast of the United States. I do not condone the length of that dispute but it has become the usual practice for the Press to draw out of the air statements saying that mythical millions of dollars are involved, whatever the length of the stoppage. I remember what happened about 4 years ago at the time of the Mount lsa dispute. It was a lesson to everybody of what should not happen. Former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Branson</inline> asked whether the many millions mentioned were the true cost of that strike. Probably he was seeking a different answer from that which I was seeking. It is remarkable that the mining industry at Mount Isa was very buoyant again within 12 months. I deliberately inject that remark in order to get honourable senators back to a more temperate level. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lillico</inline>referred to the role of the trade union movement in West Germany and compared it with that in Australia. We have to consider secondary effects. The present West German Finance Minister, Herr Schiller, has been taking action about price justification. It is true that he has not had his way entirely but at least he has endeavoured to stabilise prices. The top echelon of the West German trade union movement negotiated to reach a national wage agreement but values did not erode after agreement was reached. If honourable senators asked me to crystallise my main objection to this legislation I simply say this: After a prolonged national wage inquiry and after judges have determined a percentage increase that can be met by industry - I am dealing solely with wage justice now - if there were a price freeze for 6 or 8 months we would not see the flow-throughs which occur when people realise that within 3 weeks the prices of basic commodities go up. The Government might say that it could be too all-embracing. I say that if the Government had created a prices justification commission and industry could prove that the cost of a vital component which was important to this country had increased, there might be justification. But the fact is that these piddling little things happen and prices increase. </para>
        <para>Let me give a classic illustration. There was much agitation in Sydney about the Theatrical Employees Union - a relatively small union - and its cinema operators and even the usherettes. John Gorton liked the show &#39;Gunsmoke&#39;. ! am a Clint Eastwood fan. 1 have seen his last 3 films in Sydney in a couple of hours that I could spare. I was amazed that cinema prices in Sydney had increased from  $1.50  to almost  $2,  or they use another lurk of charging  $1.75  throughout the whole cinema - one price cinema. I will not name the cinema and give it a free plug. This is the imbalance of the situation. The Government says that it is wrong for a union to seek something, but nobody places a stopper on Greater Union Theatres or their other competitors Hoyts for the way in which they seem to circumvent any concept of price stabilisation. This is one of the basic situations that no doubt the Government could discuss when it meets officers of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. The Government pays them the courtesy of meeting them at Budget time, but for the rest of the year various Ministers take the opportunity of engaging in what I call Hawke baiting. He cannot win. </para>
        <para>I turn again to this West Germany syndrome. If the Government accepts the other point and says that this is a good part of the West Germany trade union structure, it should look at the other aspect. The West German officials were in Australia talking about the trade union insurance concept. Let me refer to Bourkes ACTU store. It seems <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> rile a lot of Government senators. It could be called a case of people&#39;s capitalism or some other term could be applied to it. The fact is that certain people who are always watching the doings of the far Left and who read left wing publications would know that the ACTU- </para>

            <para>- You should, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers.</inline> I read &#39;News Weekly&#39;, so if that publication was read in conjunction with the &#39;Tribune&#39; the honourable senator would obtain all the different views. I am trying to develop the point of why the trade union movement cannot win in the eyes of many Government members. On one hand the Government says to members of unions: &#39;Look, do not agitate about wage increases. We will reform the society from within&#39;. On the other hand we hear all this talk about why the trade union movement should not enter the retail industry. The Government cannot have it both ways. If it says that the trade union movement should keep out of that field, I take the point to the next stage: If the trade union movement is involved exclusively with its own affairs, the Government will come to it and say: &#39;We need your assistance in the immigration field&#39;. I do not say that it should not do this or that it has done it, such aid given is not fully justified. But all these matters place impositions on the trade union cost structure. That will be related to the question of amalgamations which I will be dealing with shortly. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>I want to return to the core of this legislation and the cause of it. I have dealt with the failure to stabilise prices which, in turn when the trade union movement feels it has been gypped, leads it to come back to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission again and argue that during the term of the agreement there has been such an erosion of money value that some adjustment has to be made. It may be argued that some industries are stronger than others, but as I develop my argument I do not think I can avoid mentioning the other furphies that have been advanced. The Government says that if a major strong section of the trade union movement achieves something the gap is being widened between other grades. There always have to be pace setters. I would like Government senators to reflect on the history of weekend penalty rates. In the society in which we live now the emphasis, in television advertisements and so on, is on luxury, the good world and the quality of life. That is very good. But despite what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Little</inline> said about the blue collar section declining and the white collor section increasing, I hope that honourable senators realise that somebody always has to look after the furnace and to work in a brick pit. If the labour market is declining, those people are entitled to maintain the parity they fought so hard to get. The Victorian Premier was squealing about weekend penalty rates and about decisions on whether State Electricity Commission workers in Victoria should maintain parity in regard to annual leave - something which has been accepted in New South Wales for many years. It is all very well to say to the ACTU and to trade union secretaries: &#39;Get the members back to work and we will arbitrate&#39;. </para>
        <para>I was in Britain when the Wilberforce report which brought justice to the power station workers of Britain was presented. </para>
        <para class="block">The British Government accepted that report with good grace. This is hardly the ca.se when from time to time the Victorian Premier, and unfortunately at times even senior Ministers of this Government, try to be back seat drivers behind <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Richard</inline> Kirby. 1 know that the judiciary in that field is very sour about the remarks of some senior Ministers. Like other people, J have been guilty of feeling that a few - not the vast majority - of conciliation commissioners have not been as mobile as they should have been. According to the Government, it was wrong for me to do this, but if the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> does it. it is statesmanship. I want to take the point a little further. I am again deliberately raising this comparison between Europe and Australia. The fascinating point is that when Herr Schiller, the West German Finance Minister, and his counterparts in other countries have endeavoured to tlo things, we have never had the situation in Australia in which the Government was exhorting what it calls wage demand responsibility. I instance the fumble that, went on with Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd. We saw the mix up over who told whom whether the company should increase the price of steel. I conjured up the image in my mind of the Prime Minister at first slip and the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden)</inline> at second slip. The ball was in the air and one was leaving it to the other. That was the whole situation. Nobody seemed to know just what the Treasurer said. Whatever was said, you and I know that all that happened was that BHP upgraded the price of its commodity. The company was told that it was naughty but nobody mentioned anything about penal provisions. This is an indication of double standards, yet the Government talks about how it can obtain peace in industry. 1 have dealt extensively with wage increases. I want to deal now with other causes of industrial unrest which I refer to under the headings of containerisation, automation and computers. A number of disputes have been prolonged because the issues of either safety or future promotion or even job security were involved. The containerisation situation is a classic example of a considerable scaling down of the waterfront work force covering a number of unions including the Waterside Workers Federation, the Storemen and Packers </para>
        <para class="block">Union, the Federated Clerks Union, the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemens Association and one or two other unions. When the major ship owners realised that with a reduced work force there would be an ultimate saving - 1 use the word &#39;ultimate&#39; - an agreement was reached. Then there was the idea of settling a dispute without a stoppage. That is virtually what occurred. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fitzgibbon,</inline> the federal securetary of the Waterside Workers Federation, was castigated. This has been a continuation of the Government&#39;s attitude. </para>
        <para>I cast my mind back a few years - J look to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lawrie</inline> for inspiration - to the position prevailing at the port of Mackay. There are now only 40 waterside workers operating a port where 400 worked before. I could give instances all over the Commonwealth where the work force has been reduced but where there has not been any sizable reduction in the retail cost of the product. Government members may say to me: &#39;That Ls not relevant to the other point&#39;. But I ask them to tell a meeting of trade union officials which has to agree to a phasing out of sections of their industry where the person phased out is to get work. Honourable senators can study debates in the other place about retraining. I asked a question the other week about the possible closing down of the South Broken Hill mine and about retraining schemes. As I understand the answer from the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch),</inline> the scheme does not meet this contingency. 1 instance another dispute, the one-man bus dispute in Sydney. Important lessons were learned from this dispute. Initially, the parties talked in terms of a money increase. I think that in the final analysis what was agreed upon contained a good formula which linked industrial fatigue with safe working as well. People talk about trade union secretaries, their ideological background and just pressing a button and people walking out on the job. I wonder what they would think if we had trade union racketeers like Jimmy Hoffa in the US and Boyle of the mine workers union. Honourable senators might criticise a man for what they call over-dedication. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Negus</inline> has had considerable experience in driving cars. He will agree that in our modern cities today with one-man buses the situation is nerve wracking. The bus drivers got a formula that they would not have got if there had not been a dispute originally. Honourable senators opposite could argue about the effect on the lives of people in a big city complex. Perhaps some of the people who are upset work in air conditioned offices. Other people have to drive a Postmaster-General&#39;s Department mail van in the early hours of the morning to pick up mail; somebody else has to sign on at midnight as a boiler attendant. All these jobs are essential jobs. The point I am getting at is that the Government seems to have the attitude that people will remain docile. </para>
        <para>I return again to the matter of containerisation. There have usually been considerable struggles for job protection, lt is one thing to say that people will be transferred to another job. but have honourable senators opposite ever seen the secondary effects of that.? 1 instance a different situation altogether. There has been a change in retail shopping hours in both Sydney and Melbourne. I doubt whether the union involved has much Marxist influence in it. Do honourable senators opposite consider that people are resentful of the change and that, they are rightly looking at it themselves? People may be accustomed to finishing at a certain time - 5 p.m. Then the late shopping hours are introduced. I know that we have to reconcile the demands of the community as a whole to the rights of individuals in the work force. The message that I am trying to get across to the Government is this: When there is resistance in a union it is to ironclad sanctions, ls it possible to eradicate such a thing? I say that it is. I think 1 can put my arguments quite effectively by quoting <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Terry</inline> Winter, a Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commissioner from 1963 until April of this year. </para>

          <para>This is a senseless proposal. It seems to be based on two views - -that a conciliator is more likely to succeed if he can play no part in subsequent arbitration and that, once arbitration has commenced, there is no place for conciliation. </para>

        <para class="block">The moral of that story is that the original conciliation commissioner should assess the personality of the trade union leader and that of the representative of the employers. It is a sense of timing. In some respect that may be considered old hat by Government supporters. What 1 am trying to get across to them is that unless there is supplementary wage stabilisation with more effective methods of protecting the people who are victims of containerisation there will be a source of irritation. I refer to what happened in the Golden Fleece case. That concerned the first introduction of computers into the white collar industries. The Federated Clerks Union of Australia became extremely restive. At one stage it was more or less lectured by the judge about the right of the employer to hire and fire. Do honourable senators opposite realise that once higher educational standards have been created, even for the trade union secretary, the position will be, rightly, that Jack is as good as his master. The union secretary faces that situation. He cannot sell his members a bill of goods that they are nol prepared to accept. It has to be documented. </para>
        <para>I think I might take my argument a little further and quote <inline font-weight="bold">Mr J.</inline> P. Ducker, a leading trade union official in Sydney. He said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>All the trade union movement is asking is that it should be placed in that position allowed to all other sellers in. the Australian market economy. For example, there is no public scrutiny of the methods of those who fix prices or sell land or houses or of those who decide to reduce the quality or decrease the quantity of goods sold while pretending to maintain a static price. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">That is the philosophy of the trade union movement. We feel that effective answers have not been given to these questions. I might take my argument still further and deal with the ambit of trade union movement. I say that particularly to Country Party senators. Earlier to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> 1 said that I read the &#39;News Weekly&#39; and the &#39;Tribune&#39;. I also read &#39;Muster&#39;. I do not think &#39;Muster&#39; is backward in commenting on many matters. As a matter of fact, there have been visible demonstrations by sections of rural industry. I do not cavil at what they have done. We are living in a society in which people will not remain docile if they feel that governments are not moving effectively. </para>
        <para>I deal now with the subject of amalgamation. Amalgamation of certain unions is inevitable. In the United States there is a multiplicity of unions. While the Americans believe in a minimum of government interference, this multiplicity of trade unions is getting more and more burdensome. There is one matter to which I take very strong objection. I am fortified by 2 cases which I will quote. I refer to the Government&#39;s absurd idea that if a union of 2,000 and another of 50,000 are to amalgamate there has to be a ballot of members of both organisations. I think that is patently absurd. I will give 2 illustrations. The first is a matter for the future. One day a small union in New South Wales known as the Canvas and Tarpaulin Workers Union will have to amalgamate with another union. Its membership is 600. It has had very dedicated officials, but history has caught up with it. It probably will carry on for a couple of years, but inevitably it will be absorbed by the Australian Railways Union, which has about 35,000 members, or a similar transport workers union. The Government expects a union which has tremendous calls on its finances to foot the bill for the ballot. The second case is that of the Federated Ironworkers Association of Australia with 68,000 members which is negotiating with the Chemical Technicians Guild of Australia, which has a membership of about 2,000. It is utter rubbish that the Government should impose on those unions the need to conduct a ballot. </para>
        <para>Trade unions costs are getting a lot higher. On numerous occasions my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> has referred to the rising trade unions costs. I make a plea for the Government to short circuit a lot of these matters by avoiding a ballot among members of the absorbing union when the ratio is 2,000 to something like 30,000 or perhaps 50,000. To my way of thinking, this clause is a deliberate way of drawing upon a lot of the resources of the trade union movement. I shall give a classic illustration of rising costs. Recently  I  received a communication from the Minister for Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Forbes)</inline> dealing with Greek migrants. The Australian Railways Union has a considerable number of such people as members. It decided to circulate the various delegates with on the job information that would be of interest to some of its migrant members. The postal bill was $175. It cannot afford to have too many of those ventures. That is probably the smallest cost in a trade union operation. I have tried to put this debate on the level of fundamentals. Members of the Opposition feel that, irrespective of the faults in the present Act, all the Government is doing is creating a considerable reaction and resentment. If it can prove to us that, as in many European countries, there will be supplementary assistance, wage stabilisation and such things that go with national wage agreements, we will be a lot better off. The only other point I make is in relation to fringe benefits <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lillico</inline> introduced the subject of Western Europe, not I. Western Europe and, for that matter, Eastern Europe, are ahead of us in respect of fringe benefits, severance pay and social service coverage generally. The Bill is a combination of provocation and outmoded thinking. </para>

          <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> left us with some very good thoughts on this Bill. I was quite surprised that he, as a member of the Opposition with great experience in the trade union movement, should have posed the argument which was apparently applauded by most members of the Opposition - at least they interrupted his speech to the extent that no-one could hear what he was saying - that where there was  a  small trade union and a large trade union and it appeared obvious at some stage that the larger one would take over the smaller, it was ridiculous to suggest there should be a ballot of both of those unions to decide whether the members wished amalgamation. I think that this thinking, if it is the proposition put forward by the honourable senator, needs contemplation because this certainly does not appear to me to be the proper democratic thinking of a properly oriented Labor Party. </para>

        <para>I believe there is wide scope for debate on many items of public interest in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill  1972.  The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Greenwood)</inline> suggested in his second reading speech that this Bill is probably the most significant legislation since  1947  in relation to employee-employer relations. On a number of occasions the Attorney-General in his second reading speech referred to serious wage induced inflation. It is interesting to note that members of the Opposition have not thought fit to mention that aspect. However, the whole aim behind this piece of legislation we have before us is to reduce this inflation. I believe wage induced inflation to be a fact. It appears to me that there are few people in the community who fully appreciate the cetain future impact of inflation which will be eventually hardest felt by those in the community who can least afford to stand that hardship. </para>
        <para>I have believed all of my life that it is very necessary that this community pay to employees the maximum return possible for their labour. Increased wage returns must surely be the base from which to judge an increase in the standard of living of the majority of people in the community. We would be very wise to see from every angle, whether it be from the business or employer angle and no matter to which community interest one may look that the highest wage that can be paid to employees in this community should be paid. </para>

            <para>- The honourable senator followed up his first suggestion with another most important comment which, of course, is involved in the Attorney-General&#39;s responsible statement on wage induced inflation. I believe that in these times it is still the hope of reward that sweetens labour and this community should seek to make that reward the very maximum. With the encouragement of many areas of interest in the community many benefits have been attracted to the employee in this community over the past years. At present employees have reasonably short working hours, although I realise they are not short enough for most of my Opposition colleagues. There are restricted days of work during the week as well as compensation for absence in case of sickness. Numerous public holidays are taken on full pay and annual leave, long service leave and compensation insurance are given by employers. There are many satisfactory areas of compensation for employees in the community today. These are benefits which employing bodies have been able to provide over a period of years. These benefits have been fought for by unions. They have been fought for by employees and have been agreed to willingly by governments of all complexions. One of the greatest leaders in giving compensation to employees, at least in the State of Victoria, has been the present complex of Liberal government and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poyser</inline> well knows that to be the case. He knows that benefits have been given to employees, not necessarily on the demand of trade unions. </para>

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poyser</inline> thinks the Victorian Government is years behind but I do not believe he is right. The granting of all of these achievements - and I pose this to honourable senators as something which employees should consider - has gradually created a situation in which it is not a simple matter to employ a person and pay him a wage that will ensure the employer a return on his labour. Such demands are one of the contributing factors of unemployment in the community today. Not one employee is employed today without the employer having to bear in mind the fact that it will be necessary to allow at least $100 a week for a salary together with ancillary benefits. </para>

        <para>On the basis of what I have just outlined, goods must become very expensive - and well we know that this is the case at the present time - and services in the community must become particularly expensive. Every honourable senator knows the rate that is required by ordinary labourers today to perform any sort of task. I believe that the erosion of the benefits of these community achievements - benefits such as those I have mentioned - will in the end result in a situation of disastrous wage induced inflation. Again I say that the ultimate seriousness of this situation is brushed aside by most people in the community. I believe that those who are harmed at present are those who some years ago retired on a fixed remuneration. I am talking about those who fought very early in their careers to set aside an amount that would be payable to them either through insurance or superannuation. The value of the remuneration paid to these people has been very seriously eroded and they are in dire plight today. I notice that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner</inline> has not consideration for these people whatsoever and just waves his handkerchief to indicate that perhaps he should cry over the matter. But to me this is a very serious matter which flows further to other individuals in the community whom I represent in the Senate. I speak of those involved in primary production who are working for the benefit of Australia to see that Australian goods are placed on export markets. </para>
        <para>The cost of living has undoubtedly risen in recent years. However, I think it is fair to say - and I imagine that all honourable senators in this place will agree with me - that the rate of inflation or the rate of increase in the consumer price index, as we should perhaps term it, has been very slight compared with increases in the average wage year by year. I have referred to this on previous occasions, if we have a situation in which it can be proved that generally the cost of goods has remained at a reasonably stable level or has increased at a slight figure but, on the other hand, the figure in relation to the average weekly earnings and the percentage change related to previous years has escalated, this cannot but pinpoint and endorse the Attorney-General&#39;s comment that at the present time it is wage-induced inflation. The Opposition can perhaps take this further into their minds. If it is a little difficult to comprehend in those words then I ask that I be permitted to incorporate in Hansard a publication which I have received from the statistical service of the Parliamentary Library Legislative Research Service. It indicates the average weekly earnings and the consumer price index from 1961-62 to 1970-71. I seek leave to incorporate the publication in Hansard. </para>

            <para>- I shall explain it to honourable senators. It is a chart showing the average weekly earnings in the community.It sets out the amounts from 1961-62 to 1970-71. Next to those amounts are figures that show the percentage change on the <inline font-style="italic">previous year.</inline> Taking the 10 years of change, and the percentage change year by year in relation to average weekly earnings, there have been increases of 2.6 per cent, 2.7 per cent, 5.3 per cent, 7.4 per cent, 4.7 per cent, 6.6 per cent, 5.8 per cent, 7.5 per cent, 8.4 per cent and 11.3 per cent. Those percentage changes are up to the year 1970-71. But if we look at the consumer price index - if honourable senators can keep those earlier percentages in mind - we find that from a base year 1966-67 the percentage change in each year commencing from 1961-62, has been an increase of 0.4 per cent, 0.2 per cent 0.9 per cent. 3.8 per cent, 3.6 per cent. 2.7 per cent, 3.3 per cent. 2.6 per cent. 3.2 per cent and 4.8 per cent. Ft can be seen that in not one year in the last 10 years has the average weekly wage merely equated the rise in the consumer price index. But in 7 of those 10 years the percentage change in the average weekly earnings has more than doubled that of the increased percentage in the consumer price index. As anybody must realise, this situation cannot but lead to an inflationary situation in the community. </para>

            <para>- I wish to refer to one other very important matter which I see in this wage-induced inflation. I feel that it is a matter to which the Government must give early and urgent consideration. I see a situation which has come about where the granting of a percentage increase to a basic rate by the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission is interpreted by all sectors of the community as a further requirement for a percentage rise to every class of employee. To me this is an entirely unacceptable proposition; but very few honourable senators have spoken against it in the Senate. Let me give an instance. A $5 or $6 rise which has been granted as, say, a 10 per cent rise on the earnings of a particular class of employees leads to a demand for a 10 per cent rise for employees who may be earning $10,000 or $15,000 a year. A $5 a week rise which has been calculated as being a requirement for an employee who is earning $50 or $60 a week is taken to mean a requirement of a $1,500 or $2,000 a year rise- or $20 to $30 a week rise - for some person who is on a higher salary. </para>

            <para>- I misinterpreted the honourable senator. I think honourable senators will agree, because I think 1 heard an honourable senator at question time today say that somebody had been granted an $80 a week rise. Certainly I have a feeling that in very many Federal Government and State Government circles this proposition has not been denied. I think that in these future years this is something at which we will have to look very carefully. I say again that if a 10 per cent rise is granted to somebody earning $50 or $60 a week this should not be interpreted as necessitating a 10 per cent rise for somebody earning $15,000 a year. This is one of the dangerous causes of wageinduced inflation. It will bring about a breakdown in the system of wage payments which we have in the community at present. I believe that this Bill proposes new opportunities for the development of conciliation where there are stoppages or other matters which lead to a breakdown in relations between employer and employee. I believe the Government hopes that by this Bill stoppages may be averted. It hopes that the loss of manpower which has occurred in the community certainly will be lowered in the coming years. The Bill proposes that more conciliation be induced into the various discussions between employers and employees. It further purports to extend control over the actions of organisations. This can be seen in clause 141. It proposes to give further financial assistance to ordinary members of trade unions to see that unions are properly controlled. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> made some reference to this when he brought forward the comments about smaller and larger unions. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>As 1 read it, I believe that the Commonwealth offers financial assistance to individuals in certain cases where they wish to ensure that unions are being properly controlled. Amalgamations will require a ballot of organisations concerned in any proposed amalgamation. It will be seen that amalgamations should take place only where rank and file support is evident for the proposal. The problem of agreements negotiated outside the court has been one of the disasters in our community. We can see this currently in the instance of the waterside workers making their arrangement with ship owners who, in general, happen to be overseas ship owners and who probably agreed to the arrangement while not being in Australia. This is greatly to the disadvantage not only of people who import goods to Australia but also of people who export from this country. I believe that the problems are very difficult to define, but I think that this particularly fine piece of legislation will, in some measure, equate the situation. The Bill has my full support. I certainly believe it to be in the public interest, and I congratulate the Minister on bringing it before the Senate. </para>

It appears to me that this Government cannot learn the lesson that repressive legislation is fruitless. It has been in power for 20-odd years but it still relies on repression to try to intimidate the workers of Australia.

        <para class="block">Queensland? There fs legislation in Queensland of a similar character to this Bill, dealing with secret ballots and so on. Has it had any effect? What was the biggest industrial dispute in Queensland for many years? It was the Mount Isa dispute, which was brought about by repressive provisions in the Queensland Act. Did the workers take any notice of them? Did the Queensland Government act against the workers? Of course it did. It brought in emergency powers. What did the workers say of those emergency powers? They took as much notice of them as they did of the Act itself. The Government is forcing workers into the position of ignoring and condemning the laws of the land. This is not the fault of the workers; it is the Government&#39;s fault for bringing in repressive legislation, as it is trying to do by introducing this Bill. </para>
        <para>History has shown that sanctions merely add Barnes to the fire. That will always be the case. Anybody with any experience in the industrial movement knows that this is so. I can tell the Senate of innumerable occasions when workers, incensed by government action, have not worried about secret ballots or legislation that might have been introduced. They have acted in accordance with their conscience, and they will always do so. Ask senators on the Government side what they would do if they were workers in the sense of the word as we know it and something of this nature happened. </para>

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> comes in with an inane interjection. He forfeited all right to workers&#39; consideration in 1957. I ask Government members what they would do in circumstances such as those I will now relate. A worker had the misfortune of having to take his brother to a mental asylum one Friday. All his workmates knew this, but the foreman did not. On the Saturday he was under some strain at work, as would be appreciated. The foreman noticed this, but instead of trying to find out what the trouble was, he asked the worker: &#39;What is wrong with you today. Jack? You appear to be going nuts&#39;. What happened? The worker flattened the foreman. Assuming that honourable senators on the Government side were workers. would they have acted differently? If they have red corpuscles in their blood, would they not have done precisely the same? The employer would not accept that any worker had the right to strike a foreman, so he sacked the worker straight away. What did his workmates do? What would honourable senators on the Government side do if one of their fellow workers was dismissed for something of that nature? The workers concerned walked out, as workers will always walk out over things of that nature. Innumerable matters of other kinds have caused industrial disputes. </para>

        <para>I refer to the economics of the situation. How do Government members think workers feel at the end of each week when they find that the value of their wages has been eroded by higher prices and by the increase in the cost of living? The worker has no control over those matters. But he knows when he arrives home at the end of each week with his pay envelope that his wages will not buy nearly as much as they did a fortnight ago or even a week ago. What is his attitude to life? What must his wife feel about these things? They are fearful of what will happen in the future. 1 ney have no control over the future whatsoever. The Government has control over these things, lt is the Government&#39;s duty to see that prices are controlled so that the value of workers&#39; wages will not be eroded. What must the worker do to offset this erosion? He must try to get more money. He must try to get his employer to conciliate. But the Government does not believe in conciliation. This is perfectly obvious from the statement made by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> recently in relation to waterside workers and the need for conciliation. They conciliated. But now the Prime Minister denies all the efforts of that conciliatory process which was entered into by the Waterside Workers Federation and the waterfront employers. So do not talk to me about conciliation. The Government wants conciliation only to knock down the worker. It does not want conciliation to enable the worker to lift up his position in life. </para>
        <para>Let us take into consideration the psychological attitude of the worker. No-one will deny that we are living in unusual times and times of stress. When I mention Vietnam immediately there will be catcalls from the other side of the Senate. Honourable senators opposite should not try to kid themselves that Vietnam is not an issue which has caused many problems in this country. The Government has divided families on this issue. The Government is divided on it. J know members of the Liberal Party who strongly oppose Australia&#39;s participation in Vietnam. How do honourable members opposite think the worker feels when he knows that overseas firms are taking over Australian industries and that the profit from those firms - the worker has helped to make those profits - are going overseas in the way in which they are today? Has the Government done anything about this situation? lt has done nothing at all. It would not know the psychological effect of these things on the worker and his family. Firms make millions of dollars in profit but the Government allows them to increase the price of their commodities as they like. How must the worker feel when he reads reports in the Press of debates in which it is said that country interests are not worried by the means tests to which he is subjected? Country interests are receiving millions of dollars. This might be justified, but surely the Government must appreciate that the worker considers all of these factors. </para>

            <para>- How do honourable senators opposite think the worker feels about the provision in this legislation which seeks to give to conciliation commissioners a wage increase of $4,500 a year? This comes very close to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> because I feel that he will oppose that provision. The worker through his union appears before the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and receives a miserable $2 a week increase in the national wage. Yet the Prime Minister of this country introduces and seeks to have passed by this national parliament legislation to give him an increase of $7,000 a year or approximately $140 a week. How must the worker feel about that? The Prime Minister, after the decision of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to give the worker an increase of $2 a week in the national wage, gleefully applauds that decision. </para>

            <para>- My colleague mentions the price of land. Honourable senators know the difficulties that young people face today in buying land on which to build a home of their own. How must a worker feel when he knows that a government sells the natural resources of his State and receives a royalty of 5c a ton on coal and bauxite? What must be the worker&#39;s thoughts about his country giving away its natural resources to overseas interests? Surely the worker is entitled to know what is happening. Knowing that the value of his wages are being eroded will have a psychological effect on him as he goes home each week. What does the Government expect the worker to do?  1  know what he will do. He will seek redress through his union or by his own activities on the job to achieve an increase in wages. Let me tell the story of a wharfie who, in the depression years, could not get a job. He walked the town day after day and could not get a job. He told me that he had resolved that when the depression concluded he was going to get his slice of the cake. I said to him: &#39;What did you do, Phil? How did you get a bigger slice of the cake?&#39; He said: &#39;I bought a bigger bag&#39;. That is the attitude of the workers. If they are penalised and oppressed they will use their own means to get their way in the end. </para>

          <para class="block">The Federated Clerks&#39; Union of Australia emphatically rejects the proposals made by the Minister for Labour and National Service for amendment to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act as being discriminatory, unworkable and devoid of the type of improvement to make the Commonwealth Arbitration Commission more effective and acceptable. Such proposals would pose a major threat to the system of conciliation and arbitration and to Unionism generally. </para>
          <para>We reject the proposals which attack the right of trade unionists to organise effectively as being reminiscent of attempts to prevent the growth of trade unions which were unsuccessfully made in the last century. These proposals are similar to the discredited anti-Union so-called &#39;right-to-work&#39; laws to be found in certain backward States in the USA. </para>
          <para>The proposals outlined in respect to the establishment of procedures which it is claimed will encourage greater conciliation are inefficient and have obviously been made by those who have no more than an academic and impractical understanding of the operation of the Conciliation and Arbitration system. </para>
          <para>We slate that the proposed alterations would inhibit conciliation rather than encourage it. The proposals which allow the Commonwealth Government, which we emphasise is the largest employer in Australia, to interfere with negotiated settlements made by responsible parties to industrial disputes and to allow outside interests to similarly interfere with such settlements is a retrograde step which cannot be supported. </para>
          <para>The proposal to eliminate the right of the  President  of the Commission to include Commissioners assigned to particular industries on Full Benches is also a retrograde step. This will deny such tribunals the benefit of the experience of those with the responsibility for the preservation of good industrial relations in particular industries in the resolution of some industrial disputes. lt is emphasised that the Commonwealth Arbitration Commission has stated time and again that it has regard for the economic consequences of its decisions. The proposal outlined to make this a Statutory requirement will inevitably have the effect of considerably lengthening proceedings which already take far too long to finalise. </para>
          <para>Steps should be taken to shorten the time taken to resolve disputes, not to lengthen it. As an illustration of what can be done to shorten proceedings, we refer to the procedures in the National Wages Cases which have been evolved over the years and which have had the effect of cutting the time to argue such cases from months to weeks. </para>
          <para>This Union calls on the Federal Government to reconsider its statement of intention and to consult with persons who occupy responsible positions in the field of industrial relations and who have had practical experience in resolving complex industrial disputes and to place less emphasis on bureaucratic advisers whose main experience and knowledge has been gained from text books. </para>

            <para>- There are many things which can be said about this legislation. The workers and the unions have always been the targets for these types of attacks. I draw the attention of the Senate  to what we in the industrial movement know as &#39;Kelly&#39;s prayer&#39;. In 1954 <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Raymond</inline> Kelly, then Chief Judge of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, made 14 points in all on what he wanted the trade unions to do. These are the attacks on the trade unions which have been going on ever since. He said then: </para>

        <para class="block">
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hannan</inline>would agree with that one. But I wonder what he would say if somebody wanted to limit his holidays. He would be up in arms. There are many other things contained in &#39;Kelly&#39;s prayer&#39; and I would suggest to honourable senators that they look at it on some occasion. I promised that I would say something to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> which, if he had any honour at all, would make him blush with shame. I refer to the &#39;Constitution and Rules&#39; of the Liberal Party of Australia which I received quite legitimately by writing to the Party and asking for it. Just listen to some of the grandiose thoughts on freedom in that Party&#39;s constitution. Under (d) (iii) the following appears:  freedom of speech, religion and  association. </para>
        <para class="block">But does the Liberal Party give that right in any degree at all to workers who want to amalgamate their associations? No. It wants them to take a secret ballot. Let us look now at what the Liberal Party&#39;s constitution says about that. Oh, this is a classic! It says under 5. (g): </para>
        <quote>
          <para>To enter into any arrangement for joint working or co-operation or affiliation with any other party, association, society or body of persons whether incorporated or not incorporated carrying on work or having objects similar to the objects of the Party and to assist and support by pecuniary contributions or otherwise the operations of any, such party, association, society or body- </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">And just listen to this -  and to take over upon any terms all or any of the property, undertakings and liabilities of any such party, association, society or body. </para>
        <para class="block">Where are the Liberal Party&#39;s secret ballot provisions for affiliation there? This is its document. I would like to table the document when 1 have concluded speaking because it is a classic in hypocrisy. The Liberal Party says that workers cannot band together without having to go through all the processes of a secret ballot although the perpetrators of the legislation now before us do not accept that principle being applied to their own party. The Liberal Party will take over the property of any organisation; it will take over its assets. But it does not give its members the right to a secret vote, lt does not give to the members of the organisation it intends to swallow an opportunity to exercise a vote but it wants the workers who may, for their industrial advantage, have the opportunity to amalgamate to have a secret ballot. Would anyone believe that any body such as the Liberal Party would have the temerity to introduce legislation of this nature? Let us look at some of the things the Minister for Labour and National Service said about this matter when he opened a conference in Melbourne recently - that is where he gets all his riding instructions. He said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>It is not without a certain amount of irony, let alone the pleasure that it gives me, to bc associated today with the formal opening of the Central Industrial Secretariat which has been established by the Australian Council of Employers Federations and the Associated Chambers of Manufactures and their affiliated State Bodies lo co-ordinate their industrial relations policies. </para>
          <para>The opening of this central body means that two very, powerful and influential employer bodies in this country have seen the benefits to their members of combining together their resources to more effectively undertake their responsibilities in the field of industrial relations. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>What does the Government think the trade unions want to do? Why does it think they want to amalgamate? It is in order to do the very things that the Minister now applauds the Australian Council of Employers Federations for doing. This is the hypocritical stand of the Government on these issues. It encourages and congratulates the employers for doing those things but it denies to the workers that fundamental right. </para>
        <para>Let us now look at the legislation. We have a case in Queensland where the meat industry union with 10,000 members wants to amalgamate with a little union, the bacon employees union, which has about 1,100 members. Both unions have to conduct a ballot among their members to determine whether the meat employees union will accept the members of the other union. What sort of legislation is it that requires that? The unions have to go to the expense of conducting a ballot. Each ballot paper costs approximately 17c. That includes the paper, the printing, the posting out to all the members, the enclosing of a stamped envelope in which to return the vote to the union. All this costs approximately 17c. The 10,000 members of the meat employees union have to meet the cost of that ballot being held to decide whether their union will amalgamate with another which has 1,100 members. </para>

          <para>- I welcome the amendments and improvements to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act which are proposed by this Bill. Before dealing with the Bill, which perhaps might be a revolutionary development in this chamber this evening, .1 think I should traverse one or two points made by my friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner,</inline> who is a kind, well meaning soul. The honourable senator astonished us this evening by his venture into the class struggle. How could he say that people on this side of the chamber are interested in conciliation only for the purpose of knocking down the worker? Does he not know that very nearly one-half - it is not quite one-half - of the trade unionists of this country vote for the Government parties? If the honourable senator wants precise figures I shall give him the figures which I recall seeing following the last gallup poll. They revealed that of the trade unionists in this country 38 per cent voted for the Liberal and Country Parties and 41 per cent of their wives voted in a similar fashion, which may mean that women are more intelligent than men. However, I leave those figures with my friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner</inline> for his consideration. </para>

Some reference was made tonight by my friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner</inline> to the salary of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon).</inline> I was a little surprised that: this comment should come from an honourable senator opposite because on the occasion last year when the Government refused to increase parliamentary salaries the wailing and the gnashing of teeth that came from honourable senators opposite was piteous to hear and a frightful sight to behold. My friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner</inline> had occasion also to paint a rather dramatic picture of the poor downtrodden and oppressed worker coming home from his honest day&#39;s toil only to find that prices have gone up. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner</inline> did not tell us - I know this was purely an oversight because his honesty and his integrity are unchallenged - was that 85 per cent of the cost of the goods to the worker was comprised of actual wages, lt is true that they are somebody else&#39;s wages - not his. But I am not one of those people who believe that the whole blame for cost-push inflation rests on the shoulders of the workers. I do not believe that at all. I am quite prepared and willing to concede that there are avaricious employers who are quite prepared to take the community for a ride if given the opportunity to do so. But one has to be fair and impartial in these matters. </para>

The statement, which dealt with a number of other matters also, was very lengthy and I cannot traverse it in toto. </para>

            <para>- I have to traverse the nonsense that has been put before me. My friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> who also, as I have said of my friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner,</inline> is a kind, well-meaning soul, but the argument that the union has to pay for these unfortunate ballots which they will be compelled to conduct. 1 suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> look at proposed new section 158T(1.) and (2.) in the Bill. When he does so 1 think he will no longer adhere to that preposterous proposition. I believe that this Bill is a charter designed to keep capital and labour working harmoniously for the national well being. In order to show the impartiality of the Government in relation to these matters I again refer honourable senators to the lengthy and impressive proposals put before this chamber this afternoon by the Attorney-General. </para>

        <para>Nationally both parties are committed, more or less - us more, the others less - to a policy of conciliation and arbitration in industrial matters. Once outside the framework of the conciliation and arbitration system the law of the jungle operates. The big strong unions and the big strong employers are able to drive the weaker workers and the weaker employer organisations to the wall. Hence it is clear that both sides of industry are affected. Perhaps the most important side of industry, if we can have a triangle and a third side, is the consumer. Industry exists in all circumstances only to provide goods or services for a consumer. Without a consumer there is no industry. Of course, one of the big troubles of honourable senators opposite is that they are not active trade unionists and they do not know very much about what goes on inside unions. 1 do not suppose half a dozen honourable senators opposite could produce their union cards. </para>

            <para>- Knock it off. You heard what the Acting  Deputy President  said. One of the big difficulties is that people can get out of touch with union affairs. 1 have no doubt that many honourable senators opposite have been very active in their unions in the past. They know something about what goes on in union meetings. They get elected to the Senate as a result of a secret ballot so 1 do not know what they find so objectionable about secret ballots. Then they lose touch with industrial organisations by which they rose to this place. That is why we have heard so much nonsense levelled this evening against the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. </para>

            <para>- Yes, I am. I have no intention of discussing many of the amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act which make this Bill such a milestone in our industrial legislation. I propose to concentrate on some of the more outstanding aspects of the Bill. In it we have a sharp break with tradition in the fact that a  Deputy President  may be a non-lawyer. As a simple suburban lawyer myself, I commend this decision to welcome into the ranks of  Deputy  Presidents men with a university degree or substantial knowledge and experience in industrial and economic affairs. The question of equality before the law is a matter which the Government and the draftsman had in mind when traversing the whole of the 69 clauses in this Bill. The Government proposes to make all people equal before the law. The provisions in respect of financial assistance for those who feel that their executive has not done the right thing, the holding of secret ballots and other things, are the hallmark of a Liberal administration. </para>

        <para>I want to contrast that approach to industrial affairs with the Australian Labor Party&#39;s approach to such matters. I want to say this slowly so that my honourable friends on the Opposition side will be able to take it in. At Townsville in December 197! the Federal Executive of the Australian Labor Party resolved that when it became the Government - should that cataclysm ever happen - &#39;union should be immune for actions in common law against private or civil wrongs alleged to have been committed by or on behalf of a trade union in furtherance of a trade dispute&#39;. In other words, provided there is a strike, people can burn motor cars, smash windows, assault people and trespass on property. If this is done by a trade union officer in the course of a dispute he is to be immune from actions for damages and he is to be immune from actions in tort. This is a most extradordinary proposal. It has the effect of placing trade union officers and trade unionist above the law. 1 believe that members of my trade union need protection but they do not need that sort of protection. Another decision of the Federal Executive meeting in December 1971 was: </para>

        <para class="block">I wonder whether they know that clause <inline font-style="italic">19</inline> will insert a new section 45 in the Act to deal with secret ballots. This will propide a real opportunity to find out the wishes of the rank and file. Proposed new section 45a contains stringent conditions for the conduct of a ballot. I want to have a word or two to say about this matter. If there are provisions in this Bill which should commend themselves to honest, down to earth, rank and file members of unions and honourable senators opposite - the 7 of them with tickets - they are, firstly, superseding regulation 141, the provision that will enable financial assistance to be given to a trade unionist who believes that his executive has not carried out the real wishes of his union and who demands a secret ballot, and secondly, the very extensive provisions in the Bill governing the type of ballot to be held before an amalgamation.I want to say a little about the phoney ballot which took place before the recent metal trades amalgamation. The ballot was conducted by the Boilermakers and Blacksmiths Society of Australia. I have here a photostat copy of the returning officer&#39;s report of that ballot. This is the point I want to make: Of the 35,200 members of the organisation - according to Australian Council of Trade Unions return there were 32,063; so we will accept the lower figure for the moment  -  of 32,063 members of the union only 21,783 received ballot papers. What happened to the other 11,000 members? Why did they not receive ballot papers? Is it suggested that they are all members of the Australian Democratic Labor Party <inline font-style="italic">or</inline> the Liberal Party? Surely one could not hang a dog on the result of a ballot conducted in these circumstances. </para>

            <para>- Thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President,</inline> for your protection and your impartiality. 1 draw the attention of my friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> who, no doubt is a company lawyer of some experience and erudition, to the fact that in the case of company takeovers a ballot of 90 per cent is required before the uniform companies legislation permits such a takeover. Do not let us have a lot of nonsense. One of the more amazing aspects of the matters relating to this extraordinary ballot - I shall remind honourable senators opposite of this in days and nights that are to come; they will never forget it - is that they have approved a ballot with a small majority of some 6,000 in which 331/3 per cent of the members entitled to vote did not receive a ballot paper. 1 will tell my honourable friends opposite how the ballot was conducted. They would not know that because they do not know much about trade unions. This is what happened in the case of the Boilermakers and Blacksmiths Society of Australia: Let us assume that there is a building job in a part of the city and 100 boilermakers are employed on it. The executive sends to the shop steward on the job 100 ballot papers. This distinguished officer, if he is honest, distributes them to the 100 boilermakers on the job. If he is not honest, one does not have to be Mandrake to guess what happens to the ballot papers. </para>

I have deliberately avoided much reference to the real knaves and the real villains in our industrial society - the Communist Party of Australia, whether it be the Moscow orientated crowd of Aarons, Ted Hills Mao-ist line group or the third force de frappe, I suppose it can be called, of Comrade Clancy. One reason why these amalgamations are being sought by left wing unions is, of course, that it is an essential part of the policy of the Communist Party of Australia to destroy craft trade unionism. What that Party wants is great massive industrial complexes which can hold the entire nation to ransom and which can dictate to governments. What it wants is monopolisation of control. I will deal with Comrade Sharkey and bring honourable senators opposite right up to date. Comrade Sharkey said that trade unionism in Australia has to be conducted entirely on shop lines, and that the Communist Party regards these craft divisions as a source of weakness and disunity, hindering the growth of revolutionary strength. Honourable senators opposite go along with that point of view. Sharkey claims that the best method by which to achieve this is by means of amalgamation of existing craft unions. Do honourable senators opposite support that? Finally, because my time is about to expire, I feel that I should make a passing reference- (Opposition senators interjecting) - </para>

Perhaps it is not widely known that the union to which he belongs is Actors Equity Association of Australia. After watching his performance tonight all honourable senators can readily understand why he had to seek alternate employment. In the midst of his waffling speech he challenged senators on this side of the chamber to get back to the Bill. It was an odd challenge coming from him, but I propose to take him up on it. It is about time that the Senate got back to considering what is before it. The Bill is not one to improve industrial relations; it is one to improve the Government&#39;s fortunes. It is quite clear that, as far as the Government is concerned, industrial relations run a poor second to public relations. </para>

The Commission will be empowered to confirm the award or order in the light of what is put to it or to make such changes as it deems necessary&#39;.

Once again we see that it is not principles that count with the Government, but the plain, shoddy, mundane consideration of votes. </para>
        <para>Another example of what pressure can do to the Government&#39;s principles is contained in the provisions dealing with amalgamations. Let me remind honourable senators that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch&#39;s</inline> statement of intent of 7th December 1971 was made after months of consideration and after months of consultation with the unions and employers. It was determined after a most mature consideration of the subject. In his speech of 7th December the words amalgamate&#39; and &#39;amalgamation&#39; do not occur. Then we were confronted with the furore that came from the DLP over the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union - a great aggregation of workers who joined together under one banner. The amalgamation was approved by the employers and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch.</inline> We must remember that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> was forced into a corner by the approval of the employers and by the approval of such authoritative spokesmen of his principles as the &#39;Sydney Morning Herald&#39; and he could not get off the limb onto which he had worked himself. He had said that he could see nothing wrong with the amalgamation, but the people on whom he depended for support did not like the amalgamation. He could not retreat from it. Instead he threw, as a sop to the Democratic Labor Party, the amalgamation provisions in the Bill which can be described only as a code to prevent union amalgamation. Is this an example of high principle? In this, as in every other aspect of the Bill, we observe the Government looking over its shoulder at the employers, keeping its ear cocked to the DLP and ignoring only the unions. Of course it has decided, as ever, that votes are to be garnered by putting the boot into the unions. </para>
        <para>Let us look at some of the provisions of the Bill. Firstly let us consider what is at the heart of the industrial problem in this country and at all the debate about the regulation of industrial matters - that is, the matter of strikes and sanctions. Let us get this matter of strikes in perspective before we decide whether the Government had any justification in doing what it has done in the BUI - that is, set the clock back in the matter of sanctions. As other speakers on this side have pointed out, serious and all as it may be, the time lost through strikes - half a day per man per year - is a drop in the ocean compared to the loss in production due to industrial accidents and due to the unnecessary time and production lost through the Governmentinduced unemployment which has plagued this country during the last year. If one thinks in terms of 60,000 men unnecessarily out of work over a period of a year and the production lost during that time one does not give a great deal of thought to the half day per man per year which is lost in strikes. Of course, if we want to put the matter into perspective I suggest that we should look to none other than the Minister for Labour and National Service himself and what he said in the statement of intent in December last. The Minister stated: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Statistics compiled from ILO sources indicate that for the <inline font-style="italic">5</inline> years 1965 to 1969 the average annual number of man-days lost per 1,000 employees in the mining, manufacturing, construction and transport industries in Australia was 456, compared wilh 1,556 for Canada, 1,232 for the United States and 1,574 for Italy. Furthermore, most countries are showing a rising trend in time lost through industrial disputes. For example, the number of man-days lost in 1970 was at least 30 per cent higher in the United States, about 60 per cent higher in the United Kingdom and 100 per cent higher in New Zealand than in the previous year. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">In other words, there are 2 conclusions to be drawn from the figures from this impeccable source - the Minister for Labour and National Service - firstly, that this trend to increasing strikes is common to all advanced industrial countries. I suggest that it might be for the same reason that in all advanced industrial countries workers are confronted with the problem of wages chasing prices. They see no other way of making ends meet than to use whatever industrial muscle they have. The second conclusion to be drawn from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch&#39;s</inline> figures is that the problem is less acute in Australia than it is in these other countries. </para>
        <para>In the face of this situation we find in the legislation before us an attempt to put the clock back, as I have said, on the matter of machinery for the settlement of industrial disputes and in the matter of sanctions which the Government seeks to have at its disposal to enforce its will on working men seeking wage justice. We have only to cast our minds back to the traumatic experiences of the metal trades strikes stemming from the decision of the Commission in the metal trades case at the end of 1968 which led to a rash of strikes early in 1969. Under the old bad unworkable sanction clauses in the Act - the old sections 109 and 111  -  an employer could automatically without any certificate from the  President  or anyone else rush along to the industrial court, get an order against a union and then proceed to have that union fined and loaded with heavy costs. There was a great rash of these strikes and a great rash of proceedings under section 109 until the Commission itself realised that it had made an awful mistake in the award which had caused this trouble. That was the award in which the Commission attempted to say that the minimum wage would be the maximum wage by inviting employers to absorb over-award payments they had been making up till then in the rises that had then been given. Later that practice went by the board. The Government itself acknowledged that these penalty provisions were unworkable. In 1970 it introduced the present section 32a which provides for an investigation of the facts on their merits when a strike occurs and for penalties to be imposed only at the discretion of the court when all of these merits had been investigated and nothing else appeared able to be done. </para>
        <para>Under proposed new section 33 which will replace section 32a all discretion is taken away from the court and now the presidential member who is considering the matter is not entitled to refuse an application for a certificate to proceed for a penalty unless he believes that the strike is on the verge of settlement. That is not the way to settle disputes. I suggest that the Government must know, with the experience it has, that this is not the way to settle disputes. I suggest that the purpose of this new inflexibility in the Bill is not to settle disputes; it is purely electoral. This action has been taken in order to enable this Government to pose - it is not a pose that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> finds difficult to adopt if we can judge from the smirk that is now spreading across his face - as the tough law and order Government. It is a scheme which is designed to intimidate the unions in the general interests that the Government has in imposing a wage freeze. </para>
        <para>Another similar step is the revival of the hoary unworkable strike ballots. This is based on the idea that men on the job have nothing to do with strikes. It is said that men go on strike - and I heard this echoed again last night by none other than the pundit from Tasmania, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lillico</inline> - because of some wicked men up there in the union office who call them out on strike. One wonders how these men who do these things that are so contrary to the will of their members ever get to be re-elected. However, this is part of the mythology of this Government. It thinks that the cure is to have a strike ballot when men are talking about  a  strike because somehow or other this will get behind the backs of their wicked union officials. The Government ignores the evidence of history. It ignores the Donovan Report which investigated this matter in 1968 and which found that this sort of legislation is absolutely fruitless, especially in the case of short strikes, as are most strikes. How does one hold a ballot when men are out for a day, or a day and a half? </para>
        <para>In the United States and Canada it was found that when strike ballots were held the ballots overwhelmingly supported the strikes. Of course, once one held such  a  ballot and the men voted for it, what would be the result? One would have legitimised and extended the strike and made it more difficult to settle. I believe that this matter of strike ballots alone indicates either the total unreality of the Government&#39;s thinking, as instanced by the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lillico</inline> last night, or its total cynicism. I prefer to think that the second is the real explanation. I do not believe that the Government is silly enough to think that this system will work. This is just a bit of window dressing or grandstanding. I believe that the Government has no intention of trying to apply these provisions. I would remind the Government that provisions such as this have been in the Act for many years and have been available to this Government. However, those provisions have been used only 3 times since 1928. The new provisions will make almost no change in the existing provisions. Why has the Government put these provisions in the Bill? I believe it has done it so that it can say to the public: We are the law and order Government. We are going to have strike ballots&#39;. We say to the Government that it always had these provisions but has not used them. So this action is hypocrisy; it is a fraud. </para>
        <para>Another section of the Bill provides for the separation of conciliation and arbitration. I suggest to honourable senators that this is by far the most crass and pointless section of the Bill. Under the present system an arbitration commissioner takes over the conduct of a dispute. He gets the parties together and holds conferences. If they cannot settle, they proceed to arbitration. But it is the same man who is apprised of all the circumstances of the dispute. He has been with the parties attempting to knock their heads together. Of course all is not lost even when they go into arbitration. But under this scheme at a certain point after the conciliation commissioner - who is a completely separate individual, somebody from another planet compared to an arbitration commissioner - has failed to settle the matter he bows out and a different person altogether - the arbitration commissioner - takes over. In proposed new section 30 there is this curious and extraordinary provision which says that when  a  conciliation commissioner has bowed out of the proceedings he shall: </para>
        <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
          <item label=".">
            <para>. not disclose anything said or done in the conciliation proceedings concerning matters in dispute thai remain unsettled. </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para class="block">This provision really makes me rub my eyes. What a wasted effort. This trained man who has sat down with the parties, perhaps for days, who knows all about the case and who now has to bow out of it cannot make available to the new person who takes over the matter anything of what he has learnt. The new person has to start from scratch. Is this going to expedite the settlement of industrial disputes? This is part of what is alleged to be the streamlining of the Act but which, in reality, is merely word and rhetoric. This is certainly a far cry from the aim of the Act which is set out in section  2  and which is, among other things, the settlement of disputes with a minimum of form and technicality. How can we take seriously the claim of this Government that this is a Bill for the settlement of industrial disputes when it introduces this unnecessary complication, this absurd obfuscation, into the conciliation and arbitration process. </para>
        <para>I do not have time to deal in detail with the matter of amalgamations. I shall merely reiterate what I said earlier and that is that in reality this rs a code for the prevention of amalgamations. This flies in the face of the recommendations of employers who have stated that they prefer to deal with a large, powerful union rather than with a multiplicity of unions, because employers learn in the course of their experience that if they have to sit around with  15  unions instead of one the proceedings are going to be prolonged. Of course, as everybody also knows, it is the proliferation of many unions which is the real cause of the great number of demarcation disputes which account for some  11  per cent of the disputes which occur in this country in the course of a year. But in the face of all this, in the face of the obviously common sense tendency in the community to amalgamate, the Government has confronted unions which wish to amalgamate with what amounts to an obstacle race. I make bold to say that any unions which are prepared to embark on the perilous, difficult and complex matter of amalgamation in the light of this code are very brave indeed. We, in office, as one of our first steps in dealing with this Act will certainly remove these absurd and reactionary principles which are inserted in relation to amalgamations. </para>
        <para>Other incidental clauses in the Bill are almost breathtaking in their implications. One to which I shall refer just in passing is proposed new section  153a  which creates an all time high in the intervention of government into the affairs of a voluntary organisation. We will be dealing with this proposed new section at the Committee stage. Briefly, it deals with the obligations of unions to disclose all their banking arrangements in readiness for a pounce by the Government if and when it can impose the penalties and fines which, up to now, it has not been able to collect and which, I suggest, despite this legislation it still will not be able to collect. Also we will be proposing alterations to the Principal Act. The Minister has claimed that he has embarked on a total and detailed recasting of the Act. That invites us to look at some of the matters in the existing Act which we would like to have changed. I shall not embark on them at the moment because my time is running out but I shall sum up in the brief time which I have. There have been major amendments to this highly important Act, one of the most important that govern our affairs, in the years  1947, 1956, 1960  and  1970. </para>
        <para>In the past there has been some attempts - even though they may have been bumbling attempts - to deal with the problem of industrial relations. But this year all that we have from the Government is pure politics, the separation of conciliation and arbitration, the requirement that the Commission which, under the Constitution is charged merely with the settlement of industrial disputes, should take upon itself a consideration of the state of the national economy in the course of its deliberations, the widening of the role of the Full Bench - let us not forget that with a Full Bench, under the Act the Commonwealth has the right to intervene - and the closer scrutiny of industrial agreements. </para>
        <para>All this points to a concerted policy on the part of this Government to try to stem the trend to negotiate agreements, maximum intervention by the Government and to maximum pressure on the Commission in the direction of the real aim of this Government, which is to achieve a wage freeze. A wage freeze will not work in the absence of other measures, including price justification, tariff reform and amendment of the Trade Practices Act. By that I mean a real amendment and not the pale amendment that was foreshadowed by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Greenwood)</inline> today. In the absence of these broad, fiscal and monetary measures and measures directed to interest rates it is absolutely futile and whistling in the dark for the Government to imagine that it has any chance whatsoever to impose a wage freeze. We on this side dispute the continued claim we hear from the other side of the chamber that wages are the real cause of price increases. We believe, on the other hand, that wages are continually chasing prices. </para>
        <para>We believe that instead of making the Commission an instrument of industrial instability this Bill will merely drive outside the system the parties involved in industrial disputation or industrial discussion. In that way this Bill will not achieve what the Government claims it will achieve. It will achieve exactly the opposite. Its measures in relation to amalgamations will merely increase demarcation disputes. In that way this Bill will counter the Government&#39;s vaunted aim of minimising disputes. Its interference in voluntary organisations as expressed in proposed new section 153a, I suggest, will alarm similar voluntary organisations throughout the community. This Bill is a grandstanding attempt by the Government to show strength, but it really discloses only its weakness. It is a bad Bill. It is an insincere and irresponsible Bill. Above all, it will not work. It should be rejected by the Senate. </para>

          <para>-  Few, if any, of the Australian Labor Party speakers have mentioned, except by accident, the contents of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill or its impact upon the principal Act. Wtih respect, the previous <inline font-weight="bold">speaker, Senator James</inline> McClelland, strayed only occasionally towards the Bill or the Act. I think it is important to realise that the speeches of the Labor Opposition have all been characterised by the usual class war cliches, the bitterness, the invective, the cry of the Jeremiahs, that in debates on 51 separate amendments of this principal Act over 68 years have sprinkled the pages of Hansard and have been consistently proven wrong in practice. To bring this debate back to the Act and to the Bill I say to the Senate that the parent or principal Act is the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904- 1970. Beyond a doubt it is the most significant piece of social and industrial legislation on the Australian statute book. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The Conciliation and Arbitration Act has done more for the welfare of all Australians, particularly Australian employees, than has any other legislation.. The principal Act has a world-wide reputation. It is mentioned with admiration in text books throughout the world as a pacesetter in industrial reform. Against the background of that Act we must look to the amendments in this Bill. I point out with some restraint the origins of the principal Act so that honourable senators can interweave the provisions of the Bill in it. It is derived from an industrial power that was written into the Constitution after the fights of 2 great men whose names were well known afterwards - the one Higgins, who became the judge of the court; the other Charles Kingston, well known in South Australia. Indeed, in the words of Conciliation Commissioner Portus, this Act emerged from the disaster of the maritime and shearers strike of 1890. In his book, &#39;The Development of Trade Union Law&#39;, Portus says: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The development of arbitration can be summed up by stating that the maritime strike made people conscious of the necessity of government intervention in industrial disputes and the Labor movement for its own reasons were prepared to co-operate with non-Labor governments when they introduced the legislation. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I recall to the Senate the fact that governments of Liberal faith initiated this historic legislation, and it has been governments of Liberal faith which have nurtured it and developed it over the 68 years of its life. Every major criticism brought forward by the Labor Party has proven wrong in practice. The criticism levelled tonight, that this is repressive legislation, will go to the ashes as has previous criticism. The notion this is somewhat of a pugilistic arena was drawn upon by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Garran, the great authority on the Australian Constitution, who wrote in 1930 that in the first 25 years of federation the Commonwealth industrial power played a greater part in political history and legal controversy than did the rest of the Constitution put together. A similar comment would have been justifiable covering the subsequent 46 years of Federation had <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> lived that long. </para>
        <para>Attempts to amend the Act by referenda have failed some 6 times. By bestowing this power, governments of Liberal faith gave the trade unions their chance to establish themselves firmly. We proudly acknowledge that governments of our faith gave the trade unions the chance to grow, to be vigorous, and to take part in authentic industrial agitation. Indeed, it gave rise to the arbitration system which, as did the trade union movement, led the world in such industrial achievements as the famous Harvester case, which developed the basic wage, and the fixation of working hours, standards of work, long service leave, sick leave and margins for skill. </para>

I commend this thought to the electorate for the future. I intend to make my own speech with no help from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges,</inline> who is seeking to interject. If he has any ideas that he thinks might be helpful, he will be able to put them to the Senate later. History will speak for itself. History will speak for the fact that under a Liberal administration, trade unions in Australia grew strong and developed faster than did unions in any other country - faster than in Britain and in the United States of America.

            <para>- I will read the details of the Bill for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop&#39;s</inline> edification. Because of that background, inside those 68 years Australia developed as a country with the greatest sharing of production and incomes of any country in the world. Labor supporters are tender on that score and are inclined to quote from Professor Henderson. I draw attention to the book &#39;Poverty in Melbourne&#39; in which Professor Henderson says that Australia has the lowest poverty rate in the world primarily because we have the greatest sharing of incomes of any country in the world. Let Labor senators squeal, but the facts cannot be denied. They are seeking to knock this Bill tonight, but the principal Act has done more for the people of Australia than has any other piece of legislation. I repeat that it has been a pace setter in social and industrial reform throughout the world. </para>

            <para>- Yes, I shall. Since I have been told that this legislation does not relate to reforms, I would like to mention the major reforms contained in the Bill. The Bill has some 9 clauses or groups of clauses that seek to add further protections to unionists at the grass roots. Let Labor senators laugh. The Labor Party concept of a trade union is an organisation that seeks power for the trade union boss and no freedom for those people at the grass roots. When I hear Labor senators plead in this chamber for the freedom of the ordinary trade unionist, my heart will be glad. In truth, the only people, the only parties and the only governments that have written protection of the workers into these Acts - not protection of bureaucrats - have been of the same political complexion as have honourable senators on this side. The Bill contains 9 major provisions relating to unproved conditions for the workers. Clause 6 strengthens the protection of workers and members against loss of employment, should they be officials or intending to be officials or should they be witnesses, about to become witnesses or likely to be witnesses. </para>

We take our pleasures sadly, do we not? Do honourable senators opposite deny that that is a first class reform? Does anyone in the Labor Party say that it is not good? Why is it that there has been abysmal silence in this matter? Clauses 33 and 34 extend the powers of inspectors in terms of the rights of entry to premises outside ordinary working hours.

Clause 45 and clause 46 make provision for procedures when the rules of an organisation are contravened and for the performance of those rules. Is that bad? Clause 47 provides for financial assistance for members under section 140 and section 141 of the principal Act in seeking legal costs. Does any member of the Opposition say that that is not the extension of a valuable democratic right to a trade union member? If he does, let him rise to his feet and say so. Clause 49 covers rules regarding the resignation of membership. Clause 52 provides for an official inquiry into alleged irregularities in elections. Do not those 9 collective reforms add up to a valuable widening of the rights and protections of unionists at the grass roots? </para>

        <para>Having said that, let me test these points. Not one of the speakers on the Opposition side has referred to this or to the enormously valuable steps that will be taken to help to strengthen authentic industrial unionism. By that the Bill is measured. Secondly, and without help from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner</inline> who has spoken already and who is trying to interject - indeed his speech was not helpful - this Bill aims to reform the conciliation and arbitration processes so that by those reforms we get a speedy, more effective, more flexible and more responsive kind of approach for the settlement of disputes quickly at the grass roots. It is a response through specialised understanding. </para>

This measure has 6 main provisions. It separates conciliation and arbitration functions so that the same commissioner docs not sit as Caesar appealing to Caesar. Does anyone doubt that this ls right? The trade union movement has asked for it. The second provision is the reconstitution of the Commission to provide for an unspecified number of commissioners with a retiring age of 65. Do we argue about that provision? The third point in this provision is that  deputy  presidents need not be lawyers but may be people of particular qualifications. Is that wrong? Is it not sensible? The fourth provision is a key one. This is the establishment of task forces by the Full Bench, each with a  deputy president  and at least one conciliation and arbitration commissioner, taking industries or groups of industries and being responsive immediately. Was there a mention of this provision? Was there a commendation of it? The fifth provision is that before ratifying a consent award the commission must take into account the public interest and the commission must note the economic consequences of its actions. Here is another basic provision. The sixth provision is that when an application is made for the insertion of a bans clause the primary duty of the presidential member is to bring the conduct to a cessation at that point. These are major points which should have been debated. Then there is the provision iin respect of amalgamations. Though some loose rules exist, the Act now does not provide for amalgamations in any regular form. The present Bill seeks to correct that situation. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>What is the nub of this legislation? The nub is that, ever since arbitration has existed, the Labor Party has taken an ambivalent view of arbitration. It has sought the privileges of arbitration. It has wanted the protections ofarbitraion against employers. It has wanted employers to be punished. But it will not have a bar of the acceptance of responsibility for enforcing behaviour upon itself. I think it was Disraeli who said that the newspapers of his day were like the courtesans of old, seeking absolute power with no responsibility. The Labor Party in its approach to arbitration has been perennially an industrial courtesan. Here is the ambivalence of its attitude. It wants the privileges but it wants to hop under the fence into the industrial jungle. The fact of the matter is this: The Labor Party is trying to move out of the field of arbitration and into the field of collective bargaining despite the fact that the whole history of collective bargaining throughout the world has these 5 major criticisms: The first is that under collective bargaining strikes are invariably much longer, more widespread and generally national in impact. The second criticism is that collective bargaining favours big industries which can meet its terms. It is highly destructive of small industries. In Australia, 90 per cent of all our industries have 50 employees or fewer. So collective bargaining will wipe out small industries. This is the Labor Party which claims that it is out to help the small man. In fact it is out to create industrial monopoly. </para>
        <para>The third criticism of collective bargaining - and this is important - is that no method has been devised to enforce the bargain when it is made. The fourth criticism is that collective bargaining destroys the small trade unions and promotes the large trade unions. Australia has 305 trade unions of which 198, or 65 per cent, have fewer than 2,000 members. I hope that we will nurture the small unions which have done a first class job. The final criticism is that collective bargaining by its insistence on numbers tends to ignore those with skill. The skilled are swamped by the unskilled and the margins for skill dwindle. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland set out to show by figures from the International Labour Organisation that the man-days lost in Australia in the period 1965 to 1969 were fewer by far than the man-days lost in Canada, the United States of America and Italy. In so doing, the honourable senator was inadvertently condemning collective bargaining and praising arbitration because it is the arbitration system in Australia and the system of collective bargaining elsewhere that have created this situation. </para>
        <para>The second main challenge by the Labor Party is to sanctions or penalties, lt is a strange thing that this challenge should be made by the Labor Party because all of its great leaders whom it reveres and sanctifies - I go along with their being so regarded - have stressed the importance of the maintenance of sanctions. They have stressed the importance of sanctions as being imperative to arbitration. I mention a former Premier of New South Wales, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cahill.</inline> He is revered, and rightly. </para>

Let the </para>
        <para class="block">Opposition deny that in a public statement in October last they sought to penalise individual trade unionists $20 for breaches of a law. Need I remind the Opposition how the Australian Council of Trade Unions asked its executive to look for ways of enforcement. No law can be enforced unless it has proper penalties in it. I do not stand for punitive action at all. I believe that penalties should be the last resort and they have been. In every other sort of law, whether criminal or civil, the power of the arbitral authority or the court must be related to the calling of witnesses and of evidence and to compelling people to appear and give evidence. Let me make this clear: Unless an arbitral authority acting, as it does, as the community and for the community, can say to the employer if he is in the wrong: &#39;You will stop your lock out while I hear this matter&#39; or say to the employee: &#39;You will stop your strikes&#39;, what we have is community blackmail because no judicial authority can be placed under pressure and duress of lockout or strike in order to force it to give a judgment it would not otherwise have given. Nobody in the community would accept otherwise. The dilemma throughout the world is how to enforce agreements when made. </para>
        <para>I have spoken basically about the contents of this Bill the generality of which I approve and commend fully to the Senate. Despite the jeremiahs it will strengthen enormously in the interests of trade union workers at the grass roots their conditions of work and this Government to which I proudly belong will work towards that end. A great deal of slang-whanging about what causes inflation has been engaged in. I do not want to blame any one person or any one group for this. This community has a habit of committing industrial hara-kiri. The Conciliation and Arbitration Act cannot of itself be a panacea to solve our present problem - a universal one - of inflation. It can go some way towards it and I want to talk in my remaining few minutes of that. The Act must work hand in hand with a number of handmaidens and one which I welcome is the Trade Practices Act. It is working in England and will work here. Another is the sensible use of tariffs so that they provide and protect employment but at the same time do not allow excess prices due to unused tariffs. Yet another is a progressive taxation scale. </para>
        <para>When I made my maiden speech in this House I stood here not representing either employees or employers. I felt that honourable senators represented the community as a whole. I said that I rejected the class war and I do now. I do not believe in the concept that the employer is out on the make entirely to give the employee as little as possible or that the employee is out to do as little as possible for as much as possible. There is no doubt in this world that the only way an employer can be prosperous is to have prosperous employees, and they are the working section of the community. There is no doubt at all that the only way in which the employee can have a higher wage is to get costs down and production up. Consequently increased productivity is the twin goal of both sides.  1  hope that we will have no more in this chamber or elsewhere of these shibboleths of the class war. </para>
        <para>This legislation has a world wide reputation and other countries look to it with envy and admiration. They are seeking to adopt it because they know that it gives more to the employees than any other form of legislation. Until  3  years ago - and I pay this tribute - the industrial leadership of this country for the  17  years before that was by a great Australian, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Alfred</inline> Monk, who understood the difference between authentic industrial unionism and political unionism which exploits the worker. In that  17  years we had a high level of industrial peace and the lowest rise in industrial costs of any industrialised country. </para>

He seems always to know more of the sub-rose things than I do. Nobody has ever heard me on my feet or in writing attack the ACTU or even <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> or authentic trade unionism. I am as strong an advocate as anybody in this place for trade unionism. We had a miraculous run of  17  years of great peace, sharing and prosperity. It was better than it was anywhere else in the world. When the trade union movement moved towards the left and towards political unionism it did a grave disservice to its own people and the people generally of Australia. This Bill still cannot work purely as a piece of legislation unless the hearts and minds of all people are behind it. I make the plea to the grass roots trade unions of this country to look towards industrial unionism rather than the anarchy of political unionism. </para>

          <para>-  We are considering the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill and what was just said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> is significant. He said that the legislation would work only if the hearts and minds of people were entirely behind it. The hearts and minds of the people are not behind these amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act because the people think that the amendments are not genuine, and they are not genuine. They know, for example, that the . provisions relating to amalgamations are: not genuine because the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> only a few weeks ago exploded the basis upon which these amendments are now brought in. They are brought in as a result of political pressures of which the Government ought to be ashamed. The Bill has  2  main aspects, the first of which is that it deals with the procedures of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in general. Those procedures are being juggled about in some endeavour to prevent flow-ons and to prevent real wage justice being done throughout the community. I think that the proposed new procedures will have very little general effect on the movement in wages and the improvement in conditions because those matters will be determined largely by economic pressures. They will have some effect, namely, in creating injustices in relation to small unions and groups which cannot really cope with these procedural difficulties which are being created by the Government. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The second aspect of the Bill - this is the main aspect - is that it contains provisions which worsen the situation of trade unions. That is a very important aspect of this Bill. Perhaps in its long term effect those provisions will be the most significant aspect of this Bill. What the Government has done here is to introduce  by way of the Bill and the Act, as it would be amended by this Bill, a blueprint for dealing with corporations. This Act, as it would be amended, deals with the corporate structure of trade unions. It deals with the internal affairs of trade unions in a way that will produce interference which. I think, is unprecedented throughout the civilised world. </para>
        <para>I stated earlier that the trade unions are dealt with as corporations under this legislation. My suggestion that this Bill was a blueprint for dealing with corporations was regarded as being incorrect. In fact, I was challenged by a Government senator to state in this Senate that the trade unions were corporations under the provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. I was somewhat astonished at that suggestion especially since it was said that Government senators  -  I find it difficult to believe that the Government itself would be proceeding on the basis that trade unions, although registered organisations, were not corporations - apparently had been advised that trade unions were not corporations. That is an astonishing suggestion. </para>

Let me dispose of this extremely important matter.

            <para>- If the honourable senator who interjected will look again, he will find that these corporations are capable of engaging in business, of owning newspapers and of doing all sorts of things, apart altogether from engaging in the settling of industrial disputes. It ought to dawn even on Government senators that, if it is provided that this kind of interference can be engaged in in relation to corporate bodies which happen to be trade unions, then it can be engaged in in relation to corporate bodies which happen not to be trade unions. If there is provision for interference which is contrary to what was slated in the International Labour Organisation conventions and contrary to what has been set out as to what ought to be the rights of trade unions, if we are to have judicial decisions which interfere drastically with the affairs of trade unions and which allow no appeal to anybody, and if we are to have an amount of interference by administrative bodies such as we have in this Act and especially in the amendments which are being proposed by the Government, does anyone think it will stop there? I am astonished that Government senators have not been told what the position is, namely, that we are dealing with corporations and that the provisions of the Bill provide a blueprint for future governments as to legislation dealing with the rights of corporations and with corporation mergers. </para>

        <para>What are these amalgamation provisions? Do honourable senators opposite think it would be very difficult for someone to say that these provisions should be adapted to deal with mergers of other corporations? Members of the Government and its supporters have been dealing with this legislation without even knowing its implications. It is time that some thought was given to what the Government is doing to these corporations. Leave aside the idea that it is very nice and convenient to engage in the bashing of trade unions. </para>

          <para>- 1 apologise for speaking again on the motion for the adjournment of the Senate but if honourable senators want to blame anyone they should blame the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Greenwood)</inline> and Ministers who refuse to answer questions. T am getting sick and tired of asking questions in this chamber and having them evaded by Ministers. It is extremely difficult under our system of conducting question time to ask supplementary questions in order to try to prise out of a Minister the answers that one requires. I am referring not only to the Attorney-General because any Minister who does not want to answer a question just waffles on and leaves one in the position of having to seek further information. Today, I must admit, I got into a bit of strife trying to clear up a question that I asked the Attorney-General yesterday. He failed to answer the vital part of my question. In order to get an answer I got involved in a long garrulous speech. But this is the point: He did not bother trying to answer the question that he failed to answer on the previous occasion. </para>

        <para>In this chamber in the last few weeks we have heard 2 arguments on the question of draft resisters. The Opposition side has said that warrants against draft resisters have been issued on a selective basis. The Attorney-General has said that this is not true. I wanted to find out who was telling the truth. Either the Attorney-General was telling the truth or he was lying. </para>

            <para>- Or he was deceiving this chamber, or deceiving the public. The same applies to members of the Opposition: They were telling the truth or they were deceiving us by saying that warrants had been issued against all draft resisters. That was the inference I gathered as an individual listening to both sides of the argument. As far as I can gather from the remarks of the Attorney-General on the question of draft resisters, there has been no selection of people who have resisted the draft and that summonses or warrants have been issued against all of them. That is the impression I got. However, I was becoming confused so I asked the Attorney-General a question. I asked him how many people were draft resisters and against how many had warrants been issued? I did that in order to clear the matter up. But Ministers have got so touchy about political matters that they cannot believe that question can be asked purely for the sake of getting information. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>I am not taking sides on this issue and I was not taking sides; I wanted to know who was right. I was told that I was garrulous in asking my question but I notice that it took up 13 lines in Hansard while the Attorney-General&#39;s answer took up about 60 or 70 lines. I presume that he is more garrulous than I. Nevertheless, he went on to say that there are 3 classes of draft resisters. I do not care how many there are. If people do not register they are draft resisters. If they do not attend call-ups for medical examination they are draft resisters. If they do not answer the call-up they are draft resisters. The Attorney-General classified them into 3 and pointed out &#60;my ignorance. All right, I am happy to be ignorant. He went on to say that 2 per cent of the people who should have registered failed to register. Well, 2 per cent sounds as if it is nothing. It sounds like a figure that is so small that it is insignificant. But when we realise that 2 per cent refers to 14,000 people - that 14,000 people have failed to register - that is a significant number. Against how many of those people have summonses been issued? The Senate did not hear an answer to that question. If the Attorney-General has been condemning the Opposition and saying that it is a fantasy on its part that warrants are not being issued against people, he should know the exact numbers. </para>
        <para class="block">He should have the figures in his head. He should know how many there are. How can he deny statements by the Opposition when he cannot answer that question? I presume he knows the answer but is not telling. </para>
        <para>The Attorney-General went on to say that 147,000 people had been required to attend medical examinations and that only 0.3 failed to attend. Again, 0.3 per cent sounds like a very significant number but what happens when we work it out? I think I might give the Attorney-General an abacus; it would help him. There were 441 people who failed to attend for medical examination. What has happened to those people? Were warrants issued for every one of those people? That is something I want to know. Why cannot the Attorney-General tell us? It is his Department that issues the warrants. I apparently asked the wrong Minister about the numbers because that matter is dealt with by the Department of Labour and National Service. However, the Attorney-General obtained the information for me. </para>
        <para>Finally, the Attorney-General went on to say that 0.2 per cent, or 2 in every 1,000, did not respond to call-up notices. Now, 0.2 per cent is a very small percentage but in figures it means that 110 failed to respond. The Attorney-General went on to say that only 20 warrants were outstanding for persons who had failed to appear in court to answer summonses either for failing to attend a medical examination or for failing to obey a call-up notice. There are 551 persons in those 2 groups - those who failed to attend for medical examination or failed to respond to their call-up notices. How many of those people have had warrants issued against them? This is what I am trying to find out. The Government cannot accuse the Opposition of having fantasies when it cannot tell us the numbers. </para>
        <para>I cannot follow these figures. I am a simple person. In regard to the 551 people involved, there are 20 warrants outstanding. Does this mean that warrants have been issued against 531 people? If they have not been issued, why have they not? Warrants cannot be issued on a selective basis. TJ the Government believes that these people have resisted the draft or dodged it - call it what you like - then it should have issued warrants for their arrest. Have they been apprehended or not? That is all I want to know. J do not care which way the matter goes at the moment but I want to know whether we can get some figures. I want to ask the Attorney-General specific questions and I ask him to please answer them specifically. My questions are: Against how many of the 14,000 persons who failed to register have warrants been issued? Against how many of the 441 people who failed to attend for medical examination have warrants been issued? Against how many of the 110 people who failed to respond to their call-up notices have warrants been issued? Finally, out of all those, how many have been apprehended? If the Senate were given those figures we could clear up this argument that has been going on for weeks between the Attorney-General and members of the Opposition. </para>

            <para>- Well, there should be a simple answer. The Attorney-General&#39;s Department issues the warrants and he must know. He has no right to deceive us, if he has been deceiving us, and he now has the opportunity to show us that he has the figures and that he knows exactly what has been going on in his own Department. I am getting sick and tired of this attitude and just because someone stands to ask a question the question obviously is political and should be sneered at but not answered. </para>

I propose to answer this matter in very low key simply by reading into the record of this Parliament 3 Press reports which appeared in the Geelong &#39;Advertiser&#39;. From my own information of this dispute I believe these reports to be a reasonably accurate description of what has occurred. In his question this morning <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hannan</inline> stated that the captain of this Russian ship had refused to comply with the conditions of labour in this country and had failed to co-operate with the trade union movement. This was the tenor of his question. It was a complete misrepresentation of what has happened in this matter. Without any further comment I propose to read into the record 3 statements that have appeared in the Geelong &#39;Advertiser&#39; appertaining to this matter. The first was on 1 8th May 1972, which was last Thursday. The headline is: </para>

It was a misunderstanding that was cleared up very quickly by the Melbourne Trades Hall Council in association with the unions concerned and the master of this ship. It was a misunderstanding that I believe could occur in relation to any foreign ship that may come into any port of the Commonwealth on a first occasion. The matter has been satisfactorily settled. There was no major dispute on a political or any other basis in relation to this matter. It lasted a very short time. When proper negotiations and discussions took place between the parties concerned it was resolved very quickly and amicably to everybody&#39;s satisfaction.

          <para>- In addressing my remarks to the Queensland Grant Bill 1972 on Tuesday, 16th May 1972, 1 made reference to the millions of dollars turnover in Queensland in the gambling sports. I mentioned that now Queensland is a claimant State if a move by a cartel of bookmakers to take over the gambling business in Queensland was not investigated and cleaned up, the State could lose millions of dollars in the way of turnover tax, plus the fact that being a claimant State, Queensland is now subject to budgetary restrictions and auditing procedures by the Commonwealth Treasury which would place Queensland in a bad light. In presenting that story I made certain claims. Subsequently, Press statements have been made by one of the gentlemen to whom I referred, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Stan</inline> Sheldon,  President  of the Queensland Bookmakers Council, to the effect that his </para>

        <para class="block">Council is beyond reproach, that it has the support of 10 organisations and that the claims that 1 made were untrue and unfounded. People who have known me for any length of time know that I do not go off half cocked. I have in my possession this evening 9 documents which I will itemise and then ask for leave of the Senate to have incorporated in Hansard so that people reading Hansard will be able to decide the matter for themselves. They are documents which will fully substantiate the claims which I made in my address on 16th May. I shall list briefly the 9 documents, they are:  1, A list o&#163; bookmakers associations recognised by the Queensland Bookmakers Council and showing the large scale resignations in each instance;  2,  Letters from the Queensland Bookmakers Council intimating that all bookmakers had to join the Council and that only upon joining could they expect to become licensed bookmakers; 3, A circular sent to all members of their association by the North Queensland Racing Association bookmakers; 4, A second circular sent to all members of their association by the North Queensland Racing Association bookmakers; 5, A list of individual resignations from the Queensland Bookmakers Council by north Queensland bookmakers; 6. A petition sent to the  Hon.  the Minister in charge of Racing, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Gordon</inline> Chalk, K.B.E., by the Licensed North Queensland Racing Association Bookmakers protesting against the action and attitude of the Queensland Bookmakers Council; 7. Comment on the Queensland Bookmakers Council in the Cairns &#39;Post&#39; of 14th January 1972; 8, A letter from the Mackay Bookmakers Association to the North Queensland Racing Association protesting about being forced or bound in any way to  join the Queensland Bookmakers Council; 9, A new document - a statement of receipts and payments for the period from 1st October 1969 to 31st October 1971, duly audited by B. M. Scott, public accountant, and showing an amount of $4,000 in a fighting fund. Bookmakers  are upset and concerned that details regarding the fighting fund are not available and they that feel pandemonium would be let loose if particulars regarding the $4,000 were made public. 1 must admit that an extraordinary situation exists and has been allowed to continue by the officers of the Queensland Bookmakers Council not doing everything humanly possible to explain the item in their balance sheet when they have had so many requests to do so. I believe that it is the duty of the Minister in charge of Racing in Queensland, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Gordon</inline> Chalk, to tell the bookmakers the story about the $4,000 if the Queensland Bookmakers Council will not. I ask for leave of the Senate to have these documents incorporated in Hansard. </para>

            <para>- 1 regret that my remark might have sounded out of place, but as far as I am concerned, when matters of this nature are raised the Attorney-General consistently refuses leave for any documents to be incorporated. To the best of my knowledge, the term that I used was certainly not unparliamentary. It might have had some overtones. I would think that if any body were offended it was the Attorney-General. I do not know where the Minister for Works <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wright)</inline> comes into the argument. As I fee&#93; that I have not said anything offensive, I decline to withdraw. </para>

        <para>Dear Sir,</para>
        <para>As you may have heard there is a scheme afoot led by a few Brisbane Bookmakers who call themselves the Queensland Bookmakers Council to take $1,000 from each of us plus $25 per year to guarantee us. This sudden desire to guarantee us comes not from the Government or theNQRA but from the Queensland Bookmakers Council which is trying to tell us they have been instructed by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Gordon</inline> Chalk to do so. This is a deliberate lie and in the new Racing and Betting Act Amendment Act they do not get a mention, the act says the Minister may enter into an agreement with a (any) Bookmakers Bond Guarantee Fund. So beware of this trap and send no money to them and do not join their Association. The Townsville and District Bookmakers Association, the Mackay Bookmakers Association have sent letters of protest about this Queensland Bookmakers Council to the Minister and NQRA, the Mount Isa Bookmakers Association have resigned from it. </para>
        <para>A copy of the petition which we have signed, about 80 Bookmakers from Townsville, Ingham, Ayr, innisfail, Cairns, Mareeba, Atherton Tablelands, Mackay and Mount Isa, is enclosed herewith and in the interests, of us all you should sign it and post to the Minister for Racing, <inline font-weight="bold">Hon. Sir Gordon</inline> Chalk, K.B.E., Parliament House, Brisbane, or send signed letter to P.O. Box 132, Hermit Park, for inclusion with original petition being set shortly. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>At a meeting of the Townsville and District Bookmakers Association on 7th February 1972, a motion was passed by an overwhelming majority that when the question of guarantees arised, that we have a choice as to how we wish to be guaranteed and no pressure be brought to bear on any licensee to join any particular body. A letter to the NQRA and also one to the Minister for Racing, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Gordon</inline> Chalk was to be sent. Also money which was about to be sent to the Queensland Bookmaker&#39;s Council was withheld. This clearly indicates that Northern Bookmakers are suspicious of the whole set up and propaganda of the Queensland Bookmakers Council. This body through the press and by two expense paid propaganda tours to the North has been telling everyone that it is law and compulsory to give them $1,000 and $25 membership fees with the threat of not being granted a licence in the coming year. </para>
            <para>This is a deliberate falsehood and in the recently passed &#39;Racing and Betting Act Amendment Act&#39; the Queensland Bookmakers Council is not even mentioned! This is the most blatant and obnoxious attempt to frighten licensees into giving $1,025 to a few organised schemers who want $700,000 plus 700 $25&#39;s per year subscription from the Queensland Bookmakers. </para>
            <para>If anyone in his right mind wants to give then $1,000 plus $25 each year let him do so but the same amount given to the mafia would bear as much return or security. </para>
            <para>There are a very few brainwashed propagandists for this organisation still lobbying for it up here but do not be fooled by them. The only reason for suggesting the amount of $5,000 (personal) is to come in to line with the new Greyhound Board&#39;s requirements which has Government sanction and equals the amount of guarantees of the Queensland Bookmakers Council. There is not much doubt which choice we will make, the Fidelity Bond now in operation with the Trotting Board. Think for yourself, or reflect on the legal opinion obtained on 9th February 1972, of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr W.</inline> Gillman, Solicitor of Dean Gillman and Thompson, of Townsville, who stated: </para>
            <para>It is my opinion that a bookmaker licensed by the NQRA is not bound, nor is he under any obligation to become a member of a bookmakers association or of the Queensland Bookmakers Council. If Bookmakers licensed by the NQRA wish to dissociate themselves from any agreement made by the Council or their Association, then they should resign from that Council or their Association.&#39; </para>

            <para>Dear Sir,</para>
            <para>We the undersigned, The North Queensland Bookmakers, do hereby formally request that in the matter of guarantees to be required in the near future, you extend to us the privilege of a choice in (a) Cash Deposit of $5,000.00 to be held by NQRA; (b) a Fidelity Bond Guarantee to the value of $5,000.00; or (c) a Bookmakers Guarantee Bond in accordance with the Provisions of Section 104 of Racing and Betting Act (No. 2) 1972, similar to the Greyhound Racing Control Board requirements. </para>
            <para>The Queensland Bookmakers Council, which is most unpopular amongst the NQRA Bookmakers and has no support whatever from any of the undersigned, who feel that their best interests would not be served by being members of the said body. </para>
            <para>We therefore feel that no pressure should be brought to bear on any Bookmaker to join the Queensland Bookmakers Council provided he is adequately guaranteed by Fidelity Bond or otherwise to the satisfaction of the Government, and the ruling body, The North Queensland Racing Association. </para>
            <para>At a meeting of The Townsville and District Bookmakers Association comprising A, B and C class licensees, held on 7th Fberuary 1972, a motion was passed by an overwhelming majority that a similar request be made to you and the NQRA, and at a meeting at Mt Isa of the Mt Isa Bookmakers Association they resigned from the Quensland Bookmakers Council. </para>

            <para>More than 40 Far North bookmakers have sent off a petition to appropriate authorities as a protest against  a  Betting and Gaming Act amendment which comes into operation in Queensland this year. </para>
            <para>The amendment calls for all registered bookmakers in the State to lodge $1,000 cash each with the Queensland Bookmakers Council before March  31 as  a guarantee against defaultment </para>
            <para>This in addition to having to pay premiums on a $5,000 fidelity bond each. </para>
            <para>Bookies have been told that unless they pay the money the QBC will advise the appropriate racing authority - in our case the NQRA - not to license the offender. </para>
            <para>The bookmakers will get 4 per cent a year interest on their money and will not be refunded the $1,000 until they retire from fielding. </para>
            <para>Copies of the petition have been sent to the QBC, NQRA and the Minister for Racing, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Gordon</inline> Chalk. </para>
            <para>Almost all Far North bookies have signed. </para>
            <para>They argue that the fidelity bond is sufficient to guard racing against a bookmaker defaulting. </para>
            <para>Many of them also want to know what will happen to the other 4 per cent as their capital is sure to be loaned out at no less than 7&#189; or 8 per cent. </para>
            <para>With close to 700 registered bookies in Queensland you don&#39;t need to be an Einstein to work out that there will be close to $28,000 in kitty once the bookmakers are paid their annual interest. </para>
            <para>It seems inequitable that a bookie in a remote country area who fields only six or eight times a year has to pay the same amount as a Brisbane man who stands up three times a week. </para>
            <para>That may be an extreme comparison even though the circumstances do exist. </para>
            <para>On the other hand it is hardly right that a Cairns fielder who holds little more than $1,000 a meeting should pay the same as a Brisbane paddock bookmaker who would hold 10 times that amount ON ONE RACE! </para>
            <para>Report</para>
            <para>Another point local men are objecting to is a report some time ago that the QBC made the proposal to the Minister for Racing that the $1,000 guarantee be instituted. </para>
            <para>It was supposed to have been a unanimous decision of all Queensland bookies,&#39; a local fielder told me yesterday, &#39;but most of us in the Far North knew nothing about it until it became law.&#39; </para>
            <para>There is no doubt another side of the story but I - and dozens of Far North bookmakers - would like to hear about it. </para>
            <para>Whatever the outcome of the whole business, the $1,000 guarantee threatens to sound the death knell for the small operator who has a bank of only about $2,000 to $3,000 to work on. </para>

        <para>Document No. 8 is over the signature of the North Queensland Racing Association bookmakers. The address is 149 Goldsmith Street, Mackay. It is dated 16th February 1972 and it is addressed to the Secretary of the North Queensland Racing Association, Townsville. It states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Dear Sir,</para>
            <para>I have been instructed by my Association to acquaint you of a resolution which was moved and passed by unanimous vote of all members at a meeting of Mackay Bookmakers Association held on 15th February, 1972. </para>
            <para>The resolution moved was as follows - </para>
            <para>That the NQRA and Minister for Racing, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Gordon</inline> Chalk be informed that Mackay Bookmakers Association reject any proposal that they be bound to join the Queensland Bookmakers Council, and that further in regard to any proposed Fidelity Bondage required of Bookmakers, that they also be allowed  a  choice of where the Bond be obtained from, either as  a  body or individually, providing, of course what such Bond be in accordance with any provisions set down at Government level.&#39; </para>
            <para>In effect our proposal simply requires that we be allowed the choice of obtaining any required Fidelity Bond from  a  suitable source, (e.g. The type of Bond already required by Queensland Trotting Board) rather than be forced to join the Queensland Bookmakers Council and in turn be obligated to that Council only. </para>
            <para>To the very best of local knowledge, we feel that it can honestly be stated that to date, and particularly since lie introduction of Turn-Over Tax, there has never been one single case of any Bookmaker from Mackay area having ever defaulted in payment of Turn-Over Tax, whereas such would not appear to be the case in so far as Brisbane is concerned. </para>
            <para>Therefore our Association members are very reluctant and apprehensive at the possibility that we should have to help shoulder the burden of responsibility by being forced or bound in any way to join the Queensland Bookmakers Council without being given the free choice of obtaining alternative means of coverage. </para>

They will be there now for everybody to see and to judge. 1 hope that if it does nothing else, it will allow decency to come to the surface. I will be awaiting an explanation, which I have sought tonight, of the $4,000 for the fighting fund. If the Queensland Bookmakers Council is not willing to give the information in response to a request by its members, I think it is the duty of the Minister in charge of racing in Queensland, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Gordon</inline> Chalk, to tell us about it. Nobody should know better than he, as Minister, who got the $4,000. I made my case last Tuesday week. I must say that as a new senator I am very disappointed in the attitude that was adopted in the chamber this evening. Since I have been here, I have endeavoured to fight hard and fairly. I have tried to support with documented evidence everything I have put forward in this chamber, but when I made my speech on the Queensland Grant Bill last Tuesday week I did not have that evidence. I received it as a result of statements made to the Press. </para>

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> 1 suggest that it would be wrong for the Senate to carry a motion of this nature at this stage having regard to the antics that have gone on in this chamber at such a late hour of the night on the part of 2 Government Ministers. After numerous attempts by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McAuliffe</inline> to see sanity, common sense and reason prevail in this chamber by seeking to have a multiplicity of documents incorporated in Hansard, as though they were Flanagan and Allen the 2 Ministers joined in the chorus: No, no, a thousand times no&#39;. This was after <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McAuliffe</inline> at the outset of his remarks had offered to table all of the documents from which he was made to read verbatim. Frankly, I regard this motion as an insult to a colleague of mine who at a late hour of the evening wanted genuinely to present a case and who had every obstacle put in his way by 2 Ministers. As far as I am personally concerned, believing it would be an affront to my colleague, I object to the motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> after my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McAuliffe,</inline> has gone to the tedious, long and exhausting task of reading every word in these documents which could well have been tabled or indeed incorporated in Hansard in half a second&#39;s time. I oppose the motion. </para>

              <para>- Secondly, with respect to the incorporation in Hansard of matters for which leave is asked it is the duly of this Senate to consider the appropriateness of those documents becoming the contents of the record of the Senate. That involves a consideration of their length and their substance. Having heard these documents read,  1  believe that they represent a most cowardly attack attracting the privilege of this Senate, attempting to defame and to accuse a Minister of the Crown in the State Parliament of Queensland, who is not represented here and who has no opportunity to brief any Minister or member of this place. For me to give consent to that sort of material being incorporated in Hansard would lead me to regard myself as a most cowardly ally to any Minister of the Crown so accused. For a pipsqueaking statement to be made that the refusal of leave is a matter of antics is something that excites my anger. </para>

            <para>- I speak on the motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> seeking the tabling of the documents. I do so because I believe the tabling of the documents lacks value. At the last minute, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> thought that he had to back up his colleagues by some move or other. They had consistently refused to permit the incorporation in Hansard of the documents. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> was off the stage and not in the limelight. Because of this, he wanted to get into the play and moved for the tabling of the documents. What is the value of tabling these documents which will be published tomorrow in Hansard where everyone can read them? The motion for the tabling of the documents, if successful, would have no benefit other than to give some justification for what the  2  Ministers have done in the course of this evening&#39;s adjournment debate and to give some support to those Ministers in the reason that they advanced for corrupting the normal procedures which are followed here in an adjournment debate. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Opposition has taken the attitude that, if members of the Government wish to play, it is prepared to stay here and carry on this act. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> you have my sympathy in that you must preside over a chamber in which such Ministers for no reason at all, despite what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> has said, refuse to an honourable senator the right to obtain leave to incorporate in Hansard documents which he could and did get in by reading those documents. The Ministers and honourable senators forget occasions when, by consent of the Opposition, the Government is given leave to incorporate in Hansard material including second reading speeches which should never be so incorporated. Therefore  1  say that it cannot be expected that the co-operation which has been given in the past for the inclusion of documents in Hansard will continue in the future. </para>

              <para>- I do not know whether it should be extended beyond the  2  Ministers. They are part of the Government which uses no means to discipline its Ministers for action in this House which to my mind is disorderly. The Government should take some action against the Ministers who should be held wholly responsible for what has occurred. I do not know whether there is some jealousy between Ministers but we get behaviour like this at a time when the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson)</inline> is not here which we do not get when he is here. Whether it is done to try to show up some junior Minister who has been promoted over someone else I do not know. However, we have an attempt on this occasion to discredit <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McAuliffe</inline> who was placing before Parliament what he thought was a genuine case. He was prepared to make all the documents available and asked for their inclusion in Hansard. Now we have them in Hansard and there is nothing in those documents that cannot be found out because the documents will be published later today. So what is the purpose in cluttering up the room of the  Clerk  of the Senate? The documents were attainable and everything in them will be known now. I do not think that there is any strong objection to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McAuliffe</inline> tabling these documents, but on principle they should not be tabled. It is an insult to the Senate to table documents after, because of the opposition of Ministers, we had to go through the procedure of having them placed in Hansard by being read. I hope the motion is defeated. </para>

            <para>- I want to join my colleagues in opposing the motion moved by Sentor Rae. It is a frivolous motion in view of the circus that has taken place on the Government side of this chamber tonight. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McAuliffe</inline> first raised this matter a few days ago I believe that he was endeavouring to uncover something which he believed was unfair and probably also improper. Tonight he came into this chamber with considerable documentation which bore out everything he had said previously but which enlarged on it in many respects. The other night when we clashed over another matter in this chamber I said that I would leave no stone unturned if I believed that there was corruption in any sector of public life, in any avenue of industry or in any avenue of commerce. As legislators, whether in opposition or on the Government side, we are required to be honest in our approach to everything. Thirteen million people in this country send to the House of Representatives 125 representatives and to this chamber 60 senators. When we come here they expect us to act on their behalf in a sincere and honest manner. Tonight we saw <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McAuliffe</inline> endeavouring to expose certain aspects of a matter that happened in Queensland. </para>

              <para>- Yes, but I was diverted then by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> The situation where these documents could have been incorporated or tabled was available at all times over a period of 55 minutes. On other occasions when leave was sought for this purpose 2 Ministers very irresponsibly refused leave. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> said earlier is not true and I feel I must rebut it. He said that when he presents a statement in this House he is always able to make a copy of it available. On numerous occasions not only <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> but also other Ministers have come into this chamber and read a document of which no copy has been available. Sometimes a copy is not available for several hours and it is certainly not available until after the statement has been read. This is a factual situation.  I  speak with my colleagues on this side of the Senate against the motion.  I  have said it is frivolous and  I  could call it something else but  I  would be out of order.  I  completely oppose the motion. </para>

            <para>- The implication that has been made in the moving of this motion asking for these papers to be tabled is an implication that the documents from which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McAuliffe</inline> read are false and this implication is something I resent very much in view of the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McAuliffe</inline> sought to have these documents incorporated in Hansard on several occasions. After there was refusal of leave to do this time and time again we now have <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> saying that these documents must be tabled so that we can determine their authenticity.  I  believe the implication is very strong. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McAuliffe</inline> is a man of great integrity and honour and is not a person who would read from documents or attempt to have incorporated in Hansard documents that are false, lt is a direct insult to this honourable man for this motion to be moved by a Government senator after the number of refusals that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McAuliffe</inline> had when he sought leave to have the documents incorporated. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I  think it is worth repeating the point that has been made. All the information that is contained in those documents will be available at an early hour today. The information will be available for every person to read.  I  deplore the behaviour of 2 Ministers who have taken a very petulant attitude towards these matters and  I  hope we never have to see this type of petulant behaviour repeated in this place. At the risk of being pulled up let me say that the pip-squeaks are not on this side of the Senate, they are sitting on the front benches on the opposite side of this chamber. This motion should be voted against by all fair minded senators who believe in the integrity and honesty of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McAuliffe.</inline></para>

            <para>- I  point out to the Senate that 2 things have occurred this evening. The first is that an honourable senator has chosen to speak on the adjournment and to seek to have incorporated in Hansard a document which took him exactly 45 minutes to read at a fairly fast rate.  I  suggest that all honourable senators take note of what has occurred. There should be an objection made in this Senate to any honourable senator who wishes to come into this Senate, produce an enormous document or a book which he feels he has the right to request be incorporated in Hansard and then read it. The Minister at the table or whoever is responsible has a duty to reply to the matter which is being put forward on the adjournment.  I  remark to honourable senators opposite that the 2 Ministers who sought to have the document incorporated in Hansard were acting in the best interests of the Senate. The other point is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> moved that the document be tabled. My recollection of an incident involving myself which occurred in years past  - I  must admit that you were not the  President  then, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir -</inline> is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> called on me to table a particular document. On that occasion nothing happened other than the  President  saying: There has been a request that you table the document, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster.</inline> You will please table it.&#39; There was no further debate relating to it. </para>

            <para>- The motion before the Senate is that under the sessional orders the Senate do now adjourn. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turnbull</inline> raised a matter in connection with a question which he asked earlier today. I indicated to him that, having regard to the doubt which he had cast upon answers which had been given and in view of the clarity and accuracy which he wanted, it was appropriate to put the question on the notice paper so that I could provide him with a complete answer. I propose to provide him with that complete answer, after having the appropriate inquiries made, so that he may be satisfied. However, I feel that I should clear up one misapprehension under which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turnbull</inline> is labouring. Even though I think it regrettable that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turnbull,</inline> having made his statement, is not here now to hear the response which he asked for, I point out that the misapprehension under which I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turnbull</inline> is labouring is that a warrant is issued simply because a person does not attend for medical examination or does not answer a call-up notice. That is not so. A warrant is a warrant for arrest, and a warrant for arrest is issued by a court. It is only in circumstances in which a person has not appeared in response to a summons or, having been convicted, cannot be apprehended because he is not present to be apprehended that a court will issue a warrant for his arrest. Therefore it is only in very rare cases that a warrant will be issued. I would imagine that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turnbull</inline> examines the Hansard record either tomorrow or at a later hour this day he may ascertain that there is some confusion in his own mind as to the circumstances about which he is inquiring. </para>

              <para>- That may be what he wants to know. I do not have that information with me at the moment but it can be readily supplied from within  my  own Department. Because the honourable senator has been asking about matters which come partly within the responsibility of the Attorney-General and partly within the responsibility of the Minister for Labour and National Service, it is only appropriate that research be carried out in order to get an accurate answer. For the record I repeat what I said at question time today: If the question is put on notice that information will be supplied. </para>

          <para>The second matter was raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poyser.</inline> Apart from revealing some of the problems which occur when unions impose black bans, I do not think the matter requires any answer from me. The honourable senator set out to clarify a matter which was raised earlier. The third matter was raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McAuliffe.</inline> Why he chose to make it a responsibility of the Attorney-General, I do not know, because 1 share the views of the Minister for Works <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wright).</inline> I think the debate on the motion for the adjournment in the Senate has been misused in order to cast an attack upon persons who are unable to defend themselves. 1 have read what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McAuliffe</inline> said in the course of the debate on the Queensland Grant Bill last week. At the time he spoke he indicated that he did not know whether what he was saying was true or not. He said it was simply a matter of rumour, a matter of murmuring. Whether it was true or not he could not say; he just hoped that the Minister would have a look at it and call for an inquiry. Apparently, in the light of the material which he has produced, he now believes that the allegations he made on that Tuesday are to be sustained. Having listened to what he said tonight and having read what he said before, I cannot see that the material in any way sustains the position. I do not know whether the material raises a case for an inquiry. However, I certainly believe that the way in which debate is used to have the effect of defaming under privilege people who have absolutely no opportunity of defending themselves ought to be the concern of the statement. It may be that upon inquiry the points can be sustained, but that is one of the consequences of what has been done tonight. </para>

              <para>- Lest there be any misunderstanding, I withdrew, and I withdrew absolutely at the direction of the  Deputy President.  I do not qualify that in any sense. I do make the comment that for the sake of precedent for the future we as a Senate should consider the implications of having a statement withdrawn simply because an honourable senator says that it offends him. It absolutely destroys debate in this chamber. I return to the matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McAuliffe.</inline> The situation that a Minister of the Crown in Queensland is subjected to innuendos raised in this chamber ought to give concern to every honourable senator because of the way in which people outside the chamber can be defamed, if not offended, by what is said. I can say only that the quite deliberate use of this forum by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McAuliffe</inline> in the way in which he has used it is not in accordance with the standards of the Senate prior to the occasion when he entered it. I only regret that the Queensland State election has produced the result that this forum is available for the purpose of debating Queensland State issues which have absolutely no relevance to any issue concerning this Senate. Not a word which was mentioned tonight by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McAuliffe</inline> about the alleged omissions of. or actions which ought to be taken by, the Queensland Minister who is in charge of racing and bookmakers in Queensland has any relevance whatsoever to a matter which affects this Commonwealth Parliament. </para>

However, during the course of the industrial dispute something apparently occurred which, on the information given to me, I regard as being of a very serious nature. I refer to an allegation by the New South Wales branch of the union about the use of military personnel by one of the proprietors as guards for his establishment during the course of the dispute. </para>

          <para class="block">Let me give the facts as they were given to me. Yesterday afternoon I was informed by an official of the New South Wales branch of the union that last Thursday night - Thursday, 18th May - the union decided to put a picket line outside the premises of the Sydney &#39;Daily Telegraph&#39;. The union told the New South Wales Police Force of its intention and there were one or two officers of that force there in their role as protectors of the rights of the people and, of course, in their role as the protectors of property. The union has advised me that its relations with the New South Wales Police Force during the course of the industrial disturbance were very good, to say the least. But when the members of the union arrived outside the premises of the Sydney &#39;Daily Telegraph&#39;, last Thursday night they were confronted with what the union official described to me - I quote his words - as &#39;five or six big burly men of large build, anything from between 5 ft 10 to 6 ft and above in height, some wearing big black boots&#39;. One of these men was recognised by a member of the union as being a member of the Australian Army Provost Corps. </para>

          <para class="block">The matter was drawn to the notice of one of the officials of the Printing and Kindred Industries Employees Union by the union member concerned who, I understand, spoke to a senior executive of the company. The union official asked the senior executive of the company who they were. The answer given was something like this: &#39;It does not matter who they are. These fellows are prepared to stay here for 7 months if necessary&#39;. The union official supplied me with the name of the identified man. I was asked to endeavour to ascertain whether he is still a serving member of the regular forces. I contacted the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Katter)</inline> yesterday afternoon. He told me that he would make immediate investigations. I say, in fairness to the Minister, that he acted straight away. He contacted me this afternoon to say that it would appear that the man concerned is a member of the Regular Army. He said also that a commanding officer may give authority to members of his unit to engage themselves in evening work such as that of a waiter, a barman, a service station attendant or work of that type and, to use the Minister&#39;s words when he spoke to me on the telephone: &#39;It has to be work of integrity&#39;. They are not my words, but the words that were used by the Minister to me during the course of our telephone conversation. </para>
          <para>As a result of my complaint to the Minister on behalf of the union - again, I am being fair - the Minister has assured me that he has now issued an order through the Chief of the General Staff telling all unit commanders that in giving approval to servicemen to engage in evening work the unit commanders are to exercise much more discretion in the future and that no member of the armed Services is to be permitted to take part in any work that is suggestive in any way of their becoming involved in an industrial or a political conflict. Frankly, I appreciate the Minister&#39;s issuing this edict and that he acted with promptness. But the fact is that apparently military policemen have been allowed to be employed in this sort of activity. It is very dangerous for this to be permitted in the Australian community. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DOUGLAS</inline>MCCLELLANDLet me come to this. Had something happened to spark off any trouble at that office, one does not need to have much imagination to appreciate what could have happened in the circumstances. If this Government is not paying members of the Services sufficient to maintain them in their one job - I am now answering <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster&#39;s</inline> earlier interjection - I do not object to their being allowed to do another job provided it is not taking work from someone else and provided the civilian job is not in any way related to their Service work or the type of work they do in the Army. For instance, it would be unpardonable if a military policeman by day worked as a Metropolitan Security Service guard by night. Indeed, to me it would be unpardonable if a military policeman worked as a guard on the doors of a metropolitan daily newspaper especially if, in relation to that establishment, there is an industrial disputation between the proprietor and members of a union working in the establishment. I suggest to the Government that under no circumstances will the Australian public tolerate the use of members of the armed Services particularly Army provosts, in work which obviously is intended to be undertaken, as it were, as a show of strength and possibly with the use of strong arm tactics against Australian workers who in their hearts have a genuine industrial grievance. </para>
          <para>Military personnel, and particularly military policemen, should not be allowed under any circumstances to be used in an inflammatory manner relating to any industrial dispute. Because I regard the matter as being of a very serious nature, I seek answers to the following questions: Is the person whose name I have given to the Minister in fact a member of the Australian Army Provost Corps? If so, how did he and probably others know that such a job was available. Unfortunately I cannot say that there were others until I know their names but there were, as I have mentioned, on the information given to- me 5 or 6 big burly men, one of whom was identified. If he or others knew the job was available by advertisement, when and where was such advertisement published? Since this information was given to me I have been through the issues of the &#39;Daily Telegraph&#39; back to Saturday, 13th May - 5 days preceding this incident - in an endeavour to find such an advertisement, and I have not been able to find one in the time available. Was someone in the Provost Corps telephoned or approached in any way to provide men for the type of task involved? Was the commanding officer of the unit approached for permission for the civilian work to be undertaken? If the commanding officer was approached, did he ask what the work was? If so, what was he told was the job that was involved? If he was told the job that was involved, why did he give permission? </para>
          <para>I regard the matter as very serious, as do members of the union. I demand that the Government make a full statement on the matter. Not only should the edict that apparently has been issued by the Minister or the Army- be issued, but also it should be issued by the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Mackay)</inline> and the Minister for Air in regard to members of those Services. This Government has spoken much in recent times about law and order but if it goes so far as to allow military personnel, particularly military policemen, to be used in work which could be regarded as being related to or involved in industrial disputes there will be an awful lot of trouble in this country. I suggest to the Minister and to the Government that there should be a full and open inquiry into the matter and that, to say the least, a ministerial statement should be made in the Parliament. </para>
          <para>Seantor DRAKE-BROCKMAN (Western Australia - Minister for Air) (12.50 a.m.) - Let me say immediately to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland that I view the matter as a serious one. Service personnel working outside their normal duty hours, not the particular occurrence to which the honourable senator referred, is a matter that I come across quite often in the administration of my Service portfolio. Let me assure the honourable senator immediately that there are stringent laws laid down for the employment of Service personnel outside working hours. In accordance with the general policy of the armed Services, approval may be given, by a unit commander, for a man to engage in outside civilian employment, but rules are laid down by Air Force standing orders, by Army routine orders and, I take it, by Naval orders. </para>
          <para>The application for approval to undertake employment outside normal Service duty hours must contain a statement from the applicant that he understands that his private employment will not interfere with his Service duties, that he is not to take part in any private activities which may give rise to a suspicion that he could use his Service knowledge to futher his business interests, that the activity in which he is engaged does not involve the use of official time, that the activity does not involve the use of official information or experience acquired in the course of official duties, that the activity will not bring the Service into disrepute and that he does not replace or receive the remuneration of a civilian who is on strike. These are the orders that are laid down. </para>

              <para>- Yes. The decision must be left to the discretion of the commanding officer and of the individual. My understanding is that in this case approval was given by the unit commander for this man to engage in civilian employment. I understand that approval was given on the basis that the man would be in employment with Metropolitan Security Services Pty Ltd. On the night to which the honourable senator referred this man was not working for that organisation. Apparently he was working in a private capacity, unknown to his commanding officer. </para>

          <para class="block">I put it to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> who has waited so patiently tonight to hear my submissions that obviously a certain amount of money flows back to Greece and other countries from people in Australia. As an internationalist I do not have any objections about this. I am quite happy to see the flow of capital from one nation to another, particularly when it benefits the battlers of the world. Obviously the case I have mentioned vindicates my reservations about the policy in connection with which I expressed those fateful words at Picton last Sunday. I fail to see why the Australian diplomatic representative in Athens could not speak up about this virtually open door policy on the flow-back of money from Australia to Greece. I am not passing judgment on the Greek Government. 1 could say a lot about the Greek Government but I am not going to rock the boat at this stage. However, I believe that our Ambassador should take a much stronger line. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> would be aware of the number of occasions when heads of State meet and when Ministers go overseas to countries from where migrants come. There are times when we have to speak up for the equity of people of various nationalities who acquire Australian citizenship. I and other senators have attended virtually hundreds of naturalisation ceremonies at which we are told about the privileges, responsibilities and rights of people becoming citizens of this country. I believe that the interests of these people should be looked after. </para>
          <para>I believe that the case I have mentioned is one of many occasions on which our diplomatic representatives should at least tactfully suggest to the Greek Government - and I would Jink the Spanish Government in this matter - that it might be a different thing if the person involved was a Greek-Australian multi-millionaire who had enough economic fat to live on. However, the person I am concerned about works in one of our basic industries. He has a sick wife and 6 children 14 years of age and under. He is a quiet Australian citizen and I think that at least we could express a view to the Greek Government. I do not say that in a patronising fashion. I think that our diplomatic representatives should get away from the niceties and be forceful about what can be done. Whatever way we approach this situation, if the Greek Government replies that we should not interfere in its affairs I think the Australian Government has an obligation to suggest to it that we might have to do the same as some of the NATO powers have to do at times, notably in the case of the Scandinavian countries. </para>
          <para>I know that it is now early morning. Notwithstanding that, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Robert</inline> Jago, the  President  of the South Coast Branch of the Ironworkers Federation approached me I felt that this was the place to ventilate the matter about which he was concerned. I hope that we will have a much stiffer attitude in discussions with the Greek Government. After all - and I say this quite respectfully - when we give leave of absence for Ministers to go overseas I think that the problems of the little people should be discussed, although they are too often ignored. I will leave the matter on that basis for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright&#39;s</inline> reply. </para>

            <para>- I say to the Senate that I regret that I rise at about 4 minutes past 1 o&#39;clock to speak on the motion that the Senate adjourn almost 2 hours after the motion was put. However, let me say that during the time I have been here I have not spoken on an average of more than once a year on the adjournment debate. However, I regret that I must rise to speak at this late hour this evening. On the other hand, I would advise the Senate that as is the usual practice I sought the  Deputy  President&#39;s desk at 4.15 this afternoon and placed my name on the list of speakers for the adjournment debate. At that stage I was second on the list to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turnbull.</inline> There were no other speakers at that time. </para>

              <para>- At the time 1 saw the list on the  Deputy  President&#39;s desk there was only one name in pencil written above my own. 1 point out to the Senate that honourable senators perhaps speak on the motion for the adjournment for several reasons. Strange as it may be, they think the matter of public interest they raise, in the context of the day, may catch the eye of the Press or may be of concern to the interests that the senator represents. I agree that an injustice may have been done if a senator was called to speak 2 hours after the motion that the Senate do now adjourn was moved. Earlier in the evening I would have said that something occurred today, but at this moment I must say that it appears to me that yesterday 2 major announcements were made. Firstly the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Greenwood)</inline> made a statement on restrictive trade practices and perhaps of greater impact and of greater importance was his statement on the monopolisation of industry in the Commonwealth. My speech has reference to that statement. </para>

              <para>- The matter of like importance and connected to the first mentioned matter relates to multi-national corporations and their effect on Australia. The financial pages of 24th April 1972 headline the fact that the Unilever group in Australia had a record year in 1971, and made a profit of $4.1m. The  Chairman  claims that this was the best the group had done in its history in Australia. He went on to say that sales and earnings in 1972 were better than they were in the previous year. For that information I quote the &#39;Daily Telegraph&#39;. From a business trading point of view this is a most creditable performance. The report revealed: </para>

Australian shareholders of this company, if there were any, would at least be satisfied that the dividend paid - that is, virtually the whole of the profit - was paid to shareholders. However, Australians have no equity in this company, as the whole of its dividends are paid to its huge multinational Anglo-Dutch parent, which lifted profits in 1971 by 32 per cent of $416m. For that I quote the Sydney &#39;Sun&#39; of 1st March 1972. Unilever Australia Pty Ltd produces and sells a wide range of household products. </para>

I draw your attention to this ruling. If we are to uphold that very outstanding <inline font-weight="bold">president, Mr President</inline> Kingsmill, we are out of order in having an honourable senator speak twice on the motion that the Senate do now adjourn. With great respect, we did intervene tonight with a motion and determine that motion. That should have been ruled out of order. It is a very clear ruling that we cannot determine issues on the motion that the Senate do now adjourn. I suggest to you that anybody who is speaking twice tonight is out of order. I regret intervening on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> but it happens that my attention has been drawn to the fact that he has already spoken tonight. </para>

          <para class="block">I am. quoting from the &#39;Australian Financial Review&#39;. However, in one area in which I am vitally concerned some of the facts are known. I speak now about the Australian dairy industry and the effect that Unilever&#39;s activities in the margarine field have had upon it. The following information is readily available from the </para>
          <para class="block">Commonwealth Statistician or market surveys. Mainly due to the development of so-called soft cooking margarines the Australian butter market, which previously held some 80 per cent of the total spread market, has now lost 9 to 10 per cent of that market. This is mainly due to the activities of this company which, by intense and extremely costly advertising, has come to dominate the market. I instance that by saying that so much has it dominated the market over the last 9 years its production and sales of cooking margarine have increased by 1,100 per cent whereas those of other Australian competitors have increased by only approximately 82 per cent. Obviously this is not to the advantage of other Australian margarine manufacturing companies. </para>
          <para>This policy of dominating the market by Unilever which is common throught the Western world is not only to the disadvantage of competitors in the industry but also it can be doubted whether it is to the advantage of the consumer as this company&#39;s monopoly of the market depends on extremely high levels of advertising which can be paid for only by the consumer. In other words the growth of this multinational foreign owned company, with absolutely no Australian equity, is currently operating to the disadvantage of the Australian dairy industry, Unilever&#39;s competitors in the Australian margarine industry and, doubtless, of the Australain consumer. As I have said in this senate on a number of occasions, because cooking margarine is 90 per cent tallow it is not the Australian vegetable oil seeds industry which will benefit from the development of such a market. If there is any gain to be made at all it will be to the tallow industry. I again exhort the other governments in Australia to follow the example set by the governments of my own State of Victoria and of Tasmania, and restrict the devastating effects of the growth of this product by banning the use of artificial colouring and flavouring in cooking margarine. </para>

              <para>(a) So far as the Social Services Act is concerned, where an invalid pensioner is accepted through the Commonwealth Rehabilitation.

For patients who require artificial limbs and appliances and are sponsored by State Government Departments and philanthropic organisations (and these constitute the bulk of civilian patients), it is the practice of the Repatriation Department in each case to obtain an official order guaranteeing payment from the organisation concerned before work commences on the artificial limb. Payment for the limb or appliance is then made on satisfactory completion. For a private patient, it has long been the practice to obtain payment of the estimated full cost of the completed limb or appliance before manufacture commences. This is later adjusted in the light of the actual cost of the completed limb. </para>

          <para>These charges are based on the average cost of manufacturing the particular type of limb. The concept of standard pricing has recently been on trial in Victoria and the current charge there for a below-knee patellar-tendon-bearing limb is in fact $150. </para>

          <para>A temporary relaxation of the requirement was made but it is no longer current.

              <para>The Board has taken no action to increase the output of trained personnel, either in conjunction with educational authorities or the Professional Radio Employees&#39; Institute of Australasia. Generally, it can be stated that the majority of commercial broadcasting stations are adequately manned and those stations where difficulties arise are in country areas, often relatively remote, and the problem is to attract qualified technicians away from the large cities and provincial towns. A greater output of qualified technicians each year would be unlikely to ease this type of situation significantly. </para>

Although this evaluation demonstrated that the principle could be given effect in practice, the expected advantages were not as great as hoped for, as so often happens in the research field, and further production was suspended. </para>

            <para>Dissemination of the results of research and development on artificial limbs and appliances carried out by the Repatriation Department&#39;s Central Development Unit is normally distributed within the Repatriation Department. However, from time to time the results of research projects conducted by the Central Development Unit are published in the Repatriation Artificial Limb and Appliance Service Journal. This journal, which has a world-wide distribution, is freely available on request to the Department Indeed, I am told that both the Executive Director of the Crippled Children&#39;s Association in South Australia and the Medical Superintendent of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital are sent 2 copies of each edition of the Journal. Furthermore, work of particular interest is described in papers submitted from time to time to various medical and other journals relevant to the field of prosthetics and orthotics. </para>
            <para>I am not aware of any recent requests from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Giche, Mr Tidmarsh</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sharpe</inline> to be provided wilh the results of the Central Development Unit&#39;s research. </para>
            <para>If information on research results over and above that published in the Repatriation Artificial Limb and Appliance Service or other journals is sought by an interested party outside the Department, this is normally supplied. </para>
