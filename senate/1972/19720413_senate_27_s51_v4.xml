            <para>Yes, I have seen reports and I am most concerned about them. In one paper there is a most disgraceful reference, if I may say so, which says that Department of Health officials are like the Mafia. That is a most disgraceful reference to be attributed, as it is, to a reverend gentleman. 1 want to make it clear that there is no intimidation. I do not accept the allegation that there is intimidation. It is true that a departmental officer is present at hearings of the inquiry but this is quite normal. It should be realised that the Department is required to provide evidence during the inquiry and that it will be better equipped to provide information of real assistance if it is properly informed of the nature of evidence given by other witnesses. I should add that a statement was made on 7th April this year by the Commonwealth Director of Health at Darwin. This was done with my concurrence. The statement referred to the appearance of departmental officers as private witnesses before the inquiry. This is the statement that was made: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>The Department has noobjection to members of the Department appearing as witnesses before the Committee in their private capacity. However, as the members would be appearing in a private capacity they may not present departmental policy or documents. Any request for the presentation of policy or for documents that may be required should be made to the departmental representative. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">No doubt he would be called as a witness at the inquiry. I should add that the board of inquiry is composed of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr K.</inline> S. Edmunds, who is the Compensation (Commonwealth Employees) Tribunal and who has a legal background; <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Dearlove,</inline> Director of Medical Services with the Department of Repatriation in South Australia; and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Vanderfield</inline> who is the Chief Executive Officer and General Medical </para>
          <para class="block">Superintendent of the Royal North Shore Hospital, Sydney. These are people of integrity who have status in the community. </para>
          <para>To suggest that there has been intimidation of witnesses or to suggest, as one newspaper did, that health officials were like the Mafia, is a reflection on the board of inquiry. This is a terrible thing for a Press report to attribute to anyone. I should like to make it abundantly clear also that the article in the Press this morning mentioned a complaint against the Department of Health because it had not notified people in the Alice Springs area about the inquiry. The Department of Health is not the convenor of the inquiry; it is an inquiry which is being conducted at the instigation of the Legislative Council of the Northern Territory. The Department of Health has concurred in the inquiry being held and, of course, has given its support. </para>
          <para>The same reverend gentleman, Father Robarts, is reported - I keep using the word reported&#39; because I do not like criticising people unfairly - to have complained to the board about the lack of advertising of its sittings in Alice Springs. The report mentions also that he blamed the Darwin senior health officials who had 3 or 4 weeks notice of the inquiry and who should have circulated the hearing dates. I repeat that the Health Department was not the instigator of this inquiry. If the dates of sitting were to be circulated, that would be the responsibility of those who set up the inquiry or those who have the conduct of it. The whole atmosphere of this matter contains an imputation against officers of the Public Service. It is deplorable that serious imputations of this nature should be made against members of the Public Service by a man of the cloth or by anybody else. </para>

I have no information to suggest that Professor Grant&#39;s report is now in the hands of the Minister, and certainly the Minister has made no announcement about receiving the report or that the Government intends to take certain action, so the article can only be expressing views which are purely supposition. </para>

This is not binding on the Government and it does not commit the Government in any way but it does give us an indication of what firms are prepared to meet those special requirements. In regard to the replacement for the Mirage aircraft, already we have  3  proposals from overseas firms and we expect proposals from  3  other firms and possibly a fourth. I cannot name those firms at this stage but should the honourable senator desire to know their names I suggest that he should come along and see me. </para>

            <para>- It is perfectly true that currently there are only 2 supersonic aircraft available for anbody who wishes to engage in supersonic civil flying as a commercial enterprise. One such aircraft is the Anglo-French Concorde which is due to visit Australia in mid-June as part of a long trip through the Middle East and Asian areas. The Anglo-French Concorde is the aircraft which we in this country will have the opportunity of seeing. The Russian aircraft is the Tupolov, also called by those who are involved in this business the &#39;Concordski&#39;. It is regarded by those who understand these things - 1 do not claim to be one of them - as not being as advanced technically in its capabilities as the Concorde. The 2 aircraft were side by side at the Paris air show. Many international and quite detached observers were able to look at both aircraft. I believe that the Russian aircraft is a good one. The Russian people have had a capacity for aircraft design and engine manufacture and, without any doubt, the aircraft is quite advanced. But from my information I do not think it is as advanced or as good as the Concorde. It was reported to have had a failure on its return from Paris to Moscow. For some time it was on the ground at Cracow in Poland. We could not find out subsequently what the reported failure was. All we had were reports which could not be authenticated. It is perfectly true that it has flown a great deal over Continential Europe.

          <para>It is equally true that the Russians are most interested in selling the aircraft fairly extensively around the world. I think of interest to my colleagues in the Senate would be the fact that at present Russia stands about twenty-first in the international air flying table. Australia stands about twelfth. The table is headed by the United States. I think it must be regarded as quite logical that there will be a substantia&#93; Russian attempt to expand in the air internationally as it has expanded on the seas. This fact has to be taken into consideration. Therefore, the Russians would have a great interest in internationally flying and displaying their aircraft and trying to sell it to countries which may be interested in using it. </para>
          <para>The honourable senator made an observation about people being given the chance to see and to fly in the Concorde when it visits Australia. That is an interesting observation. I have no control over who shall inspect the aircraft or who shall fly in it, but I think it would be proper for me to submit to the authorities concerned that they should consider giving members from all sides of the Parliament an opportunity to see the aircraft, to inspect it and - if anybody is to be given the chance to fly in il - to fly in it. </para>

I am hoping that the issues involved will be determined soon. I am as keen as anybody to get the matter of health administration in the Australian Capital Territory decided, particularly having regard to the construction of the new hospital in the Woden Valley which is being commissioned at present. That, in itself, is a big job. There are other health services in the Territory. I make it abundantly clear that I am keen to get the matter to a final decision. I am not being tardy in what I am doing. There is a big decision involved. It relates to health and the administration of health in the whole of the Territory. I will be making an announcement about the matter as soon as possible. </para>

That section of the aircraft equipment field is one to which we direct our attention and which we regard as important for the reasons mentioned by the honourable senator. A recent aircraft I have seen advertised is the Merlin Square Engine Metro which is a 20-passcnger prop jet aircraft which may have some facility if it goes into production. The Department already has a small version of this aircraft which is used in Australia and which is under test. Essentially, the question is one to which I am pleased to be able to direct my further attention because the Department is studying it continuously. As information becomes available, I will see that it is made available to the. honourable senator if he requests it. </para>

I refer to 2 alleged student decisions yesterday at the Australian National University, one to declare the University a sanctuary for draft resisters, and the other, to pay legal costs and fines of law breakers from the funds to which all students are compelled to contribute. Is there any authority in the University statutes or the law generally for making the University a sanctuary for law breakers? If not, is not this merely a matter of impertinent bravado? Does Commonwealth law offer a remedy, as Victorian law was recently shown to have, for this impertinent and irresponsible misuse of funds contributed by students, many of whom are opposed to the political views of the law breakers concerned? If student funds are subsidised in any way from Commonwealth grants, will such grants be halted until we are assured that none of the money will be diverted for the illicit purposes mentioned? </para>

              <para>- I think that the answer which was given by the Minister representing the Minister for Education and Science to an earlier question showed that there were approximately 4,300 or 4,400 students at the Australian National University. So, a decision of ISO students at that University can be regarded only as an unrepresentative decision. As far as the question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> is concerned, I am not aware of any provision in the University statutes which would authorise the sort of conduct which would be envisaged by the passage of these resolutions. I think that I can say quite confidently that no university statute which would be subject to scrutiny by this Parliament would ever contain such a provision. There is certainly no law in this country which enables groups of university students to say that they are in some way immune from the ordinary laws which apply to all citizens of this country. Any allegation by unversity students that they have some right over and above the rights which apply to all other citizens is merely an arrogant usurpation which is quite undemocratic and, if I might say so, absolutely deplorable in a university. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The question whether remedies are available to students or members of the public who object to university funds being applied, at the whim or decision of an unrepresentative minority, to pay the fines of persons who break the laws is a matter again for the persons concerned to examine in the light of the ways in which the money is available to the students under the University&#39;s statutes. I am sure that the vast majority of Australians were heartened by the action which was taken by some courageous students in La Trobe University. Those students applied to the courts of Victoria for appropriate orders to ensure that moneys are applied for lawful objectives. Again, it is deplorable that some university students in that University at the present time are showing a lawlessness which calls for protest simply against a court decision to that effect. </para>
          <para>In the final part of his question, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> asked whether or not the Commonwealth will ensure that moneys which are part of Commonwealth grants are not used for the purpose of paying fines. T am sure that this is a matter to which the Government will give the closest attention. It is not strictly a matter within my portfolio and I ought not to pre-empt the right of the relevant Minister to make his decisions in this area. </para>

If so, is the Minister able to provide the Senate with figures showing the number of people who are receiving subsidised health service membership compared with the numbers at Wollongong who are eligible for such assistance but have not availed themselves of it?

In recent times I have read quite a good deal of comment about shipping outside the Conference lines. I understand that very shortly - in the next day or two - there is to be a meeting in Europe on this matter. Therefore I would not like to comment further now. However, I assure the honourable senator that I will keep my eye on the results of that meeting and let him have any information I receive. </para>

My Department has taken action to meet these problems. For example - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland referred to this matter in part - it has introduced a simplified application form for the low income families.

          <para>The Department of Social Services has just completed a 4-week campaign of intensive publicity in the Wollongong-Port Kembla area, which is the area to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland referred. The campaign included newspaper, radio and television advertising, together with the good will and assistance of particular persons likely to have direct contact with potential beneficiaries. Such persons included social workers, employers, doctors, chemists, health fund officials, hospital administrators and members of migrant bodies. The purpose of the campaign is to guage the effects of intensive publicity on the level of participation in the subsidised health benefits plan in a particular area with a view to the introduction of similar measures in other parts of Australia. The results of the campaign are being analysed at present by the Department. It is therefore a little too early to give a picture of the results. Within the next few months a special insert pointing out the benefits available under the plan is to be forwarded with one batch of child endowment cheques. </para>
          <para>My Department, mindful of the problems migrants are having in understanding the subsidised health benefits plan, is currently arranging the production of explanatory pamphlets in 10 different languages.

            <para>It is true that the Treasurer made a statement on this matter on Tuesday evening and that I made a similar statement yesterday. It is true that the Parliament has passed a Bill that seeks to give effect to a part of that statement in relation to income tax. It is true that an inquiry is to be set up in relation to the generality of the taxation law. It is equally true that a statement will be made subsequently in which the whole gamut of the inquiry will be put down and the Parliament informed of it. I think it would be unwise of me now to reflect in the way that I have been invited to do so on a statement that will be made in due course by the Treasurer. It is for that reason that I would prefer to take the question on notice. When the full details are put down and publicised, I will be in a position to respond to the honourable senator&#39;s question.

I feel that it would be better to wait until I have obtained a detailed reply to the whole of the honourable senator&#39;s question instead of now replying to it in part. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- &#39;His&#39;</inline>Department never had the land. What we were discussing with the Department of Lands in New South Wales was a proposition that if the airport was desirable some land would be acquired under lease. I think that one fairly can mention here that the amount that was originally proposed for the lease during the number of years of negotiation increased dramatically. We did exhibit an interest in the situation and expressed the hope in earlier meetings in the Senate that it was very much to be desired that the area might become part of a parkland, but that was not for us to determine. That was just a personal indication of a view that 1 had. Perhaps it was presumptuous of me to do so but nevertheless I did express it. </para>

            <para>I saw a comment in the Press this morning in relation to this matter and I sought some preliminary information on it. The Press comment indicated that this device is being used in certain of the major hospitals in Sydney. It is referred to in one case as the I-spy device. Recent developments in fibre-optics have resulted in instruments being produced which enable observers - they obviously would be people engaged in the medical field - to visualise the lining surfaces of some internal organs of the body. The fibre-optic gastroscope is passed into the stomach through the mouth and allows the doctor to examine the lining surface of the stomach. By careful examination the medical practitioner is able to see changes in the stomach lining allowing him to detect many abnormal conditions, including cancer of the stomach. The suggestion, of course, is that this is early detection. Early detection of cancer will greatly improve the chances of complete removal and cure of the cancer. I know that we all hope and pray that it will be another step towards the eventual conquest of cancer. That is the information I have at the moment. If any more particularised information becomes available to me I will be delighted to make it available not only to the Senate but also to the community at large. </para>

By way of preface I refer to my question addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate and an earlier question to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry on the need for the Australian Wool Board to promote wool. I now ask: Has the Minister seen reports that an Irish trade commission promoting Irish wool designs is in Sydney at the present time and receiving considerable publicity and business? What steps are being taken to emulate this successful promotion so that Australian wools and designs can receive similar promotion overseas? </para>

            <para>- A prophet is without honour in his own country. The Australian Wool Board, through the International Wool Secretariat, has been promoting wool in many parts of the world. One has only to visit the International Wool Secretariat in London to see wool being promoted in all manner of ways, one instance being the very lavish carpets on the floor as one enters the front door of the building. A tremendous amount of promotional work is going on. Some growers and some people in the wool industry disagree with the way in which wool is being promoted. I will seek some information on promotion by way of a report from the Australian Wool Board and give it to the honourable senator so that he can understand the job being done by the Board. </para>

As this spirit of loyalty is rather unique in the business world today and would be reflected in dedicated application by employees to all phases of operations within the organisation, and therefore safety in air travel, will this aspect be given full consideration by the Department of Civil Aviation in its interest in the future of our 2-airline system as now constituted? </para>

          <quote>
            <para>I am not aware that the available statistics on income distribution show that there is &#39;an increasing disparity between people on high incomes and those on low incomes&#39;. </para>
            <para>In any case, in Australia, award wages and salaries are determined by the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and the State arbitral tribunals, in the light of submissions made to them. The Commonwealth would not wish to undermine the independence of these authorities. The Commonwealth can, of course, seek to influence the Arbitration Commission through its submissions in the public interest to major arbitral cases. </para>
            <para>The Commonwealth could, for example, seek to influence the Commission to award increases which would tend to reduce the gap between low and high wages and salaries. However, in the long run, such a course would mean decreasing incentives to those obtaining higher incomes on the grounds of work, value, including considerations of training or higher education and bearing of heavy responsibilities. </para>
            <para>Nevertheless, in recognition of the special difficulty confronting minimum wage earners, the Commonwealth, while opposing any increase in the total wage, in its recent national wage submission said that it did not set its face against any increase in the minimum wage but added that any increase should not be of a magnitude which would have serious repercussions on the economy or which would spark off agitation for the increase in total wage rates to restore relativities. </para>

If so, by whose authority and on what grounds was the ban imposed? Was it because of the danger of disease? If so, would the disease be dangerous to humans, animals or other fish? Or was it because of the predatory nature of goldfish? Will the ban apply only to Japan or to all countries exporting live fish to Australia? Is the Minister also aware that the sudden imposition of the ban has placed dealers in live fish throughout Australia in a serious financial position as tile largest portion of their incomes was derived from that source? </para>

            <para class="block">There is a danger of introducing fish diseases and parasites with imported live fish. Goldfish have a wide temperature tolerance and therefore could contaminate most natural waters in Australia including trout streams and lakes in southern Australia. </para>

          <para>That the Senate take note of the report. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">In presenting this report, I believe that as  Chairman  of the Committee I should mention some of the important factors that were basic to the Committee&#39;s deliberations on the 2 petitions seeking co-operation and financial assistance for crime prevention which were referred originally to the Standing Committee on Health and Welfare, and were later transferred to the Standing Committee on Social Environment. These were the first petitions to be referred to any of the Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committees appointed with the expansion of the Senate&#39;s committee system. Consequently, there may be some historic importance in the approach adopted in relation to these petitions. In embarking on what might be regarded as new procedures, at least in the Commonwealth Parliament, the Committee believed that it ought to deliberate carefully on the alternatives available to it and the possible consequences of action that might be taken. In these initial stages in the consideration of petitions by Senate committees, we felt that the utmost care should be taken to avoid setting precedents that could prove to be undersirable. Accordingly, we were concerned to ensure that our approach would be a well reasoned one adopted with due regard for basic principles that ought to apply to the consideration of petitions. In pursuit of these aims, the Committee sought the advice of parliamentary authorities and at one stage deferred its examination of the petitions when discussions on procedures that might be appropriate to the consideration of petitions by committees were to be undertaken. We did this because we believed it to be important that if possible we should not anticipate the outcome of those discussions and that, in broad principle, some uniformity of approach be developed in this new facet of the workings of the Senate and its committees. At this point it might be appropriate to remark that a reasonably common approach to aspects of committee operations where uniformity might be desirable could perhaps be facilitated if the chairmen of the various committees were to form themselves into a chairmen&#39;s liaison committee such as exists at Westminster. </para>
        <para>I should say that from the outset the Committee accepted that it was empowered to consider the petitions in question. It accepted no less that it had the right - and, indeed, an obligation - to exercise its own discretion and to deal with them as it deemed appropriate in all the circumstances, including the terms of reference, and the provisions of the Standing Orders and resolutions of the Senate under which the Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committees operate. As the report clearly shows, the Committee attached importance to the fundamental principle that generally petitions must relate to matters within the competence of the legislature to intervene. As has been pointed out, this is of particular significance in our federal system. Tn considering these petitions, the Committee was concerned to avoid intrusion into areas of State responsibility. The petitions, as will be seen, refer to a number of matters that fall directly within the administrative and legislative responsibility of the States within their own areas. 1 wish to emphasise that in the Committee&#39;s view, the references to those matters are explanatory of the specific request made in the petitions and do not constitute a request for an inquiry into those wider matters. In the light of these circumstances, the Committee closely examined the context of the petitions. This examination established, in our opinion, that the Sentae was asked to seek to ensure that the Commonwealth Government seek the co-operation of the States and supply extra finance to them for the purpose of combating crime. We have pointed out in our report that the text of the petitions had already been referred by the Standing Committee on Health and Welfare to appropriate Commonwealth Ministers including the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> for comment. The Standing Committee on Social Environment considered this to be a proper course to adopt and took note of the comments received. It subsequently again sought comments from the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Greenwood)</inline> so that any new developments that might have occurred in the intervening time could be considered. The replies received are tabled with the report. </para>
        <para>The Committee has indicated plainly in the report its belief that desirable cooperative measures are already being taken by the Commonwealth in consultation with the States. These embrace particularly research and training. The Commonwealth is providing one-half of the Criminology Research Fund and will accept full financial responsibility for establishing and maintaining the Australian Institute of Crimin ology which is now being formed. However, the Committee considers that the Commonwealth ought to take a more active role and pursue new initiatives which are outlined in the recommendations. </para>
        <para>I wish to emphasise the Committee&#39;s view that crime statistics currently available in Australia are inadequate and that early action should be taken to develop an improved range and pattern of statistics on the national scale. We believe that action to achieve this objective is urgently needed and should be immediately promoted by the Commonwealth. In the Committee&#39;s view, a great deal of essential fundamental research on the causes and consequences of crime cannot be initiated and carried through satisfactorily unless better statistics are provided. As will be noted, a dissenting report by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> and a statement of reservations by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> are attached to the Committee&#39;s report. I wish finally to record my appreciation of the general spirit and manner in which the Committee&#39;s deliberations on this reference were conducted. </para>

          <para>- My intervention in the discussion is simply to amplify to some degree the reservations contained in page 20 of the report. I took the attitude that fundamentally committees of this nature had to explore all possibiliies of corrective action where Commonwealth ministries were involved, &#91;t was for that reason that I outlined my proposals (A) and (B) in the report. I know that probably my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> has gone into considerable depth on many other facets of the causes of crime. My only reason in submitting reservations was, to perhaps use the military term, in the nature of a snatch and destroy mission, because I felt something could bc done very quickly by the Commonwealth. For that reason I was very concerned about uniform firearms legislation. I felt that tha Minister for Customs and Excise <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Chipp)</inline> could take more dramatic action in banning the importation of all types of firearms other than those needed for police and military purposes. </para>

        <para>About 20 years ago the Daisy air gun was everyone&#39;s idea of a firearm, but we have passed a long way beyond that today. </para>
        <para class="block">All sorts of people now own very sophisticated weapons. I am fortified in my view by the remarks of a judge at a recent criminal trial in Adelaide. He was very strong in his condemnation of the accessibility of high-powered modern weapons. I have read an article by Detective Sergeant Nixon of the ballistics section of the New South Wales police force in which it was stated that in some of the recent major holdups that have taken place shotguns have been used and, with all due respect even to the combatants - lawman and lawbreakers alike - the use of shotguns can involve lots of innocent bystanders. I have been a constant critic in this field of the dilatoriness exhibited at times in trying to get 6 State Ministers to agree. I repeat that I believe that if the Minister for Customs and Excise took a firm stand the State Ministers would be galvanised into action. </para>
        <para>The other matter with which I wish to deal concerns the screening of migrants. I wish to be fair to the Minister for Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Forbes)</inline> to this degree: When this report was prepared - my reservations on it were drafted, I think, about a fortnight ago - I had been waiting for certain answers from <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Forbes</inline> dealing with a number of people, including the major figure in the attempted extortion from Qantas. Between the time that my draft report went to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laucke</inline> and the presentation of the Committee&#39;s report to the Senate today, I received a letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Forbes</inline> in answer to my questions. I ask for leave to incorporate in Hansard that letter from the Minister for Immigration. </para>

        </quote>
        <para>I contrasted the effectiveness of that system with our present activities in such matters in which, I think, we probe too far into the political background of migrants. If we have the machinery to do this in one field, I believe that the generalities used by the Minister are not sufficient. What is the position with organised crime today? Anyone who has seen the film &#39;The French Connection&#39;, or one or two other films on similar themes, will see emerging the fact that those in the top echelons of world-wide crime seem to be able to circumvent the laws of various countries. It is on this basis that my reservations are expressed. </para>
        <para>I say in conclusion that I believe that the reply the Minister has given is not specific enough. I am fortified by the case of a prominent Canadian criminal which came to rhy notice as late as yesterday. I am told that I must wait for an answer with respect to that matter. I know that my Queensland colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McAuliffe,</inline> has raised a question concerning confidence men who again are in the top bracket of crime. These people seem to peregrinate from one country to another. Our safeguards are not sufficient. These are the grounds on which I base my reservations. My beliefs as to why the Commonwealth could do more are epitomised in my reservations. </para>

          <para>- 1 found, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laucke,</inline> the  Chairman  of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Environment, presented to the Senate the report of that Committee on petitions seeking co-operation and financial assistance for crime prevention, that I could not agree with a number of comments which were made in his introductory remarks. I could agree with 5 per cent of what he said. It will be noted that my dissenting report takes up approximately 25 per cent of the body of this report. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I think that the Senate has reached the stage at which it must decide where it is going. I am not critical of the manner in which the petitions were presented. I am not critical of the fact that they went first to one standing committee and then to another. The Senate Standing Committee on Social Environment had not been established when the petitions were presented and they were referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Health and Welfare, from which committee they came to the Senate Standing Committee on Social Environment. </para>
        <para>I do not think that in carrying out our duties we have met the request of the petitioners. The dissenting report in relation to the majority report could become, I suppose, the cause of one of the greatest procedural aguments that could take place in the Senate. I hope that when this debate concludes today an opportunity will be made available for it to be resumed in the near future, lt does not matter which party is in government after November next. <inline font-style="italic">A</inline> decision has been made by the Senate once and for all as to how its Standing Committees are to deal with particular matters. </para>
        <para>I would like to refer briefly to the petition. It is not a minor petition as it was signed by 217 people. They required us to examine proper town planning and development to halt the increase in densely populated areas which leads to increased crime. At least that was the submission made by the petitioners. They referred also to the proper staffing and equipping of police forces to enable adequate crime prevention and detection measures to reduce the frightening increase of both solved and unsolved crime; the proper detention of and rehabilitation of criminals; and compensation to victims of crimes of violence, plus related subjects. </para>
        <para>The majority view of the Committee was that we would conduct a superficial inquiry. I do not say that in a disparaging way. We are all entitled to our opinions, lt was decided to obtain certain documentary information from some departments but we did not at any time under any circumstances, in my view, carry out the wishes of the petitioners. At page 18 of the report I say:   . . when the Senate deems a petition of this nature important enough to refer to a Standing Committee, then only an in-depth examination oi the petition can be described as satisfactory. </para>
        <para class="block">It is important to keep these matters in proportion because a number of other petitions are before various Senate standing committees. Several of them which relate to the Post Office have been referred to the committee on which are serving senators who have spoken in this debate. If the majority view in this case is accepted by the Senate obviously we cannot do anything at all about the petitions that have recently been submitted to us. Over a long period I have dissuaded people from presenting petitions here. In the period of 6 or 7 years that T have been here I have presented only about half a dozen petitions. </para>
        <para>I have adopted this attitude because there has been a long-standing tendency for petitions to be presented, duly recorded in Hansard and then duly stacked away, never to be seen or heard of again. If people feel badly enough about a community problem and several hundred of them put their signatures to a petition - sometimes several thousands - they must want something to be done about that particular problem. Petitions are presented in this chamber usually with great dignity and the honourable senator who presents the petition moves that it be received and read. Then the  Clerk  at the table goes through the process of reading out the terms of the petition. Sometimes we do not even go that far. If several petitions in identical terms are received usually only one or two of them are read in the chamber. 1 submit that in this case we should have made proper inquiries. 1 am not saying that the superficial inquiries made were out of order. They were not. It was the view of the majority that that was all that was necessary, but in my view we should have made in-depth inquiries. We should have taken public evidence from persons involved in the maintenance of law and all that flows from the maintenance of law in the States and Territories. We do not know the effect of environmental problems in initiating or perpetuating crime. We do not know whether the rehabilitation measures that have been adopted to varying degrees in all the States and Territories of the Commonwealth have had any effect on returning to the normal way of life those people who have resorted to a life of crime. No indepth research has ever been carried out right across the board, although it is true that some isolated research has been conducted. Such an in-depth study could be the job of a committee of this nature. It could sift through the evidence and ultimately come up with a suitable recommendation. That has not been done so far. </para>
        <para>I come back to the crunch of whether we should continue to accept petitions in this chamber and then just put them away somewhere in the archives or whether we should act on them. Should we allow them to be filed away where they will gather dust and mildew over the next hundred years and never be heard of again or should we provide that a petition that is considered by the Senate to be of sufficient importance should be referred to a standing committee of the Senate for investigation. In my view the proper thing to do would be to refer such petitions to standing committees, especially if the standing committees are expected to continue to operate effectively. If standing committees are to continue, resolutions of this nature ought to be referred to them. That is what I have said in my dissenting report. I have also said that I believe that the appropriate terms of reference of each standing committee ought to be decided in this chamber so that the members of the standing committees will be in no doubt whatsoever about what they have to consider. I repeat what I said very early in my contribution to this debate: I hope that we will not just file away this report because petitions are not considered to be of importance. I hope that a full debate will be held on this report as soon as possible and that a decision will be taken once and for all as to what we should do about the petitions presented in this chamber by honourable senators. </para>

            <para>by leave - The Senate has to deal first of all with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair&#39;s</inline> notice of motion, which will come on for debate in a few moments. If necessaryI will move the. relevant motion to avoid the problems of standing order 127 in relation to the 2- hour limit. Perhaps the Senate will be able to deal with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair&#39;s</inline> proposition within the time limit imposed. There are only 2 other items of Government Business on the notice paper. They are 2 Bills. One is the Public Service Arbitration Bill and the other is the Customs Tariff Bill (No. 2). After 8 o&#39;clock tonight the Senate would, of course, normally deal with General Business. I have looked at the orders of the day listed under General Business. Although a good percentage of them have been on the notice paper for a fair while, if it is the wish of the Senate not to go on with General Business tonight I would not resist such a move and would therefore move for the adjournment of the Senate. But I want the Senate to deal with the Public Service Arbitration Bill today if possible. If the debate on it is not concluded earlier I would want to keep the Senate going till 5.45 p.m., which would mean that the Bill would automatically be brought on first thing next week. But if the debate on that Bill is concluded prior to 5.45 p.m. I would not be very concerned about requiring the debate on the Customs Tariff Bill (No. 2), which is only a mechanical Bill, to be resumed. I repeat that if the Public Service Arbitration Bill is disposed of at a reasonable hour this afternoon I would be prepared to agree to the Senate adjourning. </para>

Therefore, I suggest that the Senate should earnestly consider agreeing to the suggestion of the Minister for Air. I believe that some of the lengthy statements that have been already made in the other place should be incorporated in the Hansard record of the Senate instead of being read by the responsible Minister in this chamber.

          </continue>
          <para>Recognising the importance of assisting primary producers to meet the changing rural situation, the Government introduced in the States Grants (Rural Reconstruction) Act a rural reconstruction scheme involving an agreement between the Commonwealth and the States with the appropriation of $100m for financial assistance to the States over a 4 year period to finance the scheme. When the scheme was introduced, it was agreed that the first review should take place early in 1972 at a time which would enable any adjustments to the scheme to be brought into operation by the first day of July 1972. It was agreed that the matters to be covered in the review were the funds to be provided, the allocation of the funds as between the States, the provisions for losses and write-offs available to the States, the interst rates to be charged to borrowers and the proportion of financial assistance to be applied to farm build-up. </para>
          <para>While in most States new administrative machinery had to be established, in New South Wales the scheme was implemented immediately. That State drew $4m for reconstruction assistance in the last month of 1970-71. In anticipation that there would be a heavy demand on funds when the scheme came into full operation, $40m was provided in the 1971-72 budget. In addition States had available $9.5m from pre-war reconstruction schemes. Effectively then, $53.5m was available for expenditure in the current financial year for reconstruction purposes. Through my Department and the Bureau of Agricultural Economics the respective State governments have provided information on the pattern of administration of these funds under the scheme. This enabled an effective review to commence early in March. Three meetings of Commonwealth and State Ministers took place during the course of the review, which was concluded on 5th April. The Commonwealth was represented by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden)</inline> and myself and the States were represented by the Ministers responsible for rural reconstruction. </para>
          <para>Before dealing with the outcome of these meetings it is appropriate to see the rural reconstruction scheme in the context of the Government&#39;s overall policy towards assistance for rural industry, particularly the wool industry to which the scheme was especially directed. Prior to the introduction of the rural reconstruction scheme, emergency financial assistance was provided to wool growers to the extent of some $22m. When announcing this emergency scheme to Parliament in August 1970 the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> - then Minister for Primary Industrypointed out that the total approach to solving the problems of the rural industry was essentially long term. The emergency assistance scheme was introduced as a short term measure to prevent a loss of confidence in the wool industry which would reflect throughout the whole rural economy. </para>
          <para>A year later, in August 1971, against a background of a further decline in wool prices it was considered necessary to introduce another short term measure, the wool deficiency payments scheme. At that time I stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The best advice available to the Government suggests that some improvement can be expected in wool prices. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Fortunately this improvement has occurred and since January the market prices for wool have been above the level of 79.37c per kilo guaranteed under the scheme. Thus no deficiency payments have been necessary during the last 2 months. Nevertheless, some $50m has gone towards increasing wool-growers&#39; receipts under this measure. Wool prices have improved to a useful extent, seasonal conditions are, in general, good and efforts are being made urgently to improve the marketing of wool, but the long term problems of rural industry remain. There are many farms too small to be economically viable units under present conditions. Many other properties, which could become economically viable have been prevented from doing so by a burden of debts which cannot be serviced over a short period. It was in the context of these problems that the rural reconstruction scheme was introduced. </para>
          <para>The overall demand for assistance under the scheme has been heavy although it has varied from State to State. Total assistance approved by States for rural reconstruction in the period to 31st March was $59.6m, made up of $49. 8m for debt reconstruction, 59.8m for farm build-up and $29,500 for rehabilitation assistance. Some $25m of these moneys had been actually paid out by the end of March. There is of course in this lag time between the amounts approved and the amounts paid on illustration of the inevitable time lag between commitment of funds through approval of loans and the actual payout due to the need to negotiate with creditors, to legal processes and to the delay in purchases of improvements and livestock where this is part of the arrangement. By February some States had already approved applications which fully committed the funds available to them in 1971- 72. If they were to be able to continue approving applications, an assurance was needed from the Commonwealth as to the funds that would be available in 1972-73. Further, some States expected expenditure commitments in 1971-72 which would be larger than the funds allocated to them. </para>
          <para>From me inception of the scheme the difficulty of determining the amount the Commonwealth would be able to devote to reconstruction was acknowledged. In particular, debt rescheduling involved payments to private lenders and stock mortgagees to a greater extent than was originally anticipated. While some two-thirds of applications for debt reconstruction came from the sheep and wheat-sheep farms, applications from other rural industries contributed substantially to the greater than expected demand for funds. The Ministers meeting, then, took place in a situation where there would be a hiatus in rural reconstruction unless there were a major revision of the arrangements for funding the scheme. A temporary cessation of financial assistance would have been contrary to the intention of the Act and would have had severe long term repercussions on the outcome of the whole programme of debt reconstruction and farm restructuring. </para>
          <para>A detailed examination of the level of funds required has been undertaken. From this it became clear that an increase in funds would be necessary in 1972-73 if the essential needs of producers for reconstruction were to be met. In these circumstances the Government decided that it was necessary to break with traditional budgetary practice and enter into additional commitments in advance of the normal review of overall financial requirements at Budget time. It was evident that a programme of approvals, consistent with cash to be provided to the States, was essential to an orderly approach to reconstruction. In order to reach agreement on a 1972-73 programme the Commonwealth entered the discussions with the States, prepared to commit funds to be available until the early months of 1973-74. </para>
          <para>The proposal which the States willingly accepted is that the Commonwealth provide, in 1972-73, the second full year of the scheme&#39;s operation, $56m or the whole of the balance of the $100m originally allocated to cover a 4-year period. In addition to the SI 00m which would be available for expenditure by the States by 30th June 1973, the Commonwealth indicated that it was prepared to provide a further $15m to fund approvals made in the later part of 1972-73 but carried over for payment into 1973-74. This would permit the administering authorities in the States to continue operations without a hiatus up to the end of the year 1972-73. </para>
          <para>The basis of allocation of the whole of the $100m and the $15m carryover of commitments between the States will be on the formula agreed to when the scheme was first established and in fact under the formula which was written into the original legislation in section 12 (1.). The first $3m of any subsequent Commonwealth funds for 1973-74, that is, the financial year after next, will also be distributed among the States on the same basis as at present but any additional funds provided in that year, that is, in 1973-74, are to be distributed on a basis to be determined at the time taking into account experience in operating the scheme and the expected needs of the States as assessed at that time. </para>
          <para>In recognition of the catastrophic effects of drought in Queensland the Commonwealth agreed to provide that State with $3m in 1973-74, outside the Rural Reconstruction Scheme but on the same terms and conditions as the financial assistance under that scheme. This amount will be used to fund approvals made by that State in 1972-73. There will, in addition, be a matching provision of $3m by Queensland from its own resources. This separate arrangement will enable that State to deal with the special reconstruction problem arising from a long period of drought which had resulted in a great many producers being heavily in debt and without the necessary stock to make use of the now plentiful pastures. Assistance to such producers must be prompt if it is to be of any use at all. </para>
          <para>In this significant forward commitment of Commonwealth funds, the States agreed to administer the scheme so that approvals will be programmed over the period up to 30th June 1973, within the limits of the funds now allocated and the specified carryover to 1973-74 financial year. On this basis the total amount which the States could approve for reconstruction loans by 30th June 1973, including those under the separate arrangement with Queensland as well as those under the rural reconstruction scheme, will be $121m. This is in addition to the $9. 5m available from pre-war reconstruction schemes. The $121m will be split up on a State basis as follows: </para>
          <para class="block">
            <graphic href="051232197204134_18_0.jpg" />
          </para>
          <para class="block">It was recognised from the outset of our consideration of the problem of rural reconstruction that applications from farmers wishing to replace part of their existing debts by a borrowing from a rural reconstruction authority at a concessional interest rate would exceed the amount of funds which the Commonwealth would reasonably be able to provide for the purpose. While it has been the Commonwealth&#39;s intention to offer substantial assistance of this kind, it has been emphasised from the outset that maximum emphasis should be placed on financing farm build-up, which offers the only prospect of establishing rural enterprises on a fully viable basis in many circumstances. To this end a provision was inserted in the agreement with the States that the general objective would be that one-half of the financial assistance made available over a period of 4 years would bc applied to farm build-up. </para>
          <para>The Commonwealth has accepted that in the initial period of operation of the scheme, it was not practicable to achieve the 50 per cent farm build-up objective because the immediate demand was for debt reconstruction assistance. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth and the States have agreed that the general objective in the agreement for 50 per cent of funds to go to farm build-up will bc maintained, lt appears probable that different circumstances from State to State will make it inappropriate to achieve an exact 50 per cent of farm build-up to total assistance in each State. However, it is an understanding that, provided the States encourage farm build-up applications to the maximum extent possible and approve all cases which are assessed as viable, this will be accepted by the Commonwealth as the closest compliance with the general objective, that is practicable. If estimates made by the various States of the extent to which reconstrucion funds would be required for farm build-up prove correct the proportion going to farm build-up will have reached 20 per cent by the end of June 1972. The estimated proportion of funds going to farm build-up during 1972-73 will be increased by 10 per cent to about 30 per cent. On the basis of these State estimates, in the latter year 2 States, Western Australia and Queensland, will be spending almost as much on farm build-up as on debt reconstruction. </para>
          <para>The Commonwealth agreed also that the period of loans to farmers for farm buildup purposes could be extended for a term up to 30 years at the discretion of the </para>
          <para class="block">State administering authority. This will mean a marked reduction in the annual interest and capital repayments by the farmer to the authority. I believe that this will considerably assist the States in achieving the farm build-up objective. This is important because of the real long-term benefit which will flow from restructuring farms of uneconomic size. The advantage of lengthening the. term of the loan will be apparent to honourable members. By way of example debt reconstruction loan of $10,000 at 4 per cent repayable by equal instalments of principal and interest over 20 years would require an annual repayment of $736. A farm build-up loan of $10,000 at <inline font-style="italic">6i</inline> per cent repayable by equal instalments of principal and interest over 30 years would require an annual repayment of $746. Thus loans for both debt reconstruction and farm build-up at the maximum periods and at the prescribed rates of interest require an annual repayment, covering both capital and interest, which is less than 7&#177; per cent of the amount of the loan. By way of contrast a loan of $10,000 at 6* per cent over 20 years requires an annual payment of $890, which is very close to 9 per cent. Likewise it was agreed that States were at liberty to extend temporary relief by way of debt rescheduling to farmers having difficulty in meeting their instalments due to unexpected circumstances beyond their control. </para>
          <para>At the review meeting the Commonwealth and States agreed that rehabilitation loans for farmers obliged to leave the industry and suffering personal hardship were not sufficient to meet the farmer&#39;s needs at a time of personal readjustment. Accordingly the maximum amount of the loan has been increased from $1,000 to $3,000. Associated with the changes agreed to by the Commonwealth was a request by the States that repayment obligations to the Commonwealth be liberalised. However, the consequent effects on State receipts from farmers seemed unlikely to be markedly affected in the long-term and it was agreed that no changes be made at this time but that the matter be kept under review. The State administering authorities will be very considerably advantaged by the long range funding which the review has established. This funding should enable all States to operate the scheme on a continuing basis up to the end of the  1972-73  financial year. </para>
          <para>I am sure that honourable members will agree that Australia could not face a situation where rural reconstruction was brought lo a sudden halt, and the new financial provisions were proposed by the Commonwealth and agreed to by the States in the full realisation that the States Grants (Rural Reconstruction) Act will need to be amended in  1972-73  at least to the extent necessary to accommodate the funds in excess of the original $10Om which will need to be provided in  1973-T4. </para>
          <para>During the course of the review Ministers agreed that there would be merit in the administering authorities conferring to discuss the overall administration of the scheme in their respective States and in this regard a meeting will be arranged within the next  2  months. The objective of the meeting will be to ensure, as far as possible, maximum uniformity in the administration of the scheme throughout the Commonwealth. </para>
          <para>In the course of the discussions of rural reconstruction Ministers referred to the allied problem of rural credit generally and also the particular difficulties being faced by our horticultural industries outside the context of restructuring of individual farms, lt must be recognised that the rural reconstruction scheme is only a part solution to the economic difficulties of our rural industries. In the same way that the complex problems of the wool industry are under separate special study so, too, are urgent examinations being made into rural credit facilities and the over-production of canning fruits and pome fruits. </para>
          <para>The House will be interested to know that the review has shown that so much has been achieved in the relatively short period since the scheme was introduced. The new funds now provided by the Commonwealth will ensure continuity in the job of readjustment in agriculture to take account of changed market and economic conditions. Indeed, the review supports my belief that the scheme will be of real long term benefit to all Australians, not just the farming community. In conjunction with other schemes for rural assistance and allied with the improvement in seasonal conditions and the. present upturn in mar ket realisations, rural reconstruction has contributed to the presently improved circumstances of primary producers. </para>
          <para>The scheme itself is intended to provide supplemental finance for the rural industry. There is no intention that the money should replace existing and traditional sources of finance and it is important that traditional lenders fulfill their existing role in the industry. Traditional fiancial institutions in joining with the rural reconstruction agencies in advancing funds to applicants for reconstruction and in debt composition will make a positive contribution to the restructuring of rural industry to the advantage of farmers, traditional lenders themselves and the community. I trust that all will be prepared to do so in the present improved circumstances for rural lending. </para>
          <para>Serving as it does to supplement rural credit and to facilitate adjustment in the rural sector, the rural reconstruction scheme has already established itself as a worthwile catalyst towards reviewed viability in primary industry but it is, none the less, one which the Government will continue to keep under examination. </para>

              <para>That the Committee present a report to the Senate within twenty-eight days.  lt is not my intention to make a lengthy address in support of this proposition. I shall content myself with giving the reasons why my colleagues and I in the Australian Democratic Labor Party have been motivated to submit this proposition to the Senate, hoping for its approval and approbation. I want to make it clear that we are motivated and influenced in doing this by the paramount consideration - the public interest. I am conscious of the fact that an unsuccessful attempt was made in the House of Representatives to obtain approval for the appointment of a judicial inquiry into this projected takeover of Ansett Transport Industries Ltd by Thomas Nationwide Transport Ltd. To follow that process here would not have advantaged us to any extent so, as fur as I could see, the only alternative left to us was to refer this matter to an appropriate Senate committee for investigation and inquiry, that committee having the usual powers which are enjoyed by similar parliamentary committees in the matter of obtaining evidence. I repeat that the public interest is paramount in our consideration of this matter. It is not a question of having a brief for one company as against the other but 1 direct attention to some evidence in my possession which would justify a very close investigation into the foreign content of the finances of the takeover company. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>In my view, there are at least 6 major reasons why this matter should be referred immediately to the Senate Committee. Firstly, the suggestion has been made in the Press and in other places that a successful takeover of Ansett by TNT would result in increased monopolisation and lack of competition in the freight transport industry. As we all know, sometimes it can be to the advantage of the public when wasteful duplication is eliminated by 2 industrial giants merging their services. On the other band, increased monopolisation can be to the disadvantage of the public - in most cases it is to their disadvantage - and that is something that most people in our community consider undesirable. It is obvious at the moment that both Ansett and TNT are active in the freight transport business. As I have said, my concern is for the public interest. The people are asking these questions. Will the rationalisation in the freight transport industry be of advantage or disadvantage to the public? Will there be what the economists call economies of scale, or will there be monopolisation? I believe that the Senate Standing Committee could throw some light on these aspects. </para>
          <para>My second reason for seeking the reference of this matter to the Committee also involves a desire to protect the public interest and to throw light on the dark shadows in this case. I refer to the many suggestions which have been made to the effect that the takeover might be relevant to the provisions of the Broadcasting and Television Act concerning foreign ownership of Australian television stations. A quick perusal of Ansett&#39;s assets will reveal that Ansett owns ATVO in Melbourne and TVQ0 in Brisbane as well as having interests in 2 other television companies. I realise that TNT has acknowledged that it has not more than 12 per cent direct foreign ownership. However, there are such things as nominee companies. I am concerned to know how much indirect foreign ownership in TNT is exercised through such companies. Again I feel that the Committee could get to the bottom of this matter. I am in possession of a copy of a balance sheet of TNT which is written in the Japanese language. I cannot speak or read the Japanese language but 1 think the average person would be inclined to come to the conclusion that TNT has a very big Japanese content. In the event of my motion being carried I will make that balance sheet available to the committee of investigation. Furthermore I have a telegram informing me that TNT has borrowed heavily on short term in Europe to acquire control of Ansett. It goes on to say that it appears that the company will  be  fragmented to pay these debts, and that this will have a serious effect on staff, government guarantees, and so on. </para>

              <para>- Well, it could be, but it is evidence that there is a disquiet about this matter. I am asking for an investigaion. I am not saying that the allegations are true; I am not in a position to say that they are not. This is a matter for the Committee to investigate. I believe that it could get to the bottom of this subject. My third reason for seeking an examination by the Standing Committee for this takeover is that the whole operation is very much tied up with the 2-airline policy. The 2-airline policy involves a very delicate balance and the Government has attempted to preserve this balance through different regulations and controls. It even involves, as one newspaper put it rather jocularly, the type of biscuits served on each airline. Whether the preservation of this 2-airline policy is in the best interests of the public is something which is also worthy of consideration at the appropriate time. What my colleagues and I want to know, and what a lot of other people want to know, is whether this takeover will disturb in any way the delicate balance of the 2-airline policy. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para class="block"> My fourth reason involves a concern for the hundreds, if not thousands, of shareholders in Ansett Transport Industries Ltd. There are very many shareholders in Ansett who hold very small parcels of shares. They include retired people, small scale investors and even employees of the company. Do not let us gain the wrong impression that Ansett is controlled by large institutions. Many small shareholders have  an  interest in Ansett. I have seen the claim in one newspaper report that TNT needs to obtain only 30 per cent of the Ansett stock to secure a change in the board of Ansett and consequently a complete change in the company&#39;s policy. TNT already has 23 per cent ownership in Ansett and, therefore, needs only an an extra 7 per cent if this argument is correct. But what of the interests of those hundreds  of  small shareholders  to  whom I have made reference? Will their interests be brushed aside? Is there any truth in the claim about the effect of a 30 per cent ownership? These are all matters which could be fruitfully discussed and examined by the Committee. I am not claiming that anything is being carried out below board, as it were. Can we learn lessons for future takeover bids from this exercise? Is government intervention warranted in such cases? How do we protect the small shareholder? </para>
          <para>My fifth reason is related to the fact that the Federal Government should not be simply a silent onlooker in this exercise. That may be the role it has adopted but is it the correct one? After all, the Federal Government has a massive financial backing to the tune of $35. 8m in Ansett&#39;s borrowing programme to buy aircraft. This is no small amount in anyone&#39;s language. What effect could the takeover have on this borrowing programme? When massive amounts of public moneys are involved, as they are in this case, I suggest that the Federal Government should have a keen interest, if only to ensure that the integrity of the programme and the security of the backing are preserved. </para>
          <para>My sixth reason also is motivated by public interest. If honourable senators examine the takeover bid very carefully and have regard to the questions I have raised they will soon realise that a Senate committee investigation is the only way that the takeover can be subjected to public scrutiny. If only for the reason of clearing the air, such a public scrutiny is warranted and urgent. Obviously the Government has no intention of appointing a commission of inquiry. As I said at the outset, an unsuccessful attempt to get one was made earlier in the week in the other place. The only avenue remaining is a Senate select committee. An appropriate committee, the Senate Standing Committee on Primary and Secondary Industry and Trade, exists already and each Party is represented on it. It has the necessary staff to do the research. The staff has gained experience in other investigations. That Committee already has proved its competence in investigations it has undertaken. </para>
          <para>Those are the 6 main reasons why I am seeking the support of the Senate for my reference. I believe I have indicated sufficient matters of concern to warrant the investigation. At the very least an investigation by the Committee will throw light on the dark shadows to which I have referred. Neither company should have anything to fear from such an inquiry. I believe that most members of the public particularly the small shareholders involved, would welcome it. </para>
          <para>Let me emphasise that I am not attempting to prejudge TNT nor to cast any aspersions on that company. I would not go as far as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Crean,</inline> M.P., the Opposition finance spokesman in the other place, who described the proposed takeover as a hijack. I make no prejudgments about the subject but I take note of comments such as the following one which appeared in the &#39;Australian Financial Review* of 10th April: </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">Perhaps an inquiry of the type I proposed can sort out this patchwork. There is a further but secondary reason for my concern which I have not yet mentioned and that is the relationship between the transport industry and defence. The transport industry is one of the most important industries in the community life of any nation, lt is something over which all governments with any sense of responsibility at all times must exercise a very close supervisory interest. Ansett Transport Industries has 72 aircraft and 340 vehicles in the airline division and 213 buses. Its aircraft are the most important component in that collection. Their importance at a time of national emergency would be difficult to estimate or calculate. That is a further reason why the takeover bid certainly is no ordinary takeover. </para>
          <para>I believe that I have outlined sufficient reasons to justify the immediate reference of this subject to the Committee. I commend the motion to all honourable senators. I sincerely trust that if the motion is adopted the inquiry will be conducted with expedition and that the Committee&#39;s deliberations will result in protection of the public interest and greater public insight into a matter which should be of concern to all Australians. </para>

          <para>A desire to protect the public interest has been our chief motivation in the searching review of the  2-airline  policy which has been going on for months. During that review we concentrated on certain areas which we considered required attention at this time. The first of those was parallel scheduling. This has been the subject of criticism and complaint for some time. Over recent months we have been pressing the airlines very strongly to apply themselves to this problem. They have only just come forward with new timetables which go some way towards resolving it, but not all the way. I hope to be able to look at this in detail tomorrow and to have the schedules available for the weekend. </para>

The other matter we will be directing our attention to, as we have said here on many occasions in the past, is the concession fare proposition for the Australian internal air travellers at certain times on certain routes to certain places. There are questions involving country air services, greater emphasis on air freight and the general position of flights during curfew hours. It is interesting to me, having had a fairly long hard push on these matters, to find now so many enthusiastic people at my side, both in this place and outside.

To start with, it is involved in the infrastructure provided by the Australian taxpayers, which represents more than the investment in the whole of the airline equipment. It has to consider the interests of the Australian Airlines Commission. lt has to consider the market operator and his security - the Ansett Transport Industries Ltd group. Both the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> and I said quite clearly earlier this week that the Government will not permit any foreign takeover or action which would result in foreign control of Ansett Transport Industries.

              <para>- Before the suspension of the sitting for lunch I was referring to a number of matters in connection with the motion proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair.</inline> I referred to a number of activities which are being studied by the Department of Civil Aviation in pursuance of the examination of the  2-airline  policy. I introduce another comment that the  2-airline  policy is really not due for renewal until  1977.  But because of the lead time for aircraft purchase and the time for repayment of loans associated with aircraft purchase there is a case to study whether the airline agreement ought to be renewed in principle earlier than that date. That is the matter the Government is studying and it gives the Government the opportunity to try to bring about a number of improvements in the public interest. Many of these improvements have been referred to by myself and others in earlier days. As both the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> and myself have said on earlier occasions - particularly this week in answer to questions - the position regarding overseas ownership is being very closely watched in order to ensure that no action is taken by Thomas Nationwide Transport Ltd or Ansett Transport Industries Ltd which might prejudice the Commonwealth&#39;s position regarding its guarantees for the aircraft borrowing programme. </para>

          <para>Another area to which we have given close attention is the separation of airline accounts from other activities. Again, the possibility of the renewal of the 2-airline agreement allows us to develop this situation to finality with the people concerned in the 2-airline agreement. But whatever the outcome of the present takeover bid both ATI and TNT have indicated their intention of publishing separate accounts for the airline type activities of the ATI group. We welcome this indication. If the proposed Senate inquiry is agreed to it will cover many areas which are and which for some time have been under close scrutiny by the Government. We, as a Government, will accede to the proposals for the inquiry. We will assist the inquiry in any way we can. But before commenting any further one would want to wait and listen to the later developments in this discussion. </para>
          <para>In relation to television interest, I inform the Senate that this situation is also under close review at my request in my acting capacity for a brief period of Postmaster-General. The position is also under examination by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. If the proposal for a general inquiry is acceded to by the Senate the Board equally will have a great interest in the matter and will be prepared to help with the facilities in any way possible, as will the Department of Civil Aviation. Accordingly, as I have indicated, the Government supports the proposal moved by the Australian Democratic Labor Party. We await with interest the amendment to which, possibly, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> is about to give birth. </para>

              <para>- All right. I am going to develop this theme in a minute. Secondly, it could have dangerous repercussions in other takeovers if the Government is going to interfere with every business takeover on behalf of anyone who feels hurt - especially somebody who has been nurtured in the bosom of the Government for years. The Government could say that it is going to have an investigation into the takeover of any firm. Those are the 2 main reasons for my opposition. I hope to- </para>

              <para>- I was about to say that I hoped to expound on them. I think they are very good reasons why this is a futile exercise. Anyone who understands the stock exchange - I give way to honourable senators who serve on the Senate Select Committee on Security and Exchange - knows that if any party can obtain a block share of even IS per cent of a company, that party can go a long way towards dictating the policy of that company. On most occasions private subscribers do not send in their proxy. When one has 23 per cent of shares, one virtually owns that company. Therefore it can be said - excluding the matter of foreign ownership - that Ansett&#39; has been virtually taken over by TNT already. To have an inquiry about what is going to happen in regard to takeovers seems to me to be completely futile. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Of course we have been told by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> that the question of a monopoly arises. Just because 2 companies merge it does not mean that they are a monopoly. In this country a lot of pharmaceutical companies have merged but they did not become monopolies. Other pharmaceutical companies are still opposing them. Interstate Parcel Express Co., F. H. Stephens Pty Ltd, Mayne Nickless Ltd and Brambles Holdings Ltd still exist and they are prepared to exist alongside Thomas Nationwide Transport Ltd and its absorbed company, Ansett Transport Industries. There is no question whatever of a monopoly. Therefore there is no harm to the Australian people in regard to a monopoly because no monopoly exists. If honourable senators want to talk in terms of a monopoly they should talk about the  2-airline  policy. That gives a monopoly. I now turn to the matter of foreign ownership which seems to be the real cause for this inquiry. Foreign ownership can only be a worrisome problem in regard to the Broadcasting and Television Act. I ask honourable senators not to tell me that the Government is not looking into the matter. Do not tell me that the Australian Broadcasting Commission or Ansett are not looking into it to make sure that TNT is not owned by more than  10  per cent of foreign interest. So everyone is looking into this matter and we are going to look into it further. </para>

              <para>-  Parliament! I thought the honourable senator said &#39;palm&#39;. I beg his pardon. I withdraw my criticism of him. I could only hear one word. It just shows that I am getting old and deaf. When honourable senators have finished laughing I shall continue. Foreign ownership is the only thing that matters. It is being watched carefully by everyone concerned. Therefore, it is not a problem and it has nothing to do with the merger because the merger cannot take place if the foreign ownership in TNT exceeds the prescribed limit. The next thing about which we are told is that there will be unemployment. This was a completely erronous statement made by, I think, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair,</inline> because when these  2  companies merge they will grow. </para>

              <para>- I probably will. The subject of unemployment was raised, whether directly or indirectly, lt is a quite erroneous suggestion. With the  2  companies merging there will be an even bigger company with bigger prospects  - more road transport and more employment than previously. Certain employees of Ansett have mentioned to me the likelihood of their being unemployed. I have pointed out to them that they will be better off when the takeover is confirmed. The unemployment bugbear is absolutely false. I would like to reply to  2  things which were mentioned and which I thought were irrelevant. One referred to a balance sheet in Japanese. Let us face facts. Has the Government done anything to stop balance sheets being published in Japanese? The Japanese are certainly taking over many of our industries. Because a world company has a balance sheet in Japanese does not mean to say that it is Japanese owned. </para>

              <para>-  Not very successfully according to the honourable senator when I point out his foibles. He also did something which I thought was rather unworthy of him when he read a telegram - I still do not know the name of the author - which stated that TNT is borrowing on short-term, which it probably is. Large companies often .borrow on short term. Even small companies and house owners borrow on short term to carry them over. I cannot remember the second part of the telegram, but it inferred that things were not too good with TNT. </para>

              <para>-  It will take over all the activities of Ansett, debts and all. A company cannot take over another company and say: &#39;The debts do not belong to us&#39;. Of course, the debts belong to the company that is taking over. Anyhow, the Government will ensure that its contracts are upheld. To raise all these matters - unemployment, financial instability and Government loans - is to try to put to the public that TNT is not a good company to take over Ansett. </para>

          <para>It was stated that transport is important in a national emergency. Of course it is important in a national emergency. Do we need a standing committee to tell us that? Does it matter whether TNT takes over Ansett? TNT will be just as reliable and just as Australian as Ansett is at the moment. So there should be no interference. Reference was made to a gobbling-up operation. There would have been no gobbling up - this is my opinion - if <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Reginald,</inline> Ansett had not been so arrogant in the first place. It was obvious, from the first purchase by TNT onwards, that it should have a say on the board of Ansett. One would have thought that Ansett would have offered TNT a position on the board and said: &#39;Come and join us and we will make the venture a success&#39;. I think there are a lot of personalities involved in this. Because TNT was not invited to join the board it decided to go further and to take over Ansett completely. That is only my personal thought on the matter. There is no doubt that TNT is a very large company which has very lively interests and which is giving a high return on its investment. Ansett has been nurtured in the bosom of the Government and has been prepared to sit there knowing that it can thumb its nose at the Government because the Government cannot do anything about it. This favoured son of the Government is now squealing. So we all join in to try to give him a let-out. </para>

              <para>- All right. Consideration of the matter has been continuing for 5 years as far as the Government is concerned. For 5 years it has been continuing and nothing has happened. Suddenly something is happening as a result of the attempted takeover. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Reginald</inline> Ansett said that it is impossible to depart from the practice of parallel scheduling. What do honourable senators &#39;think will happen? Will the Department of Civil Aviation suggest different scheduling? <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Reginald</inline> Ansett will say: &#39;This does not suit us&#39;. To be fair to Ansett, I know that on one occasion it did alter its timetable, but Trans-Australia Airlines immediately altered its timetable to fall in line with Ansett&#39;s. They can do anything they like with the timetable and nothing is done by the Government. </para>

          <para class="block">Schedule airlines are given the concession of lack of competition on the basis that they keep to their schedules unless by some accident they cannot fly the scheduled aircraft. But this is not so with the 2 airlines at the moment. If it suits them, if they have not a full load, they will change aircraft. Honourable senators will know that time and time again, when they expect a DC9, a Friendship is used or the service does not operate at all. The Minister and his Department allow this to continue, with impunity, year after year. Cases have been brought to the Minister&#39;s notice. There is always an excuse. When one books 10 days ahead the airlines say that the particular aircraft is not operational. That shows how wonderful the companies are. Five to ten days ahead they know that the aircraft will not be operational. All these things are attributable to the 2-airline policy. We did not hear about concession fares until TNT suggested it. </para>

              <para>-  There have been group concession fares for years. The matter of separate accounts was raised. There should have been separate accounts years ago. An airline company and a road company should not have been allowed to run a television station and not have separate accounts. Suddenly, because TNT says that it will have separate accounts, Ansett says that it will do that. I do not want to dwell at great length on the subject of the 2-airline policy. It seems to me that the time has arrived when the Government should look at a 3-airline policy. There was a time when Ansett operated a third airline and did not object to it. I have no sympathy with Ansett in regard to this takeover. Did he ever think of Butler when he look over Butler Air Transport? Did the Government step in then? It did not give any help on that occasion. Today this man sees his empire going. I give him credit for what he did in building it up, although he was lucky in having an incompetent manager of Australian National Airways Pty Ltd when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ivan</inline> Holyman died and his son took over. That is when Ansett came into it. Nevertheless, he did build up this empire. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Ansett now is saying: &#39;How can road transport people know anything about the aircraft industry?&#39; I would like to know what Ansett knows about the television industry. There was a time when he was only a road transport operator. He was not an air transport operator. How did he know about air transport? It seems to me that practically all these arguments thai are advanced as to why we must have an inquiry are irrelevant. It boils down to the fact that this is a simple company takeover. There have been bigger takeovers, although perhaps not in Australia. But if we are to investigate any takeover when the person being taken over starts to squeal, I do not know where we will finish. I am surprised that the Liberal Party is supporting an inquiry into this matter. I know that, the Liberal Party is supporting the proposal because the numbers are against it so it may as well put on a good face. The Government is looking into the question of foreign investment, yet ii is prepared to allow a select committee of the Senate, which it never used to allow to investigate anything the Government was investigating, look into this matter. </para>

              <para>-  It may have. We are now reaching a pretty childish state of affairs with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair&#39;s</inline> interjections. For the reasons I have stated I feel that this motion is completely futile. The takeover is virtually an accomplished fact. If the foreign ownership problem is solved then the sending of this matter for inquiry to a select committee which already has enough to do is a waste of time. </para>

            <para>- The Opposition supports this proposal for an inquiry in broad terms. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turnbull</inline> has said that this is only a simple takeover and is no different from any other takeover of a company. We think differently. We think that this is a takeover which involves an important part of the Australian economy, lt involves a company which is in a special position under the laws of this country, lt is affected by the Airlines Agreements Act 1952, as amended. Its finances are affected by legislation of this Parliament which, in effect, guarantees loans for purchases of aircraft. In many ways, the operations of this company are inextricably mixed with national concerns. Its operations are a public affair, not merely a private affair. That is what distinguishes this takeover from some other takeover. It cannot be regarded as being one which has been selected for no particular reason out of the generality of takeovers which are occurring day by day. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I have circulated a proposed amendment to the motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair.</inline> Perhaps it might be convenient if I dealt with that immediately before developing the general matters so that honourable senators concerned may have an opportunity to consider its contents. It would not depart a great deal from what is contained in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair&#39;s</inline> proposal because, if carried, it would follow the main matter, that is, that there should be referred to the Standing Committee on Primary and Secondary Industry and Trade for inquiry and report: </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(1)">
              <para>The proposed takeover of Ansett Transport Industries Ltd by Thomas Nationwide Transport Ltd and, in particular- </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">That is the main matter and that would continue. The foreshadowed amendment deals with some of the paragraphs under that. The departure is not so very great but it seems to us to be important that there be some variation. Paragraph (a) in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair&#39;s</inline> motion suggests that one of the matters to be inquired into is: </para>
          <list type="loweralpha">
            <item label="(a)">
              <para>the ascertainment of the degree of nonAustralian ownership, whether direct or indirect, of the issued, share capital of Thomas Nationwide Transport and the financial participation of nonAustralian financial interests in the attempted takeover operation. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>We think that if the question of the degree of foreign ownership or control that should be permitted in the company is to be raised, which is so much a matter of public concern, the inquiry should not be limited to the share capital of Thomas Nationwide Transport Ltd; it should extend to Ansett Transport Industries Ltd. It is evident that insofar as Thomas Nationwide Transport Ltd has foreign ownership, already to some extent Ansett Transport Industries Ltd has foreign ownership because it has that proportion of the foreign ownership, which is included in Thomas Nationwide Transport Ltd, included proportionately in its ownership. There may be other foreign ownership; there may not be. But if foreign ownership is to be considered, we think that it ought to be considered totally. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> pointed out, other interests may be involved. They may be involved in the operations which are going on now not only In relation to Ansett Transport Industries; there may be dealings in the shares of Thomas Nationwide Transport which ought to be looked at by the Committee. We think it is reasonable that this should be extended beyond what would appear to be the intention in the particular paragraph. </para>
          <para>The next paragraph of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair&#39;s</inline> motion refers to: </para>
          <list type="loweralpha">
            <item label="(b)">
              <para>whether the exercise, if successful, might be prejudicial to the Australian aviation industry and in the event what if anything, might be done to minimise the prejudicial effects. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">We think that if one is not to prejudge the question the paragraph ought to refer to the advantages or disadvantages and what might be done to maximise advantages or to minimise disadvantages. That is the purpose of paragraph (b). Otherwise, it follows substantially what appears in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair&#39;s</inline> motion. Paragraph (c) contained in our amendment is virtually the same as paragraph (c) in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair&#39;s</inline> motion except that it adds the words, &#39;If so, to what extent&#39;; that is, if there is a degree of. passage of control to non-Australian interests what is the extent of that. The next matter which appears in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair&#39;s</inline> motion is (d), which states:  to advise the Minister, in the public interest, how he should exercise his discretion to grant or refuse approval to the transaction involving as it does shares in Ansett Transport Industries Limited. . . . </para>
          <para class="block">The discretion referred to is that which is vested in the Minister by section 92 of the Broadcasting and Television Act. It seems to me that a committee of the Senate, and indeed the Senate itself, should certainly be entitled to inquire into the effect on the licences under the Broadcasting and Television Act, but I do not think it is right at any time for the Senate to require a committee of the Senate to put itself, or indeed for the Senate to put itself in the position of advising a Minister what he should do. We are not an advisory body to any Minister. As a matter of principle I do not think we should enter into a sphere which is properly a sphere of executive government. </para>

          <para class="block">There would be no difficulty about that. The Committee would be invited and expected to express its views on these matters without turning itself into an advisory body to the Minister. Its function is to report to the Senate - I turn to the body of my proposal - on the matter of the proposed takeover. It may well be that this should be specified with some particularity because of the suggestions of enormous transactions taking place, not merely in regard to Ansett Transport Industries but also in regard to Thomas Nationwide Transport. Perhaps this is a matter that could be looked at in relation to the takeover. </para>

              <para>- The Committee is asked to express in particular its views on how this proposed takeover is being conducted. It must be a matter of great concern to the Senate and to the people of Australia to know how the ownership and control of a company, which is so important to the public and so wrapped up in the legislation of this country, is changing and how that change in ownership is taking place. I should think, without prejudging what the Committee might do, that it would be an important matter for the Committee to consider. </para>

Some of these issues are obvious to everyone. The operations of the &#34;companies involved are of such magnitude that they affect the lives of every &#39; Australian. One of the matters which the Committee no doubt will consider if the Senate agrees to this reference is the. effect of the proposed takeover on the operation of the Airlines Agreements Act. I draw attention to one of the provisions of one of the schedules to that agreement. I refer to the Second Schedule which, in part, provides: </para>

          <para class="block">What will be the effect of such a takeover, if successful, on Trans-Australia Airlines? It may well be that, if all that is said on behalf of the Thomas Nationwide Transport interests is correct, such a takeover will have a tremendously adverse effect upon Trans-Australia Airlines in that TAA will be subjected to competition by an organisation which has the advantages of integrated road and air transport although TAA is deprived of the advantages which might flow from such an integration. We are well aware of the limitations and difficulties under which TAA is operating because of the provisions of the Airlines Agreements Act and because of governmental decisions. </para>
          <para>There are other parts of the same agreement to which the. Committee no doubt will need to turn its mind. Clause 16 of the Second Schedule contains matters which are important for the consideration of the Committee. It provides: </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">I hope that out of any consideration by this Committee of the important problems that have been adverted to will come some additional benefits. Frankly, I hope that what is revealed by such an inquiry will flow to the benefit of TAA, considered as a public corporation, and to the interests of the Australian people. </para>
          <para>That affairs have been conducted in the way that they have been is quite unsatisfactory. It is quite unsatisfactory that takeovers of corporations which have a tremendous effect on the trade and commerce of this community should be allowed to go on in the way that is happening now. We know that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Garfield</inline> Barwick proposed that there should be a regular way of supervising and investigating proposed takeovers of this magnitude. We know that the Government so far has avoided, neglected and refused to introduce legislation to give effect to that proposal. The pressure of events has meant that the Government will be forced, even in its few remaining weeks, to do something about the public interest which is involved in such takeovers. </para>
          <para>I will say no more than that I think that the Committee will have an extremely important task to perform. It is not for us to go in depth into the matters which might be revealed by the investigations of the Committee. But I do suggest that the amendments that I have proposed might improve the motion. I would like to ascertain whether it would be. convenient for me to take the course which I have suggested, that is, not to move the amendments immediately in case they might be acceptable to the Australian Democratic Labor Party. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr President,</inline>the whole approach of the Australian Democratic Labor Party to this matter has been one of complete objectivity. We wish to show no preference to either of the participants in this commercial battle. For this reason and activated by what we think is genuine national public concern and the public interest, we thought that this matter should come under not merely the scrutiny of the Government but the scrutiny of the Parliament itself. There being an appropriate body, in the form of one of the standing committees of this chamber, ready to receive such a reference and equipped administratively and in terms of its personnel, we thought that this reference should be made to that committee, namely, the Senate Standing Committee on Primary and Secondary Industry and Trade. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The terms in which the motion has been couched indicate and, I think, reflect substantially this objectivity. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> has propounded a series of amendments. We ourselves were disposed, in pursuance of this attempt not only to be but also to reassure the society that we are totally objective in our approach, to make, by leave, a small amendment to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair&#39;s</inline> motion in respect of sub-paragraph (a), lt would read: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The ascertainment of the degree of nonAustralian ownership whether direct or indirect of the Issued share capital of Ansett Transport Industries. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>At a later stage <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> will ask for leave to insert those additional words, which means that the extent of nonAustralian equity capital in Ansett Transport Industries would come under equal scrutiny with that of Thomas Nationwide Transport. That again would reflect the objectivity we would hope for in discussion, approach and reference. So&#39; far as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy&#39;s</inline> proposals are concerned, we adopt that part of his sub-paragraph (a) which refers to the financial structure of Ansett Transport Industries. </para>

Senator Gair</inline>will be prepared to ask for  leave, if necessary, to amend his original motion to insert at the point I have indicated the words I have detailed. Our motion will then incorporate the idea embraced in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy&#39;s</inline> subparagraph (a), that the reference should include investigation of Ansett Transport Industries in relation to its component of foreign equity capital. But we do not see any point in adopting the whole of sub-paragraph (a) because we feel that it is substantially embraced within paragraph 1 and other paragraphs of our original motion. </para>

We cannot see that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy&#39;s</inline> proposition advances beyond- the point in our motion.

            <item label="(c)">
              <para>. Sub-paragraph (d) refers to the manner of the proposed takeover. This again is substantially mentioned in our subparagraph (a), in which reference is .made to the ascertainment df the degree of nonAustralian ownership, whether direct or indirect, of the issued share capital, of Thomas Nationwide Transport and the financial participation of non-Australian financial interests in the attempted takeover operation. We again feel that that area of reference is sufficiently wide, to embrace the element of concern which is felt by the Opposition and expressed in the more specific proposal embodied in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy&#39;s</inline> sub-paragraph (d), and perhaps (c). Therefore we do not feel there is anything which would add substantially to our proposal, beyond the insertion of the reference to the non-Australian component of the issued share capital of Ansett Transport Industries. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>The next matter relates to television. We specifically drew (d) in the terms which honourable senators will read, having consulted the statute. We drew it in very precise terms and in a very mild manner so that in no sense could Parliament have been construed as in some authoritarian way attempting to stand over the Minister in the exercise of his discretion, but merely adding the weight of his considered opinion after investigation which might assist the Minister when he comes to the exercise of his ministerial discretion. In those circumstances it is a matter of very great moment. We therefore feel that because our sub-paragraph (d) is precise in terms of the statute and mild, we should not abandon it in favour of the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy.</inline></para>
          <para>In respect of paragraph 2 of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy&#39;s</inline> proposed amendment, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> indicated by interjection that the proposal it contains would normally flow from the deliberations of the Committee, no doubt as part of its investigation. In the course of examining the operative and available law and administrative procedures, suggestions would be made and I see no reason why there should be a specification of something which is normal, natural and will flow almost inevitably from the deliberations undertaken before the Committee reaches its decision. Therefore we do not find ourselves able to embrace paragraph 2 of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy&#39;s</inline> proposed amendment. </para>
          <para>We do see that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy&#39;s</inline> paragraph 7, a machinery proposition, is a salutary provision, perhaps completely necessary. It reads: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The foregoing provisions of this resolution shall have effect notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Standing Orders or in any previous resolution of the Senate. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">As an abundance of caution that suggestion might be included and at the appropriate time <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> would ask for leave to incorporate it in his own initial motion. The attitude of the Democratic Labor Party is that we would seek leave to make first a textual amendment so that the reference to Ansett Transport Industries would be included in sub-paragraph (a) of our proposal. At the appropriate place we would add paragraph 7 of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy&#39;s</inline> proposal. Other considerations might be canvassed in a more ompendious motion, but the main object is to draw national attention and to express through Parliament national concern about this matter. </para>
          <para>I think the terms of our original motion are sufficiently embracing, comprehensive and adequate to enable this to be done. To try to specify in too much detail might destroy the whole purpose and perhaps the chance of success of the undertaking. I am concerned at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turnbull&#39;s</inline> observation because the Senate has expressed its concern on the question of foreign participation in the ownership of Australian resources and industry as has been said in the reference to a select committee of the Senate. That being so, it would seem to be a contradiction of the expressed will of the Senate if now, when there is a specific motion to invoke the scrutiny of the Senate, we should say: &#39;No, it is sufficient for the Government to scrutinise it&#39;. The Senate has in the general field expressed its desire that the whole matter should receive the attention of the Parliament. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy&#39;s</inline>paragraph 7 rather highlights the fact that this is a matter of concern to the Senate. A general reference has been made by the Senate to one of its select committees and it seems most appropriate and completely logical that this specific reference in a more limited field should similarly find ils home within a Senate committee. I particularly do not feel in any sense that the Parliament is trespassing in any way, if &#39;trespassing&#39; is at all the right word, on the powers or authority of the Executive Government. It seems to me not only a right of the Senate but a duty to refer this matter to a standing committee. </para>
          <para>I was also intrigued by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turnbull&#39;s</inline> confidence in leaving this matter in the hands of the Government because, as I understood him, he indicated that the Government is sympathetic to the Ansett complex. Therefore he is prepared to leave the decision on this matter to a government which he indicates is partisan in its approach. </para>

              <para>- Quite incorrect, but that would be the senator&#39;s disposition. That being his disposition, it seems to me that it would be much more logical for him to say we have the warrant as a Parliament to look at this matter, and not with the partisanship of the Government which he alleges and I do not acknowledge towards Ansett Transport Industries. For those reasons the Democratic Labor Party will take a stand on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy&#39;s</inline> proposal in the terms and manner I have indicated. </para>

          <para>I wish to make one more observation to the Minister. A very severe time limit has been laid upon the Committee in which to present its report. In the meantime, no doubt, there will be great activity at the commercial level and in inter-company manoeuvres. Obviously the Government therefore will be called upon - perhaps quickly - to exercise discretions, to issue permits, to transfer authorities or, in some way, to translate or sign contracts. We do not think that the Government should proceed to do such things - unless there is an inevitability about the situation and it is impossible for the Government to do otherwise - while the Committee is deliberating and before the Committee has brought in its report. I do not think that there should be any precipitate action by the Government. Such a proposition could not be embodied in the motion. It is also not a matter to which the Committee could give its mind or attention. But I do feel that the Minister should be invited to indicate whether he will await the deliberations and the decisions of the Committee before he issues the necessary transfer licences or permits or in any way assists, as the Government will be required to assist, the execution of this manoeuvre and the finalisation of the ownership of the company concerned. It is for those reasons that the Democratic Labor Party has taken the stand I have indicated on the proposed amendments. My Party adheres substantially to its motion and it will seek leave at an appropriate time to make the textual amendments to which I have drawn attention. </para>

            <para>-  Consideration has been given by the Government to the terms of the original motion and to the amendments sought to it by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy.</inline> I have conferred with the Minister for Civil Aviation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cotion),</inline> who has already spoken during this debate, about the proposed amendments and he has indicated to me that it is the Government&#39;s attitude that there is merit in some of the amendments proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> but that the Government is not persuaded that the remainder warrant an alteration to the original terms of the motion and therefore does not propose to support them. It boils down to this: The changes that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline> has indicated will be made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> at a later stage will be supported by the Government. They include the addition to paragraph 1 (a) of the motion of the words Ansett Transport Industries&#39; so that the ascertainment will be of the degree of nonAustralian ownership, whether direct or indirect, of the issued share capital of not only Thomas Nationwide Transport but also Ansett Transport Industries. The Government will also support the proposal to include paragraph 7 of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy&#39;s</inline> circulated amendment. </para>

          <para class="block">Having indicated that, I wish to make my own comments - I emphasise that they will be my own comments - in relation to this matter. The demarcation line has been drawn. From now on I speak wholly and solely for myself. First of all, I wish to express my general support for action to be taken in accordance with the general terms of the proposal. I think that there is general but not unanimous agreement within this chamber on this. There are 2 important aspects to this proposal. One is the particular interest that has been shown in this attempted takeover. Various speakers have put forward the reasons why they believe it would or would not be in the national interest and why they believe It warrants investigation. I do not propose to canvass those matters again. I think they have been canvassed sufficiently already. Although I do not necessarily agree with everything said by either <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> or any other  speaker,  I think enough has been said at the moment about the proposed takeover. </para>
          <para>The other aspect which concerns me is the manner in which this market operation has taken place. I tried to ascertain from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> what he meant by &#39;the manner of the proposed takeover&#39; in paragraph (d) of his amendments. He seemed to indicate that he was wondering about what might happen to the structure of Thomas Nationwide Transport in the event of the takeover proceeding and of some changes eventually coming about as a result of the takeover. I was not able to elicit from him any real meaning to be given to those words which went beyond the types of matters which would be investigated in any event under the other paragraphs of the reference. </para>

              <para>- I do not understand how that comes within <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy&#39;s</inline> proposal as to the manner of the proposed takeover. That is why, by way of interjection, I tried to obtain some elucidation from him. Perhaps I can talk about &#39;manner&#39; in a different sense or not limit myself to the sense in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> mentioned it. I would understand &#39;manner of takeover&#39; to mean the market operations and the general transactions which are involved as a necessary part of what will result in a takeover. I find some considerable cause for public disquiet in relation to a number of those things. I make no concluded judgments whatsoever. But if one looks at what appears from the Press reports to have taken place one finds that a number of steps taken in relation to this matter would warrant an investigation by an investigatory, body, if one were available in Australia to make such an investigation. </para>

There are some bodies such as the Commissioner of Corporate Affairs in one State or the Companies Registrar in another State, or an inspector under the Companies Acts in the States, which could conduct such an investigation under State legislation, but at the moment there is no Commonwealth body which is able to conduct that inquiry. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> interjected a moment ago that he thought that there was such a body. I assume he was referring to the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange. I would mention to him that he has expressed an interest on a number of occasions in that Committee reporting at the earliest possible date. In a statement to the Senate in </para>

              <para>- I thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> for making that clear. I do believe that there are matters of public concern as to the conduct of the capital markets in Australia - the conduct of general stock market practice - which may very well warrant investigation. I think we should make it clear as to whether it is intended that this Committee ought to include those matters in its investigation because by leaving in the terms of reference such things as &#39;matters incidental thereto&#39; it may well be that the Committee will have the power to examine them. I think the Senate should indicate whether it intends the Committee to look into the market operations side as well as into the public interest side. I am not saying that there is not a public interest aspect in market operations because there is. But the debate so far has been associated with the general public interest rather than being directed in any way to the question of market operation. I think the Committee would be advantaged by having some indication from the Senate on what it requires of the Committee in this respect. I think that if the Senate requires a quick investigation and a report within 28 days, obviously the Committee will not have enough time to conduct fully both types of inquiry. In fact, I would have some considerable doubt whether it would have time to conduct the first type of inquiry, namely, that which is clearly stated within the proposed terms of reference. </para>

              <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> has expressed his view that this matter should be raised. I believe it is important that this whole matter should be clarified during this debate. I do not raise it because I wish to create difficulties for anybody in the consideration of this question. Let me mention some of the things I have in mind that this Committee could investigate. I very deliberately omit a number of matters which I regard to be of importance. If Ae Committee concerned itself with all of these matters the inquiry could take some time. It could investigate the circumstances surrounding the $6m share placement by TNT which was an integral part of the first part of this undertaking. Should the investigation by this Committee of the takeover to which we are referring include the initial steps? I refer to the purchase by TNT of 23i per cent of the issued share capital of ATI? It may be that that placement which was part of the means by which the original purchase was able to take place is a matter which would come within the Committee&#39;s terms of reference; it may be outside them. Again, I think this needs to be specifically spelled out. </para>

              <para>- I would think that it is, but I think that this sort of thing needs to be spelled out for the. benefit of the Committee since it has to do a job within 28 days. That is a short period in which to do it, especially when the investigation of each one of these matters could require a considerable amount of time. If the matter to which I have referred is to be investigated by the Committee, let that be made clear. Another matter that I wonder about from the point of view of stock market practice is the reports of the private briefings of limited numbers of shareholders by the directors of TNT. Again, is that a matter into which the Committee should make inquiries and make comment? Another matter concerns the circumstances surrounding, and the nature of, the public statements made by the directors of both companies which apparently were intended to affect the market value of the shares of each of those companies and which were, made publicly to the Press and not to the stock exchanges. Those are matters of very considerable importance in relation to the manner - I use my meaning of the word manner&#39; - in which this takeover has been effected and the defence to the takeover has been effected. Are they intended to be included? Are the actions which were taken in possible market support of the shares of both of those companies intended to be included in the matters incidental to the terms of reference of the Committee? </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Suggestions have been made in the Press - I do nothing more than simply refer to what has been said in the Press - that there has been, or was likely to be, market support engaged in by those assisting and those participating in either trying to take over or trying to defend the takeover. Are they matters which are intended to be included in the terms of reference? If they are not, then I think the Senate&#39;s view in relation to those matters should be made reasonably clear to the Committee. I have mentioned only a few of a very considerable number of matters which conceivably could be of concern to the Senate and which could be investigated by the, Committee if lt took a liberal view of its terms of reference in relation to matters incidental to the general question of the takeover. </para>
          <para>Will the Committee be concerned to find out in detail the. financial structure of TNT not only as at present but also in the future? Is this important as to exactly how the takeover is to be financed? In view of our 2-airline policy and in view of the extent to which the Government is involved already in the support of Ansett Transport Industries, it may be that if the future structure of that company and TNT is to be something which is supported by, shall I say, paper issue, only rather than hard cash we may find ourselves in a situation where the Government has to come to the rescue. I do not think I need dwell upon the problems that arose for Australia as a result of the crash of Mineral Securities Ltd which some may believe resulted from an over-extension on short term credit. Is that one of the matters which is to be investigated by this Committee? In other words, is the Committee to find out - if so, in what depth - in what manner the financing of the takeover eventually will be supported? I mention these things only because I think it is important that they be clarified. I am not urging in any way that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair&#39;s</inline> motion should be altered; although I think it would be helpful if he and the members of his Party gave some consideration to these matters and, simply by way of indication to the Senate, clarified his meaning and the way in which he believes the Committee should procee.d to carry out its inquiry. A very great number of points could be raised in relation to this matter. I think probably most of them are better not raised at this stage. For that reason I do not propose to say anything further except to raise, as I have, just a few of the more outstanding possible other lines of inquiry in which the Committee could be involved unless it receives some reasonably clear indication from the Senate that it is not required so to do. </para>

              <para>- Yes. As to the second point, I think it would have been helpful to suggest possible advantages as well as disadvantages. I am inclined to agree that most of the matters would be covered by the term &#39;matters incidental thereto&#39;, so that does not disturb me. The only difference between us about which I am really disturbed is the question of. the Committee being asked to advise the Minister. I regard that as a matter of principle. I do not think the Senate should put that in a motion of reference. That is what concerns me. Whatever may be the outcome of this matter, I think the proper course for me to adopt is to move the amendments I have foreshadowed. I realise that there is very little difference between us now in relation to the other matters, but rather than cause any confusion I will take the course simply of moving the amendment and let the matter go as it is. There may not be need for the Senate to divide on this matter. I move: </para>

            <para>- I wish to speak briefly about some of the matters referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> and also to raise some other matters relating to episodes of the attempted takeover by Thomas Nationwide Transport Ltd of Ansett Transport Industries Ltd. I think it is important that this matter should be investigated by a Senate committee not only for the reasons put forward already by the mover of the motion <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gair)</inline> and by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> but also because I believe there are some quite fundamental questions to be considered involving the ownership of Australian industry and the manner in which that ownership is acquired as a result of recent developments on the conflict between the board of TNT and the board of ATI. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> that a number of these matters could be dealt with elsewhere if there were a national supervisory body to deal with operations on the securities markets, but there is no such authority at the present time. Accordingly, if there is to be any investigation of this matter as it relates to the present situation with which we are faced it will have to be done by the Committee to which the motion suggests that it be referred. Apparently <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> speaking on behalf of the Government, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne,</inline> believe that these matters may be considered and probably would be considered by the Committee when the reference does take place. Nonetheless I believe that some attention should be drawn to some of them. This present confrontation is of considerable importance to Australia for at least 2 reasons. One of them is the fact that on the outcome of the present conflict depends the ownership of the Australian transport industry. I do not wish to comment on its merits but if TNT is successful in its takeover offer we will find that consolidated in the hands of one group, the board of TNT, will be the direction of a very large, preponderant sector of the Australian transport industry, involving planes, trucks and ships. In fact there will be very little privately owned transport of any significance not in the hands of the conglomerate giant which will emerge as a result of a takeover of Ansett Transport Industries by the Thomas Nationwide Transport group. </para>
          <para>The other matter also of great importance is the fact that at present $35. 8m is still owing by Ansett Transport Industries on loans guaranteed by the Commonwealth. Privately owned assets which somebody is attempting to buy are not the only things involved in this matter. Also involved is a very considerable direct interest on the part of the Australian Government and the Australian people amounting to $35.8m. There can be no doubt that the resources which have been available to Ansett Transport Industries for the borrowing of funds were increased considerably by the fact that the Commonwealth guaranteed these loans amounting to $35.8m. </para>
          <para>I believe that in some respects this conflict is very alarming. At an early stage in the present crisis a statement was attributed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Thomas.</inline> He was alleged to have said: The name of the game is money, money, money&#39;. He subsequently was reported as having denied that. But in this morning&#39;s Melbourne &#39;Age&#39; he was reported as saying that he did not say: The name of the game is money, money, money&#39;. In his own words, what he said was: &#34;The name of the game is money, money, money, money - money is the name of the game*. He is reported also as saying: &#39;But I only said that because Peter was speaking at the time and I wanted to make myself heard&#39;. Whatever the reason for this strange repetition of the word &#39;money&#39;, even if it were only used once I think this should be rather alarming to the Senate and to all Australians. Whoever is going to direct a very substantial sector of the transport of Australia, I would have thought that one of the primary concerns of air transport would be safety, safety, safety, not money, money, money. As a frequent air traveller I feel quite strongly about this although I do not normally patronise Ansett Transport Industries, whoever the shareholders are. In any event, however worthy a citizen <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Thomas</inline> may be, and however worthy the other persons involved may be, I do not think that money, money, money ought to be the primary concern of the Australian people in this matter. </para>
          <para>Another matter concerning the operations of Thomas Nationwide Transport which should give some concern is the recent issue of 6 million additional shares in that .company. If there were a securities and exchange commission in Australia it could investigate this matter. I believe , that this should be looked into by the Senate committee when the matter is referred to it. It would be very interesting to learn how the 6 million new shares in Thomas Naionwide Transport were distributed to the purchasers of those shares. Can we be confident that there was nothing in the nature of insider trading? What rights did the existing shareholders of TNT have to the purchase of these shares? Was there any privileged access by any persons to the 6 million shares issued by TNT as part of this, takeover bid? Which persons were advised that they were available for sale? What preferences were given, if any, to any persons who wished to acquire these shares? . </para>
          <para>I am not trying to suggest that there is anything unusual about the conduct of TNT in comparison with that of ATI. If we look at ATI we also find some rather strange developments. On 26th March there appeared in the Sunday &#39;Australian&#39; a report of an interview with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Reginald</inline> Ansett and I have seen no contradiction by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Reginald</inline> of what was stated. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Reginald</inline> was asked by his interviewer something to this effect: &#39;What about a TNT man on the board of ATI?&#39; The report states&#39;: . </para>
          <para>I put people on the board&#39;, said <inline font-weight="bold">Sir &#39;Reginald</inline> Ansett emphatically. </para>
          <para class="block">This is probably true. I dare say that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Reginald</inline> does put people on and off the board. At the same time I think that we should look at a public company., which receives many millions of dollars in loans guaranteed by the Government when: such a strange and autocratic procedure &#39;is adopted in its administration. One person, the  Chairman  of Ansett Transport Industries, is able to say: &#39;1 put people &#34;on the board*. My understanding of the Companies Act is that people are put on a board by elections of shareholders, not by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Reginald</inline> Ansett or any other individual. I think it is disturbing that there is such blatant sole personal control of a large national enterprise, as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Reginald</inline> Ansett said on this occasion. </para>

              <para>- That will save both of us a lot of time. The other matter I wish to refer to with regard to the conduct of Ansett Transport Industries is a statement made on Sunday in the form of a Press release by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Reginald</inline> Ansett. He said that he intended to increase by 50 per cent the dividends paid on shares in Ansett Transport Industries. He said that the matter would be referred to the Board on the following day. Apparently he took it to the Board on the following day. No reports had been made to the Melbourne Stock Exchange or any other stock exchange of the intention stated by the  Chairman  1o double the dividends payable by Ansett Transport Industries Ltd. One might have been justifiably startled had one looked at a list of the directors of Ansett Transport Industries. None other than the  Chairman  of the Melbourne Stock Exchange, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Cecil</inline> Looker, was sitting on that Board which acted precisely as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Reginald</inline> said it would act only the previous day by way of a Press statement. No report whatsoever was made to the Melbourne Stock Exchange. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>Again, just recently, we saw what happened in both Sydney and Melbourne where <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Peter</inline> Abeles and various other persons from Thomas Nationwide Transport Ltd - to return to that organisation - approached groups of institutional investors seeking to enlist their support and obtain their money to go into Thomas Nationwide Transport. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Peter</inline> is reported to have given a most eloquent address just recently to a group of some 40 representatives of institutional investors in Melbourne. This was commented upon in a very perceptive article in the &#39;Australian Financial Review&#39; which asked: &#39;Are the public less equal than some?&#39; These are matters of very great concern. We are particularly concerned about foreign ownership which already exists and which is increasing in Thomas Nationwide Transport. Such ownership could play an important part in any merged company. Indeed, as the amendment and the motion indicate this matter should be investigated insofar as it applies to Ansett Transport Industries. But seriously problems affect the whole of our economy, our transport services and the financial system of Australia. These are important matters which should come before the Committee. I trust that the amendment which has been moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> will be carried. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator COTTON</inline>(New South Wales - Minister for Aviation) - by leave - I shall say one or two things quite briefly because I think this will aid the process of discussion. Regardless of any outcome of this motion safety will not be compromised. That has been said before, it will be said again and it is said now with the greatest possible emphasis. Earlier I thought I might not have a chance to speak again and that is why I asked my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> to indicate to the body of the Senate the Government&#39;s view of the motion moved on behalf of the Australian Democratic Labor Party and the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy.</inline> I thought it proper that the Senate, as a body, should learn as soon as possible in this sort of discussion the Government&#39;s view. That is what we were doing with the kind cooperation of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae.</inline> The point made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne,</inline> of course, will be taken seriously by us and will be kept under constant review. The honourable senator may be sure that the matter is being watched. We felt a slight concern, which we expressed to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne,</inline> regarding the use of the words: &#39;advise the Minister&#39;. We thought that perhps this could stand a change. We welcome a change. I understand that he and his leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gair)</inline> have some suggestions which they may care to make on this matter. We shall be very happy to hear them. </para>

          </talk.start>
          <para>Other  honourable senators. 1 indicate my support for the motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair,</inline> lt has support from all sides of the chamber except one. I think I indicated to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turnbull</inline> - 1 am sorry that he is not here - my view of his remarks when he started speaking by saying: &#39;What rubbish&#39;. I said that quite early in his comments. After listening to  him  I had no reason to change that opinion. I believe that not only is there merit in the Senate Standing Committee on Primary, Secondary Industry and Trade examining this matter but also I believe that there is a responsibility on Parliament to be informed on this matter. lt is a matter of great public interest. Where matters are of great public interest they are the real concern of Parliament. I indicate quite clearly that I shall oppose with every means in my power the takeover by Thomas Nationwide Transport Ltd of Ansett Transport Industries Ltd unless I am convinced that the public interest is best served by such a takeover. </para>
          <para>I- indicate - although my mind may or may not be open - that 1 am far from convinced at this moment that the public interest would be best served. That is why I welcome this motion. I believe that this matter should be thoroughly investigated by Parliament and not by the Executive only. Parliament should make up its mind and it should make the final decision. It is the responsibility of Parliament. Parliament cannot and should not avoid its responsibility in matters such as this. That is why I am speaking and putting the view which I believe should be put. I ask honourable senators to understand that the final responsibility is upon us as members of this Senate and of Parliament. I shall make only one or two other very brief comments. I have been impressed, as others have been, by the spontaneous reaction of Ansett employees in supporting their company. I do not think it is a matter which we should treat lightly. The views of 13,000 people - or whatever the number is - who are employed by a company must be of some concern to us. The employees have indicated their view quite clearly in a way which I should say must bring a flush of pride to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Reginald</inline> Ansett&#39;s heart. They are supporting him at this moment. ! &#39;&#39; </para>
          <para>The other point I mention is &#39;iri relation to Western Australia. Whatever . one may say about Ansett or anybody else, since ATI took over MacRobertson Miller Airlines. Services . in Western Australia there has been a most dramatic improvement in the services to the north-west; and Kimberley regions of Western Australia. As a Western Australian I do not think that I should let this service pass - unnoticed. Today this area is served by a- .complete jet fleet of the most modern jet aircraft. The services are equal to those anywhere else in Australia, and, probably, the. world. I do not think there is any area so .sparsely populated which today has the service which is provided to the north-west of Western Australia. I make the point, purely as a Western Australian, that I am vitally interested, as are my colleagues in Western Australia, to see that these services are maintained and, if necessary, improved. </para>
          <para>It has been the policy of ATI to improve services. A sixth jet aircraft is on order but whether delivery will be taken of it now I do not know because of a downturn in traffic. Nevertheless it is. ready to go into service to provide the needs of the north. With these few points I support this motion. This will be a major inquiry. I think a matter such as this is the correct type of reference to give to a standing committee. The Committee has a great responsibility to report to Parliament. Parliament has a great responsibility to make up its mind as to where the public interest lies. </para>

            <para>- I rise to support briefly the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy.</inline> Most of the matters relevent to the amendment have been covered. But I shall reiterate one or two points and perhaps bring forward one or two new points. It has been interesting to hear the 2 main divisions of thought which this takeover bid has caused. One is that it is another example of the machinations of the stock exchange. If the matter were as simple as that it probably&#34; would hot have been brought before the Parliament. In fact, it goes beyond that; Those honourable senators who have sat as members of the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange for the past year or two would recognise the takeover as being, in part, one of those jungle deals with which we have become so accustomed. I was interested to read in the Press that Patrick Partners is underwriting Thomas Nationwide Transport Ltd in this venture. I recall that Patrick Partners was intimately involved in the Minsec deal involving Queensland Mines Ltd and Kathleen Investments (Aust.) Ltd. I am sure that all its efforts were motivated by the purest patriotic intentions, as I have no doubt its efforts are motivated in this case. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>What we are concerned about is what will happen to the transport system as a result of the takeover. Without dwelling endlessly on the point and without reiterating the points which have been made, there is no doubt that the takeover will place TNT in a unique position. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Thomas</inline> has already stated the capacity  of  TNT to reduce its fares and costs probably by something like 20 per cent. It is interesting also that the matter will be referred to the same Committee as last year looked into the subject of Tasmanian shipping freights. TNT was asked to appear as a witness. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Peter</inline> Abeles - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Abeles</inline> as he then was - was the witness. One or two excerpts from the transcript of the hearing are interesting, in the light of recent developments. For example, at page 539, the first page of the evidence given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Abeles,</inline> he said: </para>
          <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
            <item label=".">
              <para>. we  are freight fowarders primarily. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">At page 541 he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">The company regards iself as a transport company, not as a trucking company, or a shipping company or an air freight forwarder. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">It was quite clear that he was endeavouring to convince the Committee that TNT was primarily interested in the carriage of freight, not the carriage of people. At that time there was not the slightest suggestion on his part that TNT would be interested in obtaining a foothold in the business of carrying passengers on aircraft, although 1 think it is generally known that TNT has a very definite interest in one intrastate airline service in New South Wales and also in a small operator in Queensland. It is also interesting to consider some other comments that he made. They leave me rather confused as to the intentions of TNT and of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Peter</inline> Abeles in particlar. At page 546 of the evidence he said - and this seems hard to believe: </para>

          <para class="block">These are not the comments of a company which would appear to be not concerned about putting itself in a unique position in the Australian transport scene. I would suggest that the intentions of TNT are quite different. Its intention is precisely what it has revealed its intention to be during the past week or so. </para>
          <para>I do not think it is a matter of defending one side or of whitewashing the activities of the other people involved, but it should be clearly understood that the overall effect of the takeover could well be to place competitors, particularly TransAustralia Airlines, in a most difficult position. Only last week <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Scherger, the  Chairman  of the Australian National Airlines Commission, said that unless TAA were allowed to expand and broaden its activities the added competition which will emanate from a combined Ansett Transport Industries Ltd-TNT operation, under the control of TNT, will put TAA out of business by the time the present agreement expires in 1977. I would think that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Scherger would be in a position to make that statement on an informed basis. For years the Government has accepted the principle of a 2-airline policy. The amazing part about the takeover is that if the Australian Labor Party and the Democratic Labor Party had not seen reasonably common ground on the subject the matter would not have been dealt with at all by the Parliament. A move to debate the matter in the House of Representatives was defeated by the Government. It would not have been even raised in this chamber. In other words, the Government would have been prepared to allow the takeover to go ahead and to become a fait accompli before anything could be done about it. That is why questions were asked this week. If the takeover were allowed to continue we would see what happened to the 2-airline policy. It would not be long before, as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Scherger said, TNT offered fares at a lower rate than that at which TAA could operate its airline. </para>
          <para>What has been the position over the years? Under section 92 of the Constitution, as I understand it, the private operator can challenge the Commonwealth on the fare structure. My understanding is that the private operator would be successful in that challenge. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Thomas</inline> has already stated quite clearly that the competition with TAA will be pretty sharp competition. Who is to say that TNT would not challenge the Commonwealth under section 92 and reduce the fares to a level which makes TNT more competitive than TAA? What happens to TAA then? Does it go bankrupt? Are we then back to a one-airline policy? Obviously the Government did not think about all the ramifications. It simply kept aside. I think it is a good thing that at least in this chamber there are sufficient people concerned that something should be done. What we would be headed for eventually would be a great monopoly embraced by the TNT organisation. Possibly the only answer if the takeover came about would be the formation of what might be termed a Commonwealth transport corporation in which the Commonwealth Government, through TAA, the Australian National Line and the various government railways, would set up a competitive organisation to combat what TNT would have formed itself into by then. No other private operator would be in a position to match it. </para>
          <para>For those reasons I support the amendment. There is very little in substance between the motion and the amendment. The intention is clear.

            <para>- It certainly is not my intention to speak at length on the matter under discussion. It is merely sufficient for me to say that I support the proposition that has been put forward by my leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy.</inline> I understand that in the event of that proposition being defeated, the members of the Australian Labor Party will then support the proposition that has now been proposed by the Australian Democratic Labor Party. We want to get down to an inquiry to ascertain the real facts of the matter in the public interest. I do not intend to attempt to debate the issues that will be the subject of inquiry by the Senate Committee because frankly I know very little about them. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I do not know either <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Reginald</inline> Ansett or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Thomas.</inline> I have no pecuniary interest in either company, but from what I have read in the newspapers it appears to me that determining the issues between <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Reginald</inline> Ansett of Ansett Transport Industries Ltd and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Thomas</inline> of Thomas Nationwide Transport Ltd is more like deciding whether Australian rules or rugby league is the best football game. The question has to be decided in the interests of the Australian people. Coming as I do from New South Wales, whichever company receives the mantle of rugby league will receive the mantle of support in the public interest. Of course, Ansett Transport Industries Ltd plays on 2 grounds, namely transport and television, whereas Thomas Nationwide Transport Ltd plays on one ground, namely transport. Certainly, if the Senate holds an inquiry it should be held on a neutral basis based on the public interest. I am rather interested to see the political arena move as it has in this matter when there is contemplation of a takeover of one Australian company by another Australian company and see the tremendous publicity that the proposed transaction has received. On the other hand the taking over of an Australian company by a foreign company seems to be regarded today as a mere matter of course. </para>
          <para>Again, I say that I know very little of the issues involved, but the matter is of vital importance to- the Australian public and to Australia as a nation. Much has been said in the Senate about employees of Ansett Transport Industries Ltd telegramming members of the Parliament urging the Parliament not to agree to any takeover because Ansett is  a good employer. They are enitled to do that and t do not doubt what they say. No doubt my colleagues like myself have received a telegram of this nature. But I also want to be fair to the other side in regard to employment. Again, I emphasise that I do not know <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Thomas</inline> or anyone^ connected with the management of Thomas- Nationwide Transport Ltd. I speak in this regard only on the basis of information conveyed to me by unionists. They tell rue that in their opinion and from their transactions with that Company, it is one of the best employers of labour in the transport industry. </para>
          <para>They have provided me with a summary of the superannuation scheme made available by Thomas Nationwide Transport Ltd to members of both wages and salaried staff under which for every 4c that is contributed by a worker to a superannuation scheme, the company will contribute 6c. Any permanent employee over 20. years of age who has been with the group for 2 years is eligible for membership of the scheme. The retiring age is 60 years for both sexes, but in certain cases if both the company and the employee agree it may be extended up to the age of 65 years. Any benefit that is payable by way of superannuation at the end of an employee&#39;s service with the company does not affect his entitlement to long service leave. Indeed, the benefits from the fund are paid in addition to the long service leave due to him. I put that on the record only to indicate that apparently from a labour relations point of view the employees of Thomas Nationwide Transport are satisfied with their employer, and union officials in Sydney advise me that they are satisfied to date with the arrangements that they have been able to negotiate on behalf of their members. </para>
          <para>All I can say is that if every employer acted in the provision of a superannuation scheme of this nature as TNT has acted, there certainly would probably  be little need for the major political parties to be contemplating the introduction of  a  national superannuation scheme at this stage. I am also told in regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair&#39;s</inline> comment this morning about a document being produced in a foreign language by TNT - I think the language mentioned was Japanese - that it is a publication put out by the company on an international basis. It is the company&#39;s annual report and balance sheet which I understand, is published In 4 different foreign languages. This company is proud of its achievements and its record in the transport field and industrial relations. I believe that that fact, too, should be placed on record, having regard to the basis of neutrality or impartiality on which we in this Senate should approach this question. </para>
          <para>One thing to which I particularly wish to refer is paragraph  1  (c) of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair&#39;s</inline> motion. It is proposed that the Committee should inquire into: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Whether the exercise, if successful, would result in a degree of control of Australian domestic airline operations passing to non-Australian interests. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Frankly, I think that is a matter of vita} concern because no Australian can afford to see any encroachment on Australian national industries over and above that which has taken place already as a result of the financial policies that have been pursued by this Government. In this regard, I draw the attention of the Senate particularly to section 92d of the Broadcasting and Television Act. This section sets out conditions as to non-resident shareholding in commercial broadcasting and television stations. It provides: </para>

            </list>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I hope that the investigatory powers of the Committee will enable it to inquire into that aspect. If a degree of foreign ownership that might affect the operations of Australia&#39;s domestic airline system is involved in this transaction, so too, is it in the interests of this country to see that no foreigner gets hold of any commercial television company operating in Australia. Knowing that Ansett Transport Industries Ltd controls  2  commercial . television stations in Australia, I believe that the Committee should look at this matter, having regard to its importance. . , &#39; </para>
          <para>I refer to one other matter that 1 think could well be considered by the Committee; that is, what will&#39; be the effect of such a takeover on these commercial television stations? When Austrama Television&#39; Pty Ltd, which is a subsidiary of Ansett&#39; Transport Industries Ltd, was granted its licence to operate in Melbourne in about 1963, it undertook to provide a 58 per cent Australian content in its programmes in its first year of operation. That company has now been operating its television  station for 8 or 9 years. According to the. latest report of the. Australian Broadcasting, Control Board, which is for the year ended 30th June 1971, the total Australian content in the television programmes presented by that company in Melbourne is 55.5 per cent. That content is above the Australian Broadcasting Control Board&#39;s stipulation of a 50 per cent content; nonetheless it is still under the original percentage that Austrama Television Pty Ltd undertook to provide in its application to the. Board for the television licence. The same remarks apply in relation to TVQ in Brisbane. The total Australian content for the , -same period for that station was 48.4 per cent, which is under the 50 par cent requirement prescribed by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. If the takeover bid is successful those licences will be acquired. The Committee should inquire whether a new company taking over control of those licences will undetake to comply with the Australian content . provisions stipulated by the Ausralian Broadcasting Control Board. </para>
          <para>I know that, going on past practices, a Senate committee inquiring into this matter will approach its task on a fair and. reasonable basis, in the knowledge that justice must be done on all sides but having in mind the public interest and the interests of Australia. Whatever may be the outcome of the recommendations of the Committee, I trust that the Government will take much more notice of them than it has taken of the reports of many other Senate committees. The report of this Committee on this reference will be of tremendous value and importance to the Australian people. But we cannot allow the report to be tendered to the Senate, and perhaps debated by the Senate, and then have nothing more come of it. The Government will need to heed the recommendations of this report. Probably the report will be the test of the future success or otherwise of Senate standing and select committees. Therefore, I urge that, once the Committee delivers its report to the Senate., the Government immediately give that report all the consideration that it can and act upon its recommendations. </para>

            <para>-  I rise to support the motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair,</inline> and as amended. I do so, firstly, because I think that this is the first reference of this type to a Senate standing committee. This is the type of reference that I had always hoped would have gone to standing committees - not the airy-fairy, long drawn out, nebulous references which, in the main, standing committees have received in the past. This is a first class example of dealing with an urgent situation. The Standing Committee on Primary and Secondary Industry and Trade is being given directions as to which way it should go and, what is terribly important, a time limit is being placed on the Committee with respect to its consideration of the reference. The Committee is being told to report in 28 days and not to wander off on ali the by-ways and paths for the next couple of years. I sincerely hope that the balance of the Senate takes note of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> has done and applies this example in respect of future references to standing committees. </para>

              <para>- I hope that the DLP, having gone along this path, will npt be led astray in the future. I say, secondly, that I think that such an inquiry ought to take place. I have been somewhat surprised that, since the first announcement of the intentions of Thomas Nationwide Transport Ltd, some suggestion has been made that this is none of our business. A suggestion was made that the Government ought to do something about this matter. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para class="block">Whether the Government wants to do something is the Government&#39;s business. But it is not the Government&#39;s business alone. It is also the Parliament&#39;s business. It certainly is the Senate&#39;s business. I speak as one who, in common with my West Australian colleagues, travels some 5,000 miles  a  week by air during the period of the parliamentary sittings - and over an even longer period now because of the operations of the committees system. We are not particularly interested in the game being &#39;money, money, money&#39;. I agree very rarely with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator John</inline> Wheeldon, but I support him in his statement that our interests is &#39;safety, safety, safety*. As far  as  I am concerned, this must be the public interest. </para>
          <para>The other thing that appears to be forgotten by certain persons in &#39; this whole exercise is that a lot of public money  is  involved. I suppose our aviation industry  is  a little peculiar. It is  a  sort of privateenterprise public-utility. It does not quite fall within the pure private enterprise group. It is not manufacturing biscuits or selling beer or something like that. It is a public utility part owned by the Government and part owned by private enterprise. So it is  a  peculiar sort of industry. </para>
          <para>It is peculiar also to the extent that  it  has had special legislation passed by this Parliament. This Parliament therefore has an interest in what is to happen to our aviation industry. It is of no use for people outside to say that we ought, to mind our own business, that this is merely a commercial operation between 2 companies acting as they ought to be able to act,  as  long as they stay within the provisions of the Uniform Companies Act. I hope that the people involved in this situation will call  a  halt to their present activities until the Committee has reported back . to the Parliament. </para>
          <para>As I understand the situation, no. formal legal offer has yet been made, t hope that TNT will be sufficiently sensitive to the importance that Parliament places on this matter to delay making any formal legal offer until the Committee has reported back to the Senate. If lt does not, I will not look too kindly upon it because,  if  TNT does succeed in its aim it will need the help and co-operation of the Senate  in  the future. If TNT disregards the fact  that  we have set up an inquiry it need not expect much help from me. We should clearly lay on the line what we expect as the Senate. </para>
          <para>I particularly hope that during this inquiry - I have an interest in it as Chairman of another select committee - the Committee will ferret behind the nominee companies on both sides and trace the beneficial owners. I trust that the Comittee will seek out and discover where all the money is coming from to pay for the takeover. It could be just as important to discover who is providing the money, whether by mortgage, loan or in some other way. That could be even more important than the matter of the ownership of the shares in a particular company. </para>
          <para>The select committee of which I have the honour to be  Chairman  is charged not only with seeking out foreign ownership but also with seeking out foreign control. Whilst they can be the same thing, it can be an and\/or proposition. The shares could be totally Australian owned but foreign controlled because of the debt structure. I hope that the Standing Committee will have a good hard look at this one because suddenly this magical amount of money seems to be available almost at will, and almost overnight. I would like to know some of the associated facts. I wish the  Chairman  and members of the Standing Committee well. I am pleased that the Senate for the first time has realised that in a matter of this urgency a committee must be allowed to sit at times when the Senate normally sits. </para>

              <para>- I am normally opposed to that practice, but in certain circumstances it would be impossible for the Committee to carry out its task within 28 days. Unless the Committee does its work within 28 days, it might as well not start. For that reason I agree with the policy. I appreciate that problems will be raised for the Whips concerning pairs because the Committee is not evenly divided. I hope that there will be understanding between the Whips on both sides and between Party leaders to bring about the new arrangement. It will create strains for the. Hansard staff and other people, but it is a recogni tion of the urgency of the problem that the Senate should be making this departure. </para>

            <para>-  I do not want to enter into the controversy on whether an inquiry should be held. I am not much concerned about who owns or controls the airline in competition with the airline of the Australian people. I can find no great love for the operations of this particular company over the years that would cause me in any way to assist in trying to prevent its profits being taken over. However, I could not let either motion go through without speaking in condemnation of the decision to allow the Committee to sit while the Senate is sitting. The question arises of whether standing committees are taking over the functions of the Senate. Our Standing Orders provide that committees cannot meet while the Senate is in session. During the last sessional period the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson)</inline> asked that permission be given for one of the Estimates Committees to meet while the Senate was in session. It was for only a few days so that the Committee could finish its business. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I protested on that occasion. The Leader of the Government in the Senate assured me that it would not establish a precedent. Now a source other than the Government wants a committee to meet while the Senate is in session. It brings up 2 matters, the first of which is that committee members will have a responsibility to attend sittings of the committee rather than to attend the Senate where there is an open forum to express opinions and to represent the electors. The second matter is that provision is made whereby every honourable senator can attend and participate in the work of standing committees, but senators cannot attend committees in large numbers when they have a dual responsibility to both a committee and the Senate. 1 voice my protest and express the hope that the occasions on which this practice is approved will be rare. If it is not curtailed there is the danger that standing committees will become the Upper House of the Parliament and the Senate will meet to suit the convenience of the committees. </para>

            <para>-  This Bill,, which relates- to the. settlement of industrial disputes on .matters arising out of employment in the1 Commonwealth Public Service, will not in the opinion of the Opposition settle:, those disputes or, as they are termed in the- Bill, industrial situations&#39;; it will enlarge, the areas and measure of discontent to encompass wider sections of the Commonwealth Public Service. In his second., reading speech the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson)</inline> said that the . Government now believes that the processes of the Public Service Arbitration Act. need further strengthening to enable speedy resolution of industrial situations. What has happened within the Public Service in general - certainly within the . physical grades - is that the officers have been struggling to maintain their salaries and standards at a time when other employees in the. work force in general - have had improvements and because of the frustrations they have experienced in their dealings with the Public Service Board, there have been disputes. It is these disputes that have occasioned the Government to strengthen this legislation. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I believe that the Government&#39;s&#34; actions in seeking to strengthen this legislation is in accordance with its policy of&#34; imposing further restrictions on the ability of trade unions in Australia to bargain with employers for an improvement in working conditions. As was stated by the Minister in his second reading speech, this legislation is directed primarily at employees and unions in the Post Office. Those employees have been in the past closely allied to outside industry and variations to determinations or awards in outside industry used to flow directly and quickly to them. But that is no longer the case. For some years Post Office employees and the unions representing them have been frustrated by the Public Service Board. Most of the claims they have put to the Public Service Board have been rejected. Some, have taken as long as 2 years to be finalised. For example, in the case of the transport drivers* strike a negotiating period of 12 months was involved. Most of the claims ought to have been resolved quickly;&#39; Their validity would have been evident to anybody who had had any dealings with industrial matters. </para>
          <para>A simple solution by the Government to the problems which exist in the Post Office would be to accede to the representations that have been made in this place on many occasions by the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democratic Labor Party and divorce the Post Office from direct Government control. It ought to be allowed to run its own affairs on business lines and to settle industrial issues in the way in which they would be settled in any normal employer-employee relationship. All honourable senators will be aware of the comments that have been made on this subject by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr O&#39;Grady,</inline> who was the chief officer la the Post Office and who retired from that position in about 1967. He has since drawn attention to the disabilities under which he and his officers worked in trying to settle matters of immediate industrial concern because he always had to take into consideration the general attitude of the Government towards wage rises and industrial relations. It seems to me that the simplest thing for the Government to do would have been to accede to the representations of postal workers generally and of a large section of the Parliament - the Senate carried a resolution on this matter - and divorce the Post Office from direct Government control. </para>
          <para>The Government discussed its proposed amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act with the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Council of Commonwealth Public Service Organisations, the Australian Council of Salaried and Professional Associations and other organisations and undertook that the discussions would be resumed. I will have something to say about that matter directly. First of all I want to say that it is evident to me that what is involved in the matter of industrial relations in a situation where the economy is rapidly expanding and where inflation has taken over and is rising very sharply every year is the ability or non-ability of trade unions to secure for their members that to which they are rightly entitled, that is, their share of the wage increases which flow from national wage cases or determinations made outside the arbitration tribunals. The Government has an obligation to ensure that its employees enjoy the standards that are enjoyed in the State public service and in the private sector of industry. The point was made by the </para>
          <para class="block">Minister that over 20 years ago public servants were not only in receipt of good salaries but also worked under good conditions. They were also saddled with special responsibilities. Some of those responsibilities have not been lifted. What has happened in recent years is that Commonwealth public servants in general and those employed in instrumentalities of the Commonwealth have been left behind in the struggle to obtain wage and salary standards commensurate with those of workers in outside industry. In addition, in certain State public services - I have in mind my own State of South Australia and other States where Labor has had a chance to make improvements in the statutes covering public servants - &#39;the leave provisions, allowances, etc., have not only caught up with the general standards in the Commonwealth Public Service but have gone ahead of them. So there is a background of discontent of which the Government must be aware and should heed in making any alterations to the Act. </para>
          <para>It is clear that the Government has decided to amend the Public Service Act not only to impose some new restrictions on Commonwealth public servants but also because it is a part of the Government&#39;s long range policy to hamstring the trade unions. The Government is imposing new restrictions which will prevent Commonwealth public servants from taking ordinary and traditional steps to obtain industrial justice. A dissimilar situation exists in other parts of the world. Unions in those countries of the world which constitute the International Labour Organisation have, over the years not had more restrictions placed upon them; they have had restrictions taken off them. They are experiencing freer conditions of negotiation and more direct influence with management. </para>
          <para>What we are surprised about is that the Government, having set upon a course of dealing with restrictions in a general industrial position where it could not enforce the punitive clauses of the Arbitration Act, has also engaged in discussions with the ACTU, ACSPA, CCPSO and other related unions. The first discussions were held at the same time as the discussions took place on the question of the amendments to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act. During these discussions it was  agreed between the parties, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> being the Minister for Labour and National Service and the head of his Department being present, that there would be further discussions in respect of the Public Service Arbitration Act between the Minister, his officers and the Public Service unions. So that there will be no confusion about whether these discussions took place, I would like to read the correspondence exchange between the Council of Commonwealth Public Service Organisations and the Minister. On 27th October 1971 Paul Munro, the Federal Secretary of the Council of Commonwealth Public Service Organisations, wrote to the Minister in these terms: </para>

          <para>It is noted that you have written to the Minister for Labour and National Service suggesting that he fix a time and place for discussion. It is confirmed that the Public Service Board will  be  represented at the proposed discussions. </para>

As honourable senators will see, the Public Service Board acknowledged those representations. While this correspondence was being exchanged, and in view of the fact that the central organisation of the Commonwealth Public Service unions would be able to take this matter up and consider what might be appropriately altered within the purview of the Commonwealth Public Service Act, they sent out to their members a letter believing that they had a complete understanding with the Minister that they would be given the opportunity to discuss what might be done. The letter was headed &#39;Public Service Arbitration Act: Amendment to Legislation&#39; and dated 24th November 1971. One copy of the letter was sent to the Federal Executive, one copy to the Federal affiliates and one copy to divisional secretaries. The letter reads: </para>

          <para class="block">There is the evidence of the discussions as reported by the Council of Commonwealth Public Service Organisations, and that is the action the Council took with its affiliates to require them to submit proposals which might later be taken before the Minister. Early this year - in March - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cook</inline> of the Department of Labour and National Service and the Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch,</inline> invited the unions to discuss the matter. But the Minister presented to the unions the final draft of the Bill which is now before the Senate. So, having undertaken to consider what the unions might think about necessary amendments, the Minister came along with the completed draft of the Bill. Consequently there was no proper discussion with the CCPSO on what might obtain within the Public Service. </para>
          <para>As I have mentioned before, the Government might properly have taken into consideration a number of matters. One was the question of separating the Post Office from the Commonwealth Public Service. The other matters are ones which we have discussed in this Senate. It was accepted by the Opposition and by some other parties in the Parliament that it was high time for another Public Service inquiry. This Public Service inquiry had been agreed upon and the unions said they would support it. It would not only inquire into the efficiency, staffing and so on of the Commonwealth Public Service but also, from the union point of view, it could consider industrial relations and the general scope of what industrial laws might be required in relation to the management and the employers of the Commonwealth Public Service. The Government did not do that. </para>
          <para>It might have considered some other matters also. It might have considered in what respect some provisions of the existing Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbi tration Act might have been inserted in place of what is now proposed. In a communication which has been sent to me and to some other unions Paul Munro, Secretary of the CCPSO, pointed out that it might have been possible to consider - it would have been preferable from the point of view of the unions - inserting directly and strictly the provisions of sections 28 and 29 of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act which they considered would be better and certainly less onerous than what is now proposed in the Bill before the Senate. On page 2 of the statement to which I have referred the following appears: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>CCPSO does not seriously quarrel with the need for conciliation procedures to be written into tha Public Service Arbitration Act. At present resort can be made by Public Service unions and management to the conciliation and dispute settling procedures under section 28 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. So it is hardly a matter of urgent need. Nevertheless the lack of integration between the Public Service Arbitration Act and the Conciliation and Arbitration Act result in more cumbersome procedures than should be the&#39; case. An answer would seem to be to extend the Public Service Arbitrator&#39;s jurisdiction by tha insertion of powers similar to those contained in sections 28 and 29 of the C. and A. Act. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Government should properly have continued its discussions with the unions if it felt that new procedures were necessary. Discussions could have encompassed the form of a proper inquiry into the Public Service which is long overdue. They could have included arbitration matters. The Government also could have sent delegations round the world to see the standards of public servants today in other countries. </para>
          <para>I recently returned from a visit to Sweden. In that country, contrary to the concepts held in Australia, there are no punitive clauses operating in agreements on wages and salaries affecting the ordinary so-called physical grades, the people in the workshops, or the people in the public service. All agreements are made on a national basis by consultation round the conference table. There are no court procedures in those countries and public servants have much more freedom than they have in this country. </para>
          <para>We strongly oppose this legislation. We suggest that step by step this Government has set out to impose restrictions on unions in an effort to restrain the economic drives it commenced in its Budget. The Government, by its budgetary action, set in course the chain of price increases. Those increases resulted from the heavy duties the Government imposed at Budget time yet it blames the unions for the escalation of costs. In recent months we have become used to regular attacks on unions by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon),</inline> the previous Prime Minister and by leaders of the Government parties. They place all blame for rising costs on the workers. </para>

            <para>- Maybe he has, senator, but you had long enough experience in the industrial movement to know that what  1  am saying is correct. That was the policy adopted by this Government when it was not so unstable. Clearly it is unstable today. Nobody would suggest that this Government is a permanent government. There is every indication that it will not survive until election time this year. There was concentrated action by the Government to attack, on every occasion possible the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the national voice of the labour movement. Over the years the ACTU has been a highly responsible body, an organisation with which this Government should have been proud to do business. On many occasions the Government failed to consider the propositions of the ACTU and the unions. The Government said that it would take every action possible in the courts to restrain wage increases. It was this sort of policy which, as we know, even during the period when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gorton</inline> was Prime Minister, caused some of the disputes within the Commonwealth Public Service which have been referred to by the Minister. </para>
          </talk.start></continue><para>For example, he referred to the dispute by the transport members of the Amalgamated Postal Workers &#39;Union of Australia. This was an outstanding case where the union&#39;s claim was justified. Because the Government declared that it would resist wage increases the Commonwealth Public Service Board would not grant to mail drivers in the Post Office the increases which had been approved in outside industry. It would not grant the appropriate margin which should have flowed to them because of their special duties. It took the union 5 months to put the case before the Commonwealth Public Service Board and it was rejected. It took a further 4 or 5 months to put the case before the Commonwealth Public Service Arbitrator and to get the proper increases. The increase of $104 a year which was awarded gave them a relationship with outside industry as well as some consideration for their special duties. </para><para>There was a great flare-up in the Government during this dispute when the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Alan Hulme)</inline> decided to employ scab drivers. This intensified the discontent in the Public Service. In these situations what else do you think the unions would do but engage more actively in campaigns to secure wage justice? If one reads the reports of the Public Service Board and looks at the frustrations of industrial dealings in the Commonwealth Public Service one finds that the record shows that the Public Service Board has been obstinate. It has been obstinate not only because of the special responsibilities it has, as declared by the Government, but also because of Government policies which too closely restrict what it might do. There is a need for reform, not further restrictions. The reports of the Public Service Board show each year that many cases have not been dealt with. There also have been numerous delays which have cost union members many thousands of dollars, particularly the Amalgamated Postal Workers Union which apparently has been singled out. I referred earlier to the strike by transport workers which occasioned delays and pay losses over a period of 10 months. </para><para>The second great problem that the Amalgamated Postal Workers Union got into was over its claim for an industry allowance. It established a very clear case for the award of this allowance, particularly when one considers the trends in private industry and the payments awarded to State public servants. I have referred mainly to my own State of South Australia because I know the conditions there better. On taking office the Labor Government in that State caught up with some of the other States in awarding industry allowances to all workers and officers in the </para><para class="block">State Public Service. The industry allowance did not apply to Commonwealth public servants until the Amalgamated Postal Workers Union negotiated and obtained the $4.50. Commonwealth employees gained some relativity with outside grades. 1 remind the Senate that when we are talking about the Commonwealth Public Service and the Amalgamated Postal Workers Union we are talking about what the Government called, during the negotiations, the physical grades. These grades are very closely allied to classifications in outside industry. There are no distinctions to make when talking about fitters, linesmen, truck drivers or concrete hands, lt is easy to align the grades. There should be no question of disparity and there should be no great delay. </para><para>That claim for the industry allowance took 2 years for the unions to process and it took a long time for the Public Service Board and the Public Service Arbitrator to deal with it. The same thing applied to the flow on from the metal trades case. It had been the custom to recognise that there was a nexus between outside industry and the Commonwealth Public Service Board. The frustrations occasioned loss of the increase to members of the Amalgamated Postal Workers Union for some 18 weeks. Finally the  Deputy  Public Service Arbitrator, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wilson,</inline> granted a $6 increase. </para><para>To support what I have said I want to read from the annual report of the Commonwealth Public Service Board for 1971. I refer particularly to negotiations in respect to the physical grades and associated staff. At page 40 of its report the Board states: </para><quote>
            <para>The Board expressed to the ACTU its concern at the circumstances which led the ACTU to make representations so soon after the December 1969 increases for trades and associated staff. However, the Board noted that the ACTU was correct in claiming that the Commonwealth Service rates had again fallen behind the market because of the significant increases in going rates in the private sector and important sections of the public sector since 1st January 1970. </para>
          </quote><para class="block">In relation to the negotiations to which I have referred it was fortunate that, in some of the circumstances, the Australian Council of Trade Unions was able to come along and assist the Amalgamated Postal Workers Union settle the negotiations. As I have pointed out, there are growing industrial disputes in some years which are occasioned by these matters which can be corrected. They can be corrected by a more active work on behalf of the Public Service Board. It can accept very clear pro formas which are well known to industrial relations people, unions and management. There should not be the delays which have occurred. They should be corrected. There is no need for restrictions which are now imposed by the Bill. </para><para>I suggest that what is now before us is legislation which is imposed for the 2 reasons which I have mentioned. The first is to try to build up within the Australian community a notion that the only cause of rising costs is the militant unions - the over-active unions - and not Government policy. I say in relation to this piece of legislation that I support what has been said on behalf of the Council of Commonwealth Public Service Organisations that negotiations should have been obtained and surrounding the Public Service Act. Management and unions should have been allowed to decide in what respect it might be modified. If negotiations had been carried out properly, today in this Parliament probably we would be considering a mutually acceptable Bill. </para><para>But the legislation casts a very wide net. Not only does it catch the. Public Service unions but it catches all the other people in the Public Service who, in many circumstances, are able to negotiate very quickly. Such people are the professional and specialised officers who have no trouble in settling their wage claims. The net which is cast by this new procedure is a wide one. It means that employees can be stood down. They can be stood down not only because of a dispute which involves workers in the Commonwealth Public Service or the instrumentalities but also because of a dispute which obtains in the private sector of industry. Such action has never been taken before, lt is going to be taken now. Looking at the sorts of unions involved, how does the Government expect to encourage the settlement of disputes? How can we expect these people to be satisfied with a situation when the Government is going to ensure that its ministers by their action can force, the arbitrator - because of an industrial situation - to act as he thinks fit? The net result of what the Government now intends will be to bring into industrial disputation more and more Commonwealth public servants, people who, hitherto, were not affected by disputes. They have not been involved in disputes. They have been able to settle their wage claims in a way which represents a conciliation. The number of unions involved in the Public Service are set out in the Public Service Board annual report for 1971. It states: </para><quote>

          </quote><para class="block">There are 5. The Government is having difficulty in the Post Office. It now proposes to establish a wide industrial prescription which brings all employees into a net under which they can be stood down. Not only can they be stood down under proper arbitration procedures but also I suggest the procedures which are outlined in this Bill are far too wide and the Minister can, if he so desires, on his own motion advise the arbitrator. The arbitrator has power under clause 12d which deals with orders in relation to industrial situations. It states: (1.) Where the Arbitrator has been informed under the last preceding section of the existence or likely occurrence of an industrial situation, the Arbitrator or a  Deputy  Arbitrator- </para><list type="loweralpha">
            <item label="(a)">
              <para>shall forthwith call a conference . . . </para>
            </item>
          </list><para>I do not intend to read the clause because it is a machinery formula. But clause 12d (1.) (b) states: may, subject to the next succeeding subsection, after hearing such evidence (if any) as he thinks fit, make such orders as he thinks necessary or desirable for putting an end to, or preventing the occurrence of, the situation or preventing the occurrence of further industrial situations or such other orders as he thinks necessary or desirable by reason of the existence or likely occurrence of the situation. </para><para class="block">Within this prescription there are no proper rules or provisions which entitle the parties to a full and complete hearing. In particular it does not refer to those affected. There can be a wide ranging obligation upon anybody to be involved. The parties to the dispute may never attend this conference but the arbitrator can forthwith decide to do as he thinks fit. Looking at the industrial matters prescription, clause 3 sets out the industrial situation. It states: </para><list type="loweralpha">
            <item label="(a)">
              <para>the refusal or failure to perform work, including (without limiting the generality of the preceding words of this paragraph) the refusal or failure to perform work in a particular manner, at a particular place or at a particular time or while particular circumstances exist; </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(b)">
              <para>the unauthorised interruption, delaying or obstruction of, or any unauthorised limitation on, the performance of work; </para>

            <item label="(c)">
              <para>the performance of work in an unauthorised manner or at an unauthorised time, being a manner or time so different from the usual manner or time of the performance of that work that there would be a limitation or restriction on, or a tendency to limit or restrict, the amount or volume of work performed or the output or production of work; or </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(d)">
              <para>the unauthorised adoption of such a practice in relation to work that there would be a limitation or restriction on, or a tendency to limit or restrict, the amount or volume of work performed or the output or production of work; </para>
            </item>
          </list><para class="block">As I say this sort of provision is wide because it can involve more matters of disputation than those which relate directly to wages and salaries. In every enterprise there are disputes between workers and management and between union delegates and secretaries and management. For example, such disputes could relate to safety at work, air pollution, unsatisfactory and unhygienic working conditions, the effect of redundancy from automatic devices and things which are negotiated every day in factories. All these things can be declared to be industrial matters. As a result, what could happen is that the Minister could decide the matter. It is no good saying that a minister&#39;s action is similar to administrative action which a minister might take in relation to a dispute in his own department. We have a law which refers to the Minister. It could be the Minister for Labour and National Service or it might be the Minister for Works. </para><para>I say to honourable senators that we can bet our bottom dollar that when the Minister takes action under the provisions of this new law it will be in accordance with the policy of the Government. Not only does that mean government policy in relation to a particular dispute or department; it also me.ans that the minister will carry out the aims of the Government, translated from its economic policies. So we have a most unsatisfactory, unfair and repressive piece of legislation because, in effect, the minister becomes the Government He thinks as the Government. He does not think as the manager of an enterprise or as the person who runs the Post Office. He thinks in terms of Government philosophy. He initiates action and honourable senators have heard me refer to clause 12D. Under that clause the arbitrator forthwith occasions a conference and then he takes such arbitrary powers and such a close action in relation to whatever he wants to do. In this world today how can there be such arbitrary powers and such a close connection between the Minister and Government policy. </para><para>A perusal of the history of the threats by the Government and the reports made to the unions shows that the legislation was drafted at a time when the Government intended to carry out a large electoral campaign against Labor. The Government intended to introduce first what it called this small piece of legislation as a dummy run for the larger piece of legislation and then to introduce the major piece of repressive legislation next week or shortly afterwards. 1 suggest that the 2 points that I have made are enough to make anybody concerned about the new power. The Minister is not just the administrative head of the department; he becomes the voice of the Government. It is a great new power. It should be resisted. We should vote against it. The Labor Party is strongly opposed to it. We will oppose, not only in the Parliament but wherever possible, the unfair and summary powers which are granted under the Bill. If the Government says that it is not intended to do the things which I have suggested will be done, it should ensure that amendments to the Bill are introduced immediately. The Minister has said that the provisions of section 28 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act are similar to the provisions in the Public Service Arbitration Bill. Section 28 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act reads: (1.) Subject to this Act, if it appears to a Commissioner that an industrial dispute has occurred or is likely to occur, he shall, whether he has been notified under this section or not, immediately ascertain the parties to the industrial dispute and the matters which form the subject of that dispute and shall take such steps as he thinks fit for the prompt prevention or settlement of that dispute by conciliation or, if in his opinion conciliation is unlikely to succeed or has failed, by arbitration. (2.) As&#39; soon as an organisation or employer becomes aware of the existence of an industrial dispute or of an industrial situation which is likely to give rise to an industrial dispute the organisation or employer shall forthwith notify a Commissioner or the Registrar accordingly. (3.) A Minister who is aware of the existence, of an industrial dispute or of an industrial situation which is likely to give rise to an industrial dispute may notify a Commissioner or the Registrar accordingly. </para><para class="block">That prescription is quite different from the one contained in the Bill. The procedures are set out quite clearly. The parties to the dispute are the people who are called. As everybody knows, section 28 is used frequently today. Informative discussions are held. They might provide an avenue by which a return to work or settlement of the matters in dispute is secured. Section 28 often does that. If the issue is a difficult one the individual union almost&#39; always engages the assistance of the Trades and Labour Council, which is the State branch of the ACTU. By consultation the dispute is settled. </para><para>The provision in the Bill gives a summary power to. take instant action. The provision will affect not only those involved in the dispute but also those only partly involved in it - employees of instrumentalities and people who have never! been previously involved in industrial, disputes. Whatever the Government&#39;s intentions in introducing the Bill, all it is doing is widening the area of industrial, disputes. It would include any strike, ban. or embargo outside the province of Com-&#39; monwealth employment. For example, recently the Building Workers Industrial Union in New South Wales imposed a ban and carried out activities to secure new standards of workers&#39; compensation - full pay for those on workers&#39; compensation - and it finally succeeded. In those circumstances, if the Commonwealth considered that an instrumentality such as the Commonwealth Employment Service might be affected, it could almost summarily take action and refer the matter to the Public Service Arbitrator to stand down workers in industries which are not involved. </para><para>It has been argued by the Minister that in the Arbitration Act there is an almost similar provision in relation to bans and limitations. In respect of the bans and limitations clauses let me point out that there are proceedings which are properly tested before the courts. The procedures are set down. The case is tested. The application is brought on for hearing. The arbitration authority decides whether a ban or limitation will be imposed. The ban or limitation can be revoked at any time. Under this Bill the bans and limitations last for all time. As long as that provision is in the legislation summary action can be taken against the union. The provision is too strong. It should not be part of the legislation. The Government should take the first opportunity to do what the Public Service unions ask, that is, to consult them as to whether modifications in respect of both sides of the employment scale might be considered. If the Bill is passed actions could be brought under the legislation. There is no doubt in my mind that prior to the election the Minister will initiate actions against unions by standing down their members. Often those actions will not be related to disputes within the particular section of Commonwealth employment. The actions will be prompted partly by political reasons. This is one of the steps that the Government has taken to bring before the public, in its own particular haphazard way, its attempt to pass all responsibility onto the union movement. </para><para>I refer to matters which are easily solved in outside industry. I have had a long experience of some of these matters, as many of my colleagues have had. There are safety campaigns in the workshops, campaigns against redundancy and campaigns to safeguard the workers against poor conditions or bad lighting. At present in the Commonwealth Public Service there are campaigns by some unions in respect of these matters. Sometimes the campaigns involve short stoppages of work. No restriction should be placed on the workers because of activities in that regard. Everybody should know that sometime or other the problems have to be solved. If the Government wants to solve them, the sensible way is across the table. It would be well for the Government to look at the standards of industrial laws operating overseas, in West Germany in particular or in Europe generally - my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clyde</inline> Cameron and I recently visited Sweden - to see the extent to which it is possible to settle differences across the table. Where there are differences in administration there could be used what is now being used in some of these countries - works councils where people can talk across the table about the problems in the industry or shop. We support the opposition of the CCPSO, of the unions generally and certainly of the ACTU. I conclude by reading a resolution carried by the Joint Councils on 30th March 1972. They issued this statement after the meeting: </para><quote>

          <para>- I indicate that the Australian Democratic Labor Party will support the Bill before the House. In saying that, I suggest that this Bill will not settle, and is not designed to settle, disputes but to intercede when disputes are in process for the purpose of protecting the public purse. Whether it will have that effect fully will not be known until the Bill is in effect and has been tested. It is also a matter of controversy whether this was the right way to do this. My own feeling is that this Bill should really be called the George Slater legislation. I believe that it is because of the activities of Comrade Slater in the Amalgamated Postal Workers Union of Australia that we are faced with this proposition  that will be binding on many public serv-- ants who have not been associated with the activities that have led to the introduction of the legislation. </para>

        <para>As a philosophy I would say that it has been brought about mainly by the unbridled use of the right to strike. I have belonged to a union for many years which always recognised that it did not have the powerful economic punch to win improvements in wages and conditions by the use of the strike weapon because the strikes would last for a period in that industry which inevitably would mean that die workers would be starved back to work. We were always warning those in the trade union movement, who were endeavouring to destroy the processes of conciliation and arbitration which the Labor movement had established in this country in the interests of the unions of that fact. They thought that in the economic circumstances cf today they were in a powerful position to use unbridled the right to strike to improve their own conditions regardless of others. </para>
        <para>I think we have a classic example of this is what was referred to by none other than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> during the adjournment debate only the other evening. He drew attention to the situation that existed in the transport industry as it related to Qantas Airways Ltd and Qantas pilots. I think we should examine that situation. I think we should also remember that the unbridled use of the right to strike can lead to a situation in which a strike may no longer be a strike but may be industrial blackmail. In the case of Qantas pilots, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> was complaining that their current wages were perhaps excessive and that their claims were outrageous. He said that there should be more equality in that industry between the clerks and the others who are on a much lower pay range. How did this situation come about? It came about because the pilots are in a situation to use the right to strike to the extent that it becomes industrial blackmail. Why are they in that situation? It is because the equipment that they use and the planes that they fly cost such an enormous amount that immediately they are immobilised on the ground the profitability of the company is eaten into and disappears almost overnight. </para>
        <para class="block"> If we believe in the unbridled use of the right to strike, the pilots have never had any responsibility or obligation to the clerks, the sweepers, the cleaners and others in the industry who work for Qantas, who could not ground the aircraft to gain the conditions they may have thought were their just right but who had to put up with a situation in which the great bulk of the profits of the industry and the establishment for which they work, went to the few who were in this powerful industrial position to use unbridled the right to strike to gain only their own ends. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> complained about the pilots&#39; wages but gave no explanation of why they were in that situation, or analysed the philosophy that if one believes in the unbridled right to strike there is nothing wrong with what the pilots are receiving today or what they may be able to squeeze out of the industry in the future. </para>
        <para>How do we relate this to the situation in in the Public Service? I suggest that in the Public Service the number of employees in particular establishments has now grown to such a tremendous extent because of the needs of this nation that the loss incurred by the department concerned, by the Government and by the taxpayers of this country who pay the salaries of those who are immobilised by a small section which uses the right to strike, that they have as powerful a weapon for industrial blackmail as have the pilots who are able to ground the enormously expensive equipment that is used in their industry. I think that any reasonable person would accept that argument because it is factual. How, then, are we in some way to bridle those who have begun to realise that they have this powerful weapon to use and who are prepared to use it irrespective of the loss to their fellow workers in associated or kindred industries, and who are prepared to use it irrespective of the loss of public moneys which are paid in tax mostly by the people who work in this country - they are the largest taxpayers because of their numbers - if we do not bring in some restraints when we see the irresponsible use of the strike weapon to protect the public purse. </para>
        <para>It is on that point that there are divisions In the sentiments of many of us who happen to be unionists but who have also been elected by the people of this country to protect public moneys and the public purse. We have approached this legislation conscious of all our responsibilities. As I said at the outset, we feel that had it not been for the very irresponsible activities of Comrade Slater in the trade union movement, the Public Service would not be faced with this legislation at this moment. Indeed, this Bill should almost be called the Slater Bill. </para>

            <para>- I am not suggesting that it is justice. I am suggesting that the responsibility to protect the public purse is ours. I said at the outset that I am not sure that this is the proper way, the right way or the only way to go about this. I will have more to say about that in a moment. But we must try something and the Government has produced legislation. I want to substantiate what I have said about why I believe this Bill is before the House. Let me draw attention to some of the information that I have relating to the strikes that have taken place in the postal industry in recent years. I want everybody to realise that in the Public Service in the past the good conditions that exist were laid down on the basis of a principle that strikes never occur in the Public Service. In the postal industry, this principle has been completely reversed. The record of the postal service unions over the past 10 years, in my view, is what has brought about the introduction of this piece of legislation. We all know and understand the enormous requirement today for a postal service in trade, commerce and defence and the need for that service to be efficiently and regularly run. The telephone service is important also so that the normal requirements of trade in all industries can be properly carried out. No government, whether it be the present Government or a government which may replace it, can afford to ignore those conditions. I predict now that, if a change of government occurred, whichever party replaced the present Government would find the necessity to use the powers of this legislation and similar legislation if the philosophy of the unbridled right to strike continued to be pursued in the manner in which it is being pursued today. Until those who are interested in labour, the Labor movement and the trade unions are prepared to recognise that an abuse of that philosophy must ultimately bring the repercussions that it is bringing now, not only the current Government but also whatever government replaces it will be forced, if it is the government elected by the people for the people, to resort to action to ensure that public moneys are not thrown away because people use what I describe as industrial blackmail. </para>

        </continue>
        <para>The guerrilla-type operations in the postal service, with short interruptions by small numbers of people causing enormous losses to the taxpayer over the last 10 years, form a particular pattern. I wish to refer to some of them specifically. The unions involved mainly are the Amalgamated Postal Workers Union and the Postal Telecommunications and Technicians Association. They cover a great number of persons engaged in the work force in this industry. Since 1969, stoppages within the Post Office have been as follows: In 1969, 10 stoppages occurred. In 1970 there were 63 stoppages. In 1971, 58 stoppages occurred. To 3rd February 1972, 10 stoppages occurred. This is a total of 141 stoppages in that period. </para>
        <para>I know that it can be argued, perhaps with some truth, that the general industrial tenor of today has created some of those stoppages. But let us have a look at how those stoppages have worked out in their repercussions on the general community. In 1970, the number of man hours lost in the postal service as the result of strikes was 381,777. </para>

            <para>- That may be another issue. The loss of those hours may be, preventable or unpreventable. I am giving to the Senate a list of statistics. If the honourable senator has a list of statistics on the matter he has raised, I have no doubt that he will put it before the Senate. The wages lost by these men in 1970 - and they have every right to lose these wages if they want to- amounted to $528,027. In 1971, 146,954 man hours were lost and the loss of wages was $272,896. Up to 3rd February of this year, 29,228 man hours were lost, while $54,138 was lost in wages. The totals over that period were 557,959 man hours lost and $855,057 lost in wages. This is what strikes cost those workers who went on strike. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>What has been the effect on associated people in the postal industry? I wish to quote some of the other aspects of disputes of this character. In September 1971, a dispute occurred at the Redfern Mail Exchange in Sydney. It commenced on 21st September. Four technicians refused, to switch on mail handling plant. All mail processing staff were left idle. Technical staff engaged on maintenance work also were unable to perform their duties. At. 4.30 p.m. that day, all work ground to a: halt. In the dispute, 2,250 man shifts werelost in the mail handling area and 500 man shifts were lost in the technical area. With respect to the 2,750 man shifts affected, 2,750 staff reported for duty but could not effectively perform their duties. Salaries totalling $50,000 were paid for these man shifts with no return in productive effort. This example illustrates the danger of such action. When the refusal of 4 people to carry out their duties creates a situation like this, I believe - and I suggest this to those interested in the trade union movement - that this is where industrial anarchy begins and where industrial blackmail can be so clearly illustrated. When a trade union official can create this sort of&#39; chaos by using only 4 men who are likely to lose wages, we must wonder how much of the public purse would have been plundered during the course of the stoppages that have, taken place already in the postal industry, when 557,959 man hours werelost and $855,057 in wages was lost by the&#39; participants in those strikes. If the same ratio as applied to the 4-man stoppage that I have used as an illustration had applied over the whole of industry - I know that it is an extreme case, but it could happen - how enormously the taxpayers would have1 been penalised because of what could have&#39; been a very small and petty dispute that occasioned 4 people to withhold their labour at a particular time. </para>

            <para>- This may be purely a matter of opinion. I have not condemned the stoppage itself. What I am condemning is the fact that it was used and took place in the manner in which it did, so depriving the public of value for the expenditure of that enormous amount of wages because these people were idle. There will always be those who will take advantage of circumstances which permit such action. If honourable senators suggest otherwise, they do not face the realities of human nature. If there were not such people, airline pilots would not be receiving the wages that they are receiving and would not be making the extravagant demands that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> described to us the other night. The philosophy is exactly the same. It is exactly the same use of the economic power that lies in the hands of a minority of people who can use it to pose the threat of loss to other people so as to obtain their specific demands or the particular objective that they want. I am opposed to it. I believe that the trade union movement, if it is sensible, will use the right to strike in a much more reasonable manner,. I think that it mostly has done so, under the national auspices of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. That body has never made a practice of racing to the strike weapon as the immediate and only solution to an argument about safety or anything else. </para>
