            <para>- My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate who represents the Treasurer. I refer to the forecast by the  President  of the United States Export-Import Bank of the probability of an upward revaluation of the yen, resulting in a relative further devaluation of the United States dollar. I ask: Firstly, has the Australian Government firmly committed itself to a devaluation in parallel with further United States devaluations? Secondly, will the Government make a statement, for the information of the Senate and of the public, of the implications for Australia of the new sweeping powers over currency just taken by the Japanese Government and the implications of an upward revaluation by Japan? </para>

          <para class="block">The question asked of me in my capacity as the representative in this chamber of the Treasurer by the Leader of the Opposition is a very far reaching one. 1 would be very cautious in commenting on such a question without notice. Indeed,I would have grave reservations about responding to that type of question if it were placed on notice. The question relates to a hypothetical situation. The giving of an opinion in relation to the hypothetical devaluation of the currencies of the world could have tremendous consequences. In fact, I think it could have damaging consequences because Australia is a country whose trade is associated substantially with primary industry. Any implication in relation to the shape of things to come in the hypothetical situation of one other country doing something with its currency - whether it be upward or downward - could be damaging. </para>

              <para>- It could bc damaging to the whole economy in Australia. I said &#39;could&#39;. I am not categorically saying that it would or would not. That is the very reason why currency decisions are ones which, like those made in a Budget situation, have to be guarded and why when decisions are ultimately taken and released they have to be made with some precision. In deference to the Leader of the Opposition, having regard to his responsibilities and mine and to his status, I think that question should go on notice. </para>

If it is correct that farmers in Tasmania are being told by processors that unless they accept pea contracts at the cost of production prices laid down by the processors they will be denied a contract for the more profitable beans and other vegetables, I ask: Does this coercion conflict in any way with the Restrictive Trade Practices Act or any other Act? </para>

If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lillico</inline> were to give me details of the particular matter to which he has referred I would take it up with the Commissioner for Trade Practices at the earliest opportunity and seek an opinion from him as to whether prima facie a matter for inquiry is warranted in the terms of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act as it now stands and communicate with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lillico</inline> as soon as I am able to do so. </para>

              <para>- As you rightly said, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I cannot give the numbers. I could not even say how many cattle have come off our family property in the last 3 years. I shall certainly make inquiries for the honourable senator. I oan say whether approval is given because I have had this information in my file for some time. As the honourable senator knows, export abattoirs must be registered with the Department of Primary Industry, as must any premises such as boning rooms, which are used in connection with meat. A company that wants to export meat must obtain from the Department of Primary Industry a permit to export. Furthermore, companies which want to export meat must obtain an export licence from the Australian Meat Board. So approval has to be obtained in respect of 3 different matters. The honourable senator asked whether the Department of Primary Industry or the Australian Meat Board was worried about the number of animals slaughtered. I would say that the Department of Primary Industry and the Australian Meat Board naturally are concerned whether the numbers of livestock that are available for slaughter will enable export quotas to be filled. In this respect the 2 bodies are keeping a careful watch on that matter. </para>

The matter is still under investigation by the people concerned, principally Qantas Airways Ltd. There are one or two problems for the 737 with the airstrip on Norfolk Island, but they are not insurmountable. I think I should get the latest information for the honourable senator. My information would be about 10 or 12 days old. I will ascertain whether there is any additional information for the honourable senator. </para>

              <para>- Last week <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turnbull</inline> asked me a series of questions about the matter. During the 1970 Budget sittings he displayed a small container which was known by the trade name of Palm-N&#39;-Turn. 1 can assure the honourable senator that my Department and T are concerned at the incidence of poisoning from the ingestion of drugs, particularly in the group of children between the ages of I and 5 years. The problem is not peculiar to Australia, ft is a world-wide problem. The age group I mentioned appears to be al greatest risk. Poisoning of children by drugs is related primarily to the. careless storage of drugs in the home and is not a new problem. The best and the most effective remedy would be greater parental care with drugs in the home. That is not to deprecate the question, but it is a fact of life, as. I think. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turnbull</inline> would agree. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </interjection>
          <para>My Department has been examining ways and means of reducing the risk related to careless storage in the home. I was not Minister for Health in late 1970 but I understand that through the agencies of the National Health and Medical Research Council a special communication was sent to all pharmacists commending to them certain action in relation to this risk and in relation to the use of safety containers. The container, Palm-N&#39;-Turn, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turnbull</inline> brought into the chamber does have deficiencies. It has been found that even children in the age group at risk - I to 5 years - have been able to open it, often in a very short period. For tablets other than short shelf-life tablets the container does not provide a satisfactory method of preventing degeneration of the drugs due to the atmospheric conditions. While safety containers have some deficiencies in relation to drug stability, durability, ease of handling and labelling, my Department is currently examining two new types of containers which have been developed recently. In addition, alternate forms of packaging, such as tablets packaged in foil strips, are being examined. AH drugs currently causing a risk problem are being examined in this context. Foil packaging may have an advantage in terms of time taken to break the tablets off the strip and remove the foil. That may guard against the careless use by children, particularly in the 1 to 5 age group. I hope that at an early date there will be further development in relation to the problem. Let us face facts: It is a very real problem in any home into which drugs are taken and in which there are children. </para>

Although 1 am not sure that the final result is known as yet, there is no doubt what the end result will be because of the method of voting employed in Tasmania. If I may say so, the time to ask mc a question in relation to that result is after the honeymoon is over. The honeymoon is now on because of the projected result of the election but we will not know the implications of the result until the honeymoon is over. To paraphrase the famous words of Lord Asquith, I think we must wait and see.

To the honourable senator opposite who groans with unease al hearing of my regret, I say it will be an unfortunate situation if moratoria follow one another in this vein with bottles being thrown, windows being smashed and violence occurring, lt may cause some amusement to irresponsible legislators but it is a matter of great national regret that that sort of incident cun occur more than once in Melbourne, lt has been inspired by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr J.</inline> F. Cairns and he has avowed his support for moratoria campaigns. As to the place he holds in the eyes of his Leader in regard to the matter, I told the Senate last week that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr .1.</inline> F. Cairns said on television that after a speech in the House of Representatives - in effect supporting North Vietnam - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> said that it was a most compelling speech. </para>

            <para>-  I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Customs and Excise whether the Commonwealth pays book bounty on locally produced books of one-quarter of the cost of production of each book? Has the Commonwealth already paid book bounty on so-called .sex manuals such as &#39;Intercourse&#39;, &#39;Ways of Loving&#39; and &#39;Call Girl&#39;? If bounty has been paid will the Minister advise me of the cost of production per book, the amount of bounty paid per book and the retail price of each book? Can the Minister confirm or deny reports that his Department has given verbal approval for the book bounty to be paid on the notorious Little Red Schoolbook&#39;. that the estimated cost of production on which bounty will be paid  is  19c a copy and that its retail price  is  $1.75? Can book bounty be refused on a book which is blasphemous, indecent or obscene or which unduly emphasises matters of sex, horror, violence or crime or which is likely to encourage depravity? Does the Minister consider that the &#39;Little Red Schoolbook&#39; and so-called sex manuals listed above merit book bounty of 25 per cent of the cost of production which  is  paid out of taxpayers&#39; money when there is such a huge margin between cost and retail price? </para>

            <para>- I think it is quite clear that a need exists in this country for a review of the whole of our law relating to divorce, family law and custody of children. That point of view has commended itself to the Senate which, late in 1971, referred this whole question to one of its standing committees. I am certainly concerned about the matter. A considerable amount of preliminary work has been done within my own Department to assess the position. Part of that work has been done for the purpose of the Senate Standing Committee which has requested assistance. I can only say that a real problem confronts me and, I think, confronts the Government when a Senate Standing Committee is undertaking this work, in knowing to what extent the responsible Minister is entitled to embark upon a considerable inquiry within his own Department. That is a matter upon which the decision of the Government ultimately must be taken. I can only respond to the honourable senator by saying that I have arranged within my Department for some work and attention to be given to this problem. I would hope that, in due course, the results of that initial assessment can be made public. </para>

            <para>- I direct my question to the Minister for Health. I refer to the Minister&#39;s announcement reported in Monday&#39;s newspapers that the Federal Government has decided to require the inclusion of a health warning in all cigarette advertising on radio and television and that it will finance a national education programme against smoking, directed particularly at young people. If the Government intends to finance a national education programme against smoking as opposed to the hazards involved with smoking, why does the Government not advocate the complete banning of cigarette advertising on radio and television? Finally, will the Government in its education programme consider producing television advertisements advocating that young people should not smoke and time slot such advertisements at children and family viewing times, at the same time thereby supporting Australian programme productions for children and family viewers? </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir KENNETH</inline>ANDERSONI feel that the honourable senator and I are at cross purposes, lt is true that I announced at the weekend the decision of the Government on 3 basic policy matters in relation to the hazards of smoking. The whole statement was in regard to the implications of the hazards to health of smoking and it must be read in that context. The Press statement indicated, first, the Government&#39;s intention &#39;to implement a national health education programme directed towards young people&#39;. That is to be on the basis of the provision of up to $500,000 a year on a 3-year programme. The second point made in the statement was that the Commonwealth would &#39;seek uniform State and Commonwealth action on health labelling of cigarette packages&#39;. The third point was &#39;to require all cigarette advertising on radio and television to include a health warning&#39;. Those are the 3 categorical statements. Then there followed in my Press statement explanations under those 3 heads. </para>
          <para>It is quite obvious that the decisions that the Government has taken are fundamental decisions of principle consequent upon a submission 1 put to the Government. It is now my responsibility, as Minister for Health, to implement, without undue delay, the principles that the Government has adopted. 1 am happy to be able to say - I have issued a further Press statement indicating this - that there is to be a meeting of Ministers for Health in Sydney next Tuesday al which we will be discussing in particular at least the second point of this programme relating to the uniform labelling of cigarettes with a health warning. I also will be giving the States an indication of the health education programme directed to the young and I will be seeking the cooperation of the States in relation to this matter. Thirdly, 1 will be having some discussions with the States on a matter which is entirely within the responsibility of the Commonwealth. I refer to health warnings in radio and television advertising. </para>

              <para>- The honourable senator asks mc about the education programme, lt may well be that, bearing in mind that matters of principle only have been decided, in the education programme directed to the young we will use the facilities of all the State education systems. The education programme may be directed in some way to the normal advertising of health matters relating to the young. It may well be that advertising on radio and television is a natural course to follow. The programme has lo be worked out. This is a big challenge to me as Minister and to my Department. Having had decisions taken we have to implement them. I indicated that I am having a meeting with State Ministers for Health next Tuesday in order to show that there is no delay. I am happy to indicate also that arrangements have &#39;been made for a discussion this Friday with certain people representing radio and television interests and also the tobacco industry. Obviously these people have problems so far as this matter is concerned. Everybody will realise that it is one thing to decide that cigarette packages are to be labelled with a health warning but it is most desirable, in view of the fact that this rests officially with the six States other than the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory that we get some degree of uniformity in the labelling. That is one of the exercises that I have in front of me on Friday in my discussions with the industry groups, including the radio and television people, and next Tuesday when I will be talking to the State Ministers for Health. </para>

            <para>- Is the Acting PostmasterGeneral aware that practically the  whole  of the State of Tasmania can be encompassed within a circle of 150 miles radius? Does he not consider that in the circumstances it is ridiculous to have 3 telephone directories for such a relatively small area with a population of under 400,000 people? Will he ask the PostmasterGeneral to take steps to revert to the use of one telephone directory for Tasmania at the next reprint and so considerably reduce the inconvenience currently being experienced by telephone subscribers in that State? </para>

            <para>- I refer the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry to a question I recently asked the Minister concerning war service land settlers in South Australia, with particular reference to rental and financial problems being experienced by war service settlers on Kangaroo Island. As these problems are similar to those experienced by soldier settlers in Zone 5 in South Australia, I again ask whether the favourable determinations made in respect of Zone 5 settlers will flow on and provide similar betterment of the position of Kangaroo Island settlers? </para>

            <para>- I think the honourable senator will recall that in answer to his last question on this subject I informed him that representatives of the South Australian Government had come to Canberra and had held discussions with officials of the Department of Primary Industry, and I think they saw the Minister also at that time. Following those talks, discussions were also held with Zone 5 representatives. The problems raised in respect of Zone 5 were specific to the area in which the representatives live. I understand that an examination of their submissions is still taking place. I also understand that a review is proceeding of the war service land settlement situation at Kangaroo Island. As the problems relating to both subjects are rather complex the examinations are still taking place. I understand that most of the settlers in Zone 5 have now signed their leases. </para>

            <para>- I noted with great personal sadness and horror the number of reported deaths in road accidents, as 1 think every honourable senator would do. I have some general comments to make on the activities of the Department of Shipping and Transport in the general field of road safety. It has set up an expert group on road safety and since the formation of the Australian Transport Advisory Council the Commonwealth has been undertaking road safety publicity in educational campaigns. Another significant Commonwealth contribution towards reducing the road toll includes grants to the States for road research, research into vehicle design and the servicing of the Australian Transport Advisory Council advisory committee dealing with road laws, vehicle safety and performance. Law enforcement, traffic control, vehicle registration, driver licensing and road designs are matters which must involve State and Territory responsibility. Nonetheless, the suggestion that this is a human problem at which a better level of responsibility might be encouraged through an educational programme is a good suggestion and T shall take it up with the responsible Minister. </para>

          <para class="block">The question of my inflicting the visit of the Concorde on Australia is, of course, not the case. It is the Government&#39;s decision to permit the aircraft to come to Australia on a flight which brings to this country, and indeed to a wide range of Middle East and Far East countries, a group of English people, among them a distinguished member of the Government - the Lord Privy Seal. We have been very careful indeed to evaluate the whole operation with extreme care, and the evaluation of the flight paths on any demonstration flights is still going on. The honourable senator may be assured that great care is being taken, and that we seek at all times to establish the truth of assertions that are made about supersonic flight. We do it as far as we possibly can on the best information we have, and we do approach it in the public interest. </para>

              <para>- lt is true that some evidence was given to an inquiry on health in the Northern Territory about native bom babies. All I can say is that the Department of Health in the Northern Territory has, over a period of time, made strenuous efforts to combat the problems that exist, particularly those in the field of medicine, nursing and nutrition. In the relatively short time I have been Minister for Health I have been to the Northern Territory twice to investigate these problems. As the Senate would know, during my time as Minister for Health the Department of Health has acquired what was the Mount Gillen Motel and converted it into a care centre for, in particular, the babies and young children in the Centre. The efforts we have made over a period of time have saved the lives of many children who would otherwise have died. In the process of doing so we have increased the strain on the existing medical and hospital activities. The problems that exist and the chronic illnesses that have occurred have placed a very heavy and continuing strain on my Department&#39;s resources. </para>

          <para>I feel that I would like to make a statement in some depth on the matter. It has become clear that in order to lower the levels of infant and child morbidity and mortality among Aborigines in the Northern Territory it is necessary to have an improvement in the general socio-economic status of Aborigines. To a high degree that would go beyond my Department&#39;s direct responsibility. The need for social progress is particularly evident in such areas as personal and community hygiene and sanitation. An awareness of the causation of disease is one of the requirements of healthy living in larger communities. It is a very complex problem. I do not think that I should at question time go beyond saying that, in collaboration with the other departments which are involved, I am working hard on the matter, f would like to have some discussions with, in particular the welfare section of the Department of the Interior before I proceed any further by way of giving an answer in depth. It is a complex problem. It is a &#34;latter which is a source of continual anxiety to us all. What has to be understood is that whilst one can do all the nest things in the world in the way of providing medical care the real essence of the problem which exists in the Aboriginal community, particularly in relation to babies, is one of prevention of disease. That is the essence of the thing. Prevention is something which, with all the best goodwill in the world, is nol directly within my responsibility. But, as a responsible Minister for State. I would not walk away from any responsibility ro do all that I can to get to the source of the problem, which is really and truly in the area of prevention of disease. If we can get that going in a much more effective manner than it is going at the present time we will be automatically able to take the weight of the load off the medical services, which are overbearing on the medical resources of the Commonwealth in the Territory up to this point of time. </para>

In view of the increase in traffic to the Gold Coast and the fact that the facilities are overtaxed at present will the Minister tell the Senate whether his Department will be calling for tenders for the construction of the proposed new airport terminal on the Gold Coast? </para>

            <para>- When one considers the attractions of the Gold Coast, both fixed and mobile, it is not hard to realise that it is very close to fact to state that the traffic to and from the Gold Coast by air is about double the national rate. As the honourable senator said, it is a little better than double. Because of this, the Department of Civil Aviation has been conscious for some time that the terminal building needed to be enlarged and expanded. The latest information I have is that our planning work is well advanced. We ought to bc in a situation to call tenders in May or early June. </para>

            <para>- As the Senate knows, it has been a long job to obtain an improvement in the parallel schedule situation. When we were able to obtain the recent improvement and this was announced, it was mentioned that we were seeking still further improvements. One of the areas mentioned was the DarwinAdelaide, Darwin-Brisbane service. While I am on this subject, 1 should mention also that we are not entirely happy with the Canberra-Sydney and Canberra-Melbourne services. We are seeking to improve both those services. There are problems in doing this, at the same time maintaining a fully viable economic operation. Part of the problem is the load factor and the number of people travelling at a given point of time. The honourable senator may be assured that the work of trying to improve this position is still proceeding. </para>

          <para class="block">There is a simple answer to the question and there is no reason why it should not have been answered. The simple fact is that the Commonwealth has no constitutional power at all in relation to advertising in the States, except in relation to television and radio. Tt has power in relation to other matters within its own territories. That simple answer should have been given almost immediately. The surprising thing is that I did not give it at the time the question was asked. I shall ascertain the reason why. That is the answer. </para>
          <para>The question was asked as a result of my issuing a Press statement at the weekend. My statement dealt with the labelling of cigarette packages with a health warning. On the constitutional problem it is well to remember that in this field the Commonwealth has no power in areas other than the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. Happily the States are moving towards such labelling and thai is a plus factor. The second part of the honourable senator&#39;s question referred to an education programme. That is a Commonwealth responsibility. The third part of his question dealt with advertising on television and radio. The Commonwealth does have constitutional power in that regard. I have indicated that we propose to intercede and use our power to insist upon a health warning. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry. When will the Government make public its decision on a proposed wool acquisition scheme? I refer to growing reports that the Prime Minister is still stalling because he fears that the cost of at least $300m could be a major vote loser at the next election. Can the Minister state how long <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Richard</inline> Randal) will take to complete his report? Will the Government guarantee that any recommended scheme will be placed before the public well before the election so that its advantages and disadvantages, in relation particularly to the economic factors involved, can be debated at length? Will the Government deny that there is a clash between the Liberal Party and the Country Party over the scheme, with the Country Party Ministers supporting it, for obvious reasons, and the Prime Minister opposing it because he is worried about its vote losing potential in urban electorates? </para>

Firstly, the submissions of the Australian Wool Industry Conference are still being studied by the Minister for Primary Industry. When he is ready to put a submission before Cabinet he will do so. In regard to the Randall Committee report, that Committee is still investigating and I would not know when it will conclude its investigations. </para>

            <para>- Can the AttorneyGeneral inform the Senate the minimum age established in Commonwealth law below which charges of carnal knowledge can be lodged against a male for engaging in sexual relations with the consent of the female partner? Now that the publication The Little Red Schoolbook&#39; which has Federal Government aproval is being distributed in areas of Commonwealth jurisdiction, openly advocating sexual relations amongst school children, and as there is now evidence of distribution amongst primary as well as secondary school pupils, will the Federal Government be considering altering restrictive legislation so that 14- year old schoolboys, who accept the advice of the book to defy parents and engage in such relations with the consent of 12 or 13-year old schoolgirls, will be protected from prosecution under the criminal code? </para>

            <para>- I regret that my detailed knowledge of this matter does not enable me to answer accurately the first question which the honourable senator has asked, but I can assure him that there is no intention on the part of the Government to so alter the law to give effect to the promiscuity which the honourable senator is saying will emerge from &#39;The Little Red Schoolbook&#39;. I pass no comments on what may be the effect of that book on people who read it. However, I can assure the honourable senator that it is not the Government&#39;s intention to alter the law in the area about which he spoke. </para>

          </talk.start>
          <para>In response to representations from both sides of the House, the amounts of travelling allowances paid to members of Parliament have been reviewed. Along with his recommendations for increased salaries, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Kerr in his report tabled in Parliament on 8th December 1971 recommended that travelling allowances payable to members and to Ministers and officeholders be increased. The Government subsequently decided not to proceed with any of the 3 Bills relating to increases in Parliamentary salaries and allowances. That remains the position. Travelling allowances are not covered in this legislation and can be regarded separately from salaries, electorate allowances and Ministerial allowances. </para>
          <para>The travelling allowance, or Canberra allowance, paid to members of Parliament for living expenses and out-of-pocket expenses incurred in attending Parliamentary sittings has been $15 a day since 1968. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Kerr recommended $22 a day. In several areas of the Commonwealth Service in Canberra in the less senior grades, the travelling allowance now paid is higher than the Canberra allowance paid to members of Parliament. It has been put that to meet members&#39; increased living costs in Canberra and the increased costs of out-of-pocket expenses, the current rate of Canberra allowance should be increased. It has been decided to accept this view and to increase the allowance to $22 a day as recommended by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Kerr. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Kerr made recommendations about the payment of Canberra allowance for Party and Committee meetings held when the Parliament is not sitting. These recommendations will be accepted. It was also recommended that the conditions of payment of travelling allowance be clarified. With this objective, a review of the conditions of payment will be undertaken. As part of his general review, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Kerr recommended that members of Parliament residing in the Australian Capital Territory should receive half the Canberra allowance. As this matter is now being treated in isolation, it has been decided that members of Parliament residing in the Australian Capital Territory will not receive any increase in Canberra allowance but will not have the allowance reduced. These members will continue to receive $15 a day. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline>Kerr recommended increased travelling allowances for Ministers and office-holders. In general, the amounts of these allowances have not changed since 1964. The allowances are paid for travel away from Canberra on official or Parliamentary business.

          <para class="block">This Bill seeks the approval of Parliament to the provision of a guarantee by the Commonwealth to a $US4.5m - $A3.8m - borrowing by the Administration of Papua New Guinea from the Asian Development Bank. The proceeds of the loan are for re-lending by the Administration to the Papua New Guinea Development Bank and will meet the foreign currency component of a number of development projects financed by that bank in Papua New Guinea over the next 3 years. The loan is the first which the Asian Development Bank has made to the Aministration since the admission of Papua New Guinea to membership of the Bank in April 1971. Accordingly, it is the first occasion on which Parliament has been asked to approve a guarantee by the Commonwealth for a loan made by the Asian Development Bank to the Administration. However, Parliament has on several previous occasions approved similar guarantees by the Commonwealth in respect of loans from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to the Administration. </para>
          <para>The loan documents, which are shown as schedules to the Bill, were settled recently during negotiations in Port Moresby which were attended by representatives of the Asian Development Bank, the Administration, the Commonwealth Government and the Papua New Guinea Development Bank. The principal purpose of the Papua New Guinea Development Bank, which is a statutory authority and commenced operations in . 1967, is to provide finance for primary production and for the establishment and development of industrial or commercial undertakings, particularly small undertakings. The loan from the Asian Development Bank will make a valuable contribution towards meeting these purposes. The loan carries an interest rate of 3 per cent per annum and will be made from the special funds resources of the Asian Development Bank. Repayments will commence in 1975 and be completed in 1987. </para>
          <para>Borrowings by the Papua New Guinea Administration automatically carry a Commonwealth guarantee by virtue of the operation of section 75a of the Papua New Guinea Act 1949-1971. Borrowings guaranteed under this provision are, however, mainly local borrowings and borrowings in Australia. However, the letter of assurances shown as the first schedule to the Bill, which is required from the Commonwealth as a pre-condition of the loan, must be authorised by specific legislation.I would mention that at the time of Papua New Guinea&#39;s admission to the Asian Development Bank Australia gave an undertaking to the Bank in accordance with article 3.3 of the agreement establishing the Bank that, until Papua New Guinea itself assumes responsibility for its own international relations, Australia would be responsible for all obligations that may be incurred by Papua New Guinea by reason of admission to membership in the Bank and enjoyment of the benefits of such membership. </para>
          <para>The Bill authorises the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden)</inline> to notify the Asian Development Bank that the Commonwealth approves the terms and conditions of the loan for the purpose of making the loan effective. The Bill provides that the undertakings in the letter of assurances shall be valid and binding obligations of the Commonwealth. It also provides for freedom of payments from Australian or Territory taxation or restrictions imposed by Australian or Territory law. It includes an appropriation on moneys required for the Commonwealth to make any payments under the guarantee. Certain assurances are also required from the Commonwealth by the Administration in connection with the loan and I take this opportunity of tabling the text of these assurances for the information of honourable senators. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

            <para>-  On the same point of order, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I draw your attention to standing order 418. I refer not to the first words but to the latter words of that standing order. I suggest that already what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> has said - I pass no comment upon the propriety of it - amounts to imputations of improper motives and personal reflection on a member of another House. I submit that the purpose of this standing order, as you said, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> is to preserve the comity between the 2 chambers. Indeed, the express intention of this standing order is that this chamber should not be used to impute improper motives or to reflect personally on members of the other House. I think that we in the Senate would take grave exception to having accusations levelled against members of the Senate by people in the House of Representatives if we in this chamber were unable to reply to them. ( believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> is fully aware of the implications of what he is doing and the fact that a person cannot be given a chance to reply in this chamber. </para>

The honourable senator, and I think the Senate, will be enlightened to have the documents, and rather than leaving the honourable senator in any doubt I am prepared to table the documents as I refer to them. A seminar was held in Melbourne on 26th and 27th May 1969.

The Senate will be interested to know that the meetings of this body which followed from time to time included discussions on various matters such as the internal political situation in Australia, in relation to which the objectives of this body were clearly set out. I am sure that honourable senators will be interested to know that at the meeting held on 7th to 9th March 1970 the internal political situation in Australia was discussed by this body, and the main objectives of political action during the previous year - 1969 - were set forth.

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline>I have other documents which set out the continuance of the activities of this organisation. For example, there are the notes of the meeting of 2nd and 3rd October 1971 which deal with such matters as  President  Nixon&#39;s announcement of his projected visit to China, the world power situation, the basis of new policy orientations in China and the United States and various other strategic matters of foreign policy, including policy submissions, defence policy, foreign policy and the industrial situation, which covers such things as the Australian Council of Trade Unions Congress. </para>
        <para>In dealing with that matter the following items are listed: Firstly, the significance of an ACTU congress; secondly, the numbers at the 1971 congress; thirdly, objectives of the moderates; fourthly, communist objectives; fifthly, Hawke objectives, and sixthly, the future. It then deals in some detail with the arbitration system and its various aspects, including the practical abolition of the penal provisions and various other matters. Amalgamations is an interesting topic which was dealt with. The meeting then went on to deal with the political situation, including the position of the Liberal Party. One of the matters dealt with in that discussion was the removal of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gorton</inline> as Prime Minister and as a Cabinet member. It then dealt with what it regarded as the main issues, such as State rights and the Public Service, and then went on to deal with the restructuring of Cabinet and the signs of internal disintegration of the Liberal Government. Other topics included the age and paucity of Cabinet material, arbitration, amalgamations, the South African tour, China policy and various other matters dealing with the ALP and the DLP. </para>
        <para>It is clear from what is set forth in the newspaper &#39;National U&#39; and in the other documents that there exists in Australia an organisation which has attempted - apparently it has been able - to manipulate the policies of the Government to achieve its own ends. That raises the most serious questions of the operation of our democratic process. If we are to have proper democratic process we believe that it should be an open political process. We know for good or for bad who are the members of the Australian Labor Party, the Australian Democratic Labor Party, the Liberal Party and the Australian Country Party. I believe that, of the meetings of these parties, the Federal Conference of the ALP is the only one which is quite open. But however it be, with all the defects which those parties might have, there has been a tradition of fairly open operation of a democratic process in which the persons who have participated have been known for their role. It seems to me that the documents which are referred to in the newspaper and the other documents by their internal consistency and the statements in relation to places, times and membership have every appearance of genuineness. If they are not genuine they can be quite easily exploded. There is an opportunity for that to be done. If they are genuine I think they raise most serious questions for this Government and for the people of Australia. Some questions are raised by the newspaper itself. I think that another question which comes promptly to everyone is: Is this the way in which policy should be manipulated in this country? </para>
        <para>I  think it is only right that the position of a minister of the Crown should be adverted to. He is a member of the other House. I think it is incumbent on the Government to inform the Senate and the people of Australia whether it is in fact true that the Minister while a member of the Liberal Party, prior to his becoming a Minister, was a member of a body which professes these aims to which I have referred and which sets out, on the face of it, to act against the interests of the Party to which he belongs and for which he was putting himself forward as a candidate to the Australian people. Is it in fact true that he was a member of a body whose objective was to pull down that Government in numbers although not to destroy  it  as  a  government and to advance the interests of another Party and to advance policies which were contrary in many respects to those of his own Party. I say no more than that. What is involved here is a serious question in relation to the operation of democracy in Australia. In the interests of the Government, the Opposition and the people of Australia a full and frank answer is required from the Government as to whether democracy should work in Australia in this clandestine fashion or whether the traditional open democracy which has been practised in Australia should continue. 1 seek leave to table the newspaper in question and the documents to which I referred and from which I quoted in part. </para>

          <para>(10.40)  -  I say at the outset that I have never heard anything like that dose of sheer and utter trivia in my life before. It is trivia in a national parliament and might, be described as an attempt to walk around standing order 418 and cast a reflection on a member of Parliament in another place. I must admit that 1 am appalled to think that the Leader of the Opposition in this place <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> should do this. I believe that this exercise was attempted to divert attention from what is happening in the Labor Party and its own problems at Newcastle in the Shortland electorate. Believing that and having stated it I do not propose to respond to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> said because it is utter trivia. In the national parliament, whether at question time or when legislation is being dealt with, emphasis is put on the conduct of the affairs of the nation for the good of the people of Australia. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The Leader of the Opposition has said that there was a meeting of some group at which he claims a member in another place was present and therefore it was evil and wrong and damaging to a certain Party and that it reflects on the corner Party here, the Australian Democratic Labor Party. If that is the best that the Australian Labor Party can do then I say that we have nothing to worry about in the future. Obviously <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> did not have his heart in his job. Obviously he did not have a stomach for what he was saying in view of the way in which he put his case. He knows in his heart as do the men who sit behind him that this is an attempt to use the character of a person in a political exercise. I must say that I am terribly disappointed in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy,</inline> I conclude on this note: If there is anything to be said about another man in another place let somebody get up on his feel and say it there. Let him have the guts to do it there. </para>

            <para>- It was said on This Day Tonight&#39;. There were 2 advertisements for this particular adjournment speech. My word, the Australian Labor Party must have a pull inside the Australian Broadcasting Commission. I came along and expected something worthwhile. But what have we heard? We have heard a statement from that notable newspaper of the Australian Union of Students and the alleged minutes of some meetings supplied by an anonymous pimp or informer who was not prepared to make the allegations in his own name. I feel that if there is anything worse than a pimp or an informer it is a proxy for a pimp or an informer. For that reason I regretted having to listen to what we heard tonight. </para>

I am not a member of it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> is not a member of it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline> is nol a member of it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Little</inline> is not a member of it. We have never been members of that organisation. We have never been asked to join it. I am a little bit disappointed in this respect because the list of its members is so impressive that I would have been honoured to be in their company. </para>
        <para>All I can say is that the statement which appears in that newspaper of the Australian Union of Students is typical of the malicious lies in which that organisation indulges and of which I had a personal example within recent weeks. Some weeks ago, on the Michael Willesee show, the  president  of this organisation which claims to represent 148,000 students - of those students, 146,000 would not even know it exists - was permitted to launch an attack on me in which he said that I had taken part in a student campaign against the paying of fines for students at La Trobe University, that I personally organised the campaign and that I addressed a big meeting of 60 students at Yarrabundy Avenue, or somewhere or other, in Drummoyne last February. </para>
        <para>It is a good cause, but I knew nothing about it. I had had nothing to do with the campaign. He said that I had been at Drummoyne in February. I have not been in Sydney since May 12 months. </para>

I have received no reply. </para>
        <para>I would not believe any statement made by the Australian Union of Students on a bet. It stands convicted of having publicly told a deliberate and malicious lie about a member of this Parliament. When that body was asked to repudiate that state ment, it did not have the guts even to reply to this letter. I listened to what was said here about people being associated with undemocratic bodies and what was said about a Minister. We have somebody who is spoken of as a prospective Minister. He attends certain organisations called moratoriums and he advocates that the, should break the law. On other occasion: he has come before the Parliament in association with people that others would <inline font-style="italic">no</inline> touch with a barge pole. In their company he has advocated again that the law b( broken. </para>
        <para>I have no hesitation in stigmatising whawe have heard tonight as humbug anc hypocrisy of the worst type. I anc confirmed in my opinion by the fact tha: this information obviously has been supplied to the Leader of the Labor Party ir this chamber by an organisation which has been shown within the past month to be an organisation which is prepared to propagate deliberate lies about people. I would never believe anything from the Australian Union of Students on a bet. </para>

My hope is that the Government will realise what we have had to go through during the years when we had such infiltrators in our ranks. However, the Government will learn in time to deal with them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> objected when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> sought leave of the Senate to table the document that has been referred to tonight. 1 wish to make some reference to the document which is entitled National U&#39;.

A little character carrying a box labelled Dynamite&#39; is saying: &#39;It won&#39;t be long now folks!&#39; The headline is: &#39;Federal Minister betrays Party. Secret national group.&#39; The document reads: </para>

          <para>The election of John Gorton as Prime Minister, with the associated defence policies, was an anathema to PWF&#39;s objectives. It is significant that at this time Kevin Cairns publicly announced his refusal to serve under Gorton as Deputy Government Whip. By the time of the PWF meeting of March 1970, the group was actively working for the removal of John Gorton from the Prime Ministership (Documents, p.  4).

            <para>- I am glad to note a little activity by Government Ministers because previously they were silent. What sort of over-reaction is this? After all, it is a newspaper report. The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> asked for leave to table the newspaper. It is a simple document which contains references to all these people who are supposed to be so objectionable. It was only to be tabled, not incorporated in Hansard, but the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Greenwood),</inline> wilh his great sense of justice- </para>

Having raised this subject, I hope that the people who occupy seats in the Parliament will realise that the electors outside this Parliament are aware of this insidious, pernicious influence that is in our midst.

          <para>-  I do not know why such an attack was launched by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> in this adjournment debate. It may be that the attention which was drawn to the Standing Orders changed the course of the allegations he was going to make. I do not know. It is curious that this matter was raised on an Australian Broadcasting Commission programme this evening and that pre-warning was given of the fact that this debate would take place. It raises the interesting question, I might say, of who manipulates whom between the ABC, or some people in the ABC, and the Australian Labor Party. I must say that I myself do not know most of the persons who were mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> and by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Byrne</inline> this evening, but I do know of them by repute. One thing which characterises them is that they are all articulate, academic people who are dedicated to the resistance of communism in this country. On the record they have written and spoken intelligently, sensibly and acceptably against various facets of communism and how it is permeating Australian society. I would have thought that for that if for nothing else, in the sense of the tone in which they have conducted their debate, they ought to have the applause and praise of all Australians. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>It is a ridiculous assertion to suggest that a body which is concerned with Australia&#39;s defence, the maintenance of Australia&#39;s freedom and the alerting of the people of Australia to the menace of communism should in some way be regarded as manipulating democracy. I do not know the details of the scurrilous document to which reference has been made. I do not advert at all to the smears or suggested innuendoes which have been raised. I leave those. But I am concerned - very concerned - with the general allegation which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> has raised in premise, that is, that the nation ought to be alerted to the fact that there are groups in this community which will seek to manipulate the democratic processes for ends of which Australia would not approve. I think we have seen examples of how this is done. </para>
        <para>I am grateful to the Labor Party for having raised this matter because, instead of referring to anonymous documents, instead of referring to those people who have said something but who are not prepared to put their name to it and instead of using this place as the means by which to defame, slander and denigrate people outside the Parliament who do not have the opportunity that members of Parliament have of saying what they would like to say in this place, we should look at the record of one organisation which has manipulated democracy in this country, which has been declared by a very well known and established Australian organisation to have so manipulated democracy and which has, when certain political advantages have been achieved, and the cloak has been removed, told us that it has not manipulated democracy in the way in which the original condemnation had it. May I refer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> to what was said in 1967 by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam,</inline> who is still the Leader of the Opposition. Speaking at the Victorian State Conference of the Australian Labor Party, he said: </para>

          <para>The people of Victoria have just shown they prefer Bolte ... to Labor under its present management. The Victorian Executive included an influential handful of men who had flouted ALP policy on unity tickets, organised or led political strikes in defiance of the ACTU, disregarded and repudiated Party and ACTU policy on the manning of ships to Vietnam and organised demonstrations against the Trades Hall Council Executive. It is disgraceful that these men should be on the ALP Executive which can appear to influence Federal policies and selections.  1  will exercise my right to repudiate such men as I believe disloyal to the ALP, disruptive of its electoral prospects and destructive of all the ALP stands for. </para>

            <para>- I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Little&#39;s</inline> interjection. I am not able to say whether most of its members were members of the Communist Party. But it is common knowledge that the significant unions in the Trade Union Defence Committee were controlled by the Communist Party and were exercising a very significant influence throughout the whole of the Labor movement in Victoria. One can only suppose that there must have been truth in that allegation. Otherwise, why would the Federal Executive of the Australian Labor Party in 1970 decide to disband the Victorian Branch on the basis that this Trade Union Defence Committee had exericised an undue influence. The Executive&#39;s decision was: </para>

          <para>The Federal Executive finds that the Trade Union Defence Committee has been permitted to dominate the Victorian Branch and the Victorian Executive. But it finds no evidence that any person who has taken part in the compilation of the  TUDC  ticket at the Australian Labor Party Victorian conference was not  a  member of the Australian Labor Party. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">That was a very significant decision because it implied, firstly, that these influences about which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> had spoken in 1967 did have a control and an influence in the Victorian Branch of the ALP and, therefore, they ought to be removed from that control. I have said that this was a confidence trick. It was a confidence trick for 2 reasons. Firstly, after the so-called reform branch held its first meeting, who was appointed as  president  of the new organisations but the person who had been the  president  of the old organisation. I think it is fair to quote what the man himself felt about this matter. In the &#39;Age&#39; of 17th May 1971 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Crawford</inline> said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Federal intervention in the Victorian Branch  8 months  ago was an attempt to bring about a change in the personalities controlling the branch. </para>
          <para>The advantage which has come from intervention is that it has caused  a  lot of structural changes, but we have the same personalities. Victoria is getting the best of both worlds.  1 can only suppose that this is an indication that this organisation, which previously had manipulated the Victorian Branch, which had caused such an unfortunate image for the Australian Labor Party throughout Australia, was still in control of that organisation in Victoria. One might suppose that this was also vindicated by the decision of the Federal Conference of that Party which was held in 1971. With a relatively minimum amount of publicity it overruled the decision of the Federal Executive that this Trade Union Defence Committee had in fact exercised such control. So the whole exercise is one in which the public was sought to be fooled by the reform of the Victorian Branch of the ALP. But at the next conference meeting, rather quietly, they repudiated the decision which was made at the Federal Executive meeting. We still find in control in Victoria the people who were in fact controlling the Branch and influencing it before the intervention took place. </para>

        <para>If the record is of no conviction, one can only look at what has happened. We have had from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Crawford</inline> the rather infamous call to mutiny, which we all remember, when a meeting of which he was the  chairman  called upon the troops in Vietnam to mutiny. We have had the latter day statement from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> when he advised all those national servicemen who were serving in Vietnam that they should not fight any longer if they conscientiously felt that way. We have had instances in more recent times involving <inline font-weight="bold">Dr J.</inline> F. Cairns in which he has called upon those who support the North Vietnamese to go into the street in protest. More recently still we have had the decision of the Victorian ALP conference, nol declaring policy but merely expressing an attitude that it fell that North Vietnam ought to win and that it drew encouragement from the success of North Vietnamese. This represents the same continuing pro-communist attitude which was exhibited by elements in the ALP in the days when the Trade Union Defence Committee was acknowledge to be influencing - in fact controlling - the ALP. The general attitudes and policies are the same as they were before. </para>
        <para>Does this not illustrate that within the Australian Labor Party is a group of communist in trade union officials and other sympathisers of communist officials who are using the Australian Labor Party for their own purposes? Why is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> not concerned with that? After all, if the newspapers are to be believed, he was a strong defender of the Trade Union Defence Committee at one stage. If, on the basis of the premise which he put forward tonight, he is really concerned that the people of Australia ought to be alerted to those who would manipulate democratic processes for ends which are not in accordance with those which Australians favour, the people of Australia should be informed. I am prepared to inform them. But is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> or anybody in the ALP prepared to come out and condemn the communist influence within that Party? Is any Opposition senator prepared to come out and challenge what was done by the Victorian Executive ALP conference a couple of weeks ago? When I say &#39;challenge&#39;, I do not mean challenge on the basis that they do not have a right to declare policy; I mean a challenge on the merits of what they said, because I believe that within the Australian Labor Party there is a substantial influence- </para>

            <para>- I am grateful for the indulgence of the Senate. I started on the basis that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> raised, that we ought to be concerned about influences which would manipulate the democratic processes. I think that I have illustrated, possibly straying a little from the direct path on occasions and not dealing exactly with the matters which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> raised, but returning to the same point, that we ought to be concerned about these influences which manipulate democratic processes. Above all, the Australian people ought to be aware of the shadow influences behind the Australian Labor Party, those influences which called for support for the North Vietnamese, those influences which seek to develop political strikes for ends which are identical with the ends which the communists support, those general policies in which elements in the ALP and the communists find no reason to disagree. These are facts which ought to be made public. I welcome the opportunity which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> has presented to be able to make these points. I would only say in respect of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cairns,</inline> because the comment has been made, that I know and his colleagues know that he is a person who supports the Liberal Party, who supports democracy, who believes in freedom and who opposes communism. I do not believe that people who have those beliefs are unworthy of the support of the people of Australia. </para>

          <para>- I wish to return to the matter which has been raised this evening by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy.</inline> I do not intend to get into a discussion about the Victorian Branch of the Australian Labor Party, although there would be occasions when I would be prepared to debate that in the same way as I would be very interested to have a discussion about the resignations within 1 month of 2 State leaders of the Liberal Party, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Steele</inline> Hall in South Australia and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bethune</inline> in Tasmania. I would be very happy also to debate the creation of a new break-away Liberal movement in South Australia. I would be happy to debate the recent resignation of the Western Australian State  President  and State Secretary of the Australian Democratic Labor Party and many members of the executive of that party. I would be happy to discuss the charge made by the former State Secretary of the DLP, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Martyr,</inline> who was previously State Secretary of the National Civic Council, that he had been removed from his office by the </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Federal Executive of the DLP because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Charlie</inline> Court, the State  Deputy  Leader of the Liberal Party, had been to the Federal Executive of the DLP and had asked it to freeze funds because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Martyr</inline> and the State Branch of the DLP were running dead against the ALP. </para>
        <para>All these matters would be very interesting to debate. I am sure that we could have a most fruitful discussion on them. But I do not want to debate the matter involving <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Martyr</inline> and the DLP for one reason: I believe that it is sub judice. It would be sub judice because the officials of the State Branch of the DLP have issued a writ against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Martyr,</inline> their former Secretary. It would be most improper for us to canvass the merits of their dispute. Indeed, I think that it would be unsportsmanlike to canvass the unfortunate predicament in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Steele</inline> Hall and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bethune</inline> have found themselves over the past month. </para>
        <para>I would like to return to the matter that has been raised this evening by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy).</inline> It has arisen from some articles which appeared in the &#39;National U\ the organ of the students of the Australian National University, and also from some documents which we endeavoured to table. I would have thought that if the Government or the DLP had any serious interest in the matter they would have been very happy to see us table the documents relating to a meeting of an organisation known as Peace with Freedom. It has been said, quite erroneously, by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Greenwood)</inline> that the documents are anonymous documents. One of the documents of which we have photostat copies is signed in the name J. McAuley of Melbourne and is addressed to the members of the organisation. It sets out &#39;.he arrangements for a seminar to be held on 26th and 27th May 1969. </para>

            <para>- The documents which have been produced make allegations that there is an organisation which has certain political goals. The membership of the organisation includes a number of people such as the Director, or whatever his title is, of the National Civic Council, various academics of, to say the least,  a  conservative persuasion, and the present Minister for Housing, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kevin</inline> Cairns, who in 1969 was a back bench member of the House of Representatives. The allegation is that during this period these people discussed various steps that they should take relating to the Federal election in 1969, one of their goals being a substantia! reduction in the majority which the Liberal Party and the Country Party held in the House of Representatives at that time and an increase in the Democratic Labor Party vote. The purpose of the operation was the replacement of the so-called Freeth-Fairhall policies on defence with the Fraser policies on defence and a  change in the Liberal Government. That is what is alleged. In itself, this is probably a political motive which anybody could have. But the serious aspect of the charge, whichI cannot confirm or deny, is that a member of the Liberal Party who is now a Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kevin</inline> Cairns, was a party to the discussions. </para>

        <para>The purpose in bringing the matter before the Parliament is that it can be placed on the public record so that the people of Australia will know that in the national legislature attention has been drawn to clandestine activities which were directed towards securing  a  change in the composition of the Government without an appeal being made to the people of Australia. We believe that the matter is  a  serious one. I do not think that anybody would have any doubt that during the year 1969 members of the Government parties were seeking the removal of the then Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gorton.</inline> Indeed, they succeeded. I do not think that there is anybody who does not know that there was a  very intense and systematic campaign against the then Minister for External Affairs, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Freeth.</inline> I think that a number of senators would have heard only last week an interjection by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> congratulating himself on the success of his Party in removing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Freeth</inline> from the Federal Parliament. </para>

            <para>- I withdraw the word &#39;conspiracy&#39; and replace it with the word &#39;discussions&#39;. If he were involved in these discussions - perhaps I should say this without any perforative implications - or common purpose of removing the then Prime Minister from his office and the then Minister for External Affairs from his office, it is a serious matter. Having ventilated the allegations, our part in the matter is complete. If members of the Liberal Party are totally satisfied, if they believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cairns</inline> is not the kind of person who would go to a meeting with other persons to discuss the removal of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gorton,</inline> that is entirely up to them. One can congratulate them on their holy simplicity, but I do not think that one can look upon them as being very perspicacious. If that is what they believe, that is entirely up to them. If they believe that there were not discussions involving members of the Liberal Party as well as other people about the removal of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gorton</inline> and about a change in the Federal Government&#39;s policy, that is entirely their business. But we do say that if there is any concern among some members of the Liberal Party that their affairs should bc conducted as openly as the affairs of the Australian Labor Party are conducted and if there is some concern among members of the Liberal Party that people holding high office in their Party should not have entered into negotiations with other persons in order to bring about the loss of scats of certain Liberal members of Parliament, I believe that they should broach this matter with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cairns.</inline> If he gives a simple denial and if he says that he knows nothing about the documents or that they were forgeries or that if they are authentic Professor McAuley had no right to use his name, they are perfectly entitled to accept those assurances. But I do suggest to them that they do make some inquiries. They could find that there are much more serious problems existing in the Federal Liberal Party, albeit latently, than those that have been revealed already in South Australia and Tasmania. If this were to be established I would think that they should thank us for having drawn the matter to their attention </para>

          <para>- I like to speak well of everybody but some people make it very hard for me to do so, and the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon</inline> make it almost impossible. We have had a typical clowning performance from the honourable senator. Early in his speech he indicated that he did not like the organisation called Peace for Freedom because most of his policies and the policies of his Party are directed towards peace, or rather the absence of struggle, against communist subversion or aggression. </para>

        <para>The only mild allegation in the whole of this scurrilous little journal to which I propose to advert is the sheer nonsense of the suggestion that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kevin</inline> Cairns, the Minister for Housing, would actively connive at reducing the Liberal vote. One has only to state the proposition to see how absurd it is. The Minister holds the seat of Lilley. Lilley is a swinging seat. He is elected only some days after the vote is held. The result is never known on the Saturday night of the election. Lilley is one of the most doubtful seats in the Com- monwealth yet this nonsensical rag puts up the proposition that this man deliberately connived at risking his own seat. It is a ridiculous exercise in political brinkmanship, if I can use a word so beloved of our friends on the left. I spent a long time with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Justin</inline> O&#39;Byrne at the United Nations in New York, and I had hoped that my long association with him and the tutelage he received from me would have given him more sense. I am sorry that he has fallen for the childish scribblings of National U&#39;. One of the odd things about this whole proposition is that honourable senators opposite fail to see communist subversion where it exists; they fail to Observe a civil disorder; they encourage and incite riots, industrial disputes and disturbances, and they are completely unaffected. Contrast that with what Shakespear said: </para>

        <para class="block">But they do not even look up. That is the sort of absurd nonsense which has brought the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> to the table this evening. In a slightly hyperbolic sense that is what has happened here. I admire <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy&#39;s</inline> tender solicitude for democracy. It does him credit. He is normally a kindly man. I am sure he is good to his immediate family. He is courteous to government senators and to people generally, and a man full of the milk of human kindness. One realises from the half-hearted and dispirited way in which he put up this nonsense this evening that he was reading from a brief in which he did not believe. Perhaps his motives this evening may have been a little less than praiseworthy. I have had a quick look at this &#39;National U&#39; nonsense. I would not hang a dog on everything that I have read in it. J notice that one portion of the article was written, I think, by a man called Zerman who was lapping around <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> in King&#39;s Hall like a puppy a few days ago. Of course, anyone is accused of being in the right wing if he wears a collar and a tie, or if he fails to pull the forelock to left wing subversion. Professor McAuley is a prime target for this sort of rubbish. He is the man who went on record as saying - he proved his point on a programme of the Australian Broadcasting Commission - that it is much easier to manipulate students than the Waterside Workers Federation. Of course, this made him a prime target. 1 do not think it is necessary for me to trace the sort of policies subscribed to by the students who felt it their national duty to produce this nonsense on ABC national television tonight and in their newspaper. They are largely Labor Party policies - support of draft resisters; opposition to national service; conniving at the breaking of the law; the destruction, as far as possible, of Australia&#39;s defence arrangements, and actually collecting money and sending it to the enemy in Haiphong. They are the sort of people who have put this rag together. Notice the people whom the Leader of the Opposition and other honourable senators attack. One is Geoffrey Fairbairn. Of course, they would attack him. He has torn their policy on Vietnam to ribbons time and again. Owen Harries is another. Of course, they would attack Harries. He has torn their policy to ribbons so often that it cannot be debated. Then we move to the smear on Kevin Cairns. I think this is contemptible, especially on the evidence which has been adduced. Being of a kindly disposition I would not suggest that the Leader of the Opposition was motivated by any thought of the Shortland pre-selection. 1 feel that perhaps he might have enlightened us in regard to that matter off his own bat. That is one of the matters which a person may feel is worthy of discussion or thought in this debate. </para>
        <para>I listened with great care as the Leader of the Opposition listed the policies of this group. I do not. know its members. I know some of the men in it personally and I am proud to know them but I do not know their organisation. I do not know what they do. The suggestion that it is a secret organisation working for the destruction of democracy is so absurd that I feel that the Leader of the Opposition must have been joking. Most of the matters mentioned in the newspaper refer to defence, foreign policy, the influence of communist subversion in Australia, the Vietnam war - all matters which are good solid points of Liberal Party policy. What is wrong with that? What is wrong with the suggestion that the group should work against an ALP victory? I think it is the bounden duty of every sane elector in this country to work in the same way, and  1  am sure that at the end of the year that is what they will do. </para>
        <para>This worry sits very oddly, as I have said, on the shoulders of my friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy.</inline> He is worried about the attack on democracy in Australia.  His  party is committed to electing a draft resister, a draft dodger, in the electorate of Hotham in Victoria. In another place his leader  -  I use the word in a whimsical sense - says that draft dodging is no crime. In my own State, George Crawford and Bill Hartley, just fresh from his unlawful occupation at the La Trobe University - are still powerful influential men in the Victorian State Council of the Australian Labor Party. Their lamentable and deplorable resolution supporting the North Vietnamese aggression against our own 150 instructors who are still in Vietnam, our American allies whose naval, air and sea forces are involved, and our South Vietnamese allies alongside whom so many of our own men fought and lied, is only echoing what was said by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr J.</inline> F. Cairns in another place in a speech on which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> congratulated him. Of course, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> saw the political disaster that faced this resolution he had to try in some vague way to disown it. but no amount of white washing and no amount of hindsight will get away from the fact that the Party to which the Leader of the Opposition belongs is not interested in the defence of this nation. Being a man of few words, I simply say to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy:</inline> Physician, heal thyself. </para>

              <para>and (2) In speaking to the press in Tokyo on 12th October I recalled that during the past 10 years a pattern had developed whereby China, to supplement its domestic wheat production, purchased hard wheat from Canada and soft wheat from Australia. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>I noted that in 1971 China had very good harvests and did not need any soft wheat but I expressed the expectation that when they needed our wheat again they would buy it because, in practice, we had found that they did not mix politics with trade. This view was reinforced by the fact that, at the 1971 Spring Canton Fair, Australian businessmen concluded orders valued at over$ 15m, primarily for metal exports. </para>
          <para>I recognised that because the Chinese had not needed our wheat they might take advantage of the opportunity to suggest that purchases were being refused for political reasons. I noted that Australia had sold more wheat in 1971 than normal but we wished to maintain our customers and I expressed the hope that the Chinese would continue to buy wheat from us when they required it. In the same interview I pointed out that the 2 countries who sold the most to China - Japan and West Germany - did not have diplomatic relations with it. </para>
          <para>The Australian Wheat Board is the sole authority for the marketing of wheat in Australia and of wheat and flour for overseas. While the Board is not empowered to advise the Government on the matter mentioned in the honourable senator&#39;s question, the Government takes a close interest in the achievements and activities of the Board. </para>

            <para>It is true that the Leader of the Opposition stated after his talks with Premier Chou En-lai that the Chinese Premier had said he would attend any reconvened Geneva Conference. I have not seen any Chinese Foreign Ministry transcript of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam&#39;s</inline> discussions, but subsequent Chinese statements made it clear that they did not see the question as one of convening a Geneva Conference. A Peking &#39;People&#39;s Daily&#39; editorial of 3rd August 1971 described a talk about a new Geneva conference as &#39;a sheer fraud which is ridiculous and absurd&#39;. </para>
