A month ago we were told that we could have no information in regard to the cost of the Patents-office and the salary of the Commissioner, because it would be forthcoming in the financial statement. So far as I cao sec, no provision is made in the Estimates for the Patents-office. It is very desirable before we proceed that we should have a statement from the Government as to its intentions with regard to the salary of the Commissioner and the maintenance or otherwise of the six establishments in the States. </para>

          <para>. - The subject-matter referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> does not come strictly under this clause, but I suppose that there will be no objection to my making a short statement. Some time ago I had a conference with my then colleague, the Minister for Trade and Customs, and though he found, as I did, that it would be impossible to say exactly what would be the cost of such a department as would be required, he considered that the salary which would have to be paid to a Commissioner would be from &#163;800 to &#163;1,000 per annum. He thought, and I entirely agree with him, that&#39; it would not bc advisable to fix the maximum at less than &#163;1,000, as it was very important to get a man of ability and experience, and, as compared with the salaries of persons who discharge similar duties, &#163;1,000 would not be excessive. If possible, however, a Commissioner would be obtained at a smaller salary. With regard to the Department, probably the salaries of the clerks would run into about &#163;1 ,500 per annum. There is no doubt that a great saving will be effected, because the intention is that when a central Patents-office is established by degrees the Departments of the Registrars-General in the States will be relieved of this work. So far from there being an increased cost to the people of the Commonwealth involved in the passage of the Bill, I think it will result in effecting a considerable saving. I have tried to get the information which is desired by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> but it has not yet come to hand. I shall hasten its production. </para>

        <para class="block">Of course, the idea in using the phrase &#34;actual inventor&#34; is that the inventor himself should receive all the benefit. But honorable senators will perceive that there may be instances in which an actual inventor may patent his invention in some other part of the world, and may owing to its character not think it worth his while to take out a patent in the Commonwealth. I think it should than be in the power of any citizen of the Commonwealth to take the position of the true and first inventor and introduce the invention to the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>- On clause 15 this question was raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston,</inline> and after discussion it was decided that the word &#34; actual&#34; should stand. The point at issue is very simple, namely, whether the granting of letters patentis to be a reward to the person to whose inventive genius the world is indebted for a new process or article. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> proposes is that we should not restrict that reward to the actual inventor, but should allow letters patent to issue to any man who is the introducer of tho invention. The term &#34;true and first inventor&#34; is perhaps a little misleading. The words &#34; true and first&#34; are used in the British statute, and they have been interpreted to include a person who is not an inventor, but the first introducer of an invention. Though in early times it might be considered a matter of almost equal merit to bring the invention of some one else into the country as to invent the article, yet, seeing that the means of communication are so much more easy and rapid than they were, the actual inventor is the person who should get the benefit. What we wish to do by the Bill is to stimulate the inventive genius of the people by giving a reward for an invention, and we do that best, I submit, by providing that the actual inventor shall get the benefit of the reward. There is less  reason now than there used to be for holding out a special inducement to a middleman. If the actual inventor does not desire to take out letters patent, why should not the invention be open to any one to use? The protection of the Patents law should be open to the actual inventor, and if he does not desire to take out letters patent the public should have the advantage of the free use of machine or process if it is available. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGREGOR</inline>(South Australia). - The position put by the Minister for Defence is correct as far as it goes, but there are inventions of a very simple character that may have been patented in other countries,and the actual inventors of which may be perfectly satisfied with their monopoly in those countries. There may be an invention of such a character that, if a monopoly were not granted, it would not be worth while for any man to make the article here. If an inventor is not willing to patent his invention in Australia, any one else should have the opportunity of doing so. </para>

            <para>- I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has overlooked the provision that the actual inventor of an article may obtain letters patent in conjunction with any person to whom he has assigned a part of his interest. There is nothing to prevent a man in Australia who knows of an invention in another country, and desires to introduce it, from getting letters patent if he does so with the permission of the actual inventor. But the operation of the amendment would be to oust the inventor in Australia. </para>

It will be seen that the &#34;assignee or nominee&#34; of the inventor are referred to. There seems to be no reason why, when an application may be made by the actual inventor or his assignee or nominee, if the actual inventor wishes to join with the assignee or nominee, those parties should be precluded. The amendment would only follow out the requirements of paragraph (b). </para>

There is nothing of the sort in this Bill. Perhaps the Minister will make a note of the point with a view to proposing an amendment. </para>

          <para>- I think that in Victoria last year, when the Patents Bill was being considered, Parliament struck out a provision to compel the examiner to inquire minutely into provisional patents. In the British Act of 1902 there was no provision for inquiring very closely into provisional specifications. When the complete specifications are introduced there is a thorough investigation by the examiner, but, otherwise, the specifications are referred to the clerks to see if they are entered correctly. I have no wish to press an amendment on the subject, having mentioned it to the Committee. </para>

            <para>- Clause 37 only deals with previous patents. There may be u question of novelty, as to which no question of. previous patents arises. The examiner under this clause will not be dealing with a provisional specification or application, but with the complete specification. If he reports satisfactorily on the three questions set out in the clause, the application will be granted. But the patentee will incur a certain amount of expense in completing his invention ; and when he goes to put it on the market he may find that it is not novel. The manufacturer to whom he goes may say - &#34; I have been using that article for years &#34; ; and all the inventor&#39;s expense will have been thrown away. If he had known - and the examiner could easily have informed him - he would not have gone to the expense of completing his invention and making the further application. Even with the limited amount of business done in the Patents-office in New South Wales, a permanent examiner has been found necessary, and I assume that we shall require a permanent officer for the Commonwealth. While the examiner is investigating the title and description of the invention, and deciding whether the application and specification are as described, he can very easily at the same time decide whether the invention is novel to the. best of his knowledge. If that were done, applicants would be saved unnecessary expense, and the registers would not be crowded with a lot of useless patents. </para>

          <para>- I can quite understand that if- the practice recommended by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> were adopted and could be fully carried out, as in Germany and the United States, it would be of immense advantage to a person desiring  to take out patent rights to have his application examined for novelty by the examiner. But that is supposing that the examination was of such a complete character, and was made by persons who had so complete a knowledge of the subject, that the decision as to novelty could be absolutely relied upon. So far as I . can gather from inquiries and reading on the. subject, if a decision did not come up to that standard it would be rather a pitfall a delusion and a snare to the applicant. The question for us to consider is whether we are prepared at the present stage to appoint examiners who will have such a complete knowledge of patents taken out throughout the world as to be able to pronounce on this question of novelty. If the decision of the examiner could not be absolutely relied upon, it would be better not to call on him to pronounce on the question of novelty at all. These considerations have operated with the&#34; Government in draftdrafting this Bill, and we came to the conclusion that it would be better at present to leave the question of novelty to be decided by the applicant himself. If his invention is not novel he runs the risk of it being attacked, and according to the provisions of the Bill, honorable senators will see that even if the examiner were charged with the duty of pronouncing on the question of novelty, the inventor would not be protected by that. </para>

            <para>- No ; it might be the means of running him into very considerable expense. If the applicant relies upon the examiner to tell him whether his  invention  has the merit of novelty, and he says - &#34; Yes, it is novel, go ahead,&#34; the applicant will go ahead upon the strength of that decision, and, later on, some one may oppose the grant of a patent to him on the ground that his invention is not novel. The patent will not be indefeasible, and the patentee will not be protected by the fact that the examiner has pronounced that the invention has the merit of novelty. The applicant may simply be misled by the report of the examiner on the question of novelty. </para>

            <para>- I am afraid that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator De</inline> Largie exaggerates the amount of omniscience which can be secured for a salary of &#163;1,000 a year, if- he supposes that we can for that salary secure an officer capable of acting as Commissioner and Examiner, and be able to pronounce on the question of novelty with regard to every application that may come before him. Supposing a man desires to take out a patent for some dyeing process. He probably has devoted the greater part of his lifetime to the business, and is a practical dyer. He hasread up the subject, and has all the information upon it that is available. We have a Commissioner of  Patents appointed at&#163; .1,000 a year, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator De</inline> Largie supposes that that individual should be a better judge than is this practical dyer whether the process which he desires to patent is or is not novel. At the same time this officer is expected to have the sameamount of practical knowledge with regard to every other invention which can be the subject of a patent. That is not reasonable. The applicant is asking for a patent in connexion with something with which he isparticularly intimate, and we may presume that he will have more knowledge upon that particular subject than would be possessed by any officer. Unless we had a very largestaff of examiners, having a knowledge, oneof one department of industry and one of another, so as to cover the whole field of scientific invention, it would be impossible for the Patents-office to undertake to pronounce with certainty whether any process for which an application was made for a patent, was novel. </para>

            <para>-  His  information cannot be compared with that of the applicant in nine cases out of ten. For instance,, we may have an application for an improvement upon a machine which the applicant has been working for years. I have in my mind at the present time the instance of a patent being applied for of immense value. It is not a very big affair, but it is of vast importance to the community. The man who is applying for this patent is a special expert in his particular line, and no examiner of patents could pretend to have the knowledge which he possesses of this particular machine. The applicant for a patent will be better informed in regard to its novelty, in 99 cases out of 100, than will be the Commissioner of Patents or the examiner. If he is not, the chances will be that he is a humbug. I think that to introduce the &#34; red tape. &#34; which would be introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> amendment would be a mistake, and would only lead to failure. </para>

I know a gentleman who has for the last 20 or 30 years, down on the lakes in South Australia, been trying to invent a flying machine. He is a South Australian native-born subject of  His  Majesty, and that ought to please SenatorFraser ; but he has never been to France, America, or to England.

            <para>- He would not be appointed unless he had a very extensive knowledge. I would ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> whether such an officer would not be likely to have information which would enable him to direct such an inventor as the man to whom I have referred, who has never been to other countries, and who has had no opportunity of reading about what has been done in other places. It is with a view to give assistance to inventors that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is trying to amend this Bill in the most liberal sense. The honorable senator has clearly pointed out that it is his intention that the examiner should certify whether an invention for which a patent is sought is of a novel character or not. If from his information the examiner tells the applicant that his invention is not novel, the inventor will know what he did not know before. There is no &#34; red-tape &#34; about that. It will probably save him a great amount of expense. Some of the most important inventions given to the world have been the outcome of the knowledge and experience of men who have travelled very little about the world, and have seldom been away from the places in which they lived. The examiner may do a great amount of service to these men, and it is for that purpose <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is trying to amend the clause. I hope it will be amended in the interests of the inventor. </para>

            <para>- I do not think it should. Where the examiner reports that an invention has the merit of novelty there is no liability assumed by the Patentsoffice. The liability of having to fight the patent later on still rests with the patentee. But the officials of the Patentsoffice will month by month be supplied with returns from the United States, Germany, and elsewhere of all patents issued, because these returns are exchanged between the various Patents-offices. No individual inventor will be supplied with that information, nor will he be able to get it in a library. The information can be got only from patent agents or from a patent office. When the Commissioner has information which will enable the question of novelty to be decided, why should he not use it ? If this is not done, the inventor will be forced to go to a patent agent, and to pay him a fee. What I propose will be in the interests of the public, because it will encourage inventions. I may tell honorable senators that my proposal is not a novel one, and I have no doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> helped to place a similar provision upon the Victorian statute-book. The returns from Patents-offices in various parts of the world will be filed month by month in the Commonwealth Patents-office, and the Commissioner will have access to them. Should not an individual patentee in the centre of Australia, or in the back-blocks of Western Australia or of Queensland, be able to get this information ? </para>

          <para>- I can throw some light on this proposal, because I have recently had occasion to look into the question of patents. What the Minister for Defence has said is absolutely accurate. The result of the so-called guarantee in Germany and America is most misleading. They do not guarantee novelty, and the result is that the inventor, who is not always a very business-like man, has been known to take cases into court which were absolutely indefensible. I was informed that there had been more cases opposed in America than in anyother country. I got my information at first hand in connexion with a patent in which I am interested. We were anxious to know what steps&#39; we could take to make ourselves as secure as possible, and what was the relative value of each patent. When I laid stress on the fact that there was a guarantee as to novelty in America and Germany, my agent assured me that I ought not to rely on that. </para>

          <para>- It goes without saying that every facility should be granted to an inventor to get a <inline font-style="italic">bon&#226; fide</inline> hearing of his application for a patent. On the other hand, I contend that when an inventor goes before a court to obtain a concession which gives a monopoly to him and to the prejudice of the public,he should state his case clearly and emphatically. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> had had as much experience of inventors as I have had, if he had known how they worry a man, hewould have taken with a grain of salt many of the statements which evidently have been made to him. Without doubt a patent for a meritorious invention is of great advantage to the public ; otherwise it is a great nuisance to the public, because it prevents inquiry in a direction in which it would otherwise take place. I shall give an instance of the way in which a patent acts most prejudicially to the public. In Victoria and New South &#34;Wales there is a patent for incandescent mantles. A company was formed in the United Kingdom to take out patent rights for incandescent mantles. They omitted to do so in Western Australia, and the consequence is that the article can be purchased in that State for about a fourth of what it costs in Victoria. It- will be seen at once that great care should be exercised before a monopoly  is granted to any one. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> asks that the Government shallconstitute a court, and that the efforts &#62;of its highly-paid officers shall be solely directed to protecting the inventor as against the public. </para>

Otherwise, all that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> has said would be quite true. Because the examiner had said that the invention was novel, the inventor would go away and labour to place his invention on the market, only to discover that he had been deceived by the statement and put to great expense. I cannot find the passage on the subject which I read a short time ago, but, if my memory serves me aright, it was very clearly stated that although in America the officials tell an inventor whether his invention is novel or not, yet, proportionately, a far greater, number of patents are upset in that country than in Great Britain, where such information is not given. I would ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to consider of what value this information would be to an inventor, unless the examiner were in some way made responsible for its accuracy.

            <para>- Both practices have been tried. One practice has been tried in one country, and another practice in another country. The English Committee, I understand, has come to the conclusion not to . require the examiner to pronounce as to novelty, and the Conference which sat in Melbourne indorsed that view. It should be clearly understood by honorable senators that at the present time the examiner reports as to whether an invention has been registered elsewhere. That is made part of the examiner&#39;s duty under clause 37, but what Senate Pearce asks is that there shall be an officer who shall have such a complete knowledge of every subject under the sun that he shall be able to say absolutely whether an application for a new process or a machine has the merit of novelty. Take the case of a flying machine. The inventor has probably studied the particulars of every flying machine ever invented in order to engraft on the old inventions a screw or a valve which will make the article work better. The essence of his invention is that it is novel. He is the only man in the community who is supposed to know whether it is a novelty. Surely it is not to be expected that this inventor, with a lifelong experience about flying machines, is to go to the examiner and say - &#34;I claim that it is a novelty, but I wish you to tell rae whether it is <inline font-style="italic">1 &#34;</inline> What advantage could it be for the inventor  to .get the word of an examiner which would not indemnify him in any way <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> What would be the use of getting an assurance that it was a novelty when immediately he had obtained his patent he might be assailed by another person on the ground of want of novelty <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> I quite understand the object which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has in view, but I submit that the provision would be more likely to deceive and mislead an inventor than to help him. </para>

            <para>- Suppose it was a flying machine or other machine, the examiner is charged by the clause with the responsibility of ascertaining certain things. I have in my mind an instance which occurred, not in connexion with a patent, but in connexion with a trade design. An Australian inventor endeavoured to get the benefit of a trade design in connexion with something which he had been using very freely in these States. When he endeavoured to register the trade design he found that there were some people at the other end of the world who had something similar which they had patented, or in respect to which they had obtained a trade mark or design. It was impossible for him, with his limited funds, to fight these people, and so they were able to come into the various States and get the benefit of a monopoly, although the article which they put on the market was not a novelty at all. If there had been an examiner, who could have ascertained whether it was a novelty, or whether it had been used by the public, with or without the consent of the original inventor, the difficulties in that case would have been overcome. I should agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> even if he omitted the words &#34; with the consent or allowance of the inventor.&#34; If the article has been in the possession of the public in Australia, and if the inventive genius of a person in Australia has produced that result contemporaneously with some person elsewhere, that is no reason why the latter should be able to come in and get a monopoly of the  sale of the article. If the examiner is simply to ascertain thethree matters referred to in paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">(a),, (b),</inline> and (c), his duties will be very few indeed. </para>

            <para>- Even if he had only to inquire into the matters referred to in clauses 35, 36, and 37, the examiner would only be making formal inquiries. As a matter of convenience and justice to persons who might have cause to assign why patents should not be granted to applicants, the examiner should be vested with the function of determining whether or not a particular device or machine in respect of which an application for a patent is made has been previously in use by thepublic in Australia. If people have been using the article in Australia, and no one makes application for a patent in respect of it, those persons who are desirous of opposing the patent may state that it is not novel, and has been used previously; and if they can satisfy the examiner to that effect he should be allowed to inquire, and report whether the article is novel or not. I am simply endeavouring to show that the examiner should be able to ascertain whether the inventor has not only complied with the formal requisites laid down in the Bill to entitle him to get a patent, but that he should also be vested with the function of determining whether the inventor has complied with the material requisites, and should be able to report whether the article has been used in Australia, and whether it is novel or otherwise. There is a provision of this character in the Victorian legislation. </para>

        <para>The United States Patent-office endeavours to assist on absolute novelty, as the basis of a grant, and searches the records not only of its own patent office but also those of other countries, whereas hitherto the British Patent-office has done little more than register any application for a patent that was not absolutely identical with one already granted, the question of infringement, novelty, and validity being left to the courts of law. Each system has its merits and defects, its admirers and opponents. My personal experience leads me to prefer the American system, on the ground that though it is more difficult and expensive to obtain a patent than under the English system, and thougha really good invention is sometimes rejected, yet a patent, when obtained, is infinitely more likely to be of value. </para>

            <para>- Until a case is determined in a court of law, no one may be able to tell whether a patent is novel within the meaning of the statute. A case in which I was professionally interested comes to my recollection. It concerned a particular sheep-shearing machine. A question of novelty arose. How was the case decided? We had to get all the differentshearing machines, have them taken to pieces, and examined to see whether the particular patented machine in question was novel or otherwise. If the decision of the examiner is to be of any use, he must, when a patent is asked for, get all this evidence himself, and decide whether an article is novel or not. In fact, the Commissioner will have to make himself responsible for deciding what ought to be decided by a court of law . if a patent were granted, and the grant was afterwards challenged. I think that some honorable senators are mixing up with this question the matter of prior registration, which is dealt with in clause 37. The question of novelty must be decided by a comparison between the article for which a patent has been obtained, and all other articles of a similar character for which patentsare in existence. Thatis a matterupon which the examiner should not be asked to give judgment. I admit that in the United States, where there has been a Patentsoffice for 100 years, with a museum attached, and where there is an enormous staff of experts, the opinion of those experts may be of some value. But it does not follow that because that is the American law now it is the law the Americans would adopt if they were starting afresh. The English committee has reported against it. </para>

It relates to the system ofcyaniding known as the ForrestMcArthur process. The process was being practised throughout Australia, and was well-known in the United States, before it was patented by the Forrest-McArthur Company. But that company obtained a patent in Western Australia, and thereupon they proceeded by a system of what was nothing but blackmailing to levy charges upon unfortunate prospectors and mining companies. </para>

            <para>- It appears to me that that is an illustration of the need for the Patents-office being compelled to give an opinion on the question of novelty.

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MATHESON</inline>(Western Australia). - I. should like to explain what happened in connexion with the cyaniding process to which reference has been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> The Western Australia law is that if a patent is taken out in England a patent in Western Australia necessarily follows if the parties interested choose to apply for it and perform certain prescribed requirements. The McArthur-Forrest people secured their patent in England, and in due course secured it also in Western Australia. The patent was at a later date attacked in England, and formed a subject of several decisions, which were eventually carried to the Court of Appeal. The result was that the McArthur-Forrest Company won, presumably on the ground that their process was a novelty. Therefore it was impossible to upset their patent rights in Western Australia. Whether the process was novel or not is a point upon which I cannot express any opinion. But I presume that the principle upon which they relied was that their diluted solution was a novelty as compared with the strong solution which had previously been used. It appears to me, however, that the argument based on that case does not help <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> in the slightest degree. In the matter of trade-marks, novelty is, I should say, a question of fact. One looks at a trademark and sees whether it infringes upon some other trade-mark. It is not an argumentative question, if one can produce another trade-mark which shows that the design has previously been registered. But, in the case of a patent, the question of novelty is not easily determined. One reads the specification, but it becomes a matter of argument as to whether it infringes upon  the ideas contained in other specifications. The specification may deal with a combination of metals or of chemicals, and. a number of things which give rise te argument. It is absolutely impossible for aregistrar to give a binding opinion. The question must go to a court in case of dispute. </para>

Suppose that a man wishes to put his land, under the Real Property Act by means of a transfer. He holds a title under what isknown as the old law - that is to say, hehas deeds coining down to him from a. former possessor of the property. He goes. to the Titles-office to obtain a new title. He puts in his old title, and the Examiner of Titles calls upon the neighbours to show cause why a new title should not be granted. The onus of proof is upon the applicant. We will say that the applicant applies for a right-of-way ina particular direction affecting the land in question. The Examiner says - &#34; Show your title, and the reasons why you want this application to be granted.&#34; The Examiner does not go round to assist the applicant arid enable him to prove his claim against his neighbours. The neighbours in the case of a patent are the public. We have to do justice to the public. A patentee should have his rights, but nothing more. Therefore, the Minister for Defence - who, by the way, I congratulate upon his new office - is bound in the interests of the public to oppose this amendment, and to throw upon the inventor the onus of proof that he has a right to what he applies for. </para>

        <para class="block">During the debate on the second reading of the Bill I intimated my intention to move in Committee to prevent the patenting of inventions in Australia which have previously been patented in the United Kingdom or in any foreign country. I propose to test the principle on this amendment. I think that the examiner should be required to say whether an application deals with an invention already patented, not only in the Commonwealth or in any State, but also in the United Kingdom, or in any foreign country, with the object of moving later on that, where an invention has been patented in the United Kingdom, or in any foreign country, no patent for that invention shall be issued in the Commonwealth. If the amendment is not accepted, I shall not move the the further amendments necessary to give effect to it. I gave my reasons for what I propose on thesecond reading. I do not believe in granting patents to inventors outside Australia. This is a Bill to encourage the patenting of inventions in Australia, and it is not a Bill to give monopolies to persons who have patented inventions outside Australia. </para>

            <para>- I admit that they could, or by patenting them here first. Honorable senators are aware that many articles have been patented outside of Australia for many years, and when a demand for them springs up in Australia the patentee at once patents his invention in Australia, and heis then given a monopoly for Australia. He continues to manufacture the patented article in the country in which he has established his works, and Australian manufacturers are prevented from making it, with the result that he fixes the price as high as he pleases. </para>

            <para>- It was. But the reason for the high price charged for the implement was that the local manufacturers could not make it without paying the royalty fixed by the American inventor and manufacturer. My amendment is intended to prevent that. Its effect in this particular instance would be that the local manufacturers would be able to manufacture the implement, and then the American inventor and manufacturer would require to enter upon a fair competition with them by bringing down his price until he beat them out of the market, or was beaten out himself. The object of this Bill is to encourage inventions amongst our own people, and we do not encourage inventions amongst our own people by giving a monopoly to foreign inventors and manufacturers. When our manufacturers are prevented from manufacturing these patented articles it is very improbable that they will ever invent any improvement upon them. Honorable senators know that when the patent rights for a particular article run out, and manufacturers generally begin its manufacture, they very speedily discover considerable improvements upon the original patent. Honorable senators will remember the instance of the reaping machine, invented in South Australia in the seventies. When that machine was being made by manufacturers on royalty, one of them invented a damp weather attachment. The machine, manufactured under the original patent, could only be worked in dry weather ; but as soon as manufacturers began to make the machine, a man who was not the original inventor, invented an attachment by which it could be worked in damp weather. </para>

Its object is to encourage inventions in Australia. By giving the American inventor the monopoly of the Australian market, we do not encourage the Australian inventor. As I have said, I propose to test the principle by the amendment in this clause. If my amendment is carried, we shall underthis clause get the information whether a patent applied for has been patented in the Commonwealth, in any State, in the United Kingdom, or in any foreign country, and where it is shown that a patent has previously been patented in the United Kingdom or in any foreign country, I intend to propose that no patent shall issue in the Commonwealth. </para>

          <para>- Whilst I am willing to assist <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to liberalize this Patents Bill, I cannot go so far as the honorable senator proposes on this occasion. I am afraid that instead of liberalizing the measure the honorable senator is here taking an opposite course. It is quite true, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> says, that the object of the Bill is to encourage inventions within the Commonwealth. We may, later on, have jurisdiction outside the Commonwealth, and may be able to legislate for the whole of the civilized world, but whilst we are making a law for the Commonwealth at present, it must be borne in mind that its effects may be felt beyond the Commonwealth. It is certain that if we take this unfair advantage of foreign inventors they will quickly get level with us by playing off the same game. If we do not agree to reciprocity in the treatment of inventors of other countries, we cannot expect our inventors to be given the benefit of the Patents laws of other countries. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> proposal would ultimately lead to other countries taking the unfair advantage of our inventors which he is proposing under his amendment to take of the inventors in the whole of the rest of the world. This proposal is in opposition to the whole spirit of Patents laws the whole world over, and I hope it will not be supported. It is strange that a free-trader should make a proposal of this kind. I agree that we should encourage our own inventors, and we shall best do that by recognising the rights of inventors in other countries. To shut our eyes to their rights will be to induce other countries to shut out the work of our own inventors. </para>

          <para>- It will be conceded by any person who has studied this matter, that the great advantage to a patentee is to secure the markets of the world and not merely the market of Australia. We are here so limited a community, that for a valuable invention there may be only a limited demand in Australia. I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> of a notable instance of this. Some time ago an invention known as the Brennan torpedo was launched in Victoria. This proved to be such a valuable weapon that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brennan</inline> having previously registered his invention in the old country, went to England, the Admiralty bought his invention from him at a very large price, and it has now become one of the recognised weapons of defence all over the world. Brennan was an Australian and a Victorian, and he went Home to obtain the larger market which was open to him by the reciprocity existing between the Colonial and English Patents laws. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator De</inline> Largie&#39;s argument is unanswerable, and if we desire justice we must act justly. If we shut out the inventions of people in other parts of the world, we shall suffer by it. If an invention is discovered here which is worthy of consideration, it will be worth a great deal more if it can be launched upon the larger markets of the world, as may be done  under the existing Patents laws. &#39; </para>

          <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has told us candidly enough that he desires by this amendment that we should refuse to give patent rights to any one who has patented his invention in the United Kingdom, or in any foreign country. I think that is very inadvisable. It is the invention that we want, and we need not care who the inventor is. What does it matter whether the inventor is a foreigner, a Briton, or an Australian, if we get the benefit of his invention ? The object of a Patents law is to encourage men to invent, and to give to the world the benefit of their inventions. We have a -clause in the Bill further on, providing that if a particular invention is patented here, it shall be manufactured here. That seems to be a very great advantage. I cannot see how it matters in the slightest degree whether an invention has been patented in a foreign country or not if we get the benefit of it in Australia. If a Frenchman invents something and patents- it in France, why should he not be allowed to patent his invention here and manufacture it here ? </para>

I confess I am very sorry to have heard the speech made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> I have looked upon the honorable senator as being always desirous of doing what is fair and square to the world at large ; but his speech this afternoon does not support that view of the honorable senator. I cannot see how the course proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> would be likely to advantage Australia. It holds out an open inducement to other countries to pass retaliatory legislation, which might have a very prejudicial effect on Australian inventors. An Australian inventor has a very small local market, and it is to the world that he must look for his large profits. We ought not, in a matter of patents legislation, to do anything to offend other countries. I do not see any occasion to debate the matter at length, and I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> will withdraw his amendment, and re-establish  himself as soon as he can in our good graces. </para>

            <para>- I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Puls-  ford to look at clause 83 and see whether the amendment I now&#34; propose is not much to be preferred. That clause provides that the manufacture of any patented article shall after a period of five years be carried on within the Commonwealth ; so that the Government already recognise the principle which I am now advocating, only they propose to attain the same end in another way. Mining plant is manufactured more cheaply in America than in any other country, because there the inventor has a large mining population to cater for, and can also supply similar mining communities all over the world. Are we to ask an American inventor to erect a factory and provide expensive machinery in Australia, merely in order to turn out one or two articles in the course of a year? Is clause 83 not as much a breach of international law, and as likely to bring about reprisals, as my proposal ? I am surprised that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> who has always posed as a free-trader, should practically commit himself to this Bill, which contains the most drastic protectionist proposals. </para>

        <para>SenatorFRASER. - For one patent in Australia there are a thousand in other countries. As to the reaper and binder, if manufacturers could go in defiance of the Patents laws of the world, no doubt that machine could be manufactured here at a lower price than that at which it is now sold ; but that advantage would be obtained at the expense of the violation of an honest principle. </para>

The fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> now intends to take the amendment to a vote shows how earnestly he regards the matter ; and the only explanation I can suggest of his present attitude is that he is a descendant of Cornish people who, in the olden days, were great free-traders and freebooters on their coasts. No doubt it is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> nationality which is coming to the front in spite of himself ; and if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston</inline> is also trueto the principles of his forefathers he doubtless will support the amendment.

But if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is a free-trader, he is a free-trader gone mad on protection. The proposal of the Government is protective, and declares that if a patent be granted in another part of the world, and also in Australia, the article patented must within a certain time be manufactured here. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> would not allow such inventors any time at all ; but, as a fact, he would steal the whole of the inventions of the world for the benefit, as he thinks, of Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> would protect Australian industry to an outrageous extent. Under the circumstances the most we can say to an inventor is, that if he wishes his patent to berespectedin Australia, the article patented must, within a given time, be manufactured here. There is no doubt, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> said, that we in Australia would be the gainers under the amendment, because for one invention in Australia there are thousands elsewhere.

            <para>- I do not wish to say that, because we are descended from the same stock. The inventions introduced in the colonies hitherto have been mostly such as could not very well be applied in other parts of the world. I knew <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ridley</inline> very well, and his stripper was a very valuable machine. At one time reaping used to be done with a sickle, and it cost from 16s. to &#163;1 to reap an acre of wheat - a charge that it would be impossible to pay atthe present price of wheat. But the conditions have altered immensely, and a man with amachine and four horses can now reap and thresh ten acres in a day. The stripper is used in all parts of the Commonwealth where the conditions are favorable, but where the climate is damp the reaper and binder is found to be more profitable. Another invention which emanated from the model State of South Australia is the stumpjump plough, which is very useful in certain portions of that State, and also in Victoria and New South Wales ; but, although I have travelled in Canada and other countries,I do not know of any conditions elsewhere which would make its use desirable. I do not think the stump-jump plough would be of much use where red wood and in some instances pines have been cut down in the forests of Canada. Under the circumstances, I think the amendment ought to be withdrawn. </para>

            <para>- I hesitate to take that course, because it is a tremendous power to place in the hands of the examiner. I think we shall find presently the bad effects of the amendment which has been carried. What is to happen if the examiner reports that an invention is not novel? Is the application to be absolutely rejected? The question whether an invention is novel or not is decided very often after a long action at law. Yet it is proposed that an officer who probably will be over-worked, from what we have heard, shall have the power to say, &#34; No ; this invention wants novelty, and the application is thrown out.&#34; The applicant may have spent years in bringing his invention to maturity, and yet it is to be knocked out on the <inline font-style="italic">ipse dixit</inline> of the examiner. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PEARCE</inline>(Western Australia). - I hope that the Minister for Defence is not seeking to re-open the question as to novelty which was decided this afternoon. If the examiner reports that the invention is not novel the Commissioner hears the application, and if he refuses to register, that is not final. If the applicant is not satisfied with the decision of the Commissioner he can appeal, under clause 39, to the law officer. The question is not decided on the <inline font-style="italic">ipse dixit</inline> of the examiner. Where is the hardship which has been depicted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake?</inline> I think that every facility is granted, and I intend to press my amendment, because it seems to me that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> is seeking, by a side wind, to defeat the decision of the Committee on clause 35. He proposes to make this provision in clause 43, but that deals with the question whether a patent has been issued. The Committee has decided that the question of novelty shall be one of the determining causes. </para>

          <para>- It seems to me that the remedy which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> proposes would be worse than the disease. What inventor is able to go from stage to stage to fight the question in the courts ? It is quite enough for an inventor to have to appear in one court, because it is usually the man with the longest purse who wins. I have always understood that a patent is granted for an article because it is a novelty. If the examiner reports that an invention is a novelty, and it is not, the common law will prevail. No matter what rights may be conferred by this Bill a man can appeal to a court and it can upset a patent which has been improperly granted on the ground of novelty. </para>

Underclause 41, if the examiner reports adversely, the applicant is to be informed thereof, and may, within such time as may be prescribed, amend the specification. Thereupon the amended specification would be again reported on by the examiner under clause 37.

          <para>- There seems to me to be nothing in the contention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston.</inline> The course of a person who has made an invention is eminently clear. He makes his application, which is sent to the examiner, who reports. That report may be adverse in a variety of ways. The Commissioner, having looked into the subject decides, and he will ask the inventor to alter his specification in a certain direction. If the Commissioner refuses the application, the applicant appeals to the law officer. The law officer then goes into the matter and hears the applicant and the Commissioner. Of course, when that is done, the Commissioner will give the reasons why he has refused the application, and will very likely say that that refusal emanated practically from the examiner, whose report was. adverse. At all events, the Commissioner will certainly have to state the grounds on. which he has refused the application. This clause simply says that, in case matters go into Court, the examiner&#39;s report is not to be published undercertain circumstances. Under other circumstances it may be published. Where is the conflict?I cannot see the slightest difficulty. The whole tiring is as plain as possible. It is perfectly right. We should give the Court power to say - they having seen the report - whether it shall be published. It may be desirable to keep it secret. It may be injurious to the inventor himself to have the information published. Therefore, the power given by this clause is a proper one to exercise. </para>

            <para>- That clause simply provides that, if the examinier reports adversely, &#34; the applicant shall be informedthereof and may amend the specification.&#34; He may alter it again, and it may still be thrown out, and he is not to be told why it is thrown out. He is not placed in such a position as to bring up an amended specification which may be accepted. I am asking not that the report  should be made known to the public, but that the applicant should be informed in what respect his application does not fulfil the requirements of the Commissioner. </para>

            <para>- As clause 4 stands at present the&#34; Supreme Court &#34; means the Supreme Court of the State in which the Patents-office is situated or a Judge thereof. I can quite understand that it might be advisable from many points of view to substitute the High Court for the Supreme Court. But, under the Judiciary Bill, as amended, the High Court will have enough work to do, and I think now it would be better to leave clause 4 as it at present stands. The subject is one which, has been under my notice before, and though my inclination was rather in the direction of having this work done by the High Court, I think that in view of the way in which the Judiciary Bill has been passed it is better that it should be left to the Supreme Court. </para>

            <para>- I find that the law which came into force in Great Britain on the 1st January, 1903, made the period 50 years. If 50 years is considered a sufficiently long period in Great Britain, there is no reason why we should not adopt that period here. </para>

          <para>- I do not see why there should be any time fixed at all. To my mind, it does not matter whether it is 50 years, 100 years, or 1 year. If the invention is not an original invention I do not see why we should not all have the advantage of it. There is no novelty in a thing which has been known for 100 years, and 1 think the term should be struck out. </para>

          <para>- It would appear from information placed at my disposal that this is a very dangerous clause. It is one which may give a great deal of trouble and work much injustice. A man completes an invention, and he applies for protection. He inserts in his specification that which he knows is really the discovery of others. He &#34; tries it on&#34; so to speak. He says - &#34; I will put it in, and I shall have protection unless some one fights me, and contends that it is not novel.&#34; The real inventor of what the applicant has made use of will know that he would have to go to the court to prove that the specification is not novel, and to avoid that expense, he may have to pay for the use of what is really his own discovery. But if the court be appealed to then the whole specification may be amended. The court may say that some of the items are admittedly not new, and then the defendant will not really lose much if he can show that one item in his specification is novel. The decision will be in his favour on that one item, and in all probability costs will be given as against the plaintiff. In my opinion the clause would give encouragement to a person to pirate a patent which belonged to another, and the real inventor might, perhaps, prefer to be. penalized and pay a royalty to the patentee rather than go to the expense of an appeal to the court. </para>

          <para>- The questions to be decided by the Supreme Court are entirely different from those which originally come before the Commissioner. All questions relating to novelty, prior registration, and so forth are decided by the Commissioner, who has to satisfy himself that the subject is one for letters patent. A patent is granted by the Commissioner for fourteen years ; and all those questions are then settled, unless there be a petition in opposition. But at the expiration of fourteen years a man comes to ask for an extension of his patent. Different grounds have to be examined before itcan be ascertained whether it is right in the interests of the community that he should get an extension of the patent. The questions which have to be taken into consideration then are the nature and merit of the invention in relation to the public, the profits made by the patentee, and all the circumstances of the case. It is all in the hands of the Court. If it considers that he has not been sufficiently remunerated during the period of fourteen years, it may grant an extension of the patent. </para>

            <para>- Most assuredly I do. The Commissioner is a specialist to deal with the question whether patent rights ought to be granted, and if he is of that opinion, the law says that he may grant them for fourteen years. If at the end of that period the patentee asks for an extension of seven or fourteen years, the Court has to decide these questions on evidence.I think that the highest tribunal which is recognised in the Bill should be invoked before patent rights are extended for any long period. </para>

          <para>- There are additional reasons to those mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> why the Supreme Court should be left to deal with this matter. In hearing a petition for the renewal of a patent, the Court should take into consideration the rights of the original patentee, or of his heirs and assigns, if it has been sold. In some cases the Court hasordered that the petitioner should give further consideration to the inventor. Ittakes every phase of the invention into account. It investigates whether the original patentee has received sufficient remuneration, quite apart from the person who may have purchased the patent from him and may be working it. Where it is perfectly clear that the purchaser may have had very good returns, and the original patentee very poor returns, the Court, on petition by the latter, has been known to put in special clauses requiring the former to give further consideration to him. It is quite clear that no Commissioner could go into all these questions, and settle the rights of the several petitioners. Therefore, it is absolutely essentia&#93; that the Supreme Court should be allowed to deal with the renewal of patents. </para>

            <para>- I think I shall be able to show <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> that there are strong objections to his amendment. He is looking at the matter entirely from the point of view of the patentee, who desires a renewal or an extension of his patent. But, how about all those persons who may wish to oppose his application ? Are they to be dragged to the State in which he is located ? By this Bill we establish a central Patentsoffice, and in the State where it is situated we say that such an application shall be made. The object of the proceeding in the Court is to enable any person to test the right of the patentee to get a renewal or an extension. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> will refer to the latter part of the clause, he will see the grounds on which alone a patent may be extended, and evidence has to be taken on those points. It might be most inconvenient to those who desired to call evidence against an extension, if they had to resort to , the State which had been chosen by the patentee. </para>

            <para>- It would be against the the interests of the individual, but it might be very much in favour of the interests of the public to revoke the patent. If the revocation of a patent can be obtained by going to the Supreme Court of a State, why cannot an extension of a patent be obtained in the same way ? Considering that the control of patents is transferred to the Commonwealth by the Bill, I should have thought that the second sub-clause referred to the Supreme Court of a State in its Federal jurisdiction. I think that we shall have to consider this question more fully on some other occasion. </para>

          <para>- This is said to be a copy of the corresponding provision in the Imperial Act. It has been pronounced by some experts as very absurd in some respects, and it has been suggested to me that the second sub-clause should be amended by the addition of the words &#34; bearing the date of the patent so revoked.&#34; Suppose that a man came forward and proved that he and not the holder of the patent rights was the actual inventor of the article ; then the patent could be revoked and granted to the petitioner. But if he applied for the patent merely from the time it was revoked, then it would not be in accordance with the Bill, which says it must be granted for an article which is new and has not previously been reported upon. Therefore, I should like to have the opinion of honorable senators on the point as to whether it would not be wise to insert the words &#34; bearing the date of the patent so revoked.&#34; We want to have placed upon the document that revokes the patent the date when the patent was originally granted, so that any one picking up the document would know that the patent had been revoked, and how far he could go in making an application for renewal. </para>

          <para>- This clause is very important, and cannot be said to reflect much lustre upon the author of the Bill. Last session we passed a Customs Act under which the importation of certain goods into Australia was prohibited. The prohibition of imports was confined to such goods as any pirated work, false money, anything blasphemous, indecent, or obscene, goods manufactured or produced by prison labour, exhausted tea, oleomargerine unless branded as prescribed, all goods which carried a false suggestion of any warranty or guarantee, and so on. So that nothing is prohibited to be imported except certain goods which were considered to be objectionable or deleterious for various reasons. But theclausenow before us asks us to prohibit the importation of goods which may be very desirable, and in industries absolutely necessary. The clause is simply monstrous, apart from the fact that it conflicts with the Customs Act. If goods can be imported under that Act I do not see how the authorities could take upon themselves to reject an entry of goods described under clause. 83 of this Bill. </para>

            <para>- The clause says - &#34; import ... or cause to be imported.&#34; It is intended to stop the importation of any invention four years after a patent has been taken out. There are some inventions for which the demand in Australia would be so small that it would be almost impossible to produce them profitably here. For instance, there are linotypes. The number of those machines which can be used in Australia is so limited that it would not be worth while to put up an expensive plant for the manufacture of them. But linotypes are considered to be very necessary. They have effected a great revolution in printing, giving us a very much larger amount of reading matter in our newspapers. In many respects they have been a distinct advantage to Australia. But under this clause we should be unable to take advantage of such an invention after so many years had lapsed, because the manufacture of it would be unprofitable in Australia owing to the small demand. I suppose a way would be found to make the clause workable, though it seems to me to be in conflict with the Tariff, inasmuch as a certain duty is imposed upon certain goods, or it is specifically provided that they shall be imported free. The importation of them cannot be stopped under the Tariff. But it is not worth while to discuss the clause from that point of view. I am discussing it on its merits. On its merits it is a very objectionable clause, even from the point of view of those who, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> are moderate protectionists. I cannot imagine that even extreme protectionists would ask us to go to the length of prohibiting the importation of an article. </para>

            <para>- Compulsory licenses are another way of insuring that the patentee having secured a patent shall not sit down and derive profit from machines that are manufactured outside the Commonwealth. But clause S3 is a very good provision to have first. If clause 83 does not work satisfactorily, clause 85 comes in. It provides that if a man secures patent rights in Australia he shall not use them to prevent any one else making an article or refuse to import the article himself. We should have a right to insist that patentees shall manufacture in Australia. Otherwise the patentee gets all the advantage, and the Commonwealth gets none. </para>

We have in view foreign inventors, who take out their patents in foreign countries, and who would, no doubt, be glad to hold the market here by getting patent rights in Australia, while they supplied our market with articles produced abroad. We say that it is better for the community that these articles should be madehere, and if we give patent rights which enable the holders of them to secure a monopoly which gives them profit, they should manufacture them here, and should not import them from abroad. </para>

          <para>- I cannot support clauses 83 and 84, but I am prepared to support clause 85. I suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> might move the omission of paragraphs (a) and (b) of clause 83, allowing the first words of the clause to stand to cover clause 85. The proposal for a compulsory licence being issued is a perfectly reasonable one, but it is absurd to say that within five years of a patent being granted the manufacture of the article must be commenced in Australia, and must be continuously carried on. Suppose that is applied to a case of articles for which there is not a sufficient demand. There would not be a sufficient demand, for instance, for linotypes in Australia to keep one factory going, and when the complicated machinery ^required to make them is taken into account, it will be seen that if they were manufactured in Australia the price would be immensely  above present prices. In the case of reapers and binders, to which I referred in connexion with another clause, the compulsory licence proposed would act well. The farmers of Victoria and South Australia could petition the Attorney-General to compel the firm holding the patent rights to issue compulsory licences, and then the Braybrook Company or any other manufacturing company in Australia could manufacture those machines. It must be remembered that the royalty would not be at the sweet will of the patentee, but would be fixed by the Court. It would not be a reasonable thing to compel the manufacturers of these implements to establish works in Australia. They have a big factory in Canada, and by specializing this manufacture they can produce these implements very cheaply. Every honorable senator who has any acquaintance with factories, will realize that they could not make them so cheaply in half-a-dozen small factories scattered over different parts of the world. The cost of making them in Australia . would probably be much greater than the cost of making them in Canada with the freight to Australia added. If it could be Shown that by some combination, or by the operation of their patent monopoly, the manufacturers charged a price which was found to be injurious to our producers, we should have power .to step in and compel them /to give a licence to our- manufacturers to manufacture these implements ; but -we should be satisfied with that power. I have referred to two machines specially, but many more could be enumerated if we had time to look into the matter. If this clause is passed the Bill might be called &#34; a Bill to fetter the Australian manufacturer in his competition with outside manufacturers.&#34; Honorable senators will recognise the complicated patented machinery which is used in our woollen mills. I suppose that one factory in England would turn out annually a sufficient quantity of that machinery to equip three times the number of woollen mills we have in Australia. And yet, because woollen mills at Geelong or Ballarat require a few machines to enable them to increase their output, it is proposed, under this clause, that they should not be able to get those machines unless the patentee commences their manufacture in Australia.. The proposal is too ridiculous, and it is a strange proposal to be submitted by a Government that professes to assist local manufacturers to compete with those of other countries. We should give outmanufacturers absolute freedom to secure the most up-to-date machinery. Our factories will at the outset be small, and there will not be a sufficient demand for patented machinery to warrant its manufacture in the Commonwealth. If there is a sufficient demand for any particular machine, the  compulsory  licence provision will do all that is necessary. Without the compulsory licence provision there might be some reason in the other proposal ; but with that provision there can be no -possible argument for this prohibition clause. Take the mining industry again. We know that the treatment of gold ores has been revolutionized within the &#39;last few years. We know that if in the mining development of Western Australia we had been compelled to look to the Commonwealth only for the machinery we required, our gold output would have been seriously lessened. The mine-owners , in Western Australia, owing to the fact that we have had low duties upon machinery, and that we have not &#34;had this prohibition provision in our Patents law, have been enabled to go into every country in the world to secure the most up-to-date machinery. There is an ore found at Kalgoorlie known as tel.luride which requires special treatment.  It had  not previously been found on Australian gold-fields, but it was known in America, where they had special machinery for treating it. Under this Bill the inventors of this machinery would have to commence the manufacture of it in Australia before those interested in mining could secure the use of it. I hope the Committee will not contemplate the passing of ti clause which would fetter manufacturers by preventing them from securing the benefit of patented machinery, and which would also fetter the agricultural and producing industries generally.  Weknow  that  the latest  inventions for carrying on the agricultural industry have not come from Australia, but from America. They have revolutionized the industry, and yet it is here proposed that their manufacture shall be commenced in Australia before our producers can secure the benefit of their use. As has already been pointed out, the reaper and binder was patented in. America, and subsequently in Australia. As a consequence, the inventor and manufacturer was enabled to secure a monopoly of the Australian market for the implement. If we had had this compulsory licence provision in operation we could have broken down that monopoly ; but no one can argue that clause 83 is necessary to enable ais to break down a monopoly of that kind. We have that power under clauses 85 and 86, and I guarantee that if our farmers do not take advantage of those provisions our manufacturers will, if there is at any time a disposition shown to unduly raise the price of patented machinery. </para>

If we take the case of woollen mill machinery, the inventor gets patent rights here, and for four years he can import the machinery.

For fouryears he may import the reapers and binders, but after that period they must be manufactured here. If the patentee does not manufacture the articles here, then he isrefused the right to a monopoly of his invention. </para>

            <para>- If there had been such a clause in operation, how different the circumstances would have been in regard to reapers and binders. These machineswere patented here for the express purpose of holding the market, and causing them to be imported at prices fixed by the manufacturers and importers. Under a clause of&#34; this kind, the patentee would have been bound to establish a factory in Australia. To put it shortly - we cannot have a man who has an article patented abroad taking out patent rights here, not for the purpose of manufacturing in Australia, but for the purpose of holding the market. </para>

            <para>- And in order to facilitate him, he is allowed to import for four years the article which ultimately he has to manufacture himself. The intention . of the clause is very good, because it is to give an inventor time in which to get the necessary skilled labour and appliances for producing the patented article. Beyond the period fixed, if no factory is set up, .the benefits of the patent are lost. But how- is the clause to be carried out ? An inventor before the five years have elapsed sets up  his factory ; but it proves of no good, and he keeps only a couple of men there. At what moment do his protective rights cease ? The clause provides that he must set up a factory and &#34; continuously carry on &#34; in Australia the manufacture of the patented article.

            <para>- The clause, provides that the patented article shall be manufactured &#34; in such a manner &#34; that any person desiring to use it may obtain it &#34; at a reasonable price.&#34; What sort of a &#34;manner &#34; is that ? And what is &#34; a reasonable price <inline font-style="italic">&#34;1</inline> If I am told that a similar provision has worked satisfactorily in Canada, that will alter ray views ; but if it be an invented clause, it seems to me to be very loosely turned, and one that would prove hard to administer. A man who sets up his factory under this clause may make a couple of score or a couple of hundred machines, as the case may be, and then cease operations. For how long -a period has that cessation to exist before his patent rights lapse ? Can it be said that he does not &#34; continuously carry on &#34; his factory if he keeps it open, but manufactures no more machines ? If the patent rights lapse, then, of course, it will be possible for any person to make the article, or import it from abroad. The only way in which this clause could be tested would be in the case of a person who, having set up his factory, and having turned out a few of the articles, was met by a purchaser who said he wanted to buy one. In such a case, the patentee might say, &#39;&#34; I cannot give you one of the articles at &#39; a reasonable price.&#39; &#34; The intending purchaser would then obtain -the machine or  article from  outside Australia, and the question would be tested on action being taken by the patentee for infringement, and the court would have to construe the extraordinary words which I have quoted. I do not think any court would venture to interpret those words. As I say, if this clause has been taken from the Canadian Act, that will alter the situation, because I suppose there must be legal decisions. </para>

          <para>- I do npt think that any one will accuse me of opposing these two clauses from a protectionist point of view. T believe I am as much a protectionist as anybody, and I believe in a manufacturer being protected by a duty. But honorable senators always seem to talk about &#34;the public&#34; and the &#34; manufacturer.&#34; This Bill is for the purpose of protecting the inventor and not the manufacturer, and it is our duty to protect the public as well as the inventor ; and clauses 83 and 84 will protect neither the inventor nor the public. I can give an illustration to show how these provisions cannot possibly protect the inventor. Suppose I were an engineer, and discovered something very important in connexion with the shafting of ocean steamers. Suppose, further, that I went to some of the shipping companies, or a combination of them, and exhibited my patent. . What would be said to me? Would I not be told that this invention could be imported into Australia for only four years, and that in five years I must manufacture here?- It might be impossible for me, as an inventor, to manufacture. the article in Australia within five years or even within ten years. What would be the result? The large shipping company, or combination of shipping companies, would say to me - &#34;We do not care about your patent rights, which will run out in five years, if the article is not manufactured here ; and we can then manufacture it ourselves, or get somebody to do it for us.&#34; Where is the protection to the inventor? The same -remarks might be made as to any other appliance invented by some clever man. It may be impossible for him to manufacture in Australia, and if he goes to a manufacturer he is told by the latter - &#34;Why should I assist you, when in another five years your rights will expire, and I can manufacture on my own account ? &#34; Cannot honorable senators see that we are defeating the very object of the measure, which is the protection of the inventor ? That is one of the reasons I oppose both clause 83 and clause 84. The other reason is that clauses 85 and 86 give a protection to the public. I wish to protect the inventor and the public. Clauses 83 and 84 do not protect the inventor, but place a very extensive embargo on him. They put difficulties in the way of inventors, who generally are poor men. Very often they impoverish themselves before they perfect their inventions, and then they are placed at the mercy of a manufacturer or a combine. Nor do the clauses protect the public to any extent. Because clause 85 protects the public I shall vote against the two clauses which do not protect the inventor. </para>

            <para>- Certainly not. The reason why it was enacted in Canada was because a practice had sprung up of American manufacturers taking out patent rights for their inventions in Canada, and then supplying the Canadian market from their side of the border. This practice was not considered satisfactory, and therefore Canada, which was followed by Newfoundland, I think, enacted this provision. It is stated in the memorandum of the Board of Trade, at page 104- - </para>

        <para>In Canada patents become null and void at the end of two years from the date thereof unless the patentee or his legal representatives or his assignee within that time, or any authorized extension thereof, commence and after such commencement continuously carry on in Canada the construction or manufacture of the patented invention in such a manner that any person desiring to use it may obtain it. or cause it to be made for him at a reasonable price at some manufactory or establishment for making or constructing it in Canada. This period of two years maybe extended at any time not more than three months before its expiration by the Commissioner of Patents on its being proved to his satisfaction that the patentee was, for reasons beyond his control, prevented from complying with the above condition. Any question as to whether a patent has become void under these provisions may be adjudicated upon by the Exchequer Court of Canada upon information in the name of the Attorney-General of Canada, or at the suit of any person interested. Any patent in Newfound land which has not been brought into operation within two years from the date thereof becomes void at the end of that period. Every patent in . South Australia is liable to be revoked by the Governor upon the application of any person after the expiration of three years from the granting thereof if it is made to appear to the Governor that neither the patentee nor his. assignee or licensee has before the time of such application used the patented invention to a reasonable extent for the public benefit. But the Governor may, in his absolute discretion, refuse: any such application upon such terms and conditions as he may see fit. No patent has yet been forfeited under the provisions, and it is believed that no application has yet been modes under them. </para>
        <para>The object of the clause is to prevent persons who have taken out patent rights in foreign countries from getting letters patent here - not for the purpose of establishing a manufactory and making the articles here for the people of Australia, but simply for the purpose of holding the market and importing the articles.

          <para>- This very drastic clause would have some very extraordinary results. If a person invented and patented any machineryin Australia, no matter what it might be, it could not be imported if it was of such a nature that it could not be made here. There are many kinds of machinery which it would be impossible and absurd for an Australian inventor to try to manufacture here. Kalgoorlie is the only place in Australia where telluride is found. A special class of intricate and complicated machinery is required for the extraction of that metal. If an Australian inventor discovered a labour-saving appliance to extract the gold from the telluride he would be placed in an extraordinary position. He would patent his invention in Australia, and it would be impossible for him to set up a factory to make the machinery and supply it to perhaps a dozen mines in Australia, or to sell his patent to other people, and have the machinery imported.

            <para>- At the present time many chemists in Kalgoorlie are experimenting in regard to gold extraction. Suppose that a chemist made an important discovery which would entail the making of complicated machinery. He would patent his invention in. Australia, and for four years he could have it manufactured abroad and imported, but at the end of that time the patent would lapse. Is not that most unfair? What is the object of the Bill but to protect the patentee of a valuable invention? This clause must be detrimental to the inventor unless his invention be of such a simple nature that he can start to manufacture it here. The intention of the Bill is to protect the rights of the patentee, to see that other persons shall not benefit by his ingenuity. </para>

            <para>- That is not necessarily the case,I am interested in an Australian patent. We understand that the article could be constructed in Europe or America for about 30s. We called for tenders by advertisement for its construction. No one cared to tender. Eventually after a lot of trouble we dug up people who were prepared to make our article for us, but at a very enhanced price. We were, in fact, obliged to go to Europe and America to get it made at a price that would enable it to be sold under the most economical circumstances. We found that if we were to sell it at the price at which it should be sold, we should be compelled to import it. The only way in which we could comply with this clause would be by paying for the construction of the article 100 per cent. more than it need cost, and in the second place by making the consumers pay a correspondingly enhanced price. Is that the intention of the Bill? Undoubtedly not. None of us want to force the consumer to pay 100 per cent. more than he need pay. On the other hand, we want to give a fair protection to the inventor. If this clause is to be maintained we should state honestly that we are not going to give patents for more than four years. Because that is what it will amount to in nearly every case. </para>

            <para>- The position is, not that we are backward, but that no one here has any enterprise. You put an advertisement in the newspaper, and no one responds. The people who are left in Victoria to-day are all so comfortable, and make such good incomes, that they do not care to go into any new business. That is the long and short of it. I say so as the result of my experience within the last fortnight. </para>

          <para>- There is one point of view which has been overlooked by the Minister for Defence, and also by the Committee. If the clause is pissed as it stands very few people will apply for patents in Australia. If, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> says, patentees find that patent rights are practically only granted for four years they will not be anxious to pay the fees to patent their articles here. They cannot manufacture the articles profitably within the Commonwealth. It would be impossible to manufacture a great many patented articles at a profit to suit the needs of such a small population as four millions of people. Any one who started to manufacture would lose money by it. I strongly oppose this clause, and consider that it is a great blot upon the Bill. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> has pointed out it cannot be in the interests of the inventor. I understood that the Bill was to protect the inventor as well as the public who buy patented goods. A few days ago I was speaking to a manufacturer who has large works in Melbourne. I wanted to buy a dynamo, and while I was at his works, I asked him what he thought of this clause. I said - &#34;Would it pay you to make these dynamos entirely in Australia ?&#34; He replied - &#34; No ; if we sold every dynamo that is used in Australia it would not pay us to make them here.&#34; That opinion fully bears out what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has said, that this clause will operate hardly upon the gold-producing industry of Western Australia and also upon the farming community. I am satisfied that if the Bill compels the manufacture of patented machines in Australia we shall have to pay a very much higher price , for inferior articles. For these reasons it is against the best interests of the Commonwealth that the clause, as printed, should pass. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PULSFORD</inline>(New South Wales). - I am sorry that we have not got the Postmaster-General in the Senate now. If he were here I should be able to urge upon him the necessity of keeping in touch with the electrical inventions of the day. I am sure that he would be satisfied of the unwisdom of putting in the Bill a clause, the effect of which would be to compel the Post and Telegraph Department to pay a greatly enhanced price for the electrical apparatus which it requires in such large quantities, and in which improvements are constantly taking place. I have received a letter, in which I am informed that what is called the electrical controller, used in the electrical trams of Sydney, is covered by no less than nine different patents. If we carried the clause I do not see that it would be workable. A particular article may not be the work of one inventor, but may be covered by many different patents. I was pleased to hear the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> who takes a commonsense view of this subject. It is the view I should take if I were a protectionist, because it is in the interests of the manufacturers to have the best and most perfect appliances. Any proposal which limits the availability of new inventions is a distinct blow to processes of manufacture. In the United States, where invention has achieved its greatest triumphs, and where the patents number almost thousands to the hundreds in other countries, there is no such provision as this in the Patents law. </para>

          <para>- I expected opposition to this clause from some of the quarters from which it has come. The fact that the provision is not contained in the Patents law of the United States is no reason why, if we are convinced that it will benefit our own people, we should not have it in this Bill. There are two sides to the question. In the first place, it is all very well to say that we should protect the inventor up to the hilt, and that he should have a monopoly with regard to his invention. But the public also have some right to be protected. If this clause is carried, the public will be benefited, whilst, at the same time, I do not believe that any great injustice will be done to inventors. It has been said that certain patented machinery cannot be made within the Commonwealth. I want honorable senators to give me a specific instance as to any patented machinery that cannot be made by the artisans of Australia. </para>

            <para>- All these arguments were trotted out when we were discussing the Tariff. We were told that it was impossible to compete with manufacturers in other parts of the world. We were told that in the early days of protection in this and in other States of the Commonwealth, but we adopted a system of protection with the result that we wereable in a few years not only to compete with the imported article, but to sell cheaper in various lines of manufacture. Honorable senators will know that for years we imported our locomotives from England and America, and it was said that we could not compete with those countries in manufacturing them here. Perhaps this is trenching upon another subject, but with regard to this intricate machinery, and the patents connected with mining machinery under this Bill, the patentees will have the Australian market for four years. The cases cited by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> can be met under this Bill. During those four years, the patentees of mining machinery will probably be able to supply all that is required in Western Australia, or in the whole of Australia. I think this is a very wise provision,and one upon which the Government may be commended. </para>

            <para>- If he cannot do that his patent rights may be revoked under clause 84. But so far as the article which is the subject of the patent is concerned, there is nothing to provide that it shall be shut out of Australia. What we provide is that, if after a certain time the patentee does not establish the manufacture of his invention in Australia, he shall not have the monopoly of the Australian market as an importer. We do not deny ourselves the advantage of using the invention, even if it be produced in another part of the world. We say that the patentee shall not continue to enjoy his monopoly under these patent rights without giving us a <inline font-style="italic">quid pro quo.</inline> It is not to be assumed that when an inventor obtains patent rights in Australia he will be content with that. If his article is the subject of manufacture elsewhere, and we are importing it into Australia, it must be obvious that he has taken out patent rights in respect &#34;of it elsewhere. Under this Bill, the patent rights granted to him, so far as the Australian market is concerned, are subject to the two conditions imposed. But so far as the people in Australia are concerned who are engaged in mining and manufacturing industries, and who may require the particular machines spoken of by Senators Pearce and Smith, there is nothing in this clause which will deprive them of the possibility of getting what they require. We say that the inventor shall enjoy the sole right of importing and supplying the Australian market for a certain period, and if at the end of that period he does not choose to erect within Australia works for the manufacture of his invention, he shall no longer be a monopolist so far as Australia is concerned, and the people of Australia will be at liberty to obtain his invention in whatever way they choose. If he says that the market in Australia is so limited that it will not pay him to commence the manufacture of his invention in Australia, as in the case cited by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders,</inline> we provide by this Bill that the article may still be imported freely into Australia, but the inventor will not have the sole right of selling it in this country. If any one in Australia is of opinion that it will pay him to manufacture the invention &#39; in .Australia, he will be at liberty to do so, and that will not be considered any infringement of. any right granted to the inventor in the past. I repeat that the disability, if it may be so called, is only upon the person who secures the patent rights, and although those rights, under certain conditions, may be revoked, the people of Australia will be placed in no worse position. </para>

Under clause 85, if the patentee, being registered outside the Commonwealth, does not &#39; think our market sufficiently large to induce him to establish the manufacture of his patented article here to supply this market, and some person within the Commonwealth thinks the market good enough, that person can apply to the patentee to grant him a licence for the manufacture of the patented article here  so that the Australian public may have the benefit of the invention. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator HARNEY</inline>(Western Australia). - When I spoke upon this clause upon the first occasion, I dealt with it merely from the legal point of view. The language struck me as very loose and such as to render the interpretation a matter of extreme difficulty, though otherwise I thought the idea very excellent. On looking at the clause closer,- however, I find that the plausible appearance it presents is merely a mask, which, when torn away, reveals undiluted, hide-bound protection. Nothing could be clearer to anyone who carefully reads the clause than that the effect is to say to an Australian inventor - &#34; We protect you for four years in any event, but not for a day longer, unless you are fortunate enough to be able to set up in Australia, by yourself or your assignee, a factory for the manufacture, construction or working of this invention.&#34; Is that a fair or a reasonable condition to impose on a poor man who gives the result of his thought, in the form of an invention, to the public? The invention may be of a character which is impossible of manufacture in Australia. - Suppose it be a. light in which the main material is a by-product of petroleum, which is not to be found in Australia. At the end of four years we say to the inventor - &#34; You must not import this from outside Australia,&#34; aad  the result is that the public cannot have the light at all, and the duration of the patent becomes four years. Then, again, the success of a patent may lie in a process by which a want of the general public is supplied not more efficiently, but more cheaply, than by a process already in existence. In other words, the only justification for the patent, and the sole value of it, may be that it does in a cheaper manner what is already done. It may be necessary for the inventor to obtain one portion of his material from the cheap labour of the Indies, and another portion from the cheap labour of the . </para>
        <para class="block">I  slums of London, and by the combination be able to undersell an article which supplies the want not less efficiently, but necessarily at a higher price. In such a case, does this clause not limit the period of the patent to four years ? An inventor is prevented from selling the public something, except on a condition which it is impossible to fulfil - the condition of paying the high wages prevailing in Australia, and of using the high-priced materials to be found here. The whole clause is another way of saying, &#34;Not only will we compel Australian people to buy in the dearest possible market, namely, the Australian market,&#34;- and herein lies the whole theory of protection as against free-trade - &#34; but we will compel the Australian inventor to confine his efforts to supplying public wants which are suitable to Australian conditions.&#34; That is the old argument of protection as against free-trade. The view I am now taking is in accordance with the free-trade doctrine, which I am bound to maintain as strongly as I can. At first the clause did not appear to me to involve the fiscal question ; but, after examination, I am bound to say, as a good free-trader, that I cannot support it. </para>

            <para>- I am bound to admit that there is a flavour of protection about the clause, and that makes me rather surprised that I have not received the full support of the protectionists in the Senate. I explained at the beginning why a similar provision was put into operation in Canada. There was a desire that when any rights were given under the Patents law, Canadian industries should be built up, and it was determined that if patented articles continued to be manufactured in the United States, patents would not be issued for the benefit of a few individuals. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Charleston</inline> contended that clause 85 would do all the work that we desire should be done by clause 83, but he admitted the weakness of his contention by suggesting an amendment in 85 which would tend in a direction opposite to that which he desired. If that amendment were to be carried, we should have a jumble of two provisions which are much better apart. With the amendment, leaving to the Court the power to revoke letters patent, there would still be a probability, under clause 85, of a person getting patent rights here and using them simply for the purpose of interposing between the public and the manufacturer, and extorting a toll. Clause 85 provides only that if an inventor is not so working: as to supply the reasonable requirements of the public, the Court may compel him to grant licenses to other persons to do so, on the application of some person interested. But, if no application be made to the Court, then there may. be a man in Australia with patent rights which he uses simply to hold a market and compel the public to pay toll to him on getting the article from abroad. It is said that that position may begot rid of by taking the provision in clause 83 as to patents lapsing, and. grafting it on to clause 85. But how could that be done? Clause 85 provides that the Court may make an order compelling a patentee to grant licences. The Court does not make an order and then look at the Act to see what is going to happen if the order is not obeyed. If the Court makes an order it will use all its power to insure its being obeyed. If that is the remedy given under the clause, then the Court will compel a patentee to grant compulsory licences ; and there the matter ends so far as that clause is concerned. If we desire the Court to have power to revoke licences, that power is given in clause 83. A licence is not exactly revoked, but it lapses if the conditions on which it was granted are not fulfilled ; and it would be much better to allow the Bill to remain as it is. In the first place, the patent rights are granted subject to certain conditions, and if those conditions are not fulfilled the rights lapse. Then if a person interested either as a manufacturer or a user shows that the holder of patent rights is not exercising them in such a way as to supply the reasonable wants of the public, the patentee may be compelled to grant licences. The two provisions are not antagonistic, but complementary. </para>

            <para>- If it is necessary to take this power in the case of the Defence Department, I think it is also necessary to protect the interests of other Departments. We ought to lay down the general rule that the Government may take over an invention of an improvement. Take, for instance, the invention of wireless telegraphy ; surely it should be reserved for the use of the Crown, and should not be monopolised by any individual ? I do not suggest that we should rob any inventor of the result of his genius ; he should be fairly compensated. We should prevent such inventions being sold to a private company. When we recollect that the States and Federal Governments are launching out into schemes of State enterprise which were not dreamed of many years ago when the old Patents Acts were passed, we shall see how necessary it is to give Ministers a larger power than is conferred on them by this clause. Why is it given to the Minister for Defence? Simply because it is recognised that it is in the public interest that no private company should be able to monopolize an invention of an improvement in instruments or munitions of war. The States Governments have practically a monopoly of railway traffic. Suppose that an invention were discovered which would revolutionize the means of transit and transport. The inventor would be able to sell to a company an invention which would make the railway lines of the States worthless and useless, and practically do away with the security for the national debt. Such a contingency suggests the necessity for giving to the States or the Commonwealth Government a pre-emptive right to every invention, subject to the payment of a just compensation. Clause 90 contains this provision - </para>

No; on the contrary he looked for some person who would give him a speculative value, and, having attained his object, the purchaser of the invention approached the Government with a view to obtaining an advance on that sum. It was not desired that the Government should get the use of the invention at its fair market value. </para>

          <para>- I do not quite follow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> because there is nothing that I can see to prevent an inventor, if he likes, from assigning his rights to the Commonwealth. The provision in clause 90 is simply to insure that if an invention is required in a Department of the Public Service, the Minister may obtain the use of it for the Department on paying the inventor a sum to be fixed by arbitration. That is very similar to the provision in the Post and Telegraph Act in regard to our use of the States railways. We recognised that we ought to pay a price similar .to that which would be charged to private persons, but we made it compulsory on the part of the Statesto allow us to use their lines. Formerly,, when a man discovered an invention the patent rights were not binding on the Crown ; it could always use the invention. We have altered that rule, but still there is the provision that the Crown is not to be prevented, on payment of a reasonable price, from having the use of an invention. Clauses 91 to 93 specially refer to inventions in munitions of war, because it is necessary to depart from the ordinary practice in order to insure secrecy. It would be of noadvantage to the Government to be possessed of an invention of an improvement in a weapon of war, if it could become known to everybody. </para>

          <para>- The Minister used the expression &#34; even if there may have been no valuable consideration,&#34; but that is not exactly the case ; it is &#34;even if no valuable consideration is expressed.&#34; I hardly see why an agreement which has been entered into with the Government, and in which there is a valuable consideration, should be allowed to be valid without the expression of that consideration. I do not see any particular point in exempting an agreement made with the Government from the operation of that provision in the common law. I do not see why the consideration should be left out. It will give an inventor an opportunity of defrauding his associates if he desires to do so. For instance, a director may sell his patent to the Government, and afterwards show his partners an agreement to the effect that he got nothing for it. </para>

The matter does not require much discussion, but I would observe that the word &#34; attorney &#34; carries with it the insinuation that the agent is connected with the law. In this case it is not intended that the attorney shall be a legal gentleman. I move - </para>

            <para>- The word &#34;agent&#34; is very vague indeed. It signifies a man who acts for another, and who possesses no particular skill or qualification in connexion with his work. There are land agents and house agents who may be skilful in their business, but whose work requires no particular qualification. Here we are making a departure. We want the patent attorneys to be persons having special skill in connexion with patents. They will not necessarily be members of the legal profession, except in regard to the Patents law ; but we want it to be understood that they are not ordinary agents, but persons possessed of ability in connexion with this business. When we are accustomed to the term patentattorneys, it will seem quite as appropriate as the term &#34; patent agents.&#34; </para>

        <para>There seems to be a storm of protest against this proposal, but lawyers&#39; fees may be taxed by a taxing master, and the Commissioner of Patents, who will be an expert in this line, can surely lay down a scale of fees which will be elastic enough to meet the various cases that may arise. We are recognising in this Bill that most of the business will be transacted by patent attorneys. The very distance of most of the States from the Patents-office will render that necessary, and there is little use in making this Patents law a liberal measure when we have no guarantee that patent attorneys will not tax inventors. If we lay down a scale we shall have some guarantee that no inventor will be charged exorbitant fees. </para>

          <para>- I do not think that the amendment would benefit inventors very much. We should have to fix a fee for lodging an application or drawing up a specification, which would, at all events, be sufficient to recompense a man for doing the necessary work in connexion with the most extensive and intricate matters which might  possibly be put into the hands  of  a patent </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">Attorney,  and that, possibly, would come to be looked upon as the usual charge. Again, if we say that the fee for drawing up a specification shall be two guineas, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Marconi</inline> desires to secure patent rights for his wireless telegraphy, and wishes to have specifications drawn up which involve a lot of intricate detail, is it to be understood that a charge of two guineas only will bc made for that? Surely that is not intended 1 It seems to me that there will be so much diversity amongst inventions which will be the subject of applications, that a reasonable fee for drawing up specifications might vary from &#38; few shillings up to hundreds of pounds. In such circumstances, how is it possible to fix a scale 1 I think we must leave to the patent agent the fee to be charged, and . there, is this safeguard to inventors that they are not bound to go to a patent attorney at all or to any particular one. Various fees may be charged by different patent attorneys. A man who has a simple invention which he desires to patent will probably go to a patent attorney, who willcharge a small fee, and a man who /desires to secure a patent for a very intricate machine will probably go to a man at the top of the profession, and pay a much higher fee. </para>

          <para>- This appears to me to be a very unjust and illiberal clause. I do not know why an officer employed in the Patents-office should not be allowed to become a patent attorney. I believe that in America it is a very common thing for even a Chief Commissioner to leave the office with a view to enter upon business in this line on his own account. It is difficult to conceive anybody likely to be better acquainted with the patent law, or better able to guide would-be patentees over the difficulties of applications and specifications. Unless there is some good reason for it of which I know .nothing, I think this clause should be omitted. </para>

          <para>- The&#39; reason clearly is this - an officer who is in the Patents-office, while an application is going through, may. become possessed of information in consequence of his position. It may be made worth his while to retire from the office, and ho may become a patent attorney at once, and act in such a way as to use the information he acquired in the office against an applicant for a patent. We have in another part of the Bill provided that an application must be accepted within twelve months of the date when it is lodged. I presume that is why the twelve months period is fixed in this clause. Presumably, if an officer has been away from the Patents-office for twelve months he will not be in a position to make use of any information acquired during his service in the office. </para>

            <para>- I shouldnot think so ; but I dare say they have people in England who can draft clauses and make them comprehensive and suitable. This is a very loose clause. It is quite possible to reduce a clause to so few words that we may have to make up for it afterwards by a lot of litigation and trouble. The clause ends - &#34; Penalty, one hundred pounds.&#34; But I do not think there is any means provided for enforcing payment or imprisonment in the alternative, if imprisonment is thought to be right. </para>

          <para>- I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> will remember that this is an extremely important clause. I can understand the objection raised to it by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford,</inline> because it is easy to believe that, in some circumstances, a man, by describing himself as a patent attorney, may receive valuable information with regard to a patent to be taken out, and may also receive money from an inventor, under the impression that he is a patent attorney. I think, if possible, the clause should be strengthened so that inventors may not be at the mercy of, and be victimized by, persons describing themselves as patent attorneys . </para>
