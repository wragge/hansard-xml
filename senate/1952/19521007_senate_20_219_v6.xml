                        <para>- Can the Minister representing the Minister for the Army say whether it is a fact that, on the 29th September, at least seven soldiers were detained in the guard house of the Puckapunyal military camp, and that some had been so detained for a period of twelve weeks awaiting trial for having been absent without leave? Is it a fact that soldiers under detention should be allowed one hour a day in the open yard for exercise ? Is it a fact that those detained are being deprived of that concession, aud that the only time they see the sun is through the barred windows of their cells which also serve as their exercise yard ? Since British justice demands that a person shall be deemed to be innocent until he has been pronounced guilty by a court, will the Minister make inquiries into these statements, and if they are found to be correct, will he issue instructions that soldiers charged with offences shall be tried within two days and also be treated in accordance with Army regulations ? </para>

                        <para>- As I have no knowledge of the allegations made by the honorable senator, I shall have to ask the Minister for the Army for information about the circumstances under which men are held in detention camps. I have no hesitation in refuting the suggestion that men are not treated properly and well. The suggestion that they are kept in circumstances that they cannot see the sun, except at stated intervals, has to me the atmosphere of gross exaggeration of the facts. I know the Army and the Minister for the Army well enough to be able to assure the Senate without reference to him, that the men are being treated generously, having regard to the circumstances in which they are placed. I shall ask the Minister for the Army to furnish a statement on the matter. </para>

An examination of the shipping position on the Australian coast disclosed that insufficient cargo was available to load <inline font-style="italic">Dulverton</inline> to proceed to Western Australia via Adelaide. Accordingly, arrangements were made for the vessel to go to Darwin again, and thence to Western Australia by that route. I do not believe that any problem exists at present in relation to the shipment of cargo to Western Australian ports. </para>

                            <para>- Some months ago, honorable senators on both sides of the chamber requested that regular and more frequent shipping services be provided to the port of Esperance, in Western Australia. At that time, the Minister for Shipping and Transport attributed the cancellation of certain scheduled calls by vessels to an engineers' strike then in progress, but he said that the matter would receive consideration. As the strike ended two months ago, will the Minister inform the Senate what improvements have been effected in the service? </para>

                        <para>- I direct to the Minister for National Development a number of questions which, arise from a statement made by the Minister last week in which he claimed that since June, 1951, American companies have invested in Australia double the amount that was invested during the preceding six years. Will the Minister table the details of such investments and disclose the source of his figures ? Will he provide details of the figures, so that the Senate will know the precise categories in which investments have been made? Has the Minister included in the figures the amount of loans from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development? Will he indicate what percentage of the money is new. and how much is reinvestment money? Has the Minister any information regarding the 82 per cent, excess pro-fits tax which is being imposed in the United States of America? Has it influenced reinvestment, and has he received any reports from the trade commissioner which can be made available to honorable senators? Has any inducement been made to American investors by promising them exemption from taxes on Australian profits under the proposed tax agreement? Has the Minister's attention been directed to the recent 64-page international trade edition of the <inline font-style="italic">New York Journal of Commerce,</inline> which does not contain a single reference to this country? Can the Minister explain why the Government does not supply appropriate material to such publications as the <inline font-style="italic">Wall Street Journal</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">The Journal of Commerce</inline> if it wishes to expand trade with the United States of America? </para>

                        <para>- I hardly think that it is fair for an honorable senator to ask any Minister to reply offhand to such a lengthy series of questions. I am afraid that I have been unable to remember all the questions. My statement in relation to the amount of capital that had been invested in this country was true. I did not pluck it out of the air. It was based on facts and figures that had been given to me by my department. The honorable senator said, if I understood him aright, that I had stated that a certain amount had actually been invested since 1951. I did not say that. What I said was that there had been commitments to invest that amount. The actual expenditure might be spread over two, three or more years, according to the requirements of each project. I am not prepared to make available publicly the details of the various investments, because many of them were based on confidential negotiations between my department and the companies concerned. I did not accept the figures that had been given to me until my department had substantiated them. I am prepared to make available to the Leader of the Opposition privately the information about the figure of £50,000,000 that I mentioned. I could not, in fairness to the companies concerned, make it public. If the honorable senator will place the remainder of his questions on the notice paper, I shall answer them. The only thing that prevents me from answering them now is that I cannot remember them. </para>

Will the Minister ' ensure that airmail which is posted in Sydney before the early afternoon on a week day and addressed to Adelaide and its suburbs is delivered by the first mail the next morning? For the purpose of  achiev-  ing this objective, will the Minister consider the use of- the daily Trans-Australia Convair service which leaves Mascot for Essendon at 4 p.m., and Essendon for Parafield at 6.55 p.m.? </para>

The Trans- Australia Airlines Convair service leaving Sydney at 4 p.m. has not been used for mail primarily because of the small volume of mail available for despatch to Adelaide via Melbourne by that plane. However, arrangements have" been made for an airmail for Adelaide to be despatched by the Convair in future. </para>

If so, what sum is paid and to whom is it paid? Why is there a need to advertise national programmes in this manner? </para>

                    <quote>
                        <para>The cost to the Australian Broadcasting Commission of the erecting of the sign mentioned was £31 10s. A rental of £15 10s. per month is paid to Claude Neon Limited for the sign and a rental of £5 per month for the excellent site is paid to Claude Neon Limited representing the Cadbury Trust. The function of the Australian Broadcasting Commission is to provide a service of information and entertainment for listeners, and it is necessary that the availability of this service should be continually brought to the notice of the public. This sign at the busiest intersection in Perth is a valuable means of publicizing various broadcast programmes. It is generally recognized in all' spheres relating to public entertainment and public services that advertisement is essential, but the Australian Broadcasting Commission's publicity activities are limited and are in fact considerably less than is normal in this field. </para>

Is it not a fact that Chinese Communists are helping the North Korean Communists in Korea against the United Nations forces? 2. Is it not a fact that Russian Communists are assisting North Korean Communists and supplying them with aeroplanes and pilots in North Korea against the United Nations forces? If the answers to questions No. 1 and No. 2 are in the affirmative, can the Minister give the Senate any information as to how the Government can justify the granting of vises to a delegation to Moscow, in Communist Russia, and at the same time the refusing of vises to the delegation to Peking, in Communist China ? </para>

                        <para>- This question follows the pattern of others that have been asked on the same topic. Of course, T. am not able to say offhand whether the figures referred to by the honorable senator are correct. It is well known that securities have been bought in on the open market. I am. sorry to say, however, that I.' do not carry in my head particulars concerning the volume of such transactions. The Commonwealth would not be prepared to purchase back its securities at par at any stage of their currency because it would be impracticable to do so. The price of bonds rises and falls in the same way as does the price of all securities on the market. The natural corollary to the proposal would be that when bonds were selling at a premium, as they frequently do, those who held them should pay the amount of the premium to the Government. I should think that that course of action would be as unpopular with the people who hold bonds as is the suggestion that the Government should purchase at par bonds which are selling at a discount. </para>

                        <para>- On the 16th September, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Paltridge</inline> asked a question on the subject of the savings effected by the introduction of diesel electric locomotives on the Trans-Australian line. The answer to the honorable senator's question is as follows: - </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The first mainline diesel electric locomotive was officially placed in service on the Trans-Australian Railway on the Ctb October, 1951. Figures for locomotive operation on that railway since the introduction of diesel electric power until the 20th July, 1052, are as follows: - Average cost per steam locomotive mile, 194.47d.; average cost per diesel electric locomotive mile, 40.07d.; total steam mileage involved, 380,000 approximately; total diesel mileage involved, 588,000 approximately. These figures include the. cost of operating crews as well as workshops and running expenses, including fuel, lubrication, servicing, &amp;c. As the diesel electric locomotives are new, very little expenditure has been involved in workshops repairs, but based on American experience, it is considered that an additional 20d. per engine mile will more than cover their average workshops maintenance costs? which means then that the operating cost of a diesel electric locomotive would be about one-third of that of the steam locomotive. </para>
                        <para>Based on the mileages given above, the savings made by the diesel electric locomotive compared with steam locomotives for the period under reference, would be over £300,000, dining which time the diesel electric locomotives operated approximately 60 per cent, of the total mileage. If diesel electric locomotives had run the full mileage, the total saving over that period, would have been approximately £59(1,000. In other words, based on present average expenditure, the diesel electric locomotives result in a saving of approximately 50 per cent, per annum of their total cost. </para>
                        <para>Overtime and penalty time as a part of the total time paid to running and maintenance staff, for the period ended 23rd August, 1952, as compared with the period ended 22nd September, 1951, shows the following reductions: - Running staff: i.e. men on rostered shifts as drivers, firemen, cleaners, pumpers, train examiners, 80.7 per cent.; shed (maintenance) staff: i.e. fixed hours staff, 89 per cent. Such payments as are still necessary are due almost solely to penalty time for week-end work. The running shed depots at Tarcoola, Cook and Rawlinna have been closed, and staff transferred to other locations. The transfer of surplus staff from the Trans-Australian Railway to the Central Australia Railway has permitted considerable reduction being effected in overtime and penalty time on the latter railway on which previously heavy overtime was being worked. </para>

However, the then Government, as is well known, did not view favorably, the bestowal of honours. Shortly after I was elected to the Parliament. I -raised tins  matter  with the Prime Minister, and I understood from subsequent correspondence that the right honorable gentleman would look into it. Many honours have been awarded during the Inst two years, and although the list that I have mentioned was only small, it is not too late for the Government to recommend the award of honours to the men I mentioned, in recognition of their special services during the war. Will the Minister inform me whether they might still expect to receive recognition for those services? </para>

                    <para>The Minister acting for the Postmaster-General has now supplied me with the following information: - lt is not now the policy to  intall  head type public telephone cabinets  except  in isolated cases where full-length cabinets are unsuitable. The replacement of existing head type  cabinets  is proceeding but the supply of full-length cabinets is not unlimited and the programme of new installations to which the department is committed renders the observance of a definite order of priority essential so that preference may be given to the most urgent cases. The replacement of head type cabinets will be expedited as much as possible. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister for the Navy has supplied the following answer : - lt is not at present intended to establish a miva! base in Cockburn Sound as existing facilities in Fremantle are adequate for our needs. The opening up of the Sound, however, is of strategic importance and would pro* vide a secure fleet anchorage and convoy assembly area if required. The Department of the Navy originally owned a considerable portion of the land surrounding the eastern side of Cockburn Sound, a large portion of which has been transferred to the Western Australian Government for the erection of a refinery and the steel rolling mills. This department, however, has retained a portion of its original holding for use if it is decided in the future to establish more naval installations in the area. </para>

                        <para>From time to time I have made it quite clear that the Australian Hides and Leather Industries Board continues in existence solely for the purpose of enabling State control of prices of hides and leather to operate. This is in pursuance of an undertaking given to the States when they assumed the responsibility for controlling domestic prices generally. However, it has never been the intention that marketing or export control of any commodity should be maintained if there " was not a  real need for it. The closer that export prices get to the fixed domestic price levels the less is the justification 'for the retention of such controls. I am at present examining the whole position in relation to both hides and tallow. </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The main proposals of the Government for adjusting the rates o|C income tax and social services contribution in respect of the financial year 1952-53 are contained in this bill. These proposals relate to companies as well as individuals. The provisions of the bill represent a substantial part of the Government's plan for reducing taxation by approximately £50,000,000 in the current financial year. The major alteration affecting individuals is the abolition of the 10 per cent, special levy imposed last year. The benefit to individual taxpayers as a consequence of this reduction will amount to £23,000,000 in the current year. The gain to these taxpayers in a full assessment year will, however, be £36,500,000. The difference between these amounts is due partly to the fact that the reduced tax instalments from earnings will not commence to operate until the 1st October, 1952. This delay in the introduction of the new schedules is necessary to allow sufficient time for the preparation, printing and distribution of the scales after the policy of the Government has been decided. Excess instalments deducted in the first three months of this year will, of course, be refunded shortly after returns for the current income year have been lodged. A further factor accounting for a part of the difference between £23,000,000 and £36,500,000 <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> that some of the provisional tax on business, professional and property incomes will not become payable in this financial year. This occurs where returns have been lodged late, giving rise to the late issue of assessments. </para>
                    <para>Honorable senators have received schedules comparing amounts payable for the years 1951-52 and 1952-53 by taxpayers with varying family responsibilities. Schedules have also been circulated to show a comparison of amounts payable in Australia on specified incomes with amounts payable in the United Kingdom and New Zealand on similar incomes. From these latter schedules it may be clearly seen that the Australian taxes proposed in the bill are much lower than are the income taxes of the United Kingdom and New Zealand. It has been argued that because the estimated collections in 1952-53 will exceed those of 1951-52, taxpayers will be worse off in 1952-53 despite the reduced rates of tax. This conclusion, drawn from such a comparison, is misleading as the taxation collections in this financial year will include arrears of taxes from previous years. The real position is that the estimated collections in 1952-53 from current income will be only £275,400,000, compared with the corresponding collection of £335,500,000 in 1951-52. Argument has also been advanced to the effect that changes in the value of money should be taken into account when determining taxation liabilities, so that the purchasing power of the taxpayer may be maintained at a constant level. It is impracticable to. adopt any other measure than the amount of money income received in any year, and no government in the past has departed from this method of approach. </para>
                    <para>The point to be borne in mind on this issue is the fact that the rates of taxation are being reduced. The taxpayer will get the benefit of the reduced rates irrespective of whether his increased income arises from basic wage increases or from any other cause. </para>
                    <para>It is proposed that the special concessions that were granted last year to men over 65 and women over 60 years of age shall be extended this year, in order to conform with the increase of the age pension. The concession is designed to exempt from taxation liability those persons of pensionable age who, by reason of their income, are ineligible to receive the age pension, but who, nevertheless, do not receive more than the permissible income for age pension purposes. In 1951-52, the permissible income was £234 for a single person and £468 for a married couple. The increase of the age pension by 7s. 6d. a week raises these amounts to £254 and £507 respectively. Accordingly, the bill raises the exemption to £254 for a single person and £507 for a married couple. Where the income is slightly in excess of those amounts the taxation liability will be limited to one-ha.lf of the excess over the permitted income. </para>
                    <para>Taxation of companies will also be reduced by the proposals contained in the bill. All companies, both public and private, will benefit from the discontinuance of the 10 per cent, advance payment which it was found necessary to impose last year. . All companies will have their current taxes reduced by a credit of the amount of the advance payment made last year, and they will not be required to make a further advance payment of 10 per cent, of the current tax. The decision to discontinue the system of advance payments will reduce revenue collections by £14,000,000 in the current financial year, and £5,000,000 in the next financial year, making a total of £19,000,000. Public companies will also benefit by a reduction of 2s. in the £1 of the rate applicable to the first £5,000 of taxable income. The Government has weighed the merits of claims that the full effects of taxation were adversely affecting small public companies. Having regard to the changed economic circumstances, it has been found possible to reduce the rate of tax on the first £5,000 of income of public companies. Although all public companies will gain some benefit from this provision, the concession will be of greatest assistance to small public companies. It is estimated that the full annual cost to revenue of this proposal will be £1,500.000, and £1,100.000 in the current financial year. </para>
                    <para>Since the introduction of uniform taxation, the primary rates of tax applicable to the income of mutual life assurance companies have been ls. lower than those imposed on the income of public companies. This concession to mutual life assurance companies is being continued by the bill. The primary rates of tax on private companies are not being altered. These rates are 5s. in the £1 on the first £5,000 of taxable income, and 7s. in the £1 on the ;balance of taxable income. However, the bill incorporates a new provision relating to the taxation of the undistributed income of private companies. In the past attempts have been made to devise a system of taxing those undistributed profits in such a way that the private company could retain a reasonable proportion of its income for developmental purposes, and at the same time pay an appropriate tax on profits retained for the benefit of its shareholders. It is admitted on all sides that the provisions of the present system are unduly complicated and, in many instances, have been ineffective in preventing avoidance of income tax. The new plan of  private  company taxation, which I. shall explain at greater length when the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Bill (No. 3) 1952 is introduced, is based, in principle, on recommendations that were submitted by the Commonwealth Committee on Taxation. Suffice it to state at this stage that the major source of complexity is to be found in the assessment of the undistributed income tax at the shareholders' individual graduated rates. This complexity is being removed by the imposition of a flat rate of tax of 10s. in the £1 instead of the shareholders' individual graduated rates. Taken in conjunction with proposed increased retention allowances, a relatively simple and, I believe, a fair basis of taxation of these companies will be attained. </para>
                    <para>It will be proposed in the bill dealing with assessments to exempt from tax nonprofit organizations concerned with sport in which human beings are the sole participants. That bill will propose to exempt from liability to taxation the income of other non-profit organizations where the income does not exceed £104. Organizations that will benefit from this exemption will be clubs, lodges and similar bodies, whose incomes consist usually of 3mall amounts of Commonwealth loan or bank interest. A special clause provides that, where the taxable income of such an organization exceeds £104 but does not exceed £208, the amount of tax and contribution payable shall be limited to one-half of the excess of the taxable income over £104. </para>
                    <para>The proposals that I have outlined relate to the current financial year. They will, therefore, be applied to the income derived by individuals during the year ending the 30th June, 1953, and to that derived by companies during the year ended the 30th June, 1952. By deciding upon the taxation policy incorporated in the bill, the Government has sought to grant the greatest possible relief consistent with the dictates of economic circumstances. The proposals that I have outlined have been designed to provide an equitable apportionment of such taxation relief as may be afforded in present circumstances. I commend the bill to honorable senators. </para>

Since the inception of the agreement, advances, to the States have steadily increased from £(5,795,000 in 1945-46 to £26,547,000 in 1951-52. In total, the States had received £111,009,000 at the 30th June, 1952. </para>
                    <para>The works programme approved by the Australian Loan Council in May last included £30,000,000 for housing under the agreement. It was estimated, however, that loan moneys would not be forthcoming to support the full programme, and that only £21,820,000 would be actually available. At the July meeting of the Australian Loan Council the Commonwealth agreed to supplement this sum by £8,180,000, thus assuring the States of total advances amounting to £30,000,000. </para>
                    <para>The Commonwealth offered this £8,180,000, on condition that the States agreed to expend it in providing houses in areas and for purposes nominated by the Commonwealth, where the Commonwealth wishes to make such nomination.

                    <para>At the 30th June, 1952, about 8,S00 houses had been imported by State authorities. A Commonwealth subsidy of £300 is payable on each of these. About 4,000 of these houses came under the housing agreement. Unfulfilled orders at that date totalled 5,000. Most of 'these houses are expected to arrive in Australia during the current financial year. No further orders for imported houses are at present being contemplated by Commonwealth or State authorities. </para>
                    <para>At the end of June, 1952 nearly 47,000 dwellings had been completed under the agreement. Completions in 1951-52 were S,766, compared with 7,778 dwellings completed in 1950-51. One-third of agreement houses have been built outside the metropolitan areas. These figures relate to New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia. South Australia has not operated under the agreement, and Tasmania withdrew two years ago. </para>
                    <para>The agreement was designed, primarily, to bring homes of a reasonable standard within the roach of persons with small or moderate incomes. This purpose is achieved by the provision of rental rebates, under which a family whose income equals the basic wage does not have to pay more than one-fifth of that income in rent, whatever the economic rent of the dwelling it occupies may be. As the family income rises above the basic wage or falls below it, the amount of rebate decreases or increases. By the 31st March, 1952, rental rebates granted in the operating States amounted to £367,000. </para>
                    <para>Under the housing agreement, any house may be sold to the tenant in occupation, who may receive a credit for any principal repayments he has made by way of rent. It is the State, however, that determines which houses shall be offered for sale, and the basis of sale. Commonwealth approval is necessary only if a State desires to sell a house at less than capital cost. To the 30th June, 1952, 1,951 houses had been actually sold to tenants, and negotiations were proceeding for the sale of about 2,000 more. Sales during the 1951-52 financial year totalled 930. I commend the bill to honorable senators. </para>

                    <para>. - Late on "Wednesday night last I asked the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'sullivan)</inline> whether he could give the Senate details concerning the work performed by tha Public Service Board. I asked him to do so because it seems to me that the Public Service Board proposes to expend a very substantial sum of money in the current financial year. I am interested to know whether the Minister can point to changed functions of the board or an increase of the number of employees, in order to justify such a large expenditure. Unfortunately, or fortunately, as the case may be, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Cormack  sought to amplify my request, and in doing so wandered into the realms of rhetoric. In the course of his remarks, for instance, he referred to the greedy fingers on the long arms of officers of the Public Service, and rather took the matter away from the lines on which .1 wished it to be discussed. Without any histrionics or rhetoric, I merely ask the Minister to outline to the Senate some of the functions performed by the Public Service Board. </para>

                    <para>.- The sum of £727,000 has been allocated for salaries and payments in the nature of salary for temporary and casual employees. The amount expended for this purpose last year in this department was £687,273. I have never been able to obtain a satisfactory answer explaining why the amount allocated for salaries and payments in the nature of  salary  for temporary officers i;. so high, year after year. I know that departments d'j li;i\e busy periods of <inline font-style="italic">ta&lt;s y'-\:iv</inline> during which they may require additional employees, but I must again voice my disapproval of the increasing amounts which are paid to temporary employees each year. I am disgusted that so many of these men, after years of loyal service to the Government, have still been classified only as temporary employees. The Australian Government appears to be the greatest sinner in this respect. The State governments have been reasonable enough to classify as permanent those temporary employees who have given some years of service, and in this way they have relieved them of considerable anxiety. I do not contend that these temporary and casual officers are not necessary. I know that they are. But from my own twenty years of experience in the Public Service I know that the employment of these people on a temporary basis is a means of securing cheap labour. These officers do not receive the reward that their services merit and which it would be in the interests of the taxpayer to give them. Many of them have offered their lives in defence of this country. </para>

The difference between the proposed vote and the vote for the last financial year is very largely due to various increases in wages. </para>

                    <para>. - &lt;No doubt some of the proposed vote of £460,000 in "Division 62 - Electoral Branch " - will be expended in the payment of fees and wages to assistant returning officers, presiding officers and poll clerks during the current financial year because it is expected that a Senate election will be held before the 30th June, 1953. At present no provision is made for teaching officers who are enlisted for one day's work by the Electoral Branch how to carry out their duties. It seems that the Government relies upon the intelligence of these people and, to some degree, upon the experience that they have gained in order to enable them to fulfil their obligations. Generally speaking, the services that they render can be considered as satisfactory. However, from time to time, an odd case shows clearly that not all officers have the knowledge necessary to carry out the duties of assistant returning officers, presiding officers or, perhaps, poll clerks. These men should be given a brief period of tuition prior to an election so that on the election day they may proceed with their duties with greater confidence than they have shown in the past. My personal experience of returning officers, assistant returning officers, presiding officers and poll clerks has been a happy one. I have found that they are prepared to co-operate with persons who are ready  to  co-operate with them, but occasionally an official is found who does not know  his duties and acts according to his own interpretation of the electoral law. An officer of that type causes much inconvenience to the candidates and their supporters and to the public generally. I have had some experiences that have not been to the credit of the department. All concerned like to see elections conducted smoothly and competently. The officers mean well but sometimes their knowledge is not sufficient to enable them to fulfil their obligations properly. Honorable senators had an illustration of this point recently when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McCallum</inline> was acting as  chairman  of the committee. No doubt he was honest and intended to do his best, but he could not carry out his duties fully and competently until he was instructed  by an officer. After he had obtained that instruction, the honorable senator was able to conduct the business of the committee properly. I invite the Minister to comment upon my suggestions. </para>

                        <para>- If that were the case, there would be no limit to the debate. L understand that the honorable senator asked in the first place whether any money had been provided in the Estimates for an election to be held during the financial year. The answer is " Yes ". A sum of £250,000 has been provided for the purpose under the heading " Miscellaneous Services ", on page 68. For the convenience of debate, I ask honorable senators not to refer to items under the " M4s,cellaneous Services " heading until consideration of votes for the various departments has been concluded. Matters such as that to which the honorable senator has referred will be considered by the committee later. It is difficult for a Minister to swing his attention from the  general  vote for the Department of  the  Interior to miscellaneous items. I shall bring  before  the Minister who is responsible for the  dministration  of the department the honorable senator's suggestion that more experienced staff should be allotted to electoral duties. </para>

                    <para>. - In view of the need for economies, I believe that the proposed vote for the Department of the Interior would bear closer investigation. This week men may be seen actively mowing grass near Parliament House. This morning two brand new motor mowers were in use on a paddock nearby. "When they had finished, the paddock looked more disreputable than when they had started. I was reminded of a conversation I had some years ago with an old farmer. "We were discussing the use of a reaper and binder on another farmer's paddock and the old farmer commented to me, " It looks as though he had chewed it off ". That comment might have applied to the work that I saw done this morning. I should like to see a parade on the lawn outside Parliament House of the implements that are used by the Department of the Interior in Canberra. Instead of buying all this expensive machinery to go over the paddocks. here&gt; the department could enclose some of the larger spaces, such as the area opposite the. Hotel Kurrajong and graze sheep there. If that were done, the list of equipment that was mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Critchley</inline> would be reduced considerably and the grass would be kept at ground level. At the same time, the sheep would return some revenue to the department and so save buying expensive machinery. </para>

                <para>More supervision seems to be needed in Canberra. One day when I was walking, I saw five men with hedge clippers who had to clip a hedge about .30 yards long. That was at 9 o'clock in the morning. The next morning at 9 o'clock they were still talking about the job. An average man could have done the work in half a day. I was amused last Friday when I read in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Chapman,</inline> one of the most competent transport men in Australia, is to have the assistance of another man who has many letters after his name to report and advise on the transport system in Canberra. If <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Chapman</inline> had been assigned to study transport in New South "Wales or in Australia generally, he would be competent to do so. He was a royal commissioner appointed to inquire into the railway system in Tasmania. To bring two highly qualified men to Canberra to advise the Government on the transport system of the National Capital is equivalent to using a sledge hammer to crack a nut. If the officer in charge cannot run properly a small transport system like that in operation in Canberra, there is something wrong with the department. Last year the system incurred a loss of £53,000. The previous year the loss was £37,000, so it is becoming worse. A radical overhaul of the system is necessary. I suggest that one-man 'buses should be capable of coping with the service in off-peak hours. A driver and a conductor are not necessary on each bus at all times. The Minister in charge of the department should study its requirements closely and exercise some economies. There is ample room, for them. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish to direct the attention of the Minister : to matters associated with the forthcoming Senate elections following upon those that have been raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Benn.</inline> Under "Division 62.  -  Electoral Branch" expenditure of £292,000 is proposed during the current year for salaries and allowances, and the total expenditure of the division is estimated at £460,000. In addition, the Minister for Shipping and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> has referred to a sum of £250,000 that is provided under another beading. This enormous expenditure in the coming twelve months will be repeated again in 19541 when an election of members of the House of Representatives will be held. It will be repeated again in 1956 and 1957. Indications are that in only one year between 1952 and 1057 an election will not be held. The people will become very tired of election appeals in two years out of every three. The cost of employing hosts of officials at elections is also an important consideration. Indeed, an enormous sum of money will be expended on elections in the next eight years. This problem will have to be faced. I am sure that if the people of Australia were aware of the prospect that they faced, they would readily support my views on this matter. The interests of the country as a whole demand that the Senate and House of Representatives elections be combined, commencing in 1953. </para>

                    <para>. - I am very much concerned about the soaring of administrative costs in the Department of the Interior and the Department of "Works. Last year, expenditure by the Department of the Interior on administration totalled £1,356,362. This year, the vote is £1,550,000. If my arithmetic is reasonably correct, that represents an increase of about £194,000. That increase is tremendous, particularly in view of the fact that expenditure on works has been severely pruned. The curtailment of the works programme is causing considerable unemployment, yet administrative costs are increasing. That is difficult to understand. </para>

                        <para>- I shall abide by your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Temporary Chairman,</inline> but I point out that  in  Tasmania quite a number of officials of the Department of the Interior are administering works. I can name them  if  necessary. However, I shall confine myself at this stage to the vote for the Department of the Interior. I am most concerned about the increase of approximately £194,000  in  administrative costs.  Can  the Minister representing the Minister for the Interior explain that increase? Surely  it is  not all due to the increase of the basic wage. Presumably, the number of employees of the department has been reduced as the result of the decision of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> to dismiss 10,000 public servants. Perhaps the explanation is that the dismissals have been more than offset by new appointments. Nevertheless, the increase of the vote is substantial, particularly  in  view of the pruning that is being carried out in other directions. </para>

                <para>The provision for the payment of rent on buildings also represents a substantial increase over last year's expenditure and I should like to know the reason. The sum of £500,406 was expended last year, but we are now being asked to vote £545,000. Has the already large number of buildings occupied by Commonwealth departments in Melbourne been increased? If that is the explanation, why has the Government not pushed ahead with the erection of more new offices  in  Canberra, with a view to saving as much as possible of this colossal annual rental bill ? Is the additional £45,000 needed to pay for premises for new departments that the Government has established somewhere, or is it the rake-off for wealthy landlords in Melbourne and Sydney who have increased their rents knowing that the Government has no alternative but to meet them? </para>

                        <para>- That is so, but I have yet to hear that a minor department is able to control the Commonwealth Government or the Commonwealth Parliament. I think that honorable senators will find that the explanation of the increased provision for rents  is  that the money  is  to go to wealthy individuals  in  the capital  cities  from whom the Government  is  renting buildings instead of erecting  its  own structures  in  Canberra. In  view  of the growing volume of unemployment  in this  country, the Government's works programme  in Canberra  could well be expanded as a means of providing employment and of saving some of the money now paid in rent. The £545,000 that the Government  will  pay on rented premises this year would  go  a long way towards meeting the interest bill on capital raised to erect public buildings  in  Canberra. </para>

                    <para>.- Provision is made in Division 65 for the Forestry Branch of the Department of the Interior. The vote  this  year for the branch  is  £104,000. Certain details of the expenditure are given in the schedule, but I should like to know from the Minister representing the Minister for the Interior the scope of the activities of the branch. Is the branch engaged only in scientific experiments to determine the most suitable varieties of timbers that can be grown  in  this country so that that information may be passed on to the States which carry out the propagation? We know, of course, that the Commonwealth has some forests of its own in the Australian Capital Territory, but I should  like  to know whether there is any Commonwealth afforestation activity in the other territories. I believe that the sum provided in the Estimates  is  totally inadequate. Experience has shown that forestry work is ideal for the relief of unemployment. It-  is  work that does not lend itself to the use of mechanical equipment, and for that reason largely manual labour  is  required. Unemployment  is  now a hard fact  in this  country,  and  I believe that some millions of pounds should be allocated to the Forestry Branch so that useful work may be provided for many of the men who are now seeking  jobs. Our natural forests hare been sadly depleted. Our red gum hardwood is almost extinct and our iron bark forests are gradually being used up. Pine timber for building purposes is becoming scarcer. There is a wide field of work open to the Forestry Branch, and I regret that the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Kent Hughes)</inline> has not availed himself of the opportunity to extend the activities of his forestry workers. There will always be a. big demand in this country for softwoods and hardwoods for building purposes and for furniture making. I hope that the Minister representing the Minis;ter for the Interior will be able to give me some information about the activities of the Forestry Branch. </para>

However, if any honorable senator wants more details than I am able to provide now, I shall be only too pleased to obtain the information for him. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Benn</inline> has complained that the vote for the Forestry Branch is inadequate. The provision is largely for the Australian Forestry School. The Government has done quite a lot. to assist in the training of students. It has also extended its own pine plantations in the Australian Capital Territory. As honorable senators are aware, afforestation is largely a State responsibility, and most of the State governments accept it as such. I have inspected the excellent afforestation work that has been undertaken in the southeast of South Australia, under the direction of the State department. The Commonwealth has co-operated with the State governments and has made a practical approach to this problem. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Benn</inline> may be interested to know that in the Australian Capital Territory no fewer than 15,000 acres have been planted in pines of various kinds. </para>

                    <para>. - I propose to discuss the proposed vote for " Division 63 - Meteorological Branch. The methods adopted by those engaged in weather forecasting in Australia have a very important effect on the results achieved. Honorable senators will agree that in a great primary producing country like Australia it is of the utmost importance that our weather service should be as efficient as it possibly can be. I fear that our meteorological officers are still using the methods of securing information about weather conditions and rainfall that were in vogue at- the turn of the century, if not from the very earliest years of settlement of this country. They rely upon the comparatively slow telegraph service provided by the Postal Department for reports about rainfall and weather conditions. Frequently information about rainfall and weather conditions is not made public until long after the rain has fallen and the weather conditions have passed on to other areas. That is especially true in respect of the outlying parts of Queensland. There is room for better liaison between the Meteorological Branch and the up-to-the-minute weather services provided by the Department of Civil Aviation. The latter department uses the most rapid communication facilities because it is essential that air pilots should have accurate forecasts of approaching weather conditions. Pilots and navigators flying aircraft in Queensland must know whether cyclonic conditions or rainstorms are developing along the routes which they traverse. Air pilots are in radio communication with one another and with airports on their route and have prior notice of changes in weather conditions. An appropriate link should he established between the Department of Civil Aviation and the Meteorological Branch of the Department of the Interior to ensure that the most up-to-date information shall be made public. The officers of the Meteorological Branch should be asked to indicate whether it is possible to improve upon the present system under which rainfall and weather information is published daily instead of at more frequent intervals. A better weather service should be provided for the benefit of those engaged in the land industries generally. </para>

                <para>Under Division 63, provision of £200,000 has been made for "Meteorological instruments and apparatus ". Expenditure on that item last year amounted to £216,000. These are large amounts of money. I should like to know whether they are to be regarded as of a recurring nature. Are the instruments and apparatus being purchased on the time-payment plan, and may we look forward to the time when the item will disappear from the Estimates? </para>
                <para>Whilst I am dealing with the Meteorological Branch, I should like to say a few words about a very fine man who has given a lifetime of service to weather forecasting in Queensland - &gt;Mr. Inigo Jones. At one time <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jones</inline> was given a small grant by the Commonwealth - if my memory serves me aright, it was about £500, which is a mere bagatelle - but for some inexplicable reason the grant was withdrawn on the recommendation of an officer of the Meteorological Branch. It seems that there is a certain degree of professional jealousy among those who profess to forecast weather conditions. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jones</inline> has never posed as a master of the art of weather forecasting, nor, indeed, has any officer on the payroll of the Meteorological Branch done so. All of them have made errors. It can be said in favour of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jones,</inline> however, that he is a highly intellectual man who has devoted a lifetime to research in this field of study. He has rendered a unique service to the primary producers of Queensland by providing for their benefit long-range forecasts based on a system which he himself has developed. It is true that his system has been subjected to criticism; but what man who has evolved a system of any kind which advances the interests of his country has not been criticized, and even, at times, abused? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jones</inline> has earned the confidence and goodwill of primary producers all over Australia. He receives a measure of financial support from journals dedicated to farm and station interests throughout Australia. All political parties represented in the Queensland Parliament have for many years approved the payment to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jones</inline> of a small grant to encourage him to continue his researches. At any time a student in this field, or in any other field of endeavour, may make a discovery which is of world-wide importance. Who knows whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jones,</inline> with his great ability and extraordinary powers of concentration, will not stumble on some ne&gt;. discovery which will completely alter the existing system upon which weather forecasting is based ? Men of his type should be encouraged to continue their researches. Surely, out of a proposed vote of £469,000 the Meteorological Branch could provide a grant of £500 a year to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jones</inline> to encourage him to continue his studies in long-range forecasting. I commend that suggestion to the Government. When I was a member of the Queensland Parliament the members of all political parties paid a very high tribute to the excellence of the work done by him. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jones's</inline> weather reports are regarded as a notable contribution to the weather literature of the world. He is in regular communication with weather experts in the United States of America, Europe and in almost all overseas countries. He conducts his re- searches at the Crohamhurst observatory, at Beerwah, 50 or 60 miles north of Brisbane. Men of his type are rare in the community and should be given every encouragement. Research workers need, money to establish their laboratories and equip them with instruments to enable them to test their theories. I urge the Government to consider the restoration to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jones</inline> of the payment formerly made to him. </para>

It has been the practice of that department to collect rent from the tenants of resumed properties for considerable periods before effecting final settlements, and to pay to the vendors interest at the rate of only 3 per cent, on such 'amounts. I know of an instance in which the owner of a property that was resumed collected the rents for many months after resumption and paid the money to the department. Although rentals equivalent to from 10 per cent, to 12 per cent, of the capital value are derived from specialized dwelling houses and premises that are occupied by doctors and dentists, the department pays the vendor only 3 per cent, interest when the amount of settlement is finally agreed upon. This matter received attention during the regime of the former Labour Government, and I hope that it will be rectified by the present Government, because the present practice is most inequitable. </para>

As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> has already pointed out, the proposed vote for this item is £65,000. Although the vote fo:- 1951-52 was £25,000, the actual expenditure on the item during the last financial year was £42,425. As the proposed voteis much greater than was the expenditure during the last financial year, I should like the Minister to explain the reason for the disparity. </para>

                    <para>.- I shall refer to "Division 62, Electoral Branch ". The proposed vote for salaries and payments in the nature of salary is more than 20 per cent, greater than was the expenditure under that heading during the last financial year. Does the Minister for Shipping and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> contend that the increase is due solely to increases of the basic wage? Have the salaries of officers in receipt of more than £2,000 a year been increased by about 20 per cent.? The proposed vote of £460,000 exceeds by £118,616, or almost 35 per cent., the expenditure during the last financial year. Has additional staff been engaged by the Electoral Branch? I submit that the engagement of additional staff could not be justified on the ground that an election may be held next year, because one was held only last year. I should like the Minister to explain how the enormous increase of expenditure by the Electoral Branch can be justified. </para>

                        <para>- I assume that the Minister means that the increased cost of the Electoral Branch is attributable solely to increased salaries payable to officers who were members of the branch last year; in other words, that there has been an increase of salaries by almost 35 per cent. in one year. How does the Minister reconcile his statement with the fact that the proposed vote of £292,000 is about 20 per cent. greater than was the expenditure of £256,220 under this heading during the last financial year? The Government has promised to curb inflation, but it will not be halted if salaries are to be increased so rapidly. I am prepared to concede that Commonwealth electoral officers were underpaid for many years compared with State electoral officers, but as that anomaly was removed about two years ago, the Minister cannot now claim that the increase is justified on that score alone. Is there another reason for the increased expenditure on the Electoral Branch ? </para>

My remarks could refer equally to the proposed vote for Australian representation in the United Kingdom. They arise from the procedure that is adopted at Australia House in London in relation to Australian elections. A friend of mine who was in England at the time of the last Australian general election has told me that progressive figures were posted for about three or four days, but that the final results were not published. I do not know whether it is the responsibility of the Electoral Branch or of the Australian High Commissioner in London to publish at Australia House the final results of Australian elections. Many Australians may be in England when Australian elections are being held, and it is only right that the final figures in relation to all divisions and States should be posted at Australia House. Many Australians will visit England in connexion with the Coronation celebrations next year. </para>

                    <para>. - I shall direct my attention to the proposed vote of £104,000 for the Forestry Branch - Division 65. I am tremendously interested in the subject of reafforestation in Australia, to which I do not consider that we have devoted sufficient attention. The wonderful forest areas of this country should be preserved for all time. Recently I had an opportunity to visit Palm Valley, a few miles out from Alice Springs, the scenic beauty of which compares favorably with that of the great valleys of the United States of America that have been advertised extensively. I consider that the Forestry Branch, should take steps to reserve large areas of land adjacent to our magnificent forests. I have been somewhat alarmed by the statement of the Minister for Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hasluck)</inline> that mining leases are to be granted in relation to lands that were formerly native reserves in the Northern Territory. There are magnificent forests on some of those lands. I consider that we should preserve not only their magnificent natural beauty, but also the timber that, is on them. I should he glad if the attention of the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Kent Hughes)</inline> was drawn to this very important matter. There should be national parks throughout Australia, as there are in other parts of the world, so that places of beauty might be preserved for the Australian people. Too often have we mined the country for our immediate needs, without any thought for the future. I am afraid that in allowing mining leases in native reserves, great devastation of beautiful forest lands will result. </para>

Some sixteen departments occupy non-public buildings, and the Commonwealth pays rent for such buildings. It is common knowledge that, at the moment, in all capital cities there is a great dearth of- office accommodation for private enterprise. Professional and  business  people experience difficulty in securing proper accommodation. Yet everywhere Commonwealth departments are occupying valuable space in private buildings. It is necessary, of course, for Commonwealth staffs to be housed, but it would be much more convenient, from the point of view of the public, if the Commonwealth offices, which are now scattered all over the capital cities were concentrated in 'one central place. I should like the Minister for Shipping and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> to indicate what the Government has in mind regarding the erection of public buildings, in the various capital cities particularly, not only to provide for the convenience of the staffs of Commonwealth departments and to meet future expansion, but also to make a notable contribution to the architecture of our cities. I think it behoves the Commonwealth, in its approach to such buildings, to set a standard which, both architecturally and aesthetically, will accord with the dignity of the Commonwealth itself. 1 should like the Minister to indicate whether the Commonwealth contemplates taking staffs from these scattered buildings that are at present rented from private individuals, and proposes to press ahead with permanent establishments of the kind to which I have referred. From the viewpoint of people in business, I cannot urge this matter too strongly. </para>

                <para class="block">Whilst there is 'no doubt that some men have not pulled their full weight in the building industry and have not given a full' day's work for a day's pay, 1" think that it would be a slander of those engaged in the industry to give such criticism any kind of general application. The statement may be true of some workers, but I reject the idea that it is true of the bulk of those engaged in the building industry. The building workers have had their difficulties. For instance, the unavailability of materials has obliged men to sit down and await the arrival of materials. That position no longer obtains, due to the fact that people, for reasons which I do not propose to discuss at the moment, are not prepared to embark on home building on an extensive scale. </para>
                <para>I put it to the Minister that now that the building industry is crying out for some stimulus, the opportunity exists for the Commonwealth to make up its mind to embark upon the very long delayed work of providing permanent public buildings particularly in the capital  citieS.  The slack in employment might well he taken up in this way. I think it is common knowledge that even members of this Parliament occupy rooms in private office buildings throughout Australia. They should be grouped in a suitable public building, with proper facilities. lt seems to me altogether derogatory of the dignity of the Parliament that its members should be scattered in buildings of a private nature, many of which are completely unsuitable from the point of view of the standards that should be set for members of this Parliament. </para>
                <para>I should like the Minister to take this suggestion in the spirit in which I proffer it. I appreciate that Commonwealth departments expanded so rapidly during (he war that it was necessary for them to intrude into a sphere normally occupied by private industry and to crowd people out. It is important that the Commonwealth should give a lead to industry, which is already generating new momentum. I hope that when such buildings are planned they will be looked at not from a cold, utilitarian point of view but as buildings that are aesthetically desirable and in keeping with the dignity of the Commonwealth. </para>

I know that the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Kent Hughes)</inline> has already given attention to it, but as the Government considers that the housing of the people, and the building of schools, hospitals, and structures of  a  like nature should be given a high priority, I am not optimistic that any -headway can be made during the current financial year along the lines suggested by the honorable senator. The slackening-off in employment in the building industries during the months of July, August and September was only temporary. With men and materials readily available, the housing and other programmes of the Government will fully occupy us during this year and will, of course, be given a higher priority than that accorded to office accommodation. All that I am able to say is that the Government appreciates the difficulties and the inconvenience experienced by private individuals who have leased office accommodation to the Commonwealth. I assure the committee that .the suggestion made by the Leader of the Opposition concerning the artistic approach to such buildings will be considered. The question of the erection of permanent office accommodation also will be considered in its order of priority as soon as the Government is satisfied that men, materials and money are available for such works to be carried out. </para>

I presume that this is a service for the protection of weekly wages between banks and departmental offices. It seems to me to be an extremely high figure. I ask the Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner)</inline> whether this service is conducted by certain firms in the capital cities. I understand that in Melbourne a firm by the name of Mayne Nickless Limited performs this function, and that something of the kind is also done in Sydney. I take it that it is necessary to convey wages and salaries amounting to £3,716,000 during the year, that being the total amount of salaries and wages to be paid by the department. Presumably a great deal of that sum will be disbursed outside the capital cities. The provision of £10,S50 for the year is equivalent to approximately £210 a week. If the service is confined to one or two capital cities of the Commonwealth, it seems to me that it is a very expensive one. I should think that an old armoured car and a driver could do the job much more cheaply. </para>

I have not details of it at the moment, but I understand that the system is in operation in the main capital cities of the Commonwealth. It would be difficult for me to say, at the moment, whether or not it would be cheaper to have this service performed by government vehicles. Although I have not had an opportunity to examine the detailed costs, I should imagine that there was a great deal to be said for the employment of a service such as this by the Department of Works, which has a very large 'pay-roll, and a very large number of employees in metropolitan areas. The service rendered includes the collection of the payroll 'from the bank and its distribution to the various works. </para>

                    it is necessary to examine the procedure involved. In the first place, the approval for the works is requested by the department that wishes to have the repairs and maintenance carried out. The honorable senator mentioned particularly the Department of Immigration. The recommendation of that department has to survive examination by an interdepartmental committee. That committee has then to make a recommendation to a sub-committee of Cabinet. In other words, individual works are crutinized  on two  accasions  by authorities outside the department for which they are to be carried out.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline>
                    asked why the proposed vote was greater than the vote for the last financial year. That question cannot be answered simply, because figures in respect of three financial years are involved. At the beginning of each financial year, certain works remain uncompleted from the previous financial year. Incomplete works at the commencement of the last financial year totalled about £25,000. Incomplete works at the close of the year are expected to total £93,000. The cost of works which are not completed, from year to year, is the main cause of variations in the Estimates of departments. It is true that the immigration programme has been modified but the hostels have to be maintained and kept in repair. The amount shown for this purpose will be expended on hostels in all States of the Commonwealth. Thy amount in respect of each hostel is not great. The biggest expenditure, £35,000, will take place at Bonegilla. Expenditure at other hostels ranges from £2,000 to £20,000. By and large, the total is an amalgamation of comparatively small items. Honorable senators will realize that the hostels must be kept in repair. However, K
m-- - a pickle makes a muckle " and the expenditure of comparatimely  small amounts on a number of hostels will make up the proposed vote.

                        <para>- A lot of other departments are also concerned. Probably, many buildings which require alteration have been rented by the Government. When the Government first rents a building considerable alterations are probably required in order that it may be made suitable for its new pur- pose. In such circumstances the expenditure of considerable funds would be required. As the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline> and I have already mentioned, the Government would save a considerable sum of money by having its own buildings instead of renting them. Now that there is a pool of unemployed, the Government has a golden opportunity to construct its own offices and so avoid the necessity to spend money on the renovation of buildings which it only rents. Could the Minister for National Development inform me what proportion of the proposed vote for maintenance and repairs will be expended on buildings owned by the Commonwealth and what proportion will be expended on rented buildings? </para>

                    (New South Wales - Minister for National Development) | 5.39].  -  It is difficult for me to give an immediate answer to the honorable senator's question. By and large, the proposed expenditure will not be upon rented buildings. In respect of the Department of National Development, for instance, the greater part of the proposed expenditure relates to the old war-time factories at St. Mary's and other places which are under the administration of my department. The expenditure will not only be required in order to effect repairs to buildings, but will be required for roadways, sewerage and other facilities for the purpose of making these buildings available for use as commercial factories. A similar state of affairs would apply in other departments. The proposed vote for the
                </para>
                <para class="block">Department of the Interior will be expended on Commonwealth-owned offices, meteorological buildings and war workers' cottages, new maintenance work on the quarantine station at North Head, New South Wales, and on other buildings which are Commonwealth property. I cannot say to what extent the expenditure will be incurred in respect of rented properties. However, I would hazard a guess that such expenditure would represent a minor proportion of the total vote. The Government is not different from private individuals in that it tries to avoid expenditure on some one else's property. I should say that the overwhelming proportion of the vote would be expended on our own buildings. </para>

                    <para>. -  I was interested in the remarks of the Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner)</inline> in relation to Division 69, item 15  -  Immigration. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> drew attention to the fact that whilst £224,208 was expended last year on this item, the Government proposes to expend £258,000 during the current year. The Minister quite correctly stated that at the beginning of each financial year there were certain works which had not been completed during the previous year. I should like to ascertain the actual increased expenditure which the Government contemplates in relation to this item during the current financial year. According to the Minister, the amount of £258,000, which appears in the Estimates, includes £25,000 in respect of buildings that were incomplete at the end of the last financial year. The deduction of £25,000 from £258,000 leaves £233,000. But if the work to be commenced this year which will be incomplete at the end of this year can be valued, at £93,000, as estimated by the Minister, then that amount must be added to the sum of <inline font-style="italic">£233,000</inline> in order to arrive at the value of new work to be commenced this year. In other words, the cost of the work to be commenced this year would be £326,000, not £258,000. Having regard to the decrease in immigration, a 50 per cent, increase in maintenance work on buildings connected with immigration seems to be extraordinary. If the flow of immigration has to be stemmed, I should expect that there would  be  far less need for repairs and maintenance on the buildings connected with the reception of immigrants and their distribution of employment, not more. On the basis of the answer which the Minister for National Development gave  to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> it would appear that additional work to the value of £326,000 is contemplated. </para>

                        <para>- The committee was discussing earlier the effect of the increase of the vote for repairs and maintenance, and I have been able to obtain some more information on the matters that were under discussion. The point that I raised and upon which the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline> sought some clarification does not alter the fact that the votes for the year are as printed. When the year began, uncompleted works were valued at £25,431, and new proposals were estimated to cost £310,863.  It  is estimated that  at  the close of this financial year, works estimated to cost £92,938 will be uncompleted, giving a total amount of £243,356 for the year. Administrative charges total £14,604. If honorable senators follow those figures through, they will reach the total of £258,000 that is shown in the Estimates. The Estimates for this year for work to be done for the Department of Immigration are £33,000 higher than last year. The reason is that although the immigration programme has shown a decline, the establishments are still in existence. They are expensive buildings to maintain. Some of them are old and some were of a temporary nature. People are still living in them. They must be kept in good order and condition, not only because they are occupied now, but also because they will be wanted while the immigration programme is continued. Honorable senators will be able to study this matter in the correct perspective if they remember that in recent years about £20,000,000 has been spent on the provision of hostels for immigrants. That large capital expenditure has been distributed throughout Australia. </para>

                    <para>. -  I wish to ask the Minister a question 'with regard to government policy in letting contracts for the Department of Works. During the war and in the post-war years, governments of the day representing both parties necessarily adopted the cost-plus system. It has not been satisfactory and has encouraged inefficiency. I believe that the present Government has attempted to get away from the cost-plus system and has adopted a modified system under which a contractor tenders at a price and is allowed a certain profit above his tender. I am not sure whether that is correct, and perhaps the Minister will inform me on the point. Does the Government not consider it desirable to get away from the cost-plus system altogether and revert to the practice of requiring a contractor to submit a specific price and then take the risk that is involved as a normal business venture? </para>

                    <para>. -  I cannot give detailed information in reply to the questions that have been asked by honorable senators. I can give information offhand only in general outline. With regard to work that is being done through the Department of Works, there has been  a  change of policy. So far as possible, it is done by contract instead of by day labour or under the cost-plus system. I am informed that the change is working successfully. Contractors are now prepared to fix a price and enter into firm contracts without the costplus provision that has led to much extravagant and uneconomic work, as honorable senators on both sides of the chamber will agree. I cannot answer <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robertson</inline> with any degree of certainty. The honorable senator has mentioned a specific contract for certain fittings and it is practically impossible to give information offhand on that matter when such a great volume of work is in hand. If the honorable senator requires the information I am certain that I can obtain it from the department and give it to her. Ry and large, the principle that is followed by the Department of Works  i3  not different from that of other government departments in that all commercial transactions are handled, as far as possible, on a basis of public tender. The department always invites tenders for materials in the same way as it invites tenders for contracts. </para>

                        <para>- That being the case, I assume that the Minister anticipates that the contract system will be much more expensive than the system under which the department was previously working and that allowance is being made for that increased expenditure. I believe that the department will find that the former system was better for jobs involving small repairs and alterations. The department has an army of administrative officers. It cannot do without them.. If a contract is let, the job must be inspected. After taking into account the cost of advertising, inspections, reports and other supervision, the jobs will be found to be much more costly under .the new system. In each State the department has inspectors and overseers. Some very competent men are engaged on jobs for the Department of Works. Can the Minister justify calling for tenders for small jobs and repairs so that they may be done by contract? I asked the Minister previously whether he could give details of the proposed expenditure of'£800,000 on repairs and maintenance. Can he indicate how much is to be spent on replacements and on new accessories, including typewriters, machinery, desks and furniture, and how much is to be spent on repairs and alterations? On his own admission, the contract system will be more expensive. Can the Minister give details of repairs and maintenance work, other than capital works, that have been done more cheaply than it would have been done with the staff at the disposal of his department? </para>

The Auditor-General has also drawn attention to the lack of reconciliation in the stock-sheets of some hostels. In fact, this lack of reconciliation in stock-sheets has been found in the accounts of several departments. I should like to know first what steps are being taken to reduce or eliminate the accumulating losses on hostels and day-labour camps, and, secondly, what is being done to ensure that stock-sheets shall be reconciled every year. </para>

Loss after loss is being suffered on messes throughout the Commonwealth - and I use the word " messes " in a double sense. Surely no Parliament could sit idly by in the face of such criticism by the Auditor-General. One normally expects messes to be self-supporting. For instance, Navy, Army and Air Force messes arc self -supporting. I can well imagine the hideous cry that would arise from the Labour party if service messes were to incur successive losses. I hope that the Minister is in a position to proffer some hope to the committee that these losses will be extinguished in the next twelve months. </para>

I suggest, therefore, that when all other matters appertaining to the Department of Works have been dealt with, further consideration of the proposed vote be postponed until I can obtain the information from the department and make it available to honorable senators. </para>

                        <para>- I said that the policy of the department was to have its work done by contract. That policy has been operating satisfactorily. It does not mean, however, that there will be no more cost-plus jobs any more than it means that a maintenance staff will no longer be required. There are some localities and some circumstances in which contracts cannot be obtained. For instance, it is difficult to have work done by contract in the Northern Territory and in other outback areas. In certain circumstances it is difficult to secure contracts even in the metropolitan areas, but the work must be done. We believe that if it cannot be done the best way, that is by contract, it has to be done the second best way. </para>

                    <para>. - In view of the interest of all honorable senators in the subject of social services consideration of the proposed vote of £2,146,000 for the Department of Social Services provides an opportunity for discussion which can hardly be allowed to pass. As the Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner),</inline> who formerly was Minister for Social Services, is now representing that Minister in this chamber,. I expect that he will take a particularly keen interest in this discussion. I should like to take his mind back to 1949 when members of the Liberal party and the Australian Country party were wooing the electors. In the course of that election campaign those parties made certain specific promises. One was that if elected, they would put value back into pensions. The exact wording of the promise contained in the joint policy speech was - </para>

                    <para>We will, much move importantly, increase their true value by increasing their purchasing power. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">Does the Government claim that purchasing power has been put back into pensions? Clearly the Government could not put value back into pensions without increasing the purchasing power of money generally. Therefore, the promise to restore the purchasing value of pensions, implicitly and explicitly bound the Government to put value back into the currency. I should like to know therefore, whether the Minister claims that that promise has been redeemed. A second promise made to the electors in  1949  was that there would be submitted to them in  1952  for their approval or disapproval, a scheme for the abolition of the means test. I concede that when that promise was made, the then Opposition parties had in mind that, in the ordinary course of events, the Parliament that was about to be elected would not expire until  1952.  However, there was a double dissolution in  1951.  Nevertheless, it was clearly in the mind of every body who heard the  1949  election promise that, in  .1952  an opportunity would be given to the people to express their approval or disapproval of some scheme for the abolition of the means test. Such a referendum could be taken in conjunction with forthcoming Senate elections, which could be held if necessary, before the end of this year; but we have not heard of any such proposal. Arc the figures "  1952  " contained in the election promise to which I have referred now to be construed as  "1954",  and if so by what process of reasoning are they to be so construed? Has the Government evolved, or has it under consideration, a plan to abolish the means test? If so have any conclusions been reached and will the electors be given any information about that plan during  1952? </para>

                <para class="block">McKenna). Obviously the honorable senator's remarks raise considerations of the highest political importance, and I make no excuse for saying that I am not prepared to answer them now. However I think it is only right to say that much, time and consideration have been given to the very important problem of the means test, both while I held the Social Services portfolio, and since it has been held by the present Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Townley).</inline> Since the present Leader of the Opposition relinquished the portfolio of Social Services a special section has been established in the department to consider all the factors that are inherent in the provision of pensions free of the means test. I say no more than that a great deal of work has been done by the officers of that section. A decision on the problem of providing pensions free of the means test will be announced by the Government. It is not appropriate that it be announced by an individual Minister on an occasion such as this. </para>
                <para>Opposition senators have stressed the need to put value back into the pension payments. Surely, as the Leader of the Opposition himself indicated, that matter is completely bound up with, the general economic condition of the community. During the two and a half years that this Government has been in office it has had to weather the hazards of a substantial inflationary wave. We believe that the tide has now turned and that we are getting back to a stable economy. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator hopes that there will be unemployment. He and his colleagues might win a few votes by their attempts to scare the people into believing that unemployment is rife in the community when, in fact, its incidence is very slight; but not many people will be influenced by their attempts to engender a fear of unemployment. Measured by reasonable standards, we can fairly claim that the pensioners in the community have been very well looked after by this Government. When honorable senators make comparisons they must also fix a standard by which to make their comparisons. I have not the precise figures in my mind,  but I believe that whilst the pension does not bear quite the same relation to the C series index figure as it did in the early fifties, when the Government made its first pension increase, having regard to the troubled conditions that have existed in our economy during the last two and a half years, the Government has done all that it possibly could do to assist the pensioners. I am proud of its record in the field of social services. </para>

                    <para>.- Provision of £2,500 has been made in Division 92b for " Services of Registrars of Births and Deaths ". Expenditure on that item last year amounted to £9,994. Many aged persons who apply for social services benefits have great difficulty in obtaining birth certificates. Some of them have no idea 6f the date upon which they were born. Does the reduced provision indicate that the department had simplified its procedures and that the services of registrars of births and deaths would be availed of much less in the future than they had been in the past? It is unfair that applicants for social services benefits should have to pay search fees to a State registrar of births and deaths for birth certificates with which to support their claims. It is true that the fee charged is not high, but even the payment of such a small amount embarrasses many of the poorest people of the community. I should like the Minister to indicate whether the reduced provision this year indicates that a more simplified procedure has been adopted by the department. </para>

Would it not be possible for banks and post offices to reduce considerably the charges made for such services? </para>

Temporary employees do not enjoy the status and privileges that are granted to permanent ' employees. Many of these so-called temporary and casual employees are, in reality, permanent-temporary employees. An injustice is apparently being done to a large number of employees by their retention for long periods - many of them until they reach the retiring age - in a temporary capacity. I realize that permanent employees have to pass certain qualifying examinations and that certain classes of work are best performed by temporary employees ; but it is apparent from the magnitude of the proposed votes that a huge staff of temporary employees is maintained by the department on a semipermanent basis. I know that other governments have followed this practice; but that does not excuse this Government of responsibility in the matter. Temporary employees who competently perform the duties allotted to them should be given an opportunity to secure permanent employment, particularly in a department such as this, the staff of which is increasing as each year goes by. </para>

                        <para>- There is justifiable dissatisfaction amongst the recipients of social services payments, who consider that those benefits are cancelled out by increased prices and restrictions. How does the Minister intend to ensure more equitable treatment of those 'beneficiaries, who are being penalized bv persons outside the jurisdiction of the Parliament and who are, for all practical purposes, a law unto themselves? Although the Parliament decides the rates of age and invalid pensions, persons outside the jurisdiction of the Parliament fix the purchasing power of pensions and of wages. The pensioners should be protected, because they are unable to protect themselves. The Minister stated that all aspects of the matter would be considered. That sounded all right, but the statement did not contain any substance. </para>

I  find in the debates upon this subject that there are too many crows to prey upon the carrion associated with the worst of social rescue. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline> has referred to the value of the £1 and to a general Government proposal in relation to the means test. Although the proposed vote for the Department of Social Services is only £2,146,000, that department will administer a total expenditure of £164,000,000 of the taxpayers' money during this financial year, which is about one-sixth of the total budget of the Commonwealth . </para>

                        <para>- Even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> will probably realize after next July that the taxpayers' outlook in this matter should not be ignored. A capital investment of about £6,000 or £7,000 would be necessary in order to produce an annuity equivalent to the amount of the age pension. Those honorable senators opposite, who make such disparaging references to these Estimates, should take off their coats and endeavour to earn some of the money which must be' provided for social services. The taxpayers, who provide that money, take off their coats to earn their living and provide this additional amount for social services. That section of the community, generous as it is in supporting the pensions, wishes from time to time to remind the " heelers " that it is work that provides money to buy goods and services. A person from the State from which the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline> made his exodus some three and a half years ago, to be seen in it on only infrequent occasions since then, last week advocated, as a cure for incipient unemployment, that we should reduce the hours of work to 30 hours a week. He also advocated that wages should be maintained at the existing rate. That is the solution which the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues suggest of the problem of the decreasing value of the £1, to which the honorable senator referred when discussing these Estimates. That matter has only to be expressed to be recognized as doddering nonsense.  I  ask the Senate to return to adult speaking. </para>

                <para>The Government has been challenged on its Estimates in relation to pensions. This department, for which it is proposed to vote £2,146,000 to-night, is responsible for administering moneys which aggregate £164,000,000 for the  year. The age pension is now £3 7s. 6d. a week, compared with £2 2s. 6d. a week upon which, the Chifley Government rigidly stood in December, 1949. That Government did not offer one penny increase of the pension until the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley,</inline> for whom honorable senators opposite so often feign admiration, was driven during the 1951 general election campaign to offer a bribe in the form of a 10s. a week increase of pensions. He had been goaded into doing so by the petty urges who go out battling for votes. Honorable senators will remember that at that time the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> said, in effect, " Pensioners of Australia: I am not up for auction, but if you re-elect the Government which I lead, you may rest assured that social justice will be done. Immediately the inflationary forces, which we inherited and which have driven costs to an unprecedented level, are overcome, pensions will be overhauled ". In the first budget introduced after the return of the Government, which has been childishly referred to by the Opposition as a " horror " budget, provision was made for pensions to be increased by 10s. a week. The latest budget of the Government provides for pensions to be increased by 7s. 6d. a week. How well I recall the timid and vacillating speech to which the Leader of the Opposition treated us in the Senate after the general election of December, 1949. Do honorable senators recollect how he impishly tried to give an impression of the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> on the stage as an old man, not knowing which way to turn ? </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> introduced heat into a very fair discussion. After all, the Estimates show that, on the administrative side, there has been a substantial increase of expenditure on social services. In my opinion, the reason for that increase is clear to everybody. There has been a substantial rise in the cost of living, which is reflected in the Estimates now before us. </para>

                        <para>- I was about to discuss the point raised by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna),</inline> when he asked whether the Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner)</inline> or the Government proposes to do anything about the promise to make the value of pensions at least the equivalent of their value when this Government took office. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> stated that, in his opinion, the pension rate is adequate. He pointed out that the provision of pensions imposes a hardship on the taxpayers, that pensioners are very well cared for, and that pension rates should not be increased. If the Minister reiterates those opinions, our questions will be answered. If he states that he supports the opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> that pensioners are now very well cared for, that the taxpayers are paying too much to provide pensions, that the costs of social services are too great, and that the recipients of pensions should feel that they have obtained all that they are entitled to obtain, we shall know where we stand. But, of course, the Minister will not say those things. It, therefore, is necessary for one of the supporters of the Government to tell us, quite frankly, that, in his view, the taxpayers have contributed sufficiently towards social services and that pensioners cannot expect improved conditions. The Opposition wishes to know whether that is the view of the Government, or whether the Government believes the truth of the promises it made more than two years ago. It said then that it would put real value into pensions. As the Estimates show, the cost of living has risen considerably. The cost of administration of this department- </para>

                <para>The matter that has been raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> is the crux of the point that I wish to make. It is apparent from the Estimates that there has been a substantial increase of the costs of administration of the Department of Social Services. That increase has not been reflected in the amount paid out to the recipient* of pensions. I note that provision i.» made for certain commission charges made by banks and post offices, and I should like the Minister to explain the nature of those charges. I point out that there has been a substantial rise in the cost of living of the people administering the department. That rise, of course, has not been reflected in the standard of living enjoyed by the recipients of the various pensions. I ask the Minister whether it is not possible to utilize some of the additional money which it proposes to expend on administrative purposes to give the pensioners a little more. Does the Government accept the philosophy of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> who has claimed that the pensioners are already receiving more than they deserve and that the taxpayers cannot afford to pay them any more? Does the Government believe that we should give more consideration to the taxpayers and less to the pensioners as was suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright?</inline> Does the Minister believe that the Government should adopt that attitude or that it should endeavour to fulfil its promises? </para>

Does the Government propose to add to its already heavy undertakings by controlling births and deaths or is there another reason for the decrease? </para>

                    <para>. - In my opinion, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> properly invited attention to the fact that the taxpayers provided the wherewithall for expenditure on social services. But who are the taxpayers? Obviously, they are largely those workers who are engaged in essential, productive services. All other persons are non-producing and for all practical purposes, the workers engaged in essential productive services carry the whole of society on their backs, including honorable senators present. If social services were to be increased the recipients would still receive only a portion of what they had contributed during their working lives towards the upkeep of this institution, the armed forces, the police and all others who come within the category of non-producers. So those who receive pensions are not paid anything to which they are not entitled. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Actually, they are entitled to a great deal more. When I acted as an advocate before arbitration tribunals I always apologized for the modesty of the claims made by those who sought an increase in wages. To increase pensions is simply to give a little more in terms of inflated currency, not in terms of commodities, to those who have produced the goods that are essential to this community. If these people had received all that they had produced they would not be in need of pensions now. It seems to me that most honorable senators opposite believe that these people are given something in excess of that to which they are entitled. Nothing of the sort occurs. Unfortunately, too many people believe that that is true. It could be. proved beyond all shadow of doubt that the majority of people who receive social services benefits merely have returned to them a few crumbs of the loaf that they made themselves. </para>

                    <para>. - The Senate is discussing the proposed vote of £114,000 for the central administration of the Department of Social Services. If the Government were to abolish the means test, as advocated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> during his election campaign, would the administrative costs of the Department of Social Services not be reduced? For instance, inspectors must ascertain whether applicants are eligible for pensions. If that action were rendered unnecessary a considerable amount of money would be saved. I have here a pamphlet which was circulated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> prior to his election to this chamber. In it he advocates the highest possible living standard: generous help for home ownership; production to prevent inflation; lower taxation and social services without the means test. Apparently the Government does not" believe in implementing these promises. People were told by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> that if they worked harder they would help to curb inflation, yet he has not done the work that he was sent to this chamber to do. I ask the Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner)</inline> whether the abolition of the means test would not reduce administrative costs and whether the Government intends to make social services available without the application of the means test as it promised to do during the general election campaign. </para>

I asked him not to regard at least one of them very lightly, because, at the moment, the Estimates for the Department for Social Services, which is a department with vast responsibilities, are under consideration. This is the one opportunity for the Opposition to traverse the activities and examine the future of that department. "When I, as Leader of the Opposition, put a question to the Minister on whether a specific promise in relation to a specific year is to be honoured in that year I, as an individual, do not ask that question of the Minister us .an individual. I ask it of the Government on behalf of the Opposition in this chamber. This is an important matter in which many people are vitally interested. It is not right for the Minister to seek to evade it altogether. After three years of office he has been asked, "Does the Government propose, in 1952, to submit any kind of plan for the abolition of the means test to the people ? " I could understand the Minister saying that he was not prepared at this stage to tell honorable senators the details of mi oh a. scheme. I .could understand his saying that the time was not opportune or that a statement of that nature would be announced by another person, perhaps in another place. But I think it is proper for the Minister to give a direct answer to the question, " Does the Government propose to put any plan to the people this year for their approval in relation to the abolition of the means test?" </para>

T do not claim that the abolition of the means test is the most important problem that faces the Department of Social Services. I think that the needs of pensioners should be considered first. Discarding all comparisons with the basic wage and taking the best index that Australia has of the increasing cost of living, the C series index, if regard had been paid to the increased cost of living since this Government took office, the amount of pension paid to-day would be, not £3 10s. a week but more than £4 a week. I shall make no further comment on that matter but I press the Minister, from my responsible position, to make a clear .statement. Is any proposal to be put to the people in 1952 regarding the abolition of the means test? </para>

In almost every section of the Estimates, large sums of money are provided for those employees. The Government should take steps to reduce the number of temporary and casual employees in its employ, not by dismissing them but by appointing them to the permanent staff. Year after year similar provision is made in the Estimates. There is much to be said for the appointment of officers to the permanent staff. Those concerned receive greater privileges as permanent officers, including superannuation and promotion rights. If there is an employee anywhere in the Commonwealth Public Service who is filling a permanent vacancy that person, whether male or female, should be appointed to the permanent staff as quickly as possible. I admit that in a large organization such as the Commonwealth Public Service, there will always be quite a large number of temporary or casual employees. Perhaps the Minister will explain to me the difference between a temporary and a casual employee. A temporary employee has very little security of tenure and a casual employee is in much the same position. </para>

In the report that was presented to the Parliament by the Public Service Board for the year ended the 30th June, 1951, attention was directed to the increase in the cost of administration of the Department of Social Services and various other departments. Honorable senators have questioned the Minister about costs and have asked him why they are rising. I believe that the reason for the additional expense may be found, embossed, as it were, in golden letters, in the board's report.

                <para class="block">The committee has been called upon to oass a large sum of money and it is justified in asking the Government to explain through its Minister the steps that it intends to take to reduce the increase of salaries based upon the cost of living adjustments and variations in relation to theC series index. Why does the C series index show such a remarkable increase? Why is the Department of Social Services called upon to find additional money this year to pay its officers because of the rise of the cost of living? This is a most serious matter for Australia. The money that is required must come from the pockets of the taxpayers. This Government promised to reduce taxation. It promised to increase the value of pensions and to put value back into the £1. Those promises were made by the Government's leaders and it is useless for honorable senators on the Government side to try to pass them off. The rising cost of living has been responsible for the increased vote that is required for government departments. The Government  should be able to assure the people who find the money to pay its officers that it will take steps to economize. Cost of living adjustments have been upward because the Statistician has found that the people have to pay m.ore for the goods that they require. The occasion demands a serious statement by the Government to the committee and to the people. The Government is charged with the responsibility of administering the affairs of the nation. It has made certain promises' and it has not been able to keep them. It has found from experience that circumstances prevent it from doing all that it promised to do. Therefore the Government should take its courage in its hands, and possibly also its political future, and tell the people exactly where it was mistaken. In another place, and in the press to-day, the Government has been brave enough to admit one of its mistakes and to rectify it. It realized that the economy of the nation was becoming chaotic because of its credit restrictions and so it has informed the people that its policy will be altered. The Government should go a step further and tell the people that it was wrong when it promised greater value to the pensioners, reduced taxation and the restoration of value to the fi. If the Government would make that admission it would be in a stronger position than it is now with its specious arguments with which it tries to delude the people. I hope that the Minister will be able to give the committee and the people some explanation of the cost of the items that are contained in the Estimates. </para>

                    <para>. - The total proposed vote for the Department of Social Services is £2,146,000. I clearly understand why the sum is so high. It is due to an all-round increase of costs for wages, materials, rents and all other expenses that are necessary for the conduct of a government department. I understand also that because there is a means test, it is necessary for the department to incur greater expense. A department that is charged with the payment of invalid and age pensions must necessarily make costly investigations if a means test is applicable. Other social services payments include child endowment, unemployment and sickness benefits and widows' pensions. All those payments involve investigation. I notice under the heading of General Expenses a paltry sum of £12,000. I hesitate to mention that amount when the committee skips over £12,000,000 in a few seconds. The sum of £12,000 is to be voted for the services of magistrates, police, registrars and agents. Who are these agents? Are they private persons or government officials ? The term " agents " is broad and could include almost any one. I have never heard of a private individual being employed by the Department of Social Services to snoop around to see whether a widow is still a widow or whether a person who is receiving unemployment benefit is still unemployed. However, the Government is to be congratulated upon its improved outlook on social services. I see no reason why we should castigate members of. the Government parties. How remarkable has been the change in their attitude towards social services in the past nineteen years! Only nineteen years ago, in 1933, a pensions bill was passed which included the following provision : - </para>

Under that legislation, therefore, upon the death of a pensioner, property to the value of the pension paid throughout the life of the deceased person had to be forfeited to the Commonwealth. The result was that 12,000 pensioners surrendered their pension rights in 1933, and 13,000 persons refrained from applying for the age pension. The savings to the taxpayers - and that, of course, was the most important consideration to the then Government - was the sum of £650,000 annually. Now Ave find members of the Government parties speaking about abolishing the means test. Surely that is progress indeed. Let them go ahead. No one is preventing them from abolishing the means test. </para>

I said, straight from the shoulder, that I was not prepared to give an answer because I thought it was not the kind of question that, should be raised in a debate of this kind. We are debating the proposed vote for the administrative expenses of the Department of Social Services. Surely it is incongruous that the Leader of the Opposition should expect a. Minister to- say at this, stage whether the. Government proposes to sponsor a. measure which would involve additional, expenditure' amounting to more: than £100,000,000 a year. That is my attitude and I shall stick to it. The request by the Leader of the Opposition was unreasonable and I hope that, on reflection, he will agree with me- on that point.- Not only would the abolition of the means test involve an additional annual social, services commitment of more than £100,000,000,. but also it would have repercussions throughout our entire economy. Clearly this is not. the proper time to seek a policy statement on. such an important matter: </para>

                    <para>Before1 dealing wish, the individual matters that have been raised by honorable senators,. I shall deal, with the position in general terms. The vote for the Department of Social Services this year is £2,146^000 compared' with £2,021,000' last year. I believe that the department" is well administered1 and. function.1? smoothly. That was, certainly my own experience when I' held' the social services, portfolio. It. is a department in which administrative expenses- must be expected to rise. Expenditure on social services this year is estimated at £164,000,000 compared with an average of £80,000,009 in the, years immediately preceding the election of the present Government. In other words, expenditure on social services has doubled since the Menzies Government has come to office. Surely that fact itself: answers much of the criticism that has. been, offered by honorable sena:tors opposite. I remind members of. the Opposition who claim that social services payments are not sufficiently generous, that they had ample opportunity when Labour was in office to intro duce the reforms that they now wish to see made. Prom 1941. to 1944, the age pension was increased by only 3s. 6d. a week. That is Labour's record. In the two and a half years that we have been, in office, we have increased the age pension by 25s. a week., </para>

                        <para>- I do not intend, to be provocative. This- is. an occasion, on which one is entitled to take considerable pride in the record of the- Menzies Government in the field of social services.. I submit that I am entitled to rebut criticism, that honorable senators opposite have offered in the course of this debate; This Government has gone- a long way, not; only by increasing pensions, but also by easing the means- test.. One of the greatest social improvements of recent years - an improvement that goes far beyond the monetary benefit entailed - is the provision of a free medical service to pensioners. This- is indeed a boon to pensioners.. A constant anxiety amongst, people getting on in years was that, they would not be, able to obtain proper medical, care without waiting in- queues and feeling themselves under an obligation for the  treatment  that they received. </para>

                <para>I was greatly interested to learn the difference between a casual employee and a temporary employee. I am informed that  a- casual employee is, generally speaking, « person who is employed for a few days to deal with a rush of work. I am afraid that I cannot give <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> much information about his question relating to. the accommodation provided foc the Department of Social Services in Perth. The Leader of the Opposition will agree with me that the department's quarters in the General Post Office building were sadly overcrowded. I recall that when I held the portfolio, an area of laud had been set aside for a new building. I. can recall exactly where it was although. I am not familiar with, the names of the various localities in that city.. I have not heard of the proposal to remodel old hotel premises for this purpose,, and the officer instructing, me has not. heard, of. it either.. </para>

                </para>
                <para class="block">Department of 'Social Services. I remind the honorable senator that this department is somewhat different from other departments in that a considerable volume of mechanical work is involved. This work, which includes the writing and issuing of cheques, is done by machines which are supervised hy girls. They are not salaried officers and most of them are not concerned about obtaining permanent employment. Most of them seek only temporary employment to fill in time until they get married. Therefore there is a considerable turn-over of employees. Mention has been made of the decline of the cost of the services of registrars of births and deaths. That is due to a change of departmental procedure. The department is now relying on medical certificates from practitioners and is not insisting on an official certificate from a registrar in connexion with child endowment applications. It is worthy of note that the level of employment in the department has declined. Although the proposed vote represents an increase of approximately £120,000 on last year's vote, employment in the department has fallen from 2,254 in May, 1951, to 2,094 at present. That, I think, is a good administrative record, having regard to the. additional work that the department has been, called upon to do. Every budget contains some new social services provision or arrangement. The department has been able, to cope with those additional duties, and, at the same time, to reduce its staff. That takes me back to my original point that the Department of Social Services is one of the well administered government departments. </para>

                        <para>.- The Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner)</inline> has made some rather provocative statements. There is no need for me to emphasize that the purchasing power of £1 to-day is vastly different from what it was when the Labour Government increased the age pension by 3s. 6d. a week. It is remarkable that whenever reference is made to this Government's unfulfilled election promises, honorable senators opposite retaliate by comparing the Labour Government's record with that of the present administration. They fail completely, of course, to mention the substantial change that has occurred  in  economic conditions in the last few  year3.  Provision is made in " Division 92- -State establishments " - under the heading " General Expenses " for an estimated expenditure -of £12,000 on the services  of  magistrates, police, registrars and agents. The actual expenditure under this heading last year was £19,443. I should like to know what duties magistrates have to perform in the field of social services. Does the department employ magistrates and pay them for their services?  If the  department is the prosecutor  in a  court action against a recipient of  a  social  services  benefit, and the magistrate  who  hears the case is  a  paid servant  of the  department, what chance of securing justice has the unfortunate person concerned? What duties do the magistrates perform? If the provision covers payments for the services of magistrates  in  connexion with court actions, what kino! of actions does it cover ? Provision is also made for the services .of police. Recently, the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cooper)</inline> defended the action of his department in policing the morals of women in receipt of war widows' pensions. </para>

                        <para>- Are  the  recipients of widows pensions under  the  social services legislation also subjected to the same scrutiny? I understand  that  the Director-General of Social Services and the Minister exercise discretionary power to grant or refuse an application for a widow's pension. Are the services of the police used to investigate the status or the moral conduct of widow pensioners? Provision is also made for the services of registrars and agents and  of  registrars of births and deaths. I  am  intrigued to know what registrars are employed by the department other than registrars of births and deaths.  If  registrars are attached to the department the Minister should indicate the duties that they perform. What do they register? If the department employs  the  services of agents, are they private inquiry agents, or are they persons who function on behalf of the department in areas where the normal facilities for the payment of pensions are not available? </para>

                        <para>- The Minister also failed to reply to my remarks relative to the provision of £24,000 for " Incidental and other expenditure " under Division 92. Is it intended that that amount will be expended on <inline font-style="italic">items the cost</inline> of which will not exceed £2,000, or £5,000, or will it be expended on items the cost of which will not exceed, say, £10? The committee is asked to approve of expenditure running into tens of thousands of pounds without any explanation on the part of the Minister of the items that will be covered by it. It may be true that the proposed votes for the department have been increased because of inflation. If so, and if inflation is caused by rising prices, the Government is responsible for the need to increase the proposed votes because it has failed to put value back into the £1 as it promised it would do prior to the last general election. </para>

                    <para>. - I direct the atention of the Minister to the item " Commission on benefit payments made by banks and post offices " under Division 92. To what extent are banks paid commission, and which banks receive such commission? The proposed vote for this item this year exceeds the appropriation last year by £10,000. To what extent do the private banks, or the Commonwealth Rank, make a profit out of the payment of social services benefits on behalf of the Commonwealth ? </para>

                    referred to the item " Incidental and other expenditure ", for which £24,000 has been provided. No details of the items to be covered by that amount have been given by the Minister. All of this expenditure increases the cost of social services. It would appear to the perfectly unsophisticated mind of the average person that the Government has unnecessarily increased the cost of social services. I should be grateful to the Minister if he would explain the purposes for which this proposed vote has been provided.  His  vague references to proposed expenditure are far from satisfactory.

                    has directed attention to the provision for the services of magistrates. These dignitaries are usually paid by the State government. I do not know whether special magistrates are employed by the Commonwealth. If a beneficiary under the social services legislation is indicted by the police and appears before a magistrate, surely a charge for the services of the magistrate concerned is not made against the Commonwealth '.

                    <para>. -  I should not have spoken again but for the fact that the Minister, when he refused to answer m.y question relating to the Government's proposals for the abolition of the means test, intimated that, upon reflection, I might agree with them that this was not the appropriate stage at which to raise such a matter. I do not so agree, because the whole of the activities of the Department of .Social Services are now under review. If one were to direct a question on this subject to the Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner)</inline> during question time, or upon notice, I have no doubt that he would avoid a direct reply by stating that the question involved Government policy. Does the Minister contend that the Opposition should remain silent on the matter until such time as the Government chooses to bring it before the Parliament? If the Minister considers that the Opposition should await the complete convenience of the Government in this matter, let him say so. I remind the committee that the Minister did not reply to many questions that were asked about social services by honorable senators on both sides of the chamber during the general debate on the Estimates and budget papers. I know of no more opportune time than the present to ask the Minister whether the Government intends to introduce during this year a proposal in relation to the abolition of the means test. As the Minister refuses to answer my question, the position is clear, even if unsatisfactory. I do not concur in the Minister's opinion that this is not the proper time to ask him such a question. </para>

                    <para>. -  It was not my intention to reply. It is not encumbent on a Minister to reply to every question that is asked by honorable senators, and I have already replied to the majority of the questions that have been asked during the consideration of the proposed vote. However, in view of the difficulty that has arisen, I shall answer the honorable senator's question. I refrained from answering it earlier because I did not want to get heated about the matter. I considered that there was a good deal of antagonism to the honorable senator's suggestion that the Department of Social Services should employ private inquiry agents to investigate the circumstances of pensioners and the morals of widows. I am at a loss to understand persons who make, such suggestions. </para>

The expenditure of £19,443 during the last financial year included a payment of £8,73S to the Queensland Government in relation to services rendered during the previous financial year. This amount had remained unpaid because negotiations with the department were incomplete at the 30th June, 1951. </para>

                        <para>- On two occasions during a consideration of the proposed vote I have sought information from the Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner),</inline> on behalf of the people that I represent in this chamber. No government should expect the committee to swallow without explanation the provision of a large amount for incidental expenditure. Provision is made throughout the Estimates for incidental expenditure amounting to hundreds of thousands of pounds. I have not been nasty about the matter, but have sought information civilly. Will the Minister please furnish to me information that the electors require? If the Minister refuses pointblank to supply the information sought, honorable senators could be pardoned for thinking that the proposed provision for " Incidentals and Other Expenditure " is intended to be ladled out in tips or in some other manner. We have heard of slush funds in the past, but I do not consider  that provision should be made in the Estimates for such funds. The taxpayers are entitled to know the real purpose of the proposed provision of £24,000. If the Minister does not consider that the people are entitled to such information, he should rise and say so. Is the money required to establish a secret fund, about which no member of this chambershould dare to ask a question? If the Minister is not prepared to furnish the information that I have sought he should be man enough to get up and say that he is not prepared to disclose it. </para>

                        <para>- The matter that has been raised by the honorable senator shows that he has little appreciation of the information that is before the committee. During the last financial year the Department of Social Services expended £23,150 on incidentals. The proposed vote in this financial year is £24,000. I was perfectly entitled to let the honorable senator's question go over my shoulder and to answer only important questions. No importance attaches to a question relating to incidental expenses of the Department of Social Services which will require an expenditure of £850 more in this financial year than was expended during the last financial year. Such a question does not do any great justice to our position. However, in order to bring the matter to a close, I inform the committee that the proposed vote of £24,000 for administrative general expenses includes provision for such matters as office cleaning, where not covered by rent; maintenance of office machinery; laundry; advertising; and the removal of waste paper. The slight increase over the expenditure during 1951-52 will be due to higher prices. </para>

                    <para>The reason why I'm  writing  this is to try and get some publicity on the so-called " justice " we've got operating in  Her  Majesty's Force«. In the gaol there are 7 chaps waiting District Court Martial for being A.W.L. When a bloke is awaiting a D.O.M. naturally he !ms not been found guilty of the offence until he does appear cn the Court Martial. However, the whole ewen are in detention in the guardhouse. One has been in for 12 weeks waiting  trial: another for <inline font-style="italic">3</inline> weeks, and the rest await the s:une period before their trial comes off. These bloke? aren't guilty, as under British justice <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> man isn't guilty until proved; hut here' are 7 such, living in close confinement like pigs, with storm-troopers, stand-over merchants as their warders. The chaps here asked if I'd write this, as we feel that publicity on this sort of thing might not only hurry our own trial but trials for blokes in our position in the future. If a soldier does, say, a couple of months in the 'guardhouse waiting D.C.M. and at that trial he is awarded a further couple of months, the first two are not taken into consideration and he has to rio his " time ". You can understand a bloke's point of view who has to stay in here for weeks on end, where orders state that: - (l)a  soldier  under sentence, or awaiting sentence, shall not be allowed the use or possession of  tobacco  in any form; (2) no member of the guard will converse with the soldier under sentence or temporarily committed for safe keeping, or allow any familiarity; and (3) every letter, post-card, letter-card, telegram, or other written matter, addressed, or written by a soldier under sentence, or temporarily committed for safe keeping, or awaiting trial, will be read by the CO who will in his discretion approve or not approve of the transmission of the same. </para>
                    <para>These chaps here have been putting up with these things for the above periods and they haven't yet been found guilty, or even tried. So you can see we have just reasons for complaint. </para>

                    <para>However, you are not allowed to complain in the Army like this so we arc writing; this to get the people to  understand  what the  under-dogs  arc suffering. We hope you will give this publicity. We appeal to you to get publicity for  the  men in uniform who aru being  victimized  We are supposed to get one hour's exercise each day out in the sun, but as yet I haven't come across it and I believe it its rate. So the only time we see the sun is through the window, and the exercise yard is our cell. Evidence proves that the Army is getting recruits in under false pretences; the majority of blokes in 2 Batt, joined up for a " career " but now find themselves as riflemen in an infantry battalion. What a future! In my own case, as you know, I was allocated to do a PT  course  here but on arrival I found it was ft lot of hooey and I was a rifleman in 2 Batt. A notice outside 2 Batt. Orderly Room states: To all new members of 2 R.R.A. - You  have  joined an infantry battalion. Forget the promises of the Recruiting officer, soldier on and be proud of your uniform and your corps. </para>

                <para>So you can see that many chaps come in with the recruiting officer's stories of a bright future, &amp;c., &amp;c, and soon find out it's just a lot of eye-wash. The blokes here want to sign this, but it would not be wise to publish the names, as your own experience tells you. It would mean victimization by the Army authorities. </para>
                <para class="block">That letter was signed by seven soldiers, who gave their army numbers, but I shall not state their names. However, their complaint appears to have some substance and to be worthy of investigation. </para>

                <para class="block">I have no objection to the Government's making a decision of this kind, hut I consider that the Government, through the appropriate Minister, should have made a statement to the Senate on this subject. Honorable senators have had to rely on the press report, which may or may not be correct, for information of this decision. If an honorable senator were to state publicly that this decision had been made he would be asked his authority for making such a statement. He could only reply that he had read the press report. The Government has made no statement in this chamber or in another place on the matter. Its failure to do so is typical of the actions of the Government. The Parliament has been ignored whenever the Government has made a decision on a matter of major importance. This is another instance in which the Government has adopted a totalitarian attitude. It has ignored Parliament in connexion with all subjects of major importance including the imposition of import restrictions. The Government may have had the best of reasons for imposing import restrictions, hut Parliament was not consulted on the matter. If this kind of practice is to prevail in the future, honorable senators will become so many overpaid rubber stamps. I. have always objected to being a rubber stamp. The Curtin Government, and' the Chitley Government, of which I had the privilege to be a member, reported to Parliament, on every matter of major importance. If necessary, the opportunity was given to honorable senators to discuss whether the Government's proposal was proper or not. This Government has adopted the attitude that Parliament does not matter. I would expect this attitude of the Prime Minister because as far back as the 1930's he paid tribute to the totalitarian state of government, both in Germany and in Italy, and expressed his strong approval of the policy that had been adopted by both those governments. Honorable senators know what that policy led to. It led to the people of those countries being committed to fight wars without being consulted. </para>
                <para>The democratic form of government requires that no policy shall be executed without parliaments being consulted. </para>
                <para>How long will the supporters of the Government tolerate this sort of action? How long are they prepared to be ignored and treated as if they were of no consequence? How long are they prepared to bo treated as mere followers of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet? This practice is leading insidiously to a form of dictatorship that cannot be justified by those who claim to be democrats. I hope ( lj ti t if the Government adopts a similar attitude in future, its supporters in this chamber will either register their protest or confess to the people that they are ignored by' the Government. </para>

                    <para>. -1 also enter an emphatic protest at the failure of the Government to inform the Senate on the very important matter of the lifting of credit controls. This is a most important decision which will affect the business community and the whole economy of Australia, yet honorable senators have been dependent on press reports to learn of the decision. It was only after questions had been asked in another place concerning the propriety of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Arthur Fadden)</inline> making unpopular decisions on this matter that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> made n statement which lias not been sufficient to clarify the position. It appears from press reports that great confidence in. the beneficial effects of this decision has not been experienced by people who should know what effect it will have on the community. It was reported in the <inline font-style="italic">S'im News Pictorial</inline> in Melbourne this morning that the Prime Minister had announced that the banks were now free to finance  customers  for any purpose, subject only to the provisions of capital issues regulations. But other responsible people were reported as follows: - </para>

                <para class="block">Those are very conflicting statements. The Prime Minister has suggested that the banks could now lend as much as they wished, the inference being that credit restrictions had ended and that this would be of great benefit to the community. When the position is analysed it does not appear to be so rosy as the Prime Minister would have us believe. There are certain obstacles in the way. The Government should have made a considered statement on this matter to both houses of Parliament. I hope that the Minister for  Repatration <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cooper)</inline> will convey to the Prime Minster and the Treasurer that the Senate is very eager to have a statement presented to it covering the whole of these procedings  so that we shall understand exactly what is involved. I support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron's</inline> protest. The Government has been very neglectful of its duty in not making a statement in the Senate on this matter to-day. </para>

                    <para>. - I also protest against the Government's action in relation to this matter. When T read in the press the account of the lifting of credit controls I found myself in a state of complete confusion. I could not ascertain who had made the decision. I could not discover whether it was a decision of the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, a decision of the Commonwealth Bank Board, a decision of the Government or a decision of the Treasurer. If this was a decision of the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank or of the Commonwealth Bank Board it could have been dictated completely by the economic situation. But if the decision was made by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Arthur Fadden)</inline> it could very easily be nothing more than a purely political decision, determined by political considerations and the difficulties that face the Government in relation to the forthcoming Flinders byelection. That is why I consider that the Government should have made a clear and decisive statement on the matter. I join with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan</inline> in suggesting that, even at this late stage, the Government should make some explicit announcement, on the reasons which determined the change of policy and the actual details of the change. </para>
