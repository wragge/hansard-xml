          <para>. The death of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. II.</inline> P. Lazzarini was not unexpected by his friends and intimates, and it draws attention to the honoured place that his name occupies in the history of the Australian Labour party, which includes, of course, a very substantial part of' the history of Australia itself. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The Minister has formally placed on record the high-lights of the long career of public service of the late honorable gentleman, who was privileged to serve . his country in the highest administrative offices, and at a time when it was passing through one of the greatest crises in our history. I refer, of course, to the horrors associated with the period of World War II. </para>
        <para>I had the privilege of knowing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lazzarini</inline> ever since I entered the Senate on the 1st July, 1944. I had a -close and intimate relationship with him, not only in the Parliament, but also in a Cabinet in which we both served under the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley.</inline> I think that it is also worthy of mention that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lazzarini</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley</inline> were long and intimate friends for the best part of a lifetime. Many -Opposition .senators also had a lifelong association and friendship with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lazzarini.</inline> Those who knew him even casually will realize that he had a most kindly disposition and was a cheerful and great-hearted companion. He was one of those rare individuals who appreciate the great value of kindness in little things in all their relationships with' their fellow men. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lazzarini</inline>was a deeply religions man and it is a consolation to his friends to know' that his long illness gave him the blessing of ample time in which to prepare for his end. We know that he took the fullest advantage of that opportunity. As one might expect from a man of his calibre, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lazzarini</inline> was a devoted family man. He took great pride in his family and had cause for great joy in that family. By his death, his electorate,, the Parliament and, indeed, all Australia is poorer. My colleagues and I sincerely deplore his passing.  His  memory will ever be fresh with us and to-day our thoughts extend, in particular, to the bereaved surviving members of his family. . To them I, and all my colleagues of the Opposition, extend our deepest and most sincere sympathy. </para>

          <para>. - The members of the Australian Country party desire to associate themselves with the motion before the Senate and to express their deep regret at the death of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lazzarini.</inline> I had the privilege of knowing the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lazzarini</inline> over quite a number of years. I appreciated the many humane and human qualities that he possessed. He was at home with people in all walks of life and could associate himself with those upon the lowest rung and those upon the highest. I think that that ability gave him a great knowledge of the general thinking of people in various walks of life throughout the country and was of very great assistance to him in the public work that he took up.  His  knowledge .was of valuable account in the general progress of Australia. We desire to extend pur deepest sympathy to his widow and the members of his family. </para>
