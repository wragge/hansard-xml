                        <para>- Can the Minister for Repatriation inform me whether it is correct, as was recently reported, that it is proposed to curtail the full-time services of padres at repatriation hospitals throughout the Commonwealth? If the report is .correct, is such niggardly action necessary because. of the parlous financial position of the Govern.ment? In view of the excellent work done by padres in such hospitals, and the comfort which patients derive from the knowledge that padres are always at hand or on call, will the Minister take immediate action to cancel this miserable proposal ? </para>

The .question is also connected with the recent demonstration at the Bonegilla immigrant cam]), in Victoria. I now ask the Minister whether an allocation of £500,000 was made to the Department of Works for the absorption of these immigrants. If such an allocation was made, in what  proportions was the amount distributed to the various States? Was any portion of the amount allotted to Tasmania for the purposes of its works programme? </para>

                        <para>- I draw the attention of the Minister for Shipping and Transport to press reports which appeared this week to the effect that because of the unavailability of shipping and disorganization of waterfront labour establishments which handle timber shipments from Tasmania, a number of sawmills in Tasmania either have closed down or have curtailed employment. From the positive interest which the Minister takes in Tasmanian affairs, I expect that he has seen such reports. Will he say whether the cause which has been attributed by the press to such curtailment of production and trade is in fact lack of shipping and waterfront labour disorganization? Will he investigate the matter so that, if that be a fact, appropriate remedies may be applied by his department? </para>

To-day, I received information to the effect that the Tasmanian Traffic Committee, which looks after matters of this kind, had advised that the only request it had received for shipping space had been made a fortnight ago and that in response to the request <inline font-style="italic">Dulverton</inline> is nowloading at Launceston  and <inline font-style="italic">Dubbo</inline> is now loading at Burnie. In view of the nature of the press statement I asked the committee to get in touch with the Timber Association of Tasmania in order to ascertain whether the statement was correct and to indicate the immediate future requirements of the industry. When a report on those matters has been received I shall be only too pleased to furnish the fullest information to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> and to other honorable senators who are interested in this problem. </para>

The proposed sailing date has now been fixed at the 14th August. When it was proposed to dock the ship for repairs, every effort was made to get another ship with which to carry on the service but, unfortunately, the strike which occurred in the shipyards in Sydney rendered that impossible. </para>

                        <para>- My question, which is addressed to the Minister for Trade and Customs, is based upon information furnished to me by the Wholesale Jewellers Association of Australia. Is the Minister aware that pre-budget statements that have been published in many newspapers forecasting or promising relief from some of the extortionate rates of sales tax have had very damaging effects on the manufacturing, wholesale and retail sections of industry resulting in unemployment? Does he realize that as the result of such statements business in the manufacturing, wholesale and retail jewellery trade and in other industries affected by sales tax has stagnated to such an extent that many firms and individuals have gone out of business? Is he aware that Crown Crystal Glass Proprietary Limited has closed one of its factories and has dismissed 40 skilled workers, and that Mr. Whiting, a highly skilled artisan, has been forced to close his works at Albion-street, Sydney, and to dispense with the services of highly skilled personnel? Will the Minister inform the Senate what Government authority gave information to the press relating to reduced sales tax in the budget yet to be brought before the Parliament? If the Government denies responsibility for the repeated press statements of possible budgetary relief, will the Minister take action to ascertain the. source of this leak of information relating to Government economic policy, which should remain highly confidential, and, if possible, deal with the person or persons who have been recreant to .their trust? </para>

It is very unfortunate - and I should like the press particularly to take notice of this fact- that a great disservice is done to the country by wild speculation upon what the budget may or may not contain. No good can possibly come from such speculation. I agree with the honorable senator that speculation on the contents of the budget is grossly improper and renders a great disservice to the country. </para>

                        <para>- The total number of persons in receipt of unemployment benefits at the 26th July was 13,480. That figure represents about one-third of 1 per cent, of the total work force in Australia - a figure which I suggest is smaller than the corresponding figure in any other country in the world. I do not suggest that all the people who are unemployed at the moment have applied for unemployment benefits, but the figure that I have quoted is an indication of the existing state of affairs. </para>

                            <para>- If honorable senators opposite say that it does not represent the real number of unemployed who have sought relief, I suggest that they are engaged in the most deliberate exaggeration. I regret to say that it is becoming manifest that members of the Labour party seem to derive some . pleasure from exaggerating  the present degree of unemployment. The Government is concerned about this matter. Honorable senators opposite should not imagine that the Labour party has a monopoly of concern about the problems that may arise from unemployment. It is the wildest exaggeration even to hint that there are 100,000 unemployed in this country. There are no figures available at the moment to support any such contention. All the evidence at present available indicates that the number of unemployed does not exceed 40,000. </para>

The fact is that those who at  any  particular time are registered as being out of employment have been unemployed for only a short time. In other words, the unemployed personnel is constantly changing. While some are being placed in employment, others, perhaps, are losing their jobs. That is the best information that I can supply at the moment. If the honorable senator wishes to get more detailed information I shall be glad to supply it. </para>

The Australian Labour party in trying to make of this subject a political issue with which to attempt to defeat the Government is doing a great disservice to Australia. The question is in terms which are too general. A specific reply cannot be given to it, particularly as it has been addressed to a member of the Cabinet on budget day. </para>

For  many years I was the organizer of a trade union, and I am aware of the lax methods adopted by government officials in arriving at unemployment figures. Is it not a fact that thousands of female workers are being dismissed by Australian firms and that most of such workers do not register as unemployed? If that is so, it is obvious that a true picture of unemployment is not being painted at the present time. Can the Minister inform me of the means at the disposal of the Government with which to gain a true knowledge of the number of unemployed persons ? I should like the Attorney-General thoroughly to investigate this matter. I make no accusation such as the members of the Government make against the Australian Labour party. All honorable senators should be seriously concerned with this subject. I have been unemployed and I know what unemployment means. Because of the admitted failure of the Government during the last year or two to preserve full employment, will consideration be given to bringing together in conference the leaders of the trade union movement and the captains of industry, in order that a real solution of the unemployment problem .might be found ? </para>

                                <para>- All that I wish to say in answer to the last question asked by the honorable senator is that there is no admission on the part of the Government of any failure to maintain full employment in this country. Full employment has been the policy of the Government and remains its policy to-day. As far as sources of information regarding unemployment are concerned, I remind the honorable senator that there are several sources to which we may turn. First, we may turn to the registrations of people for unemployment relief, although I agree that that is not a perfect ' test. Next, the Government has access to figures which are supplied by trade unions, indicating the number of trade unionists who, from time to time, state that they are unemployed. The Government also is able to obtain information from the Commonwealth Employment Service, which can supply figures which show the number of vacancies that exist. I remind the honorable senator that many vacancies for employment are still registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service. The last figures which I saw were approximately 31,000. </para>

                                <para>- -They are not nearly as fictitious as are most of the statements made by the honorable senator. In addition, the persons who register for employment with the Commonwealth Employment Service indicate the period of time for which they have been unemployed. There are, therefore, various sources from which it is possible to obtain information which, although perhaps not completely accurate, is as good as it is possible to obtain. These sources of information are at present being carefully examined. As I have said, honorable senators will be (riven full information on this matter in the course of a  day  or two. </para>

                            <para>- In reply to a question .by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sandford,</inline> the Attorney-General said that he used the number of applicants f"r the unemployment benefit as an indicator of unemployment. He mentioned that there are now about 13,000 applicants  for the benefit. Later, he said that possibly 40,000 per sons were unemployed but that that number was not a permanent figure because some of those who registered for work obtained it and new ' applicants were being registered. How does the Attorney-General reconcile the two statements ? The fact that some unemployed are obtaining work and others are becoming, unemployed must surely indicate that ari army of approximately 40,000 persons is permanently unemployed?</para>

                            <para> I cannot follow the honorable senator's reasoning. Apparently, we speak different languages. If 40,000 unemployed persons who have been registered for a week obtain jobs and at the end of that week a new group of 40,000 persons is registered, it cannot bc- said that 40,000 persons can be described as being in a condition of permanent unemployment. The most that oan be said is that, from week to week, 40,000 persons are out of employment for the week. That was not what Senator Sandford sought to convey when he suggested that 40,000 persons are per.manently unemployed. On the contrary, he sought to convey the impression that 40,000 persons are completely down and out and have no possibility of finding jobs, whereas according to the latest information in my possession, despite the existence of a small degree of unemployment - and it is very small - approximately 31,000 vacancies are registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service. That may mean that there is still in this country, as I believe there is, a considerable unsatisfied demand for certain classes of labour.</para>

To what extent did this Government, last year, increase the amounts of reimbursements to the States out of revenue to enable the States to maintain their current expenditures?

                                <para>- I think the Senate will concede - that Senator Wright's question is appropriate and  to  the. point. Before I became a member of the Parliament I read a  press report to the effect that a great public works programme that had been prepared by the Australian Labour government then in office, would be  a  buffer against unemployment. The estimated expenditure involved was astronomical. I think that it was almost £1,000,000,000. Like so many  of  Labour's plans, that plan was all right except that the unemployment did not occur. That is the position again to-day. There is not at present unemployment, and please God there will not be unemployment. One of the best ways to promote unemployment is for the Labour party to try to create nervousness and anxiety. In the last budget we provided £225,000,000 from various sources for works programmes of the States, which the States would not have been able to provide for themselves. This year we have undertaken to provide £180,000,000, and the distribution to the States from the proceeds of uniform taxation will be almost £16,000,000 greater than it was last year. </para>

I understand that this is an  opinion  that is widely held in Australian medical circled. As these detergent* are extremely efficient cleansing agents, they are . widely used, find if they have the effect that has been suggested by the medical pr"fession they are a constant and growing source of danger to the health of the community.

Like soaps, they net by lowering the surface tension of water and they assist its cleansing action. They  also  have certain  advantages over  soaps, e.g., they can be used  satisfactorily  in hard waters and since they are not alkaline and are free from irritating fatty acids they will not irritate the skin in the  same  way that swap does, although it U possible they may irritate the skin in some other way. According to reports, some of  these  detergents give good indications of  being  less irritating to some skins than i$ soap. </para>
                        <para>The question whether synthetic detergent? have a carcinogenic action on the skin" has been discussed with prominent dermatologists and other medical  specialists  in Sydney nml with representatives of two large  soap manufactoring  firms. A search has also been made of the relevant medical literature available at the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, Sydney. There )£ no information from .any of these sources  to  indicate that the use of synthetic detergents is associated with  the  risk of cancer of the skin, and no indication from the medical practitioners consulted that they believe such an association to be likely. </para>
                        <para>Most of the synthetic detergents used in Australia ave imported and include preparations named  Teepol, Pref,  Kwit,  Santomerse  aud  Lissapol.  Some of these compounds have been used for several years in industrial skin cleansers, particularly in the United States of America. They are especially suitable for workers who are sensitive to the usual soaps, or to alkalies or who are affected with dermatitis, and have been recommended by authorities such as Dr. Louis Schwartz, until recently Chief Dermatologist to the United States Public Health Service, and by the Committee on Occupational Dermatoses of the American Medical Association. It is hardly likely that their use in skin cleansers would be advocated if there were any suspicion of a carcinogenic effect. fu <inline font-style="italic">Medical Uses of Soap,</inline> edited by Morris  Fishbein  (1045), at that time editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Journal of the American Medical Association,</inline> it is stated, at page 1G2, that materials in thu group of  sulphonated  alkylated aromatic hydrocarbons have been used as household and industrial detergents -  Aliwol,  Saves.

                        <para>- While there is an adequate supply of Australian coal available, importations of coal will be confined to orders in respect of which commitments have already been undertaken and cargo space obtained, and to certain quantities of gas coal. The position to-day is that supplies of coking coal and general purposes coal are sufficient to meet our requirements, but that some gas coal still has to be imported. I have quoted the relative prices of Australia]* coal and imported coal from time to time. The cost of imported coal varies with fluctuations in freight charges. The price of the coal itself is fairly constant, but freight rates have varied considerably over the last twelve months. In 1950-51, the subsidy on imported coal totalled £1,700,000. The subsidy averaged £2 4s.  a ton on coal delivered to South Australia, and £2 7s. a ton on coal delivered to Victoria. The quantity of coal imported in that year was 733,000 tons. In 1951-52, imports fell to 231,000 tons, on which the subsidy totalled £1,300,000. The average payment was £5 5s. 10d. a ton on coal for South Australia, and £6 2s. 8d. a ton on coal for Victoria. </para>

                            <para>- The question that I wish to ask the Minister for National Development has been provoked by the implications of the question asked by Senator O'Byrne - implications which to honorable senators on this side of the" House are grounds for congratulation but which to honorable senators opposite apparently are grounds for complaint. I ask the Minister whether the stage has now been reached at which Australian industry has an adequate supply of coal. If so, will the Minister indicate to the Senate in what measure this satisfactory state of affairs has been contributed to by the Government's programme to increase production in the New South Wales coal mines, both by open-cut and underground methods, and to what degree it is due to the Government's policy of supplementing home production with importations of coal? </para>

                            <para>- When this Government came to office, coal was being produced in New South Wales at the rate of 10,700,000 tons a year. The present production rate in that State is 15,000,000 tons a year. When we came to office, open-cut coal production in New South Wales was at the rate of 1,300,000 tons a year; to-day, the production is 2.800,000 tons a year. In addition, New South Wales has been surveyed and prepared so that production can be expanded at short notice to whatever level is required by the nation. Most significant of  all, however, is the fact that, whereas when this Government was elected the production loss due to industrial disputes was at the rate of 14 per cent, per annum of the productive capacity of the coal -mines now, and for many months past, despite Communist leadership of the miners' federation, losses due to industrial disturbances are considerably less than half of what they were when Labour was in office. </para>

                        <para>- Answering the last question first, there should be no need for any honorable senator to seek such an assurance because no Australian Government would give preference to the produce of Japan over that of the? country. I am not aware of the contract  to which the honorable senator has referred, but I do know that licences for the importation of cement from overseas have been granted only because the local supply has not been able to cope with the demand. On occasions, even customs by-law concessions have been granted in respect of imported cement, and the United Kingdom Government has consented to waive the British preference requirements because that country has been unable to supply our needs. The policy of this Government, and indeed of all Australian governments, is to require the use of Australian products wherever practicable. If local supplies are inadequate, preference is then given to the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries. Only if goods are. not available within the British Commonwealth are orders placed with other countries. The honorable senator will realize, of course, that the Commonwealth itself is not the buyer in such instances. The buying is done by merchants. However, it is necessary for them to obtain import licences. </para>

                        <para>The Canberra abattoir is administered by my department and the Minister for the Interior has accordingly referred the honorable senator's question to me. Facilities are provided at the abattoir for the slaughtering and chilling of meat by slaughtering butchers, but not for .retail selling. Nevertheless, a practice developed whereby single sides of lamb and mutton and other meat .vere sold to members of the public by the slaughtering butchers'. The frequent opening of large  chilling halls for individual sales, a practice contrary to the first principles of refrigeration, interrupted the normal work of the abattoir staff and ultimately interfered with the efficient working of the establishment. My department therefore required the discontinuance of the sales. The decision was a normal administrative function and no ministerial direction was necessary. </para>

                    <para class="block">The Treasure]- <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Arthur Fadden)</inline> is to-night delivering in another place the budget speech for the financial year 1952-53. The budget is being presented much earlier than is customary, and it is hoped that this will become the rule rather than the exception. At the present time it is more than usually important that the Parliament and the people should know without delay the financial course that the Government intends to follow during this financial year. </para>
                    <para>I propose to inform honorable senators of the principal features of the Treasurer's budget speech and to give details of the revenue and expenditure proposals contained in it. In a review of the economic and financial situation it is stated that dramatic changes have occurred in basic economic conditions since the last budget was brought down. "Wool prices fell to half the level of the year before.- Imports of every kind flooded into the country, forcing the Government to place drastic restrictions on their entry. Our international reserve shrank by nearly £500,000,000.  Rural  production was set back because of drought, bushfire and flood. These developments, in combination, put a heavy strain upon the economy, but at the same time they helped to ease the extreme inflationary pressure from which we were suffering. </para>
                    <para>The signs that our basie position is sunder than it was a year ago are now multiplying. The output of black coal ind basic steel products has increased substantially. Labour shortages have  disappeared  in most industries, notably those of an essential kind. More goods ;ire being moved by rail. Congestion at the wharfs has lessened. Few consumer goods are short, and traders are competing more actively with one another. All this has been accomplished without detriment to a rapidly expanding defence programme. It is true that " cost inflation " continues, partly because' of past increases in wages and costs, and that certain other characteristic results of inflation are still with us. The loan market, for example, is weak, since' inflation has discouraged saving and investment in fixed interest-bearing securities. Business in many directions is eonfronted by slackness and uncertainty. This is not due to a deficiency of purchasing power, which still remains at a high level and could, if financial errors were made, easily set up new inflationary pressures. Eather is it due to a general hesitation and to a mood of indecision whether investment should be made now or deferred. </para>
                    <para>It is important that the difference in the situations confronting the Government a year ago , and now ' should he clearly understood. A year ago 139,000 vacant jobs had been registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service. Only a few hundred persons were drawing unemployment relief. To-day, registered vacancies have fallen to 32,000. While unemployment is still sporadic and, I believe, transitional, the number on relief ha.s risen to over 12.000. A year ago  the  special deposits held by the trading banks with the Commonwealth Bank amounted to £526,000,000. To-day, the total is only £195,000,000, the Central Bank having released no less than £331,000,000 during the year. A year ago, record wool prices had added £380,000,000 to our export incomes. Since then, we have had experience of a year of  sharply  reduced wool prices, with a reduction in the wool cheque of no  less  than £300.000,000. </para>
                    <para>A year ago, few people were disposed to worry over the morrow. To-day, there is widespread uneasiness about what may bc in store for us. The feelings of businessmen, in particular, have radically changed, and there is in some quarters a good deal of fear about the economic future. This is, I believe, baseless, but in itself it is a fact which the Government cannot ignore. Looking back over the past year, the Government is convinced that the counter-inflationary measures both in, and  in  conjunction with, last year's budget were broadly correct and well justified. </para>
                    <para>After studying the situation exhaustively and weighing up all the factors to which I have referred, the Government has decided to base its budget for 1952-53 on the following broad considerations : - First, there is still inflation in the sense that prices and costs are still rising, partly as n result of earlier price and cost movements. There has been some loss of business confidence, and some trausition.nl and sectional unemployment has appeared. Going to the limit of its budgetary capacity, but without running into a deficit and so prejudicing economic stability, the Government therefore proposes to make certain adjustments and tax reductions to give incentive to investors, businessmen and the community in general. Secondly, the large and costly works programmes of the State governments will not he charged against the cu.rr.eni revenues of the Commonwealth. Thirdly, because of the change in economic conditions and the emergence of some -signs of unemployment, it is considered justifiable that loan raisings for essential works of a truly developmental and productive kind should receive some ' special assistance from bank credit.. </para>
                    <para>To state the matter in another way, "the Government intends to reduce taxes as far as the Commonwealth budgetary position makes that possible, but it will not go into deficit for the purpose of reducing taxes. The shortfall in terms of cash will be outside the budget and will relate solely to the needs of State  programmes  which are under State control. En brief, so far as the Commonwealth is concerned, all Commonwealth expenditure, including capital works and services, will be met out of the revenue of :the year.. That means that in this budget the Government has endeavoured, :and, I believe, successfully, to reconcile  prudence  and responsibility with en-  couragement  to enterprise and a checking of certain recessive tendencies in business and employment which, if left to themselves, might cause much damage. </para>
                    <para>After allowing for the proposals which L shall outline shortly, total expenditure for 1952-53 is estimated at £959,430,000. The comparable figure for expenditure last year was £.903,900,000 so that there is an estimated increase of £55,530,000. The greater part of this increase in accounted foa1 by the increased estimates for defence services and payments to the States, which amount to approximately £30,400,000 and £16,900,000 respectively. </para>
                    <para>Preparation of the defence estimates could not be completed until the defence programme as a whole had been reviewed in the light of discussions held by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> during his visit overseas. It has now been decided to provide a total amount of £200,000,000 for defence expenditure in 1952-53, compared with an actual expenditure of £169,500,000 last year. Allocation of that amount is now being considered by the defence authorities, and detailed estimates will be submitted at a later stage. </para>
                    <para>Total payments to the States are estimated at £177,800,000 this year, compared with £160,900,000 in 1951-52. The main reason for the increase of £16,900,000 in this item is to be found in the combined total of the tax reimbursement grant and the special financial assistance grant which it is proposed to pay to the States. </para>
                    <para>Estimates for capital works and services have been rigorously pruned to ensure that only the most essential works and services will be provided for, and the amount of £106,600,000 included in the estimates is £4,000,000 less than actual expenditure last year. Taking higher costs into account, this represents a substantial reduction of the volume of works activity. </para>
                    <para>The decision to reduce the intake of immigrants has enabled the estimates of the Department of Immigration for expenditure on miscellaneous services this year to be reduced by approximately £1,500,000 below expenditure in 1951-52..  Further  savings may become possible at a later stage. </para>
                    <para>Subsidies are estimated to cost £28,400,000 thi3 year, which is £3,000,000 less than expenditure in 1951-52. Only small payments of woollen goods bounty, on which £2,300,000 was spent last year, will have to be made in 1952-53. Thi subsidy on wheat for stock feed is, however, expected to cost £2,600,000 more this year. </para>
                    <para>Estimated expenditure of the Postal Department shows an increase of nearly £9,700,000 over last year. This is mainly attributable to higher wages,  saleries  and general costs.  Erpenditure  on railways and the broadcasting services is estimated to increase in each case by £400,000, also because of higher costs. </para>
                    <para>Departmental expenditure is estimated for this year at £48,400,000, which i- £6,000,000 above the cost for 1951-52. The higher departmental estimate is chiefly a matter of increased wages and salaries and general costs. </para>
                    <para>With regard to repatriation benefits-, it is proposed to increase " general rate " war pensions and the war pensions payable to the wives and children of incapacitated ex-servicemen and the children of deceased ex-servicemen: The increases proposed are: 10s. a week in the full "general rate" war pensions; 5s. and 2s. 3d. a week in pensions for the wife and each child, respectively, of a " special rate " or full " general rate pensioner; and 4s. 6d. and 3s. a week in the pensions for the first child and each later child, respectively, of a deceased "xserviceman, except where the child's mother is also deceased, when the increase will be 8s. a week. General rate pensioners not receiving the full pension, and their dependants, will receive proportionate increases. Service pensions are also to be increased by amounts up co 7s. 6d. a week for an unmarried pensioner and up to 12s. 6d. a week for a married pensioner. </para>
                    <para>Other proposals include increases in i.he education allowances payable under the soldiers' children education scheme to certain children of deceased and totally and permanently incapacitated or blinded ex-servicemen and the payment of an education allowance from age twelve instead of thirteen years; an increase of L'l 1 OS. a week in the living allowance  payable  under the Commonwealth recon.struction and related training schemes and the war service land settlement scheme, and in the maximum rates of i  re-establishment  allowances for ex-servicemen engaged in farming and other occupations. Increased pensions and allowances will be payable from the date nf the first war pension pay-day after  the  necessary amending legislation is passed. The total additional expenditure involved in these proposals is estimated at £3,200,000 in a full year and £2,400,000 in 1952-53. </para>
                    <para>It is proposed to increase by amounts not exceeding 7s. 6d. a week age and invalid pensions and the pensions payable to widows who have one or more children. The pensions payable to other classes of widows and the allowance payable to the wife of ah invalid pensioner will also be increased. The increases will  become  payable on the first pension payday after the necessary amending legislation is passed. It is also proposed to pay, free of means test, to qualified blind persons the first £3 of the invalid pension, and to repeal the provisions which disqualify a person aged between sixteen and 21 years for invalid pension if his parents are able adequately to maintain -him. Further, it is proposed to increase the allowances payable to persons suffering from tuberculosis by 10s. a week for a sufferer who is unmarried, and by 15s. a week for a man and wife. Unemployment and sickness benefit rates for a single person and for a man and wife will be doubled. It is estimated that these proposals will cost £11,100,000 in a full year, and £8,300,000 in 1952-53. </para>
                    <para>During the financial year the medical benefits scheme will come into operation. This scheme provides for the payment of subsidies in respect of medical treatment to members of organizations registered under the 'scheme. This scheme is estimated to cost £750,000 this year and about £7,500,000 a year when fully established. The living allowances payable under the Commonwealth scholarship scheme are to be increased by amounts up to 7s. 6d. a week for students living at home and 10s. a week for students living away from home. The increase will  take effect from the 1st. January, 1953. From that date also, it is proposed to ease the means test attached to these living allowances. Under the proposal, except where full living allowances are already payable, the living allowances otherwise payable will be further increased by amounts up to £30 a year, or approximately lis. 6d. a week. The additional cost is estimated at £55,000 in a full year and £27,000 in 1952-53. </para>
                    <para>It is proposed to amend the relevant legislation to provide that the amount to be appropriated to the National Welfare Fund in this year and subsequent years shall be equal to expenditure from the fund. Under the present arrangement the annual appropriation to the fund is related to variations in collections of pay-roll tax. Whilst this arrangement has so far resulted in payments to the fund being greater than expenditure from it - mainly because of the steep rise during recent years in wage and salary earnings in respect of which pay-roll tax is levied - it could obviously cause the fund to run down if the rise in earnings slowed down while expenditure from the fund continued to increase. The pronosed arrangement will have the advantage that annual expenditure on social services benefits will be fully covered by the annual appropriation and the amount of that expenditure will be accurately reflected each year in the budget. Meanwhile, the position of the fund will be fully protected. At the 30th June last, the balance in the fund stood at £185,000,000. At that figure it provides an ample reserve and safeguard for the continued payment of social services benefits, which was the purpose for which it was originally established. The total expenditure from the fund this year is estimated at £164,179,000, and that is the amount for which provision is made in the Estimates. </para>
                    <para>On the basis of taxation rates as they stand, it is estimated that total revenue iri 1952-53 would reach £1,009,4.60,000. If revenue remained at £1,009,460,000 and expenditure at £959,430,000, there would be a surplus of approximately. £50,000,000 for the year. In the view of the Government that amount represents the extent to which reductions of taxation can safely be given. I shall now explain the tax reductions which the Government proposes to make. </para>
                    <para>The special levy of 10 per cent of income tax and social services contribution imposed on individual taxpayers last year will not be re-imposed this year. The value to taxpayers of the discontinuance of the special levy will be about £36,500,000 in a full assessment year and £23,000,000 in this financial year. Because new deduction scales have to be prepared and distributed to employers, the lower instalment deductions from salary and #wage earners will not commence until the 1 st October, next. </para>
                    <para>A reduction of 2s. is proposed in the rate of tax on the first £5,000 of taxable income derived by public companies. The rate at which tax will be payable on incomes of public companies for the year ended the 30th June, 1952, including the levy of 2s. in the £1 imposed last year will accordingly be - 7s. in the £1 on the first £5,000 of taxable income, and 9s. in the £1 on the balance of taxable income. </para>
                    <para>The reduction of 2s. in the rate on the first £5,000 of taxable income will afford some relief to all public companies and will be of special assistance to those companies in the lower profit earning ranges. The cost to revenue of this reduction is estimated to be £1,500,000 in a full assessment year and £1,100,000 in the current financial year 1952-53. </para>
                    <para>The system of advance payments by companies instituted last year will be discontinued. This means that in the current financial year companies will not be required to make any advance payments based upon the income of the year ended the 30th June, 1952. The advance payments imposed in respect of the income of the year 1950-51 will bf credited against company tax assessable during the current financial year. The cost to revenue in the current financial year is estimated at £14,000,000. </para>
                    <para>The primary rales of tax imposed last, year on the 1950-51 taxable incomes of private. companies were 5s. in the £1 on the first £5,000 of taxable income and 7 s. in the £1 on the balance of taxable income. These rates are being retained this year for application to the 1951-52 taxable incomes of private companies, but these companies will benefit substantially in not being required to make an  advance payment  this year, and from increases in the amounts which may be retained free from undistributed income tax, as I shall now explain. </para>
                    <para>For many years the basis of taxation of the undistributed income of private companies has been the subject of controversy both as to the weight of the tax and the complications of the system. At present a private company may retain a portion of its distributable income without incurring undistributed income tax on the amount so retained. This amount, called the " retention allowance ", ranges from 50 per cent, of the first £1,000 of distributable income down to 10 per cent, of the excess of the distributable income over £10,000. Commencing with the income year 1951-52, the Government proposes to increase the minimum retention allowance to 25 per cent. Where the present retention allowance exceeds  25 per cent, the greater amount will still apply. </para>
                    <para>The new scale will be as follows: - </para>
                    <para class="block">

                    <para>The new scale of retention allowances should enable all private companies to plough back the necessary reserves for the proper conduct of their businesses, and at the same time to effect sufficient distributions of profits to shareholders 10 avoid undistributed income tax. </para>
                    <para>Where, however, a private company chooses to retain profits in excess of the retention allowance, undistributed income tax will be payable. Past experience has imply demonstrated the need for simplifies tion of the method by which this undistributed income tax is assessed. The complexities and delays of the system mainly arise from taxation of undistributed income at the shareholders' graduated rates. Troubles have arisen also because of the inability of companies to check the accuracy of the assessments made. In addition, serious complications have been encountered in ascertaining whether, for purposes of rebate, the profits so taxed were subsequently distributed. Acting upon a recommendation of the Commonwealth Committee on Taxation, the Government proposes that the undistributed income tax shall, in future, be levied at a flat rate instead of the shareholders' graduated rates of lax. The flat rate now proposed is 10s. in the fi. </para>
                    <para> Having in mind the greatly increased retention allowances which will be allowable to private companies, and upon which only the primary rate will be payable so long as they remain undistributed, it is not proposed to provide any rebate of the flat rate tax chargeable on distributable profits over and. above the permitted retention allowances. The basic reasons for this proposal are that a company which so retains profits is assumed to be retaining those profits permanently in the capital structure of the  company  and that theY will not be distinguishable from other retained profits in any subsequent distribution. There will be no  obligation  on private companies to incur undistributed income tax even  though  they may find it  necessary  to utilize profits in excess of the  retention  allowances. As the Com.monwealth Committee on Taxation ha,s pointed out, these companies will be able in most, if not all, cases to arrange for shareholders, after paying their taxes, to re-invest the balance of the dividends with the companies. The plan proposed, it is thought, will provide a simple and stable system for the levying of tax on the undistributed income of private companies. Whilst providing full equity for private companies, it will prevent the delays now so prevalent in ascertaining, full liability on any year's profit and will provide a welcome simplicity enablingcompanies to ascertain their liabilitiesat the earliest date. </para>
                    <para>Because of increasing costs of education, representations have been received! from- a wide cross-section of the community for some relief on account of" expenditure incurred by parents in educating families. It is proposed accordingly to allow parents a concessional' deduction for education expenses incurred! up to a maximum of £50 for each, dependent child under 21 years receivingfulltime education. This concession will commence to apply on and from the- 1st July, 1952, at an annual cost to revenue, of approximately £1,500,000. There will, however, be.no cost to revenue in the current financial year 1952-53. </para>
                    <para>The Government has examined the effects of income tax on amounts paid and received for the acquisition and disposal of goodwill attached to leasehold business premises. These amounts have in the past been treated as income of the recipients because in many instances  they  amounted to nothing more than rent paid in advance. Correspondingly, paymentshave been allowed as deductions for the reason that the value of the payments isexhausted at the termination of the lease. In recent years, strong protests have been made against the practice on the ground that the tax is a levy on capital. There is little doubt that in a great number of cases there is substance in these protests. The matter has been considered by the Commonwealth Committee on Taxation which has recommended that amounts paid for goodwill so described should be, treated as taxable income on the one hand and allowable deductions on the otheronly if the vendor and purchaser so agree and notify the Commissioner of Taxation to that effect. In other words, it is intended to let the tax consequences follow the stated conclusions of the negotiating parties. It is intended that the altered law should commence to apply to transactions made after the 31st December, 1952. This will enable the parties to leasehold transactions and their advisers to familiarize themselves with the altered law prior to its operation. </para>
                    <para>The Government proposes to exempt from, income tax the income derived by football, cricket, tennis and other clubs which are concerned in the promotion of sport in which only human beings ^participate. Such organizations which are not carried on for the profit of individuals will, in this connexion, be on the same footing as musical, artistic, scientific and literary societies, the incomes of which are already exempt from tax. It is pro.posed also that other non-profit organizations; .such as lodges and social clubs, shall not be liable for income tax unless the income exceeds £104 in the year. These exemptions will commence to apply to 1951-52 incomes, at an annual cost to revenue of £20,000. </para>
                    <para>At present an employer is allowed a deduction of contributions made to funds for the individual personal benefit of employees and their dependants. In the first instance, however, the annual deduction is limited to £100, or 5 per cent, of the annual remuneration of the employee, whichever is the greater. In those cases where the contribution exceeds this limit, the Commissioner is authorized to allow a greater deduction if there are special circumstances warranting the increased allowance. Adopting a further recommendation by the Commonwealth Committee on Taxation, it is proposed to increase the limit from £100 to £200. This increase is in consonance with the increase made in recent years from £100 to £200 in the concessional deduction allowable to taxpayers for life assurance, contributions to superannuation funds and comparable payments. It is proposed also to exempt from tax the income derived by funds established for the purpose of providing retirement benefits for self-employed persons. This exemption will correspond with the. exemption already provided for employees' pension funds. The new provisions will operate on and from the 1st July, 1952. </para>
                    <para>Last year the Government introduced allowances which exempted men over 65 years and women over 60 years of age if the income did not exceed £234. In the case of married couples this exemption applied if their combined incomes did not exceed £468. 'These allowances coin.cided with the limits of the maximum permissible incomes for purposes of Commonwealth age pensions. As already announced, it is proposed to increase age pensions by 7s. 6d. a week. In consonance with this increase, exemptions are being increased by £20 to £254 in the case of single persons and by £39 to £507 in the case of married couples. The increase in this exemption will apply to incomes of the current year 1952-53. </para>
                    <para>Ever since the inception of Commonwealth income tax. the law has contained a provision which requires tax to be paid only on 5 per cent, of lump-sum retiring allowances paid to persons in consequence of their retirement from an office or employment. Until recently this provision has encouraged employers to reward their employees for faithful service and has prevented that reward from being unduly encroached upon by full taxation of the retiring allowance aggregated with other income of the year. Unfortunately, in recent years evidence has accumulated that this concession has been abused. Ii is proposed to remedy the technical defects of the present law to ensure that the concession shall apply only to those lumpsum receipts  which  are genuine retiring allowances and which are reasonable in amount having regard to the value of the services and the length of the employment. 'The altered provisions will commence to apply in assessments based on income of the current year 1952-53. </para>
                    <para>The Government has also examined the position of transactions in trading stock, including live-stock. The broad principle on which those provisions .are based is that, on a disposal of trading stock, its value should be taxed in the hands of the person or persons disposing of the stock and, correspondingly, allowed as a deduction to the person or persons acquiring the stock. Recent decisions of  courts  and Wards of review have disclosed that the existing provisions do not give full and proper effect to that basic principle. As a result, the provisions operate inequitably in some cases of disposals &lt;of trading  stock  outside the normal course of business. It is proposed to introduce amending legislation to remove these anomalies. One proposal is that, where trading stock is disposed of by way of .gift, the donee should be entitled to the same deduction as -a .purchaser, and the donor should be taxed in the same manner as a seller of that stock. This provision will commence to apply to gifts of trading stock made in the current year 1952-53. </para>
                    <para>The position in regard to partnership transactions involving- trading stock also will be clarified. One view previously held was that the transfer of interests in partnership assets, including trading stock, was a constructive sale. In accordance with this view, partners have been taxed on the market value of stock even though there has not been a realized profit out of which the tax could be paid. It is proposed that partners should be given an opportunity to elect, if all the parties unanimously agree, whether tax should be payable on the profit deemed to arise from a transfer of interests in trading stock, or whether the tax liability should be deferred until the stock is actually sold. The proposed legislation will- be made retrospective to the 1st July, 1950, so that partners who have been taxed on profits deemed to have arisen .from transfers since that date may elect, upon unanimous agreement, to have their assessments amended on the alternative basis now proposed. </para>
                    <para>It is proposed to make substantial reductions in the rates of sales tax payable on certain classes of goods. The maximum rate of tax will be reduced from &lt;56&amp; per cent, to 50 per cent.1 and goods now subject to the maximum rate will benefit accordingly. Toilet and cosmetic preparations and toilet requisites, which have hitherto borne tax at the rate of 50 per cent, will, in future, be taxed at the rate of 33-Jr per cent. The tax on sporting equipment and toys and radio receiving sets will be reduced from 33-^ per cent, to 20 per cent. Reductions are also proposed on numerous other classes of goods. The rate of 25 per cent, will be eliminated. The number of rates of tax in operation will be reduced from six to four, namely, 12^ per cent., 20 per cent., 33^ per cent, and 50 per cent. This should afford some relief to those engaged in commerce. </para>
                    <para>Certain further exemptions are also proposed. The most important of these is the allowance of full exemption from sales tax in respect of goods for use by universities and schools which are not conducted for profit. Hitherto such in- stitutions, other than government schools, have enjoyed only a limited exemption of scientific equipment and goods for use for the purpose of tuition. They will now be entitled to exemption of such goods as sporting equipment and general furnishings. The allowance of full exemption is in line with the Government's general policy to assist education. The opportunity is also being taken to remove a number of anomalies arising out of the existing classifications of goods fo.r sales tax purposes. In terms of revenue, the concessions proposed involve an estimated loss of £6,000,000 in a full year, or approximately £5,200,000 in the financial year 1952-53. The new rates will come into force as from the commencement of business to-morrow, the 7th August. </para>
                    <para>Land tax was introduced in 1910 with the avowed purpose of breaking up large rural estates that were not being used to their full commercial advantage. The truth is that to-day by far the greatest proportion of the tax is levied on city land which is already fully developed and which could not be sub-divided even were the owners willing to do so. The Government accordingly proposes to vacate the land tax field on and from the 1st July. 1952. The cost to revenue in the financial year is estimated at £6,250,000. All ' told, the value to taxpayers of all the tax concessions just outlined is estimated to amount to a total of £49,570,000 in. the current financial year. </para>
                    <para>Bringing into account the revenue and expenditure proposals I have outlined, the budget for 1952-53 may be summarized as follows : - </para>

                    </para>
                    <para>Events of the past year have brought acutely to a head the entire problem of Commonwealth-State financial relationships. A fundamental change in prevailing arrangements is obviously necessary. Last year, the Commonwealth provided for the States no less than £314,000,000 and by far the greater part of that amount had to be provided from revenue. This year, the Commonwealth will again have to find for the States at least as much as last year and it should be pointed out that all but a minor part of this enormous sum will be spent on purposes for which the Commonwealth has no direct responsibility and over which it has no administrative control. Clearly the position is radically unsound. The Commonwealth has to raise enormous sums of money for expenditure outside its own constitutional field; the States meanwhile spend vast sums for the raising of which they, as governments, have no responsibility whatever. The Government, therefore, regards a recasting of these arrangements as imperative and us a first step it has informed the States that it is prepared to put them in the position again to raise revenues for their own purposes from income taxation. From time to time all the States have indicated that, they desire income-taxing powers to be returned to them and it now becomes a matter of working out a basis for arrangements under which the major source of revenues can be shared between the Commonwealth and State governments. It will, of course, be one of our objects to avoid documentary duplication and provide the Utmost simplicity for the taxpayer. </para>
                    <para>The Government will take an early opportunity during the present session to amend the legislation which regulates the relations between the Commonwealth  Bank and the trading banks. It also proposes to review the legislation which determines the relationship between the central banking activities of the Commonwealth Bank and its trading section. Whilst there are many minor respects in which alterations to the Commonwealth Bank Act 1945-51 and the Banking Act 1945 are long overdue, the main objects of the proposed amendments will be to remedy certain dangers inherent in the current provisions relating to the special account system and to ensure that the trading activities of the Commonwealth Bank do not involve unfair competition with the trading banks. </para>
                    <para>The development of adverse conditions in the loan market, due principally to the inflationary forces operating in the economy, have made it impossible for governments to borrow at the comparatively low rates of interest which prevailed during the war and post-war years. All governments,, whether Commonwealth or State, are naturally reluctant to pay increased rates of interest, but the trend towards higher rates is world wide, and in their borrowing operations governments must recognize the realities of the market situation. The Commonwealth Bank recently reviewed rates of interest in the light of increases in the coupon rates and market yields on governmental and semi-governmental securities in Australia and also of the rise in rates of interest in London. In the result, as already announced, the order made by the Commonwealth Bank under the National Security (Economic Organization) Regulations fixing maximum rates of interest for bank advances and a number of other commercial lending operations has, with the approval of the Government, been revoked. In current circumstances the Commonwealth Bank does not wish to take further action to fix maximum rates. The trading banks have, however, agreed to observe 5 per cent, per annum as the maximum overdraft rate and not to pay on fixed deposits of various terms more than the rates announced by the Commonwealth Bank. The previous maximum bank overdraft rate was 4$ per cent, per annum. </para>
                    <para>In harmony with this rise in overdraft and fixed deposit rates, it has been decided to increase the rate at which the Commonwealth Bank discounts treasury bills for the Government from f per cent. to 1 per cent, per annum. Similarly, the interest which the Commonwealth Bank pays to the trading banks in respect of the moneys which they hold in special account at the Commonwealth Bank has been raised from 10s. ner cent, to 15s. per cent, per annum. The Commonwealth Savings Bank has also made an all round increase of 5s. per cent, in the rates of interest on deposits. As from the 1st August, the Commonwealth Savings Bank will pay 2£ per cent, per annum on amounts up to £500 and 1£ per cent, pur annum on amounts from £501 to D,000. </para>
                    <para>During 1951-52 Australia's international currency reserves fell from £843,000,000 to £362,000,000. Even with  the  import restrictions announced on the <inline font-style="italic">S-th</inline> March, the total value of imports into Australia during 1951-52 was £1,050,000,000 f.ob., or, adding freight and insurance, £1,197,000,000, thus giving art adverse balance of trade for the year of £530,000,000, and, when all other external transactions for the year were brought into account, a balance of payments deficit of £4S1,000,000. The present reserves of £362,000,000 are none too- large for our requirements and for the present this means that at the very most we cannot afford to spend on imports more than we obtain from exports and the proceeds of overseas borrowing or private investment in Australia. </para>
                    <para>The import restrictions announced on the Sth March are now ' beginning to become fully effective and the immediate problem has been successfully brought under control, although to make our position really safe we must spare no effort to build up our reserves as and when we can. A further objective must be to reduce our deficit with the countries of the dollar area. In this direction we are making our- contribution towards- maintaining the gold and dollar reserves of the sterling area, both by the stringent measures we have adopted to cut down dollar expenditures and by renewed efforts to- increase our dollar earnings from exports-. In addition 'we have; as already announced, arranged to make a. temporary drawing of 30j000,000 dollars from, the International Monetary Fund and have concluded a new 50;000,000 dollars loan agreement with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which will help to finance the import of dollar capital goods for the- development- of our primary and  secondary  industries. The. whole dollarsterling situation will, of course, be considered at the Commonwealth economic conference which is: planned; te take place in London, next November. . </para>
                    <para>Democracy and free enterprise in the modern world tread a precarious path between the twin evils of inflation and unemployment. In Australia we have had experience of both within the past twenty years. We are, perhaps, the mo-re prone to swing one way or the other because we are a young country with a strong urge to progress, and also because we are. so much exposed, through the nature of our trade, to the impact of world conditions. To find and keep amidway path throws a heavy responsibility upon governments. There can b« no more difficult problem than te hah,, as we have tried to halt, a  long-continued  and violent inflation and yet in so doing to avoid an unwanted down-turn in economic activity. It is characteristic of inflation that the longer it goes om and' the stronger it grows, the more its features: become the accustomed and accepted conditions of economic Kie. Plans and. commitments are built upon the belief that, prices will continue to rise and scarcities to persist. When these conditions are brought or come to an end, as- they must some time, expectations are falsified, plans go wrong and losses, are incurred. <inline font-style="italic">[Extension Of time granted..</inline> Left  to  run its course^, inflation wit inevitably bring its- own-, drastic solution in  bankruptcies  and mass-  unemployment  It is- the tassie of.  economic  policy so- to adjust conditions that neither inflation itself nor the- reaction from it will run toextremes'. </para>
