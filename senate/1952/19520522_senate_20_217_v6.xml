            <para> - In the absence of the Minister for National Development, I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs whether there are any differences of opinion between the Australian Government and the Queensland Government on the efficacy of the Burdekin Valley development scheme. If so, and if those differences can be overcome, will the Australian Government give an assurance to the people of Queensland that money will be forthcoming to carry out the scheme in full? </para>

                    <para>- I am not familiar with the details of the matter to which the honorable senator has referred. I understand that there have been some differences of opinion on the best method of developing the Burdekin Valley. It is clear, however, that both the Queensland Government and the Australian Government are eager to proceed with the development not only of the Burdekin Valley but also of Queensland generally. The honorable senator may have read that, at the last two meetings of the Loan Council, the Commonwealth has been unprecedentedly generous, and has agreed to forgo its own share of loan moneys in favour of the States in order that they may proceed with their works programme. In fact the Commonwealth will underwrite the difference between the cost of the agreed works programmes of the States and the funds that will be available to the States from the loan market. That has not been done by any previous Australian Government and I think that the people of Australia appreciate the Commonwealth's action even if the States do not. </para>

                        <para>- The shipping of fruit from the southern ports of Tasmania during the last fruit season has been considerably hampered by the activities of certain organisations on the waterfront. The situation could be relieved considerably by the reconstruction of the Port Huon wharf. Has an application by the Tasmanian Government for finance to permit that work to proceed come to the notice of the Minister representing the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture? Has he informed himself personally of the need for that undertaking, and can he indicate when a decision is likely to be made on the matter? </para>

                        <para>- Representations have been made on this subject, and during my trip to Tasmania recently I visited Port Huon with the honorable member for Franklin (Mr. Falkinder), in whose electorate the port is situated, to see how far the scheme had progressed. I regard the completion of the jetty a; a matter of very great importance because it is needed to relieve the pressure during the busy fruit export season. The representations that have been made have been placed before the Treasurer, and I hope to receive a decision in a few days. </para>

In view of the severe increases in postal, telegraph and telephone rates that were imposed under the last budget, is the Minister jn a position to indicate whether there has been buyer resistance to the heavy charges with a consequent fall in turnover and a relative decline in revenue? If statistics are available, would the Minister inform me of the number of telegrams and phonograms that were despatched through the General Post Office, Brisbane, for the periods 1st July, 1950, to 30th April, 1951, and 1st July, 1951, to 30th April, 1952? </para>

This matter has been brought before the Minister on numerous occasions by people who are interested in the wool industry. Recently, a new aspect of the matter has been brought to light. Dry cleaners have found that, because of the many substances that have been incorporated with wool, suits have been ruined by dry cleaning. As the Minister has stated that the labelling of textiles cannot be enforced until all States have uniform textile labelling legislation, will the Minister inform the Senate whether any State Parliament already has the required legislation on its statutebooks? </para>

                        <para>- On the 2nd May I attended a conference of State Ministers concerned in this matter in Melbourne. One Minister was absent, but I indicated to those present the type of legislation and regulations that the Australian Government considered could be effectively operated and policed. The proposals did not quite conform with what the States wanted. The States have power to make their own regulations for the labelling of textiles, but it is highly desirable that imported articles should be subject to the same regulations as those of local manufacture. I hope that, as a result of the conference, the States will adopt a policy in uniformity with that of the Commonwealth. </para>

Many of them have had telephone facilities installed on their doctor's advice. I understand that a very small number of them would be affected by this proposal and that the loss of revenue to the Government would be negligible while the assistance that would be given to deserving cases would be great. </para>

                    <para>The circular also stated that the <inline font-style="italic">Gape York</inline> service was to be used for the transport of all bulk and dry stores, and that the consignment by mail boat of any stores other than fresh meat, butter and vegetables would not be allowed. Can the Minister give any reason why the  Deputy  Director of Lighthouses and Navigation in Tasmania has notified all lighthousekeepers on the Tasmanian coast that they should order five months' supply of goods to be delivered in September instead of ordering three months' supply as formerly? Is it intended to cut out the December vessel that always used to take in the Christmas supplies? Does the Minister consider that men who are doing such an important job in the interests of shipping should be treated in such a contemptible manner? Will the Minister do his best to ensure that the three-monthly service is continued? </para>

From time to time recommendations have gone forward from that committee to State Ministers administering road traffic laws and to the Minister for the Interior, who administers the motor traffic ordinances of the Australian Capital Territory. I hope that during the current sittings of some of the State parliaments legislation will be introduced to implement the committee's recommendations. I have been informed by responsible officers of my department that the committee has performed much useful work. I shall obtain for the honorable senator an up-to-date report on the progress that has been made as a result of the recommendations of the committee, and furnish it to him as soon as possible. Both the Commonwealth and State authorities are eager to take whatever action may be necessary to reduce the dreadful toll of the road in this country. </para>

                        <para>- Will the Minister for Shipping and Transport inform the Senate whether it is a fact that M.V. <inline font-style="italic">Lautoka</inline> is to proceed to Japan for repairs and the installation of new deck plates? Is it true that the Government dockyard at Newcastle, Mort's Dock and Engineering Company Limited, of Sydney, and private shipping yards, submitted tenders to the agents, W. E. Carpenter and Company Limited, to carry out the work for about Â£15,000, but that it will be performed in Japan for a much lower price? Is this the first fruits of the treaty of peace with Japan that was ratified recently by this Parliament? Is the Minister aware that a continuation of this practice will cause unemployment in the metal trades and shipbuilding industry which will prove calamitous to our economy and be a retrograde step in Australia's defence programme? </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator's question smacks of cheap propaganda. I have no desire to dictate where Senator Ashley should have his repairs carried out, and therefore I do not think that it would be proper for the Government to attempt to dictate to private enterprise in such matters. The price factor is important in these matters. I remind the honorable senator that we are short of several thousand men for naval construction work and repairs. The naval programme is behind. There is adequate employment in this country. </para>

In 1905, this Parliament appointed a royal commission to inquire into patent medicines and secret drugs, but owing to lack of constitutional power little effect could be given to the recommendations of the commission. Since then the people, by referendum, have empowered this Parliament to control drugs. In view of the serious effects of certain patent medicines upon the health of the Australian people will the Minister appoint a royal commission to inquire into the patent medicine trade in Australia? </para>

The press yesterday reported a series of extraordinary statements by Mrs. Ian Anderson, who is paying a four months' visit to Australia under the sponsorship of the trust and who, during her stay here, is to be the guest of the Country Women's Association. Seemingly, this lady has come from Scotland with the object of giving us information regarding that country. Is the trust financed by the Government? Is any control exercised over the persons selected by the trust to come here? If so, what precautions are taken to ensure that they shall be qualified to speak on behalf of the countries that they claim to represent? Mrs. Anderson is reported to have  made the startling statement that nearly everybody in the highlands of Scotland wears the kilt. That is sheer rubbish. Steps should be taken to ensure that those who come here on such visits shall be better informed. Although the Minister's forbears originally came from Ireland- </para>

                            <para>- I am not familiar with the Imperial Relations Trust, which has been referred to by the honorable senator, but I imagine that it is a voluntary organization. To what degree, if any, it is sponsored by the United Kingdom Government or the Australian Government I am not aware, but I am sure that if it sends persons out here from Scotland, it is prepared to give us something that is worth taking. In the free world, ingress to and egress from the various countries is still fairly free, provided that one conforms to the passport requirements and obligations. I hope that such freedom of movement will always continue. If the honorable senafor suggests that the people to whom he has referred are coming to this country for subversive reasons- </para>

                        <para>- Has the attention of the Minister  representing  the Minister for External Affairs been drawn to a recent statement made by Senator Sparkman, who is a member of the Tinted States Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, to the effect that the Pacific pact does not impose any  obligations  on America in the event of an attack being made upon Australia, but that the incident would merely be noted? Is this not in direct conflict with the views of the Australian Government which, as I understand them, are that an attack upon a country which has subscribed to the pact will be considered as an attack upon all such countries? Does the Minister agree that further negotiations should be commenced with a view to having a statement made which will clarify the position and declare precisely the meaning of the pact? </para>

                        <para>- If my recollection serves me aright, this question was discussed at some length in the House of Representatives, and also in the Senate, when the treaty was being ratified by the Parliament. I think that the position was made clear that it was not possible to impose on the United States of America a completely automatic obligation to go to war, because the fulfilment of certain functions is required by the Senate of that country. Consequently, the reciprocal obligations undertaken by both parties were in line with the limitations imposed by the United States Constitution. When the bill was before this chamber, I commented on the fact that the written words seemed to me to be far less important than the spirit in which such treaties are entered into. In this instance, I have no doubt that both parties to the treaty will fulfil completely the obligations that they have assumed. </para>

                        <para>- I preface a question to the Minister for Repatriation by pointing out that during the past five or six years I have, on many occasions in the Senate, referred to the payment of compensation and subsistence allowance to ex-prisoners of war held by the Japanese. I have also expressed dissatisfaction with the report that was presented to the Parliament concerning that matter. Has the Minister seen a copy of the questionnaire that has been sent to all ex-prisoners of war? Is he aware that great indignation is being expressed by ex-prisoners of war because of the nature of the questions they are required to answer if they wish to claim assistance from the Â£250,000 which has been made available by this Government? Is it true that  it is practically impossible for a person to fulfil all the requirements of the questionnaire unless he is destitute? Will the Minister pause an inquiry to be made with a view to having the questionnaire withdrawn and a new approach made to ex-prisoners of war regarding the use of the fund? </para>

I shall be glad to bring the matter to the notice of the department concerned. I inform the honorable senator that the Repatriation Department does not administer the prisoner of war trust account. It is a separate trust which I understand is under the control of the Prime Minister's Department or the Treasury. However, I shall pass the honorable senator's question on to the appropriate authority. </para>

Will the Attorney-General assure the Senate that if it is not possible to remove the plant to Tasmania, it will not be transferred to one of the major oil companies on the mainland? Is it not a fact that a deputation which consisted of technical experts assured the Minister for National Development, the Minister for Labour and National Service and the Minister for Supply last week that the plant was in first-class condition? Is the destruction of the Glen Davis shale oil  industry a part of the desocialization policy of the Menzies Government, or is that industry being destroyed for the benefit of one of the major oil companies or of the oil companies in general? </para>

                        <para>. - The Opposition supports this bill, which proposes to increase the salary of the Australian High Commissioner in London by Â£500 per annum. It is rather amazing that the salary of that office has stood at Â£3,000 for 40 years. Obviously, the position has been grievously underpaid, particularly in recent years. Had that salary been the entire remuneration of the occupant of the office. I doubt whether he would have been able to do full justice to his duties. A large part of his work consists of social activities, and expenditure on entertainment is considerable. I take it that the High Commissioner's salary is subject to income tax in Australia, but not in Great Britain, and that, apart from his salary, the High Commissioner receives an entertainment allowance. </para>

I am sorry, too, that, in attempting to  improve  the position, the Government proposes to increase the salary by only a niggardly Â£500 a year. In view of wage and salary increases and rising costs over the years, the Government would only be doing the right thing by the occupant of this office and by Australia itself, if it were to double his salary, regardless of whatever other allowances are payable. </para>

                            - I thank the Senate for the manner in which it has received this measure. The salary of the Australian High Commissioner in London is subject to income tax at Australian rates. In addition to his salary, he receives an entertainment allowance and the use of  an  official residence. I agree with the sentiments that have been expressed by Opposition speakers.

It is a machinery measure which provides for the adequate description of all types of liquor whether they are matured spirits, whether they are imported in bottle or bulk, and whether they are of Australian origin, or not. I think that the Government's proposal must have the support of every honorable senator. The bill exempts from the requirement of description of maturity certain other liquors which do not require to be matured in wood. The Opposition cordially supports this measure. </para>

                        <para>. - The Opposition very cordially supports this measure which is designed to permit the Australian War Memorial to be used for the establishment of a permanent record of Australia's activity in all wars. I believe that every honorable senator will join with me in congratulating the Board of Management of the Australian War Memorial at Canberra on the magnificent record that it has established and preserved. One cannot even stroll through the Australian War Memorial without feelings of humility, reverence, and pride in Australians. In that atmosphere, and seeing what is to be seen there, one is reminded of the birth of Australian nationhood. I think that a truly Australian national spirit was born in the war of 1914-18 and that it came to maturity in the recent holocaust of 1939-45. It would be a good thing if every Australian were given an opportunity to visit the Australian  War  Memorial at Canberra. Any person with only a spark of pride in his country would have it stimulated very quickly into a flame upon visiting that memorial; and if any Australian, through thoughtlessness, did not have that spark of pride I think that a stroll through the memorial would speedily enkindle it. There are certain machinery provisions in the bill relating to the board of management which will make changes in its personnel easier to effect. On behalf of the Opposition I cordially support the measure. </para>

I agree with the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline> that one cannot approach such a memorial as this other than in a spirit of the utmost humility. In this materialistic age it is of fundamental importance that this National Parliament should ensure that the memorial shall be perpetuated and enlarged. So far, the memorial refers only to the activities of those who participated in World War I. It is also intended that the memorial shall perpetuate the activities of those who served in the second world war, and those who are now fighting in Korea. I especially commend the Government for giving consideration to South African War veterans. </para>

The national capital will in the future be visited by students, both Australian and from overseas, who are interested in the doings of illustrious Australians, and it is desirable that they should have access to records housed in the memorial.

The Opposition supports the measure. I can see no benefit in discussing the details of the bill when we do not oppose it, and have no special requests to make. The Opposition has, from time to time, paid proper tribute to the men of the mercantile marine who kept the sea lanes open and maintained lines of communication during the war at great risk to themselves. I take this opportunity to repeat the tribute which the Opposition believes is due to these men. </para>

                        <para>. - As one who spent 30 years at sea, I have a particular interest in this bill, the main purpose of which is to embody in statute form, certain regulations that were introduced under the National Security Act for the purpose of conferring pensions and other benefits upon men of the mercantile marine. Wo in Australia have reason to congratulate ourselves that there is in existence hero provision for conferring such benefits upon  seamen.  The former Menzies Government is to be commended for having brought in the provision, although I have no doubt that had a Labour government been in office at the time it would have done the same. In other parts of the world, the men of the mercantile marine have been, in general, ignored. Throughout the whole of the first world war seamen whose ship was torpedoed received no pay from the time of the sinking of the ship, even though a considerable time might elapse between then and their getting home. All the thanks they got for their service, and the danger they had undergone, was to have their pay stopped the moment their ship was sunk. I congratulate the Australian Parliament upon having led the world by passing this very worthwhile legislation. </para>

                        <para>. - This small bill is necessary because the War Service Land Settlement Agreement Act 1945 was declared invalid by the High Court of Australia in its judgment on the case <inline font-style="italic">Magennis</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">the Commonwealth.</inline> Since that time the Commonwealth has been paying just compensation along the lines of the original agreement. Now this measure has been brought down to validate whatever action may have been taken. The purpose of the bill is to authorize the Minister to pay to the States moneys voted by the Parliament for war service land settlement in the various States. When it was before the House of Representatives a debate ensued on the New South Wales system of acquiring land for this purpose. It is not my intention to deal with that aspect of the matter, as sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof. The Opposition does not oppose the passage of the bill. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not wish to deal with this measure from the point of view of law or any  esesntial  principle. I take this opportunity to refute certain inaccuracies and innuendoes that were voiced in another place against the policy of the Queensland Government in connexion with the resumption of properties for the settlement of ex-servicemen. Allegations have been made by land-holders that the Queensland Government is pursuing a socialistic policy to deprive them of their land at unfair valuations. Other equally inaccurate charges have been levelled in another place against the Queensland Government, and the suggestion has been made also that that Government has no interest in encouraging primary settlement and production. It has also been stated that the Queensland Government is still acquiring land at 1942 valuation. To raise this matter in the Senate is proper,  because this chamber is the custodian of the rights and interests of the States. Since 1950 the Queensland Government lias acquired properties for the purpose of the land settlement of ex-servicemen at current market valuation. Prior to 1950, but subsequent to 1942, land values were pegged. The only assessable market value was the 1942 valuation. In 1950 land sales control was abolished in Queensland, and from then onwards the market value has been the basis of compensation payable for resumed land. Therefore, I lay bare the falsehood that has been so wrongly uttered in another place. The practice of the Queensland Government has been one of complete equity in resumptions. In most instances the amount of compensation, payable has been determined by negotiation. Where negotiation has not succeeded the matter has been submitted to the Land Court, a judicial body that functions under the Queensland Lands /lets. An appeal against a decision of the Land Court may be made to the Land Appeal Court, and if desired ultimately to the Full Bench of the Supreme Court. In the initial stages the Land Court decided resumption values, which became the norm and the basis for subsequent negotiation. There has been no attempt by the Queensland Government at expropriation of land for the settlement of ex-servicemen, in defiance of equity. I know that for the purpose of negotiation the vendor usually asks a high price while the resuming authority naturally offers a comparatively low figure. Both sides allow a wide margin for negotiation and ultimate settlement. Recently, certain determinations were made by the Land Court in Brisbane. They show that a norm has actually been struck. The court's determination was close to the figure offered initially by the Crown. In one instance, the amount offered by the Crown was Â£13,196, the amount claimed by the person whose property was being resumed was Â£35,000, and the ultimate figure, determined by the Land Court was approximately Â£21,000. In. other words, the court reduced the claim by Â£14,000 and increased the Crown offer by Â£8,000. In the second case, the Crown offer was Â£6,700, the claim initially was Â£15,000 and the ultimate determination was- Â£10,800. To say that the QueenslandGovernment is resuming properties but not giving ex-servicemen an opportunity to acquire economic propositions is coin.pletely unfair. That contention is nit tenable because the State is bound <inline font-style="italic">by iti</inline> agreement with the Commonwealth which lays down certain specificconditions. One condition is that the property shall be an economicproposition for the ex-serviceman. It is fantastic to suggest that Queensland desires to depart from the ordinary principle of good administration in settling e&gt;: -servicemen on the land. I repeat that I do not want to go into the details of the allegations that have been made. I have addressed myself only to a consideration of the principles involved, and I have tried to show that these completelyinaccurate, careless, and malign insinuations do tremendous damage. They destroy the faith of many young men in the sincerity of purpose of the Queensland Government. They should not bemad e; but they are easily refuted because they are not in accordance with fact. I trust that honorable senators, when they consider matters of this kind in this chamber, will stick closely to the facts and present a clear and accurate picture of the circumstances. I assure honorable senators and the public at large that theQueeusland Government is resuming properties for war service land settlement purposes at current market values, that it is placing young men on properties that are economically sound and is endeavouring to do justice to all parties concerned. </para>

                    <para class="block">Thus, the bill will give to the Minister in charge of war service land settlement  very wide authority to control the administration by the States of the war service land settlement scheme. The very contentious subject of the land acquisitions for the scheme has not been fully discussed in this chamber, as it was in another place. The progress of the scheme throughout Australia has been impeded by the selfishness of land-holders who do not use their land to the best purpose, but hold out for the highest price for their land and use every technical and legal loophole to evade their responsibilities. This scheme has a twofold purpose; first, it will enable us to bring about a much-desired increase of food production; and, secondly, it will enable the Government to honour the promise made to members of the fighting forces during the war that, after the cessation of hostilities, those who had the requisite experience would be assisted to settle on the land. There is a tremendous back-log of applications for the allotment of properties. In Tasmania, in particular, the scheme has progressed very slowly. Unfortunately the Government of that State has been forced to include marginal areas in the scheme. It is carrying out experiments in areas that are at present unsuitable for agriculture or grazing, but it hopes that, within four or five years, these experiments will be successful and that it will be possible to utilize the land for the settlement of ex-servicemen. </para>
                    <para>Within 35 or 40 miles of Launceston there are 300,000 acres of well-watered agricultural land in an assured rainfall area, the original owners of which have bequeathed large areas to the members of their families in order to escape their obligations to make the land available to ex-servicemen. The State Government has not gone far enough in its efforts to acquire the land for ex-service land settlement purposes. The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Sullivan),</inline> in his statement on the Government's economic policy last night, said that we are living in a period of price booms. Owners of land suitable for the settlement of ex-servicemen, in an effort to get the last pound of flesh from ex-servicemen, are bitterly opposing the attempts of the States to scale down land values. Under the provisions of this measure, the Minister  in charge of ex-service land settlement will be able to prevent the States from scaling down land values in periods of inflation. The additional expense involved in resumptions for the purposes of this scheme will eventually be borne by the ex-servicemen, as was the case after World War I., when properties were purchased at boom prices, subdivided and allotted to ex-servicemen, countless hundreds of whom subsequently walked off their properties without a " bob ". The worst feature of the earlier scheme was that in many instances the excess money paid to the holders of big properties was used to repurchase the properties after they had been abandoned by the ex-servicemen. </para>
                    <para>We have not tackled this problem in a workmanlike manner. In my view increased production of food in Australia is of more importance than is the manufacture of defence material. The United States of America and other friendly nations are better equipped than we are to produce our requirements of arms and armaments. We have the God-given advantage of broad acres and a people who have a kinship with the soil and we should be able to produce much more food than we require for our own needs. As the loading of ex-servicemen with a burden of debt for land purchased in periods of inflation was proved to be wrong in the past, so it will be proved to be wrong again. The provisions of this measure will bring a situation about similar to that which existed after World War I., when the land monopolists who lived in the cities and employed managers to farm their properties extracted the last pound of flesh from ex-servicemen. Any move to alter the existing law which enables the States to peg the price of land suitable for ex-service land settlement is a retrograde step. </para>

                        <para>. - This bill gives us an opportunity to integrate our thoughts about the ex-service land settlement scheme generally. The Menzies Government can take credit for having greatly improved the scheme inasmuch as, when it assumed office, the scheme contained all the elements of the stereotyped pattern of socialism which have now been eliminated. If we are to consider this measure in its proper perspective, we must delve into the history of the scheme. The original legislation was introduced by the Chifley Government shortly after the presentation of a not too well known rep art by some of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley's</inline> myrmidons on the subject of housing which recommended the general socialization of land. The Chifley Government forced upon the agent States, some of them socialist States which were not too unwilling to accept it, a provision that land for war service land settlement purposes should be held on perpetual lease so that the Crown could retain ownership, reassess the rent payable in respect of it every ten years, and thus relegate ex-servicemen to the position of permanent tenants. It is to the great credit of the Menzies Government that, immediately after it assumed office, it insisted that freehold land should be made available as an inalienable right to those ex-servicemen who wished to own their own land. Doctrinaire Labour governments think that they are performing a public service by expropriating civilian land-owners who, in many instances, have been pioneers. By their own efforts during, perhaps, 50 years they have acquired an asset. I am jealous to protect the rights of men who have acquired property by methods typical of the pioneers. </para>

                    <para>I wish to refer particularly to the application of this bill to the State of Tasmania. The first legislation concerning war service land settlement required that land should be resumed at the value of the land as stated in the State capital roll, which was then obsolete, in many instances, by as much as 20 or 30 years. A land-owner was required to yield up his land at that figure, plus 5 per cent. When I was a member of -the Tasmanian Parliament, the government of the day to its credit, accepted suggestions that it should repeal that legislation. Thereupon, resumptions were lawful when made at current market values. </para>

                            <para>- If there is any sorrow that I can share with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> I shall be happy to do so, as long as he maintains silence. The Tasmanian statute of 1950 represents the second thoughts of the Tasmanian Labour Government on this subject. The High Court of Australia, in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Magennis</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">The Commonwealth,</inline> demonstrated to the Labour Government of New South Wales that the Constitution requires that property shall be acquired on no basis other than just terms. After that lesson had been given by the High Court, the Victorian Government devised a method whereby implementation of the decision could be avoided. However, it is interesting to consider the action that was taken by the Tasmanian Parliament after the judgment of the High Court had been delivered. It provided a funk hole by means of section 57 of its 1950 legislation. By virtue of that section it proudly adopted an iniquitous system, in defiance of the High Court ruling that it is the constitutional right of every Australian property owner to be compensated on just terms if his property is resumed. I am prepared to leave to any court of justice in this country the assessment of just terms. I raise my voice here to-day in contempt of the Executive which seeks to impose upon land-owners expropriation of land except on just terms. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> wishes to aline himself with those authorities, he will demonstrate that he has no sense of justice. In the legislation to which I have referred, the Tasmanian Parliament provided that - </para>

                    <para class="block">That legislation -was enacted in November, 1950, as a direct and contemptible attempt to exercise State power in order to deprive land-owners of the benefit of just terms, although the High Court had declared that, for the purposes of the scheme, the Australian Constitution guarantees to every Australian who owns property that the Commonwealth, or the States acting as agents for it, shall not acquire his property on other than just terms. </para>
                    <para>I have risen to speak in this debate because last week I listened to the broadcast proceedings of the House of Representatives, from which it appeared that New South Wales is the only State in which this unjust provision is being exercised. I want it to be known that the Parliament of Tasmania has provided, in express terras, for acquisition of land on the basis of 1942 land values. </para>
                    <para>Last night, during discussion of the economic policy of the Government, honorable senators heard something of the doctrinaire socialism that is practised by members of the Opposition. If I interpret correctly the remarks that were made by the Leader of the  Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator</inline> McKenna),  he believes that arapidly increasing basic wage is the greatest menace to the Australian economy at the present time. The honorable senator might inform the Senate  of  the basic wage, as the index of economic value, -on the 10th February, 1942, and compare it with the basic wage as it stands to-day. If he does so, honorable senators will be able to see how vacuous is the contention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> that the farmer who thinks that he should not lose his farm on the basis of 1942 values is avaricious and should be suppressed. Obviously value is one of those elusive things that can be established only in relation to existing circumstances. If a man is to be turned out of one farm to-day, he wants to be paid enough to enable him to buy another farm to-morrow so that he may continue to earn a livelihood, and ensure for his sons the future for which he has worked all his life. If Labour seeks to destroy that spirit, I am proud to be able to speak in this Parliament in opposition to Labour's policy. I warn honorable senators opposite that they will not get very far in the Australian electorate if they pursue their present arguments. Surely land-owners are entitled to just recompense if their properties are to be resumed. The purpose of this bill is to ensure that Commonwealth funds shall not be misused in expropriating .properties at half their current value. </para>
                    <para>Having made that clear, I wish to refer to one other argument which I did not think any one would shame himself by expressing publicly to-day. Proponents of that argument have revealed a complete misunderstanding of the whole basis of the War Service Land Settlement Scheme, which is, of course, that the nation which owes its continued existence to members of the armed forces should provide ex-servicemen with opportunities to go on the land and to earn a reasonable living. The difference between the capital expenditure incurred by the Treasury in resuming and improving land, and the price at which that land is made available to ex-servicemen, is written off at the expense of the Australian taxpayer, and I am sure that every taxpayer is proud to mak, his contribution to this worthy cause. My contribution to this debate has been somewhat longer than I intended it to be, but I fear that my remarks were protracted by the stimulation given to me by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne.</inline> I am glad that the Government is insisting that the money that it is making available for war service land settlement shall be used only by agencies that will guarantee just terms to land-owners whose properties are to be expropriated. </para>

                        <para>.. - Probably no legislation is more liable to be the vehicle foi attempts to make party political capital than are measures providing repatriation benefits for ex-servicemen. That has been so, regardless of the political complexion of the various governments that have sponsored such proposals. However, I see no justification for the overwhelming political bias that has been shown in this debate by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> AntiLabour administrations held office in South Australia both at the end of World War J., and at the end of World War II. The present South Australian Government has candidly conceded that grave mistakes were made in soldier settlement schemes after the 1914-18 war, and has earnestly endeavoured to avoid a repetition of those mistakes. My only complaint is with the slowness of the present scheme. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearson</inline> who has come to our midst from the Parliament of South Australia comparatively recently - for the good or otherwise of the nation I have yet to determine, but if he continues to support this Government I shall not be much longer in making up my mind - will agree that the operation of the war service land settlement scheme in-so-far ms South Australia is concerned is a credit to those responsible for it. However, I am sure that no one will quarrel with me  when I say that ex-servicemen are becoming a little restless because of the slowness of the scheme. A matter such as this should not be the subject of party wrangling. We should all <inline font-style="italic">he</inline> united in our efforts to ensure that there shall be the least possible delay in making land available to ex-servicemen who offered their lives for their country. Our first consideration should be the needs of the ex-servicemen, and debates that reek of partisanship contribute nothing to a solution of the problem. I understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne's</inline> outlook. Regardless of values, if land cannot be made available to ex-servicemen, on an economic basis, no soldier settlement scheme can succeed, and I have nothing but contempt for any Parliament, State or Federal, which stands idly by while large tracts of suitable country which would make ideal holdings for hundreds of soldier settlers, remain unproductive. In South Australia, the aggregation of large estates has, in the past, forced not only soldier settlers but also the sons of pioneers who devoted their lives to the development of new lands, to take up holdings situated even beyond the marginal areas, where they have not had even a snowball's chance of success. After listening to the Minister's second-reading speech on this measure and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright's</inline> contribution to the debate to-day, I shall be hard to convince that the old conservative line of thought does not still exist. It seems that this measure would not have been introduced had it not been for a long standing difference of opinion between the Labour Government of New South Wales and the Australian Government. It was refreshing indeed to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne,</inline> exercising his prerogative as a defender of State rights, recount to the Senate what is happening in Queensland. </para>

                    <para>Thousands of men who returned to this country from active service in our armed forces earnestly want to go on the land - not under the land as many ex-servicemen of World War I. did as the result of the hardships that they endured under the old soldier settlement scheme. Unfortunately many applicants for allotments have now been waiting for many years. It is regrettable that every time this subject is debated in any parliament, State or Federal, the argument seems to hinge on the fair value of lands which, at present, are not producing to anything like their full capacity. We should all remember that but for the sacrifices of our fighting men, values to-day might have been very different from what they are. To suggest that we on this side of the chamber have ever attempted to deny a property-owner just recompense for his land is too stupid for words. It is regrettable indeed that whilst so many ex-servicemen are waiting for farms, hundreds of thousands of acres of fertile country remain undeveloped. However, if land resumptions have to be made on 1952 values, ex-servicemen will have little chance of establishing successful enterprises. Once again I express my disgust and contempt at the heat that has been engendered in this debate and at the tory partisanship displayed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator "Wright.</inline> I hope that the bill will be passed. It may do some good in a certain State. </para>

                        <para>. - I have no desire to delay the passage of this measure. ,1 am prompted to offer a few brief comments only because of what has been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> Notwithstanding <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright's</inline> boyish charm, I am afraid that he is a disturbing factor in this chamber. The honorable senator brought all his extraordinary eloquence to bear on the question of acquiring land on just terms. No other honorable senator on either side of the chamber has suggested that land should be acquired on other than just terms. But <inline font-weight="bold">.Senator Wright</inline> referred to Opposition members as landed gentry or capitalists and then accused them of wanting to confiscate property. Being a solicitor, I suppose lie can have it both ways. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Honorable senators in this chamber represent the States of the Commonwealth. I remember that at the advent of federation the States insisted on the establishment of the Senate for the purpose of preserving and protecting their lights. The successful settlement of the land and the development of its industries is the responsibility of the States. It is unfortunate that for quite a long time the Commonwealth and the States failed to do their duty collectively and to fulfil their responsibility to the people of Australia. They have argued constantly and have shown great hostility to one another. The people have a right to expect them to be more united in dealing with the problems of the nation. The cost of resumed land is a very important matter which must receive serious consideration. The Australian Government should remember that the sovereign governments of the States are elected by the people and are responsible for the determination of policy. Despite this fact the Australian Government has decided not to co-operate with the States unless they do as that Government tells them. </para>
                    <para>I do not want any section of the community to be dealt with unfairly, but I have vivid recollections of the effect of land settlement immediately after World </para>
                    <para class="block">War I. During that period the Government had a most trying and difficult time. It had to appoint committees of inquiry and had constantly to reduce the value of properties because soldier settlers were unable to make a living, due to the fact that they had paid too much for the land in the first instance. We do not want to repeat that process. Is it not the responsibility of the States to settle people on the land and maintain and increase primary production? It is a great pity that the Commonwealth and the States cannot come to an amicable arrangement and avoid the conflicts which are doing no good to this country and which are discouraging a lot of people. </para>
                    <para>With all the assurance of a solicitor. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> referred to leasehold tenures. As a farmer he is an excellent solicitor. I have been associated with activity on the land all my life, and 1 know of the struggle that takes place there. I know of men who, after working their farms for some time, have had to leave them because, in the first instance, they had paid too much for them. It was not that they were not goo. farmers, but that they did not have a knowledge of the economic condition ot the country and of the world. The Government must guard against a repetition of such occurrences. It is a physical impossibility for a working man's son to acquire a farm. I know of a one-man farm in Victoria which cost Â£16,000. Many of the successful farmers of this country came from working class families, but what hope have the sons of working men of getting a farm at present ? There is some virtue in leasehold tenure because, in the first instance, one does not need a large amount of money to commence a farm under that tenure. The Government of Queensland allows settlers to have land at a modest rental, so that men do not require a lot of capital to become farmers. It was in those circumstances that I became a farmer. I was one of a large working-class family and would not have had a chance to become a farmer if I had had to pay the price that is demanded for farms at present. This national parliament should give some thought to the subject of the successful settlement of soldiers and others on the land. </para>
                    <para>I have always been an advocate of orderly marketing and the stabilization of prices. Fluctuating market conditions may be all right for some people, but they are to the great disadvantage of the working farmer. It is better for him to have a stabilized market. If a man were to buy a farm at present inflated values and prices should then recede, what chance would he have of being able to carry on? It does not matter how hard he may work, if the price that he receives for his product is not adequate he cannot be a successful farmer. The outstanding problem of this country is its successful development. In order to accomplish this we must have a lot more small farmers. The States are faced with tremendous difficulties. If men take up land in distant parts of the States they find that transport facilities and other conveniences do not exist, and in these times of shortages it is most difficult to obtain the materials that are required for the successful development of a farm. The Government has expressed itself in favour of land settlement but has been silent in regard to orderly marketing or the stabilization of prices or any other plan that would give security to the man on the land. These principles are a part of the policy of the Labour party and it is only by their implementation that people can be successfully settled on the land. The prices that are being asked for land to-day are altogether unreasonable. Consequently, the State governments have had to exercise caution in resuming land for soldier settlement. If settlers' farms are over capitalized they will require higher prices for their products in order to make a living. I bought my farm at a time when prices where high. I had no alternative, and I had a long struggle before I was able to pay for it. Many settlers who deserve better treatment could have the same experience. </para>
                    <para>The land must be .successfully settled by conscientious men in order to bring benefit to the nation and satisfaction to the people. When the nation has decided, that these people should be settled on the land, what other authority than the people's own representatives, the State governments, should determine the fair value of resumed land? I regret that the Australian Government has assumed a dictatorial attitude to the States in connexion with this matter, and that honorable senators opposite who frequently talk about the rights of the States are now very silent in regard to those rights. My main concern is that the land settlement schemes should be successful and that men who go on the land with a conscientious desire to make good should succeed. If they are burdened with heavy capital costs that will be a physical impossibility. As I have stated, I know of a one-man farm in Victoria which cost Â£16,000. If a man had as much capital as that he would be foolish to settle on the land. But even half the price of that farm is not available to the average working man and, consequently, he is not able to obtain land. Practical men are required to work the land properly and in Queensland some of the best farming men have been those who gravitated to farming from working class families. Because of the system of tenure adopted in that State, they have been able to acquire land and hold it for a reasonable rental. </para>
                    <para>I know that the bill will be accepted by this chamber but I contend that it is the responsibility of the Government to refrain from trying to force the States to adopt a certain policy. The Government should co-operate with the States with a view to achieving a satisfactory solution of the problems associated with land settlement. The Chifley Government had very little difficulty with the States. It obtained the co-operation of all State governments, whether Liberal or Labour. At that time there was no open conflict between one legislative body and another. The Government would be well advised to consider the need for keeping down costs of production, because our prosperity depends upon our economic relations with the rest of the world. We should do everything possible to bring down those costs. The time for complacency has passed. If we are to hold this country and develop it a determined effort is called for from every one, property-owners, workers and managers alike. The economic honeymoon is over, and the time has now come when we must all get back to work. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not want to see heat injected info this debate. All honorable senators agree that there should be a land settlement scheme for ex-servicemen. It is their just and proper reward. The war-time governments told servicemen that when the- war was over everything would be done to settle them suitably in civil life. This problem of the settlement of ex-servicemen is not novel. It has its roots deep in antiquity, and after every war the settlement of ex-servicemen has had to be undertaken by governments. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>When the war ended, I was the custodian of certain family interests in a property in Victoria. At that time a Labour government was in power there. I believe in closer settlement. Land which is used for purposes the need for which has passed, or is passing, should be made available to serve the needs of the community. The property to which I have referred, amounting to about 10,000 acres, was one of the first to be offered to the government, for the settlement of ex-servicemen. It is one thing to make such an offer in accordance with one's principles; it is another thing for a government to acquire land on terms which are arbitrarily fixed in accordance with certain ideological concepts rather than with justice. The price of the land to which T have referred, was fixed, perhaps on unjust terms, but it was accepted in the belief that it is the duty of citizens to make some contribution towards the cost of settling ex-servicemen The trouble is that those who believe that there is no such thing as a right to property are disposed to take such an example ns a precedent. Their appetite grows with what they feed on. They go on and. acquire other substantial interests because one land owner accepted the obligation to make land available. Howover, that is all over and done with, and T mention it now only to emphasize my interest in this question. </para>
                    <para>I was stung into protest when I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> describe land-holders as greedy and brutal exploiters who are demanding their pound of flesh, who seek to grind ex-servicemen into the earth and to saddle them with a load of hopeless debt. I am sure that that is not the attitude of land-owners in general. How ever, it is instinctive for land-owners, who have developed their own properties, to be attached to their land. A man who, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Courtice,</inline> takes up virgin country,, or country that had been only partly developed, and who toils on it so that every fence post, every furrow, and every brick in his house represents the expenditure of so much sweat and labour, cannot but resent any attempt by a government to deprive him of his land on other than just terms. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Courtice</inline> would be the first to object to the taking of his property on anything but just terms. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline> accurately expressed the feelings of honorable senators generally on this subject of the resumption of land. We agree that, in certain circumstances, it is necessary to resume land. No honorable senator objects to the principle of acquiring land for ex-servicemen. I go further than that and am prepared to admit that it is necessary to resume land in order to provide holdings for persons other than ex-servicemen who wish to go </para>
                    <para>On- the land, and are qualified to do so. The. point which we have now to consider i.s whether a government, in acquiring land for just purposes, should do so on just terms. It is true, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline> said, and as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Courtice</inline> implied, that the Queensland Government has acquired land on just terms. It has set up judicial machinery for the determination of values. In South Australia and Victoria also, land has been resumed on just terms. In New South Wales, however, land has not always been resumed at a fair price, and that is the reason for the introduction of this bill. The members of this Parliament have sworn to uphold the Constitution, and the Constitution specifically recognizes the property rights of the citizens of Australia. No matter what some members of the Opposition may believe, the fact is that our society is founded on the recognition of the rights of property. Unfortunately, the Government of New South Wales, acting on the excuse that it is necessary to acquire land for the settlement of ex-servicemen, has blandly disregarded the requirements of the Commonwealth Constitution.

                        <para>. - It has been stated that this is a bill to assist ex-servicemen to settle on the land under fair and reasonable conditions, and on such terms as will give them an opportunity to make a good livelihood, after meeting their interest commitments, so that eventually they will be able to discharge their capital indebtedness. However, I consider that the means to be adopted will result in a negation of the objects of the bill. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Reference has been made to the exorbitant price of land. I suggest that this measure could be more appropriately described as " a bill for an act to enforce the demands of landlords ". As has been stressed already by other honorable senators, it is quite obvious that in existing circumstances it is impossible for ex-servicemen settlers on the land to escape from being manoeuvred into a position where they will be committed to pay what is virtually an unpayable debt. That was the position in which soldier settlers found themselves after "World War I. They were compelled to pay  exorbitant  prices not only for land but also for the plant and equipment that they required. Subsequently, in the 'thirties, many of them were starved off the land and compelled to work for the dole. To-day, ex-servicemen of World War II. are being called upon to pay exorbitant prices" for land. In the event of a collapse of the currency, due to unchecked and fraudu lent inflation, those men will be in a serious plight. Already, in terms of gold, the Australian Â£1 note is worth only 5s. The proof of this assertion is that a sovereign weighs a quarter of an ounce and the price of gold is now approximately Â£16 an ounce. In other words, four Â£1 notes are required to purchase what a sovereign would purchase to-day. This will give honorable senators an idea of the extent to which the currency has been inflated. </para>
                    <para>Considerable sums of money have been lent at 4$ per cent., which at first sight is a relatively low rate of interest. However, if the purchasing power of the Australian Â£1 note to-day was equal to the purchasing power of the Australian Â£1 note before World War I., the equivalent rate of interest would be 16^ per cent. As I have pointed out in this chamber previously, it is not possible for the Government to protect ex-servicemen adequately unless it maintains control of banking. Although I listened very attentively to <inline font-weight="bold">.Senator Wright's</inline> remarks I learned little from them. The honorable senator repeated his parrot cry about " just terms ". Although one of my colleagues on this side of the chamber asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> by interjection, to elaborate on that term, he made no attempt to do so. There is objective justice, subjective justice, and legal justice. Legal justice depends on the assumptions of the persons that are called together to deliver judgment. For that reason, lawyers seldom agree. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cormack</inline> has referred to justice for the landlords. I point out that there can be no justice for ex-servicemen who desire to become farmers unless they share with landlords and other people the right of freedom of access .to land. </para>
                    <para>The value of land is influenced by the extent to which it has been improved by labour. There is a distinction between price and value. The price of land is governed mainly by the law of supply and demand. In turn, the law of supply and demand is influenced by the economic powers of would-be farmers. Unfortunately, many ex-servicemen do not understand this aspect of the matter fully. My colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Courtice,</inline> can appreciate the implication of my remarks fully because he started on the land from scratch. Ostensibly, the Government claims that it intends to do something for ex-servicemen by ensuring that landlords shall receive just terms. I consider that the New South "Wales Government is to be commended for its approach to the subject. In effect, it has stated, " We will fix what we consider to be a fair price for the land ". I believe that the members of the New .South Wales Government are quite as capable as are members of the legal profession to decide on a reasonable price for any specified land. As Postmaster-General in the former Labour Government, I always exercised considerable care when acquiring land for postal purposes under the Land Acquisition Act to ensure that the land that the Commonwealth intended to acquire was not being used by the owner in order to earn his livelihood. Generally speaking, land so acquired was land that was not being used by the owner. I do not consider that a person should be permitted to continue to hold land merely for speculative purposes, and not use it. In present circumstances lie has no right to fix a price for such land far in excess of that which he paid for it. This bill was introduced solely for political purposes. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> has said that its purpose is to protect the interests of land-holders and that henceforth it will be impossible for the State governments  to say to land-holders, as they now do, " This is the price we will pay for your land. You will get so much and no more ". <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cormack</inline> referred to property rights. I have yet to hear the honorable senator speak about human rights.  His  thoughts .are dominated solely by Â£ s. d., the worship of mammon and the law of minimum production for maximum price. Because past governments adopted that law many ex-service]1 en were starved off their land. In the circumstances that prevailed after World War I. they could not compete with more fortunately placed primary producers. At a time when there was a great deal of talk about mountains of wheat being eaten by weevils, ex-servicemen by the thousands were starved off their properties and walked the city streets on the dole. A similar state of affairs will undoubtedly exist again if this measure is passed. Any one with a smatter ing of knowledge of what happened in the past knows perfectly well that the provisions of this bill will not protect the ex-servicemen. I feel it an obligation to say what I have said this afternoon because it is perfectly obvious that honorable senators either are not aware of the position that is developing or are deliberately trying to ignore it. Surely they can realize that if a crash comes those ex-servicemen who have been settled on the land will  be  forced  off  their properties unless appropriate preliminary action is taken to protect them. If honorable senators opposite can grasp that simple fact they will realize that there is no alternative to Labour's policy in connexion with this scheme. The Government must -control banking so that it will be able to control inflation and prevent rapid increases of prices. </para>
                    <para>Reference has been made to the basic wage. In terms of money the basic wage has been increased by more than 300 per cent., but in terms of purchasing power it has not been increased one iota.  Inflation  has brought about a corresponding reduction of the purchasing power of pensioners,, superannuants and persons on fixed incomes, but the Government has done nothing about the matter. How can the Government contend that this bill is designed to protect the interests of ex-servicemen when, at least by the silence of its members, it has indicated that it does not intend to do any more for ex-servicemen than it has done for them in the past. Whether they like it or not, honorable senators opposite must face these problems. It is of no use for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> to talk about just terms in theory while in practice he assists the Government to enforce most unjust terms on men and women who are unable to protect themselves. It is obvious that the Government intends to enable landowners to obtain exorbitant prices for land which they are not entitled to retain. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. I am attempting to counter the soft words of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline> by directing attention to the manner in which the resumption of that land was carried out. I realize that there must be a substantial writing down of the value of land acquired for the settlement of ex-servicemen so that they may have a chance to succeed in their ventures. It was obvious to me then, and it still is, that it would be foolish to purchase land for the settlement of ex-servicemen in the post-war period on the basis of values ruling during that period. The pertinent question is: Who should carry the financial responsibility for the writing down of land values? On that question the Labour governments of Queensland and New South Wales failed to stand up to the acid test. Instead of agreeing that the burden should be borne by the whole community, they took the view that the land-owner should make the sacrifice. Why should the financial burden of this scheme be placed on the shoulders of the land-owner? To dispossess a man of 'his property and compensate him by the payment of only one-half of its value and then expect him to purchase land elsewhere at double the price at which his land was acquired is manifestly unfair. </para>

                        worked himself up into a tantrum about the acquisition  of land an just tei-ms. It is fortunate for the people of this country that under the provisions of the Commonwealth Constitution the Commonwealth may acquire property only on just terms. The sovereign States of the Commonwealth are not so inhibited. They can acquire properties at any price they care to fix. Indeed, they may resume land and refuse to compensate its owner in any way. Grave injustice has : been done to many decent men who took up virgin land developed it and brought up their families on it only to have the area " frozen " by lbc Queensland Government. The irony dlf that acquisition is that many of the owners were ex-servicemen from the 1914-18 war, whose sons were absent from Australia fighting in  World  War II. when their land was "frozen ". There is no justice in such acquisitions. That is the Government's case in a nutshell.
                    </para>
                    <para>Using the  arguments  that were advanced by supporters of the Labour Government an the Queensland Barlin - ment, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline> asked whether we desired -ex-servicemen -to bear the cost of the Wai' Service Land Settlement, Scheme. . We do not want them to do so ; it should be -borne by the community as a whole. What would be the attitude &lt;of honorable senators -opposite if we suggested that retail merchants should yield to the Cr.own one half -of the value of their properties and be forced to :seek accommodation elsewhere  at present value?? How would <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant,</inline> who is now interjecting, like the Crown to say to him " As your contribution to the settlement of ex-servicemen, we shall dispossess you of your home and pay to you only one half of its value ". Let us step into the shoes of the men who have been dispossessed of their land and compensated to the amount of only one 'half of its -value. No demagogic pleading can get round my argument. We have heard a good deal of 'humbug about rapacious landlords who would not make their proper 'contribution towards the war effort and who will not now make a reasonable contribution to the settlement of ex-servicemen  on the land. Land-owners who have been dispossessed of their properties under this scheme have suffered a double burden because, in addition to the loss of tone half of the value of their land, they had -to sell their sheep and cattle at a  time  when war-time taxes were particularly severe; When1 a primary producer sells his sheep  and  cattle <inline font-style="italic">in fate</inline> the proceeds of the sale are regarded as income for taxation purposes. It is all very well; for honorable senator.0 opposite to ridicule the acquisition of land, on just terms when they know that there is no other method by which  land  can be .acquired without heavy lass- to landholders. </para>

                    <para>We can all' differentiate between just and unjust terms. I have just indicated to  the  honorable senator what I consider to be just terms: I have  also  indicated that there has been a change of heart on the part of the Australian Labour party in Queensland', and that the present Labour Government  approaches the subject of war service1 land settlement in a much more reasonable manner than did its predecessor. The present Government is attempting to resume land for the settlement of ex-servicemen on the basis of j.US t terms. For a number of years, however, grave injustice was visited upon men who had worked hard to build up their properties and were then, hunted from them, fu my long experience of the political life of the country, I have never seen  anything  more- unjust than the action taken  against  Queensland land-owners whose properties, were resumed during the past four or five years. If I make that severe criticism, of a former Labour government of Queensland,, it is fair that I should also state that there is now a. different method of approach t'o that subject. Recently, the Queensland Government agreed: to acquire land" for the settlement of ex-servicemen on terms that have been decided upon by the Land Court of Queensland. Four cases came before the court, which was presided over by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> L. Payne: Although the resumptions had been proclaimed' in 1951, the eases caine before the court only recently. They were test cases, and the decisions given are worth citing- in order to show that' there is- a difference between resuming land on unjust  terms and resuming it, on just terms: The first case concerned Rigby Brothers^ of Rochedale. They claimed! Â£35,282 as compensation- from the Crown, whereas' the Government offered'  them  Â£1'3-,196-.. After hearing evidence, inspecting the property, . and obtaining; further evidence from competent and- expert witnesses on. behalf of the Crown and Rigby Brothers, the Land Court decided  that  the true- compensation was Â£21,850. Consequently, there was a difference of more than Â£8,000 between the- amount offered by the. Crown  and  that decided upon by the court. </para>

I cannot go back into the misty corridors of time and indicate, for the benefit of the honorable senator, who established- those tribunals', but I know that they have been in existence for many years. In any event, the landowners to- whom I have referred- did not have access to the Land Appeals Board because their.' properties had been "'frozen "!

                    <para>This bill, which is a small one, involves an important principle.

It is right, also, that the Minister for the Interior should have independence of thought and decision in matters relating to war service land settlement, in order that he may act as a referee and ensure that land-owners whose property is resumed receive a fair deal. I believe that returned servicemen should be able to obtain land at written-down values, but I also believe that the community as a whole, and not merely one section of it, should be called upon to bear' the cost of the difference between those reduced values and current market values. </para>

                        <para>. - It seems to me that the crux of the disputation in regard to this hill concerns the interpretation of the words " just terms ". Surely it is not suggested by the Government that any member of the Opposition advocates that land should be acquired, even for the purpos-3 of war service land settlement, on terms other than just terms? </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I point out to honorable senators opposite that the land in this and any other country is worth only as much as it will produce. If we look back to 1938 and 1939, it will be remembered that wheat was then being sold at ls. 6d. and 2s. a bushel, and that the price of wool was very low. Land values at that time were also very low. As a result of World War II. and an increased demand for primary commodities, such as wheat and wool, land values have increased considerably. It is pertinent to ask at what stage did the market price of land represent its true value. It could easily be said that if land had been bought in 1938 and 1939 at about half its present price it would have been acquired on unjust terms. Therefore, according to the argument that has beer presented by honorable senators opposite, some ex-servicemen should be asked to pay higher prices for the land  oh  which they have been settled. If they are not called upon to do so, the taxpayers must bear the difference between the two sets of values. </para>
                    <para>I point out that in New South Wales there are closer settlement boards, advisory land boards and other authorities which examine land values. I am sure that even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cormack</inline> would not contend that he is better qualified to determine just terms for the sale of land than are the tribunals in the various States. I consider that New South Wales leads the way, as far as the acquisition of land for war service land settlement is concerned. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator "Vincent</inline> laughs. I remind the honorable senator that in the six months which ended in December last only five farms had been acquired in Western Australia for. war service land settlement purposes, and that only 70 farms have been acquired in Western Australia for that purpose during the last five years. </para>

                        speaking with great indignation, claimed that land-owners were being burgled of their land, but he omitted to say that, under the law, a land-owner may retain Â£14,000 worth of land, exclusive of the buildings on it. The honorable senator put only one side of the case. In all .States, the only complaints concerning resumption of land for war service land settlement purposes have come from the large land-owners of this country. It is the function of the Government to ensure that every returned serviceman, who desires to engage in rural pursuits, shall be given a reasonable opportunity to do so. I understand that in
                        <inline font-style="italic">New</inline>
                        South Wales the Closer Settlement Advisory Board examines properties in accordance with the terms of the States Grants (War Service Land Settlement) Act, which requires that an ex-serviceman must have a reasonable chance of success, with average seasons and conditions. I doubt whether
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maher,</inline>
                        or any other honorable senator opposite, would deny that those conditions are reasonable. Every soldier settler has a right to expect a reasonable opportunity to make a success of his venture.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cormack</inline>
                        will remember, as we all do, that after World War I. hundreds of soldier settlers walked off land that had been acquired at high prices. That happened in Western Australia, in particular. If
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Seward</inline>
                        does not believe that, I shall obtain the figures for him. In many instances, land resumed for soldier settlement was entirely unsuited to the type of production that was undertaken on it. To-day, great care is being exercised, particularly in New South Wales, to ensure that every soldier settler shall have a reasonable prospect of success. That contention is well supported by the charge made in the House of Representatives by the Postmaster-General that many soldier settlers had already paid off their properties. Is it a crime that a man who fought in defence of this country should have been able, because of fortuitous circumstances and the high price of primary products, to pay off his property in less time than- was expected? If soldier settlement is being retarded in any State, the blame lies with the Commonwealth.
                    </para>
                    <para>I invite the Minister to explain in his reply what he considers to be just terms for the acquisition of land. I should like to know also how honorable senators opposite consider that land resumptions at increased prices should be financed. Is the Commonwealth in a position to pay the difference between the value fixed by the Land Settlement Advisory Board in New South Wales and what avaricious land-holders consider to be just terms? It is significant that opposition to the war service land settlement scheme has come, not from the small land-owners, but from the owners of huge tracts of land. I know of some property owners who have complained about the resumption of large areas of country which they themselves consider to be of a poor standard. Again I invite the Minister to give to the Senate some indication of what he considers to be just terms for the acquisition of land, and to inform us of the manner in which the Government proposes that the difference between the compensation claimed by large landholders and the price decided upon by the Closer Settlement Advisory Board should be made up. </para>

                        <para>.- I am pleased that the question of just terms for the acquisition of land has been raised because it is the crux of the problem. Are private landholders entitled to just compensation for land that is resumed for soldier settlement purposes, and, if so, who shall decide what are just terms? I am sure that no honorable senator opposite is prepared to say openly that land should be acquired on unjust terms. Therefore, the argument boils down to the question, " Who should determine what are just terms ? " Whenever there is disagreement on a matter of that kind, the decision should be given by an independent arbitrator. In this case, the only possible arbitrator is a court of law. The Commonwealth Constitution provides in section 51 that land acquired by the' Commonwealth must be acquired on just terms. In the final analysis, the interpretation of " just terms " is a matter for the High Court. That authority does not rest with any Minister, and I say that it should not rest with a Minister. </para>

                    <para>The second point that I wish to make is that the price that is paid for land resumed from a private land-owner has no relation whatsoever to the price that is paid by the soldier settler for his holding. Although the stories that have been told by honorable senators opposite about the plight of soldier settlers after World War I. may be perfectly true, they are quite irrelevant because the present war serviceland settlement scheme is entirelydifferent. Underthe -agreement of 1945,hand ismade available to ex-ser- vicemen at aprice which 'is determined aftera survey  of productivecapacity,  probable prices,and other factors has beenmade bytheDivision of Agricultinsal Economics. Whetherthe price that was paid for thelandin the first place ishigher or lower thanthe Division of Agricultural Economicsconsidersit should be, the fact remains thatt the price charged to the ex-servicemanshould enablehim to derivea reasonable return from hisventure. The point  at  issue is this:Should land beresumed on unjust termsin order to protect the pocketof the  generaltax-payerat  theexpense of the land-owner ? Those who say that it should beareentitled to their opinion, but it is one that I do not share and I believe that theattitude of those whohold it is rather despicable. In effect, they are saying to theex-serviceman. You are a great fellow. You defended this country.You deserve to be given an opportunity  to  settle on the land, and we are prepared to doe very thing in our power  to see  that that opportunity is given toyou; but do not ask us to pay the bill. Let the landowner pay it . The pricethat you pay will not be any greater,but it will make adifference to ourpockets if we can throwour responsibilityon to the shouldersoftheland-owner ". That is theOnly possible interpretationof the attitudeof people who claimthat taxpayers should be protectedby resuming land -on terms which a court of law would consider to be unjust. Such an attitude asu n-Australian. It is our responsibility as anation to settletheex-serviceman on the land, and to ensure thatland shall be madeavailable on terms that willenable him to make a good living  from  his property. </para>

                            <para>- Land was acquired at 1942 values while the Land Sales Control Regulations were inoperation . That was the law. Since the regulations were repealed, the value of  the  landhas been determined by the New South Wales Closer Settlement Advisory Board, and resumptionshave been made atfrom 40 per cent. to 50 per cent.  above  the 1942 pegged values. The board examines a property, and assesses it? value. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton</inline> rightly sa id. the crux of the problem is who should decide what are just terms. I should not like to leave that decision to the landowner. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maherhas</inline> told us  of  landowner inQueensland who valued hisproperty at Â£45 an acre, whereas the Government's offer was Â£15an acre. Then a court decided that  the  value was Â£25 an acre or approximately half-way between the two estimates. That is typical of such transactions; it is the old story of the buyer and theseller. It is necessary to have an independent arbitrator to decideupon a fair value. InNew South Wales, the arbitrator is the Closer Settlement Advisory Board. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ashleyhas</inline> pointed out, many property-owners in New South Wales are offering their land to the Closer Settlement Advisory Boardbecause land values in New South Wales are receding, and the board is offering mora money than most private purchasersare willing to pay.That is a phase throughwhich we are now passing. Protests against the Closer Settlement Advisory Board's valuations are based largely,not on 1951 figures, but on 1950 figures, because last year values dropped byabout25 percent.Risesand falls in the priceof landcan bevery rapid.In matters such as this, honorable senators  opposite are often inclined <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> take a " holier than thou " attitude. They refer <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the Opposition as men who want to do all the bad things and to the members of the Government as saintly individuals who want to do all the right things. If Government supporters examine the manner in which existing legislation is administered in the Department of the Interior they will find that the Government has been completely unjust in its treatment of people from whom it has resumed land. </para>

The owner did not receive any payment for his property for at least eighteen months after the date of resumption. During all that time he had to collect the rent from the property and poy it to the department. When the Government finally settled the transaction they paid h'im interest at the rate of :i per cent, on the resumption value of  the  property in respect of the period during which they had retained his money while at the same time, in respect of that period, they had received rent from the property at the rate of 12 per cent. </para>

It would be destructive of proper treasury practice to  fail  to incorporate in the statute -the specific terms and conditions under which these moneys are to be appropriated so  that  those terms and conditions may l&gt;e studied by treasury officials, the Auditor-General and others who may have to deal with the application of these moneys.

                        arn surprised that some Opposition senators have had difficulty in interpreting the expression "just terms". Sometimes lawyers are subjected to the reproach that they couch acts of Parliament in language that is obscure, complex and difficult to understand. The expression "on just terms" seems to me to be very simple and there is a precedent for it5! use in the Constitution. It has also been the subject of discussion and interpretation by the courts. Surely this is the very type of expression that could be acceptable to all honorable senators. As the amendment would enable the fulfilment of the purpose of the bill I hope that it will be acceptable to honorable senators.

                        <para>. - I am in no way unsympathetic to the object which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> has sought to achieve in moving his amendment. This bill has been prepared after consideration by the legal officers of the Commonwealth and the States and as a result of the decision in the <inline font-style="italic">Magennis</inline> case. In the preparation of the bill consideration was given to the inclusion in it of some such provision as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> has suggested. However, difficulties arise to some extent, from the fact that the power to acquire bind for this particular purpose is exercised by the States, and that in each State, independent of soldier settlement legislation, there is land acquisition legislation of some kind. This is the legislation under which the States would normally act, in acquiring  land for soldier settlement. The acts concerned have  been  accepted by the public as providing fair and reasonable terms upon which land may be acquired for public purposes. Of course, the State parliaments are not bound by the provisions of the Commonwealth Constitution which prevents the Australian Government from acquiring land except upon just terms. Although the expression " just terms " is of some simplicity and conveys to the average man precisely the idea intended, a body of law is growing up around the meaning of that expression which may involve some technicalities. lt is by no means inconceivable that State land acquisition legislation - the general legislation, not that which contains special provisions concerning 1942 values - may contain provisions which, technically, would offend against the conception of " just terms " as expressed in the Australian Constitution. I do not mean that that legislation contains unjust provisions. It is legislation the principles of which have been accepted for a long time. Very often it has been copied from similar English statutes. But the relevant acts were brought into operation by legislatures which are not bound by the conception of " just terms " as mentioned in the Constitution, and, although the legislation might be fair and reasonable, it still might contain provisions which might offend against that requirement. That fact presents a complication, and I put it forward for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator "Wright's</inline> consideration. </para>

It is true that under the bill the payment of money is left in the hands of the Minister, but he is responsible to this Parliament, and if he is not satisfied with the terms upon which land is to be acquired by a State he can refuse to enter into an arrangement with that State. Consequently, the object that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> seeks to achieve will be achieved by this bill. If the Senate agrees to the amendment complications may arise. The bill will then allow of no flexibility in the handling of this problem. The Minister will have to direct his consideration to the question of whether the land acquisition legislation of a State complies with the conception of " just terms " as that expression is used in the Australian Constitution. For those reasons, I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> that he give further consideration </para>

                    <para class="block">This bill is a complete revision of the law relating to patents of inventions. It is technical in character, but of great importance in the industrial development of the country. Its purpose is to improve the existing law relating to patents, in the light of modern requirements brought about by the great advance in technological development during recent years. Nevertheless, it does not change radically the principles of our patent system. The existing patent system of the Commonwealth is based on the Patents Act 1903, which itself superseded separate systems in each of the States. The act of 1903 has been amended from time to time in minor respects, but the need for a comprehensive review has long been recognized. </para>
                    <para>Prior to World War II., the present Prime Minister, who was then Attorney-General, set up a committee to consider what alterations were desirable in the Australian patent law. Bills were introduced to give effect to the recommendations of this committee, but the project lapsed in 1940 owing to war-time exigencies. Developments during and after the war have accentuated the need for an overhaul of Australian patent law. In particular, the British legislation, upon which our act of 1903 had been based, was extensively amended and consolidated in 1949. Accordingly, the Government decided to appoint a new committee to review the Australian law in the light of present-day needs, and of the developments in patent law overseas. The  chairman  of the committee was the Honorable Arthur Dean, who was a member of the pre-war committee, and now a judge of the Supreme Court of Victoria. Another member of the present committee who served also on the pre-war committee is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. L.</inline> B Da vies, a pra ctising patent attorney who is a past  president  of the Institute of Patent Attorneys of Australia. The other members of the committee were Messrs. R. K. White, J. Q. Ewens, and H. R. Wilmot. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. White,</inline> like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Davies,</inline> is a past  president  of the Institute of Patent Attorneys. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ewens</inline> is the Parliamentary Draftsman and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilmot</inline> is the Commissioner of Patents. </para>
                    <para>The committee invited suggestions from all persons interested, and considered suggestions for alterations in the law put forward by the Institute of Patent Attorneys of Australia (Incorporated), the Commissioner of Patents, interested Commonwealth departments, the Chartered Institute of Patent Agents of the United Kingdom, and others. The committee presented its report on the17th April, and the bill has been drafted to give effect to its recommendations. The Government is most appreciative of the work done by the members of the committee, and the thoroughness and care which they have devoted to their task is clearly manifest to all who read their lucid and comprehensive report. </para>
                    <para>Though the bill proposes to repeal the whole of the existing act and to replace it with a new one, this does not mean that the bill involves a drastic departure from the- present system. The procedure of repeal and substitution was adopted in order to avoid a multiplicity of detailed technical amendments. The committee did not recommend any radical changes in the existing system. On the contrary, it recorded, the view - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>That  the system of patenting inventions as at present established is, eni the whole, working satisfactorily, audi that any alterations necessary are concerned with matters of procedure rather than with matters of broad general principle. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>The greater part of the will' which honorable senators have before them is, therefore, not new law at all, birt has been in operation for almost half a century. The old law, and the charges now proposed, have been thoroughly considered by <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> high lj' expert, committee. I slia.FI touch on the more important changes presently; but before doing so I shall remind the Senate briefly of the important role that the patent system has played in the industrial history of the British peoples, and of the objects for w hich the patent system has been devised. </para>
                    <para>For centuries, British law has recognized that an inventor should have some protection for his invention, and, indeed, in all but backward countries some such provision exists. This protection is given by the patent system, which is directed lit four objects : the encouragement of inventors-, the advancement of industrial development by bringing- inventions into use without delay, the disclosure of technical! information and the protection of the public interest. </para>
                    <para>The foundations of our patent system were laid over 300 years ago by the Statute of Monopolies, 1624, which provided for the grant to inventors, by letters patent, of monopoly rights for a limited period. It established the fundamental principle that a patent monopoly could not be granted in respect of manufactures already in use, but only for new manufactures, and then only if they were not. "mischievous to the State or generally inconvenient''. In fact the existing Patents Act - as also this bill - defines  invention " by reference to the provisions of the Statute of Monopolies. </para>
                    <para>Some measure of the part that patents fi lay in. the industrial life of this country i* given by the fact that the Patent Office has issued 105,614 patents, that 23,000 remain in force and that patents are now granted at the yearly rate of 4,300. Because of the importance of patents in industrial development, governments all over the world are revising their patent systems and paying particular attention to the. stimulation of inventive skill and energy in their citizens. As technical progress is made, national prosperity increases, and with it the ability of the nation to preserve its national identity. The atomic bomb, jet-propelled aircraft and radar forcibly remind us of the importance of invention to a nation's existence. Nations which have failed to fake steps to stimulate invention have thereby suffered in their industrial development. In this connexion the history of Holland it worth consideration. Patents of invention were abolished in Holland in 1S69 and were not restored until 1912, and there are students of economic history who maintain that the intervening years were a backward period in the development of Dutch industry. </para>
                    <para>Whatever encouragement is afforded to inventors by the State, it must be equally applicable to the invention of a group of men as to that of an individual. Industrial technique has now become so involved that in many cases invention if the work of many men working as a team in the well-equipped and expensive laboratories of large business concerns. If this research  i3  to continue: and be extended, those responsible for it must be assured of eventually recovering, at least the expenditure incurred, if not some reasonable reward. </para>
                    <para>It is almost universal practice to encourage invention and provide reasonable protection for the inventor by granting him a monopoly for- a limited period to make, use, exercise and vend the invention within the country of the grant. Thc International Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property has further encouraged invention by extending the field of exploitation to- countries other than, that of which the inventor is Â» resident. </para>
                    <para>The term of a patent in Australia  is  sixteen years. Under the present law. this period runs from the date on which thu  h Implication is filed, but a patentee has no fight to sue in respect of infringement commited prior to the publication of the completed specification. Under clause (t'7 of the bill, the period runs from the lodgment of the completed specification. The effect of the change will be to extend the term for which the inventor of the patent is given protection. It will also bring the Australian law into line with the provisions of the international convention. </para>
                    <para>In the public interest, it is essential that protection for the inventor  should  be coupled with disclosure to the public of the scientific knowledge comprised in the subject matter of the invention. In bringing about the disclosure of technical improvement and information, our patent system has worked exceptionally well. Whether or not any individual patentee rnakes a profit from the invention for which he holds a patent, the information lie discloses, when added to that disclosed by other patentees, has helped to build that vast store of technical information which is now to be found in patent specifications. These, indeed, in many cases will provide the main source from which new industries will be developed. This vas the case, for instance, in the manufacture of electric computers* - machines which, in a few seconds, solve the most complicated mathematical problems, the solving of which, by mental labour, takes hours, days, or even weeks. </para>
                    <para>The store of technical knowledge contained' in the specifications lodged in the Patent Office has, up till now, not been used to full advantage. To help in disseminating knowledge contained  in  the specifications, and to assist the applicant in the preparation of has own specifications, the bill, in clause 56, makes provision for the disclosure by the Patent Office of particulars of prior specification.? disclosed by official searches. A similar provision contained in the legislation of the United States and Great Britain has been found to be of considerable advantage1. </para>
                    <para>The present patent system has limitations both in the encouragement of inventors and in bringing inventions into use without delay. Having evolved his invention, the inventor's  greatest  trouble often lies in getting, the invention adopted in industry. In any major industrial change a manufacturer is forced to weigh the advantage to be obtained by being the first to develop the new methods against the loss in tools and plant rendered obsolete by the change. </para>
                    <para>It is possible, by legislation, to remove or minimize some of those features of our present patent system which are detrimental to the encouragement of inventors, and to reduce the delay in putting inventions into use. The bill contains several provisions directed to this end.  For  example, clause 120 enables a manufacturer who proposes to make an article or use a process, and is unable to obtain from his legal advisers a clear opinion that he will not thereby infringe some patent, to seek from the High Court a declaration that in the making of the article or the using of the process he would not commit an infringement. </para>
                    <para>The involved nature of modern industrial technique has also brought difficulties to the inventor in protecting his invention, and litigation has become more costly owing to the complexity of the issues involved. The bill provides some measure of relief in these matters. One illustration is clause 95, which allows the Commissioner, in addition to the court, as at present, to extend the term of a patent on the ground of war loss. In many instances this will save both time and expense. The establishment of a system providing for the grant of a patent monopoly imposes an obligation upon the legislature to ensure that the public interests are properly protected. In this connexion, I draw the attention of honorable senators to the following observations by the committee,, m paragraph 10 of its report : - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The industrial development of <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> country is considerably affected by the efficacy or otherwise of its patent system. Manufacturers would not be prepared to develop and produce improved machinery if others could copy the results of their work with impunity. On the other hand, any inequity in the patent system may hamper manufacturers and cause inconvenience to the public.

                    <para>The. chief beneficiary of our patent system should be the Australian public, and this should be true whether or not the invention is commercialized. "Where the invention is commercialized the public benefits from the product or process. Where it is not commercialized the public benefits from the recorded knowledge of the inventor. In either case, some contribution is made to technical progress, and so to social and cultural progress. The working and compulsory licence provisions of the present ' act have been retained, and have been amplified by the requirement now contained in clause 110 thai the invention be worked, where possible, on a commercial scale in this country. These provisions are a safeguard to the public interest. So also is clause 125. Under this clause the Commonwealth or a State or any contractor with the Commonwealth or a State may use an invention, subject, of course, to the payment of reasonable compensation. Although tha Commonwealth has certain rights of use under the existing law, these rights have been extended, and under the bill will also be enjoyed by the States. I draw the attention of honorable senators to clause 131, which enables the Commissioner, subject to any directions of the Attorney-General, to prohibit or restrict, the publication of information concerning the subject-matter of an application for a patent where it is necessary or expedient to do so in the interests of defence. </para>
                    <para>The recommendations of the 1950 committee adopt most of the recommendations of the pre-war committee and follow also in the main those of the recent English committee. Many of the provisions of the 1949 British Act have been adopted in substance in the bill. In matters of patents for inventions it is particularly important that legislation in Australia and the United Kingdom should correspond as closely as possible, in the interests alike of British and Australian inventors and their advisers. The reports of the Australian committees to which .1 have referred, together with the bill, have been incorporated in a memorandum, copies of which have been made available to honorable senators. The bill is a rather lengthy one and I do not intend to weary the Senate with a detailed explanation of . it. Suffice to say that, in addition to the matters to which I have already referred, the more important amending provisions relate to <inline font-style="italic">(a)</inline> changes in procedure in connexion with the applications for patents and in the system of dating patents for the purpose of determining the validity of the patent; <inline font-style="italic">(b)</inline> the grant of additional rights to exclusive licensees and the definition of "exclusive licensee"; (c) the persons who may practise as patent  attorneys </para>

                            <para>I have, already referred to the provision contained in the bill for the dating of a patent for the purposes of. determining the limits of the term of the patent. In clause 45 the bill makes provision for a patent to have a second date. This date is known as the " priority date " and is the date to be used for determining the validity of the patent. A detailed explanation of the purpose of dating a patent will be found by honorable senators in paragraphs 13 and 54 of the report. (&amp;) Clauses 6, 96, 114 and 127 clarify a matter in which the present law has been very obscure, namely, the position of an exclusive licensee. Clause 6 defines " exclusive licensee " as a licensee under a licence granted by the patentee which confers on the licensee the right to make use of, exercise and vend a patented invention throughout Australia to the exclusion of all persons, including the patentee. Clauses 96, 114 and 127 give to an exclusive licensee the powers possessed by a patentee under the bill in respect of the extension and infringement of patents and declarations by the court of Crown use of patented inventions. </para>

                            <para>Under the existing act a legal practitioner is entitled to practise as a patent attorney. It is rare for a solicitor to engage in the practice of a patent attorney, but barristers and solicitors have at times done some of the things normally done by patent attorneys, such as advising on the specification of a patent and appearing before the Commissioner. In view of the scientific qualifications required of patent attorneys it has been felt desirable that some restriction should be placed upon the extent to which legal practitioners are free to carry on practice as patent attorneys. Clauses 136 and 137 now restrict the right of legal practitioners to practise as patent attorneys and the effect is that - (1) a legal practitioner who possesses the required scientific qualifications may be registered as a patent attorney upon passing appropriate subjects of a prescribed examination; (2) a legal practitioner who within one year satisfies the Commissioner that prior to the 1st January, 1952, he had practised as a patent attorney, may continue to practise as such ; and (3) any other legal practitioner is not untitled to prepare specifications unless lie is acting under the instructions of a patent attorney. The Australian Law Council and the Institute of Patent Attorneys of Australia have approved of these restrictions. <inline font-style="italic">(a")</inline> The amendment of specifications has, by clauses 77 to 89, been facilitated both before and after publication of the specification, thus allowing a meritorious invention to be maintained even though the specification may be subject to drafting defects. </para>

                        <para>. - The purpose of the bill was explained fully by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer)</inline> in his second-reading speech. It will bring all the land in the Northern Territory under the operation of ordinances that hereafter may be made by the Legislative Council of the Northern Territory. It seems that the primary purpose of the bill is to bring under Commonwealth control an area of about 675 square miles that was vested in the owners under South Australian law prior to the Commonwealth acquiring the Northern Territory. The South Australian law at that time vested in the holders of the fee-simple the right in minerals below the surface of the earth, and it now appears that minerals of importance in the production of atomic energy are located in sections of this area. It is desired to enable this land to be brought into line with land in the States generally, and with other land in the Northern Territory, so as to divest the owners of rights, not only to minerals that have some relation to atomic energy, but to all minerals, and, in effect, to vest the rights in those minerals in the Crown. The Commonwealth has complete power in relation to the Northern Territory. Its powers are exercisable under section 122 of the Constitution generally without reference to more restrictive provisions of the Constitution. Although it would no doubt be of interest to debate that aspect of the matter, I see no profit in that course at the moment, because the Opposition supports the bill. However, I draw the attention of honorable senators to the fact that there is on the statute-book the Atomic Energy (Control of Materials) Act 1946. That measure was passed at' a time when atomic energy became a matter of real interest in the world. In effect, it conferred on the Commonwealth the right to move in upon land and acquire rights in minerals capable of being used for the production of atomic energy. It relates not only to minerals that have been won from the land, but also  to minerals that are still in the land. Whatever rights or powers the Legislative Council of the Northern Territory may see fit to exercise in relation to land within its jurisdiction once the bill becomes law, any ordinance will, of course, be subject to the operation of the Atomic Energy (Control of Materials) Act 1946. </para>

                            <para>- I do not want to embark- upon a discussion of what constitutes just compensation under the terms of Section 51 of the Constitution. When we speak of just terms, divorced from the legal implications to which the Attorney-General referred a little while aso - :and they .are so divorced when the Legislative Council of the Northern Territory is considering compensation - we must remember that there may be ,-as many differing views about what constitutes justice in this matter as there may  be  bases of valuation. One of .the greatest difficulties is to determine -in the .abstract what is just. A great deal depends upon the point of view from which <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> situation is regarded. It is proper  that  the holders of the freehold -of the land under consideration should be compensated. It may be that sheer justice will have regard to the use that tas hitherto been made of the land. I frankly do not know whether it is premer that .such a matter should be taken auto consideration, but it seems to me that some distinction may well be drawn between those owners who have contributed to the welfare of the territory by. taking up land, exploiting it or working it, and those who having acquired land have failed to use or exploit it for any public or private purpose. </para>

                    <para>The Opposition does not oppose the measure. I have made these comments merely in order to show that the Opposition takes a lively interest, in the affairs of the Northern Territory. Some of us have had an opportunity to wander over a portion of that vast expanse of land, to learn at first-hand of its difficulties of travel and its periodic seasonal difficulties, to watch the  miracle  of its rivers that flow on one day and disappear on the next, and to gauge the extent of its great areas of arid soil and the other areas that are capable of development if water can be provided in the right quantities at the right time. The Northern Territory must be watched with keen interest by this Parliament if for no other reason than it is of the utmost importance to the defence of Australia. Air and naval bases must be established in the north, and Darwin is the appropriate place for their location. Prom  the  defence angle alone, it is important that the population of the north be greatly increased. </para>
                    <para>The Legislative Council of the Northern Territory does not  exercise  complete power over the territory. Its ordinances are subject to disallowance by the Minister for Territories.

The Minister may disallow ordinances made by the council, but this Parliament, theoretically at least, controls the Minister. I support the measure. </para>

Xt is .also pleasing to .note that .the Government is prepared to use the people's .money for the development of what .can only .be described as a completely socialistic enterprise. There are pertain fundamental industries in which the Commonwealth must engage, either because they are  too  big  -for  private enterprise to "handle  or  'because they -are not. attractive enough to induce private investors  to finance  them. 'The story -of this project is one. that we hear :a'rl too often in this country. In the -first instance, overseas -interests were invited to establish the aluminium industry iia Australia but they clearly indicated -that while they would gladly supply us with our aluminium requirements they were not prepared . to establish the industry here, the then Government rightly decided that, as the production of aluminium was vitally necessary for our -development, it should itself undertake the venture. The preliminary plans provided for an annual production of 5,000 tons. Increased demand for aluminium made necessary a revision -of the plans and the Government now proposes to establish a plant with a capacity of 13,000 tons per annum. Until 1 939 the consumption of aluminium in Australia did not exceed 3,000 tons annually. These figures dearly reveal how the demand for aluminium has increased in recent years. </para>

The -demand for -aluminium is increasing :so greatly that when the Bel-I Bay plant is in -operation in 1954 its output will not nearly he sufficient to meet Australian requirements -and we shall still be compelled to import substantial quantities from -overseas. I think 'that the Minister foi- Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">.(Senator Cooper)</inline> stated in the -course of his second-reading speech that the annual Australian consumption of .aluminium is approximately 3 :1b. a head, whereas it is almost 15 l;b. a head in the 'United States of America. Through increased usage .aluminium .wil-1 a.Â© doubt be required in greater quantities in this country and before long it may be found .that just as many dollars .as ever .are .needed in order to import aluminium from America. Now is the time either to double the size of the Bell Bay plant or to build another  aluminium production plant in some other past of Australia. I point out to honorable senators opposite that a British aluminium company has been most interested in certain projects that could be developed with little difficulty in New Guinea. At Rouna -Falls, neaÂ»r Port Moresby, there is a fall of water which is eminently suitable for the generation of the power necessary -for the -breaking. down of the components of -bauxite. It may perhaps, be wise for the Government to draw up plans for the development of an additional aluminium project, even though its site be in New Guinea. </para>
                    <para class="block">One of the main attractions of the proposal to establish the industry in Tasmania was the fact that, in the initial stages, power appeared to be available in that State in abundant quantities. However, the old story of this country must again be told. Our industrial development has been much more rapid than the most farsighted of us imagined. The power potential of Tasmania made it an attractive proposition to set up the aluminium industry in that State. So great, however, has been the demand for Tasmanian hydro-electric power that it is hard put to meet the calls that are made upon it. For instance, the demands for power for the aluminium project have increased by more than 50 per cent, since the early days of the project. It has been suggested in the House of Representatives that power will become a bottleneck. I am certain, however, that the people of Tasmania will keep their hydroelectric power projects moving, so that when power is needed in 1953 or 1954 for the aluminium industry it will be available in sufficient quantity. Now is the time to plan for further production of aluminium, either by extending the Bell- Bay plant or by establishing a plant in some other part of Australia. We must keep ahead of demand or we shall run into bottlenecks which arc expensive both to the community and to our overseas financial credits. </para>
                    <para>In congratulating the Government on its support of this socialistic enterprise, one is led to a consideration of the inconsistency Of its approach to many of its problems. With a great fanfare of trumpets, it was announced recently thatin association with the Bulolo timber interests the Government intends to develop the pine forests of New Guinea. That was a plan proposed by a Labour government. It is two and a half years since Labour left office, but action is only now being taken. </para>

Apparently, association with private enterprise is now to be engaged in, although the Government disposed of its shares in Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited some months ago. Apparently, this Government is only consistent in its inconsistency. It sells its interest in Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited and wants to get out of Glen Davis; yet it is -moving into the aluminium industry and proposes to engage in a socialistic enterprise to obtain timber in New Guinea. Its policy is completely inconsistent. </para>

The Australian Â£1 has lost its value; in the last couple of years the basic wage has almost doubled, and costs are rising as each quarter goes by. I commend the bill to honorable senators. </para>

I listened with great interest to the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong</inline> until he began to play the game of party politics. Apparently the honorable senator is not as well-informed as he should be. In yesterday's newspapers a statement appeared to the effect that, as this project had been commenced by the Menzies Government, it is the intention of the Government to complete it, and then to make it available, in the form of a public company, for., private enterprise to continue. Apparently the honorable senator is only half informed on the matter, and in his endeavour to play party politics he has gone off halfcocked. </para>

                    <para>Although the establishment of an aluminium industry was proposed by the Menzies Government in 1941, it was a Labour government which established the beginnings of the industry at Bell Bay in 1944. The industry has been very fortunate. The basic plant was obtained as  war reparations. It was plant which had been manufactured in Germany for use in Norway. It was in fact cased and at the site in Norway where it was to be used when the war came to an end and the Australian Government was able to obtain it. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but we obtained it at a. greatly reduced price. That was a good start for the industry. By another piece of luck we were able to obtain breaking-down plant which had been established in Wales by the British Government, which, during the war, had purchased aluminium and had treated it in Wales. It sold the breaking-down plant to the Australian Government, which enabled the Australian Aluminium Production Commission to convert direct current into alternating current. The plant was bought at a fraction of the cost a t which it could be built then or obtained now. </para>

                    <para>I wish to refer to the power position, because there 'appears to be some misunderstanding concerning that aspect. Although the Tasmanian Government oversold its supplies of power before they became available, and is now short of industrial power, it is building a plant at Trevallyn, which is approximately two miles from Launceston and thirty miles from Bell Bay. The entire output of that plant is earmarked for the aluminium industry. The plant will supply sufficient power for the industry in its initial stages. Whilst the overall picture of power in Tasmania is anything but satisfactory, the position of the aluminium industry at Bell Bay is protected. In addition, a huge water scheme has been undertaken about 50 miles from Bell Bay. That scheme will serve all the municipalities which lie between its site and Bell Bay, and will ensure an adequate supply of water for the aluminium undertaking. A contract for steel has been let, and the steel is just beginning to arrive. Water supply is therefore assured. With power and water assured, the project is well on the way to success. </para>
                    <para>As honorable senators may be aware, the Glen Davis shale oil refining works are divided into three parts. There ave a mining section, a retorting section, and a refining section.. The aluminium industry requires between 7,000 and 10,000 tons of petroleum coke each year. Petroleum coke is the pure carbon which remains after the final process of refining petrol. The refinery at Glen Davis has been producing such coke, and it is essential that supplies shall be available for the aluminium industry. The most sensible and economic way to ensure their availability is to transfer the refining plant to Bell Bay. In the process of refining, natural gases are given off. Those  gases  can he used at Bell Bay to effect a saving of approximately 30,000 tons of coal a year to the aluminium industry. That is an additional advantage which the industry will enjoy. I believe that all the advantages to which I have referred will ultimately lead to the Bell Bay establishment being able to produce aluminium at a lower cost than it is produced anywhere else in the world. I am eager to see that, in the disposal of the Glen Davis shale oil refinery, the requirements of the aluminium industry will receive proper consideration. </para>
                    <para>The aluminium industry has made slow progress since it was established in 1944. I have often visited the Bell Bay area and I was dissatisfied with the rate of construction during its early years. However, a top-level construction engineer has been engaged for the past eighteen months, and it has been heartening to see the plant come to life. Not only has that engineer performed a magnificent job in connexion with the construction of the plant, but he has also built up an excellent team of workmen and has provided amenities and good working conditions. The men who are employed there say that the early teething troubles, which were partly due to the isolation of the area, have now disappeared. The preparatory work is proceeding rapidly. I have every confidence that the undertaking will be in full-scale production by the end of 1954, and that Australian aluminium will be able to compete both in price and in quality with the product of any other country. I thoroughly agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong1</inline> that the scheduled annual production will not be nearly sufficient for our needs. With the depletion of the world supplies of copper and non-ferrous metals, aluminium will play an increasingly important part in industry. Although the total annual Australian consumption of aluminium is only 15,000 tons, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong</inline> has pointed out, on a population basis, that figure represents only one-fifth of the consumption in the United States of America. We should hare no difficulty in doubling our consumption. I am sure that the Government is aware of that prospect and t hat it will make early plans to extend the existing plant. I have no fear about the adequacy of the supply of electricity in Tasmania. The hydro-electric resources of that State have not been properly exploited. If one project had been tackled and finished at a time, instead nf starting work on four or five undertakings simultaneously, the position .today would have been much better than it is. </para>
                    <para>An important advantage to Australia of the local production of aluminium will be an annual saving of 5,000,000 dollars. That will m!ake an important contribution towards a solution of the dollar problem. I have the greatest faith in this project. I believe that within two years this valuable industry will be i ti production, and that aluminium will be produced economically. I have every confidence in the present production manager and his team, and I believe that when the industry is in full-scale opera- tion every one will agree that it is a credit to Tasmania and to the Liberal and Labour governments that have been associated with its establishment. I congratulate the Government upon the introduction of this bill, and I trust that once the industry is on a firm footing, the Government, will allow the- people of Australia to play their part by handing the venture over to a public company, thus removing it for ever from the dead hand of socialism. </para>

                        (Tasmania) [5.19}. - I support this bill which provides for the allocation of funds for the development of the great aluminium industry iii Tasmania. The venture is proving a great boon- to that; State.  We are extremely  fortunate  that Tasmania was chosen- as the location of the undertaking: It has- the- advantage, *Â»f course, of having a great hydro-electric power potential. As
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henty</inline>
                        has pointed out, the Tasmanian Hydro-electric Commission has undertaken a project at Trevallyn which will supply 40,000 horsepower to the aluminium industry.. That will be sufficient for an output of 13,000 tons of aluminium a year. The Tasmanian Government has played a great part in the preliminary work. In fact, it has embarrassed itself in other directions to provide funds for the project. As I have said, the Trevallyn hydro-electric scheme is designed exclusively to provide power for the aluminium industry. Money has been provided also to house employees of the Aluminium Industry Production Commission. At present, more than 500 people are employed on the project, and, at Georgetown, a few miles from the site of the works, the- Agricultural- Bank of Tasmania, an instrumentality of the Tasmanian Government, has erected 100 houses. Many more are under construction. This, of course, has meant a reduction of the number of houses available to people elsewhere in Tasmania. I say, therefore, that the Tasmanian Government has made a substantial contribution to the development of this, very important undertaking.

                        Hentry  referred to what he described as the over-selling of power in Tasmania. Surely we have passed- the stage when anybody considers that matter to be anything- but a political1 football. Every one who has had a commodity to sell since the war- ended has over-sold because of the great pressure of demand in the post-war years. The Tasmanian Government was most eager to have the aluminium industry established in that State, just as it was eager to- have- other industries-, such as paper manufacture, established1. The Tasmanian Government believes that its objective should be to secure the establishment of industries, and',, at the same time, to develop the State's hydro-electric power potential. Unfortunately, the last few years have been abnormally dry on the catchment area which supplies the- main power houses, and the reserve of water in the Great Lake has been seriously depleted. Am a.  precautionary  measure electricity has; been, rationed to- industry in- Taw mania;. That difficulty will' b&amp; overcome,

                    <para>The Government's decision to expend further moneys on the development of the aluminium industry is to be commended. It is gratifying to know that the Government regards this project, which was started during Labour's term of office, as an essential factor in the Australian community. "We in this country still do not fully appreciate the uses to which aluminium can be put. That was made clear to me when I was in Canada. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henty</inline> have said, Australia could consume twice the annual production planned foi Belli Bay. The venture is one that deserves the commendation of the .people of Australia, and it should be carried on with the greatest possible speed. The people of Tasmania are behind the Commonwealth Government in its efforts to ensure the success of the scheme, and I have pleasure in giving my fullest support to this measure. </para>

It is idle for the honorable senator to suggest to us a medicine that he himself is not prepared to take, or even to compound.

                        urging this Government to plan ahead. The Labour Government had an opportunity to plan .ahead but did not do so. This Government's views on government enterprises are well known. We believe that a government should engage in, or assist, an industry only when such action is inescapable in the national interest No government can apply to a business undertaking the energy and drive that can be applied under private management. Private enterprise has to be energetic and efficient or it will go down. In some cases, however - and this is one - government participation cannot be avoided. We are confronted with the necessity to pour more money into the aluminium undertaking because of delays and lack of ability in the early stages of the project. That, of course, k nothing new, but further governmental aid should not have been necessary at this stage. Had the Labour Government established the undertaking soundly in the first place it would be much further ahead than it is to-day, and the Government would probably have been in a position to withdraw from the project. Unfortunately, we are compelled to continue our participation in a manner with which we disagree in principle.

                    <para>It was most interesting to hear what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henty</inline> had to say about the present management. He was quite correct. The mail who is at present in charge of that enterprise has great organizing capacity.  His  ability to  develop the enterprise is due to the training and experience that he received in private enterprise which has to be efficient, competent and speedy in order to exist. </para>

I take a considerable interest in this industry, and the latest report that I have been able to find is in respect of the year 1950. That report reached me early this year. 1 hope that the Minister will ensure that the reports that will be furnished under the bill before the House will be. rendered promptly so that honorable senators may be aware of the progress that is being made. I support the bill. </para>

                        <para>. - As I listened to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tate</inline> I wondered whether he intended to support or oppose the bill. I was pleased to hear him say, at the conclusion of his remarks, that he supported it. I think that all honorable senators who have the development of the aluminium industry in Australia at heart will support the measure. 1 do not believe that any complaint should be made in respect to certain difficulties which have arisen in Tasmania since the inauguration of this project. I have a lively recollection of the negotiations which took place concerning the establishment of the aluminium industry in Australia. Great pressure was brought to bear in order to persuade the. Government of the time not to establish this industry. It was said that it would be possible to obtain all the aluminium necessary for Australia's requirements from abroad. I am very pleased that the Government did not heed the arguments that were then advanced. This country is very rich in bauxite and the other minerals that are necessary for the production of aluminium. The aluminium factory which was established at Wangaratta, in Victoria, proved very useful in the prosecution of the war. Strong representations were made for the aluminium industry to be located in Victoria, close to the bauxite deposits, and there was agitation for its establishment in other places, but the then Government considered that Tasmania was the best place for it, because of that State's hydro-electric scheme and the availability of a deep-sea port. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I do not intend adversely to criticize the Tasmanian Government concerning the shortage of electricity in Tasmania. Private enterprise could never have accomplished in Tasmania what the Tasmanian Government has done in regard to the production of electricity. The Tasmanian Government is able to supply sufficient electricity at. present only because other industries were established in that State following its offer of inducements beyond those offered by other States for their establishments. Like other States, Tasmania has had adverse seasons. This year there has not been as much snow on the mountains as usual, and because of a shortage of water it has not been possible to produce the required amount of electricity. I was very pleased to read in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> a very favorable commentary on the way in which Tasmania had grappled with the problem of supplying electric power. That newspaper drew attention to the fact that the production of aluminium had been delayed somewhat duc to circumstances over which the Government of Tasmania had no control. It commended the action of the Tasmanian Government in establishing subsidiary schemes, and it stated that in a year or so Tasmania would be able to supply all the power necessary for the aluminium project. Consequently, I do not charge the Tasmanian Government with having retarded the development of this project. </para>
                    <para>The fact that the project will cost more than .was expected in the early stages of its planning is not- surprising; a similar state of affairs exists in many other industries. Costs have increased rapidly and no doubt they will continue to increase. I shall not be so uncharitable as to say that they will increase because the Government may remain in office for another year or so. I commend the Government for making this additional money available in order that the work may proceed as rapidly as possible. Australia, with its growing population, will need more aluminium. A vast quantity will be needed for defence preparations and it is far better to have aluminium at our door than to have to import it from abroad. I do not know how it would affect Australia's dollar  balance if it were necessary to import. all the aluminium that we need for defence preparations. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> correctly said that aluminium could be used in many ways. The use of this metal is only in its infancy in Australia. As time goes on more use will be made of it. It is only a few years since many kitchen utensils now made of aluminium were manufactured from other metals. I am pleased that the Government has proposed to make it possible for the work to be proceeded with as rapidly as possible. Therefore, I have much pleasure in commending the bill. 1 know that it will pass the Senate and I hope that the plant will be completed and in full production within the time expected by the Government. </para>

Although the previous Government prepared the blueprint for this project, it left it to th? efficient management of officers appointed by the Menzies Government to establish the industry. The encouragement of the industry is in the interests of the naval, military and air defence of the Commonwealth. It is a major component of Australia's war preparations. The attention of Australia has been directed to the need for the continuance of the production of this metal. It is a very paltry jibe by the protagonists of socialism that the Menzies Government has departed from its principles of public administration by continuing a defence project oi such paramount importance.

                            <para>- It should be emphasised that the Commonwealth proposes to expend an additional amount of Â£4,250,000 on the establishment of the aluminium industry in Tasmania, and this fact should be set against the criticism that the Commonwealth is starving the States of money. The Australian Government is resolved to develop the nation to the financial limits to which the people are willing to go. The Tasmanian Government originally agreed to contribute towards the cost of this project on a Â£l-for-Â£l basis. However, it has had to default on the undertaking, with the result that the Minister for Supply announced some time ago that the Commonwealth would establish the industry without further aid from Tasmania, because of its paramount importance to defence. That fact should be considered in relation to the demands of the States for more loan money. In 1948, a total of Â£75,000,000 of loan money was distributed among the- States. This: year, the States- have demanded' that the amazing amount of 247,000,000 shall be raised for their purposes. It is- not difficult to understand that such demands have had an adverse effect upon the loan market. </para>

It is proposed  80  amend that section by providing merely that the undertaking shall- not be disposed of " except with the approval of Parliament ". That means the Commonwealth Parliament. In short,, the view is expressed that the ultimate disposal of the industry should, rest with the Parliament which provides the bulk of the money. 'Ft is, however, stipulated that the- Commonwealth shall give the State three months' notice of its intention to dispose of the project, and that the State has the rikht to object; but if fine- Common-wealth persists- in its purpose the- State shall be paid', out of the proceeds' of the sale,, the money which it has already put into the- project. </para>

                        wonder whether honorable senators have considered how supplies of raw material are to bp maintained for the manufacture of aluminium in Tasmania. Although it is very difficult for the Opposition to obtain information on the subject, I believe that the quantity of bauxite in Tasmania will be insufficient to carry on the aluminium manufacturing project for any great length of time Therefore it will be necessary to ship large quantities of bauxite from the Australian mainland or from other countries to Tasmania. I have been told that it is intended to obtain supplies from the huge deposits in Victoria. This will involve the provisio nof shipping. During the relatively short period that I have been a member of the Senate I can recollect a number of Tasmanian senators advocating thu provision of a government shipping service to Tasmania, because private enterprise had failed to cater adequately for the requirements of that State. As the existing shipping service between the mainland and Tasmania is inadequate, it i.&lt; obvious that another service will have to be provided in order to transport supplies of bauxite from the mainland to Bell Bay. Yet even now the Minister for Shipping and Transport

                    <para>Honorable senators well remember that in the past some people have done extraordinarily well out of the sale of Commonwealth industries to private enterprise. The Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers was sold at a tremendous loss. Indeed, about Â£1,250,000 of the price has not yet been received by the Government. We can be pardoned for thinking that someone other than the Commonwealth or the people of this country may get something out of the sale of the aluminium project in the future. Much has been heard during recent months about the probable disposal by the Commonwealth of TransAustralia Airlines. Although the Government has denied that it intends to sell Trans-Australia Airlines, it admits that a large proportion of mail traffic is to be transferred to Australian .National Airways' Proprietary Limited. </para>

                            <para>- Supporters of the Government are quick to seize on points' of order when the implication of such matters is brought home to them. It is significant that at the very time the Government is seeking to make available Â£4,250,000 for the completion of the aluminium, project at Bell Bay, some of its supporters are hinting about the probable disposal of the venture in the future. Just as, ultimately, TransAustralia Airlines will be virtually handed over to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, so will the aluminium industry, when established, be handed over to private enterprise. Already two representatives of Tasmania sitting on the Government side of the chamber have stated that the </para>

                            <para>- Apparently that question is not offensive to honorable senators opposite. Two Government senators have stated that the Government considers that the expenditure of an additional Â£4,250,000 on this venture is warranted in order to get the aluminium project into production. They have <inline font-style="italic">&amp;hn</inline> stated that they would be pleased to see the project handed over ultimately to private enterprise. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> has stated that the project should be completed as a defence measure, having regard to the possibilities of the future. The only possibility as far as the conservative element in the Government is concerned is that this project will be handed over to somebody. This Government believes in private enterprise. Indeed, many supporters of the Government have advocated the selling to private enterprise of government socialistic undertakings. Yet they continue to advocate the establishment of this socialistic enterprise. Is it because they know that private enterprise has failed to establish the aluminium industry in Tasmania? I remind the Government that the aluminium cartel would have done so long ago had not the Australian Labour party prevented it from doing so. </para>

                        has given us some soft soap about the Government obtaining the assistance of a distinguished engineer. I point out that the honorable senator has paid no regard to the physical disabilities that had to be overcome at Bell Bay before the engineer mentioned took over. Many physical difficulties associated with the provision of hydroelectric power had to be overcome before the building of the aluminium project could be undertaken. I understand that a number of members of the Parliament contemplate visiting the Snowy Mountains hydro-electric project in the near future. Although efficient engineers have been employed there since the commencement, of the undertaking, I venture to suggest that the vast amount of preparatory work that has been done by the engineers will not be obvious to the parliamentarians until it is pointed out to them by an engineer. Yet some honorable senators opposite have claimed that one particular engineer has been responsible for the progress at Bell Bay. Honorable senators should be fair and impartial in this matter. The Government should not give all credit for progress at Bell Bay to the engineer that it appointed. Tremendous initial physical difficulties had to be overcome at Bell Bay.

                            <para>- I have a good knowledge of the geography of Bell Bay, and a good knowledge also of other matters associated with the establishment  of  the aluminium project there. ' To be fair, honorable senators opposite should admit that a good job has been done at Bell Bay from the beginning. It is true, of course, that financial assistance has been provided by the Commonwealth.  1  should hate to think that the Government, after making available a further Â£4,250,000 in order to establish the  aluminium  industry in Tasmania, intended  to  place physical difficulties in the way  of  the industry so that ultimately it would  be  handed over to private enterprise at a discount. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> stated that he could not understand why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong</inline> did not readily support the proposed additional expenditure on this socialistic enterprise. However, his criticism does not amount to a tinker's benediction, because when the original agreement came before the Parliament honorable senators who now occupy the Government side of this chamber stated that the project would be a huge socialistic enterprise. Whether they like it or  not they  must admit that it is still a socialistic enterprise. It is for them to state why, having opposed such enterprises through the years, they support a  bill  of this kind.  What  has caused them  to  abandon their faith in private enterprise and embrace the ideals of socialism ? I should like a definite assurance from the Government that it has not decided to proceed with the establishment of this industry with the object of disposing of  it  to private enterprise at a later date. If it is the intention of the Government  to  dispose of it later, why do not Ministers frankly say so? Is  it  the intention nf the Government to develop this indus  try  in order to benefit certain shipping companies  by  giving them the sole right  to  transport bauxite ores to Tasmania and to carry the aluminium ingots to mainland ports? It is impossible for the existing shipping service to clear the cargoes that are now awaiting shipment in Tasmanian ports. How does the Government propose to meet the transport requirements of this undertaking when it is in full production? I am pleased to note that honorable senators opposite have changed their attitude to socialistic enterprises of this kind. This undertaking can be described as a socialist experiment <inline font-style="italic">in excelsis</inline> because no person may build a house in the area set aside for the plant at Bell Bay unless he first obtains the permission of this Government or of the Government of Tasmania. [ trust that the Government will complete this project and that within a few years aluminium ingots will be shipped from Tasmania to the mainland, first, for the production of defence <inline font-style="italic">materiel</inline> and, later, to replace other soft metals, such as copper, tantalite and the like. Aluminium has many uses other than for the production, of defence <inline font-style="italic">materiel.</inline> When the aluminium requirements of the defence programme have been met it will be interesting to learn whether the aluminium plant can be successfully operated to meet the requirements of the civil population. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government of Tasmania is to be reimbursed the amount of money which it has invested in the venture. Thus, in addition to the capital cost, losses incurred in the operation of the plant will be borne by the Australian taxpayers. If the industry is subsequently disposed of, as other  Commonwealth  undertakings have been disposed of in the past, it will probably be sold at very much less than cost and the taxpayers of Australia will have to bear the loss. I urge honorable senators who represent Tasmania to do everything possible to ensure that the Commonwealth shipping line is retained so that when the aluminium plant is in full production Commonwealth ships may be used to transport the bauxite from the mainland to Bell Bay and to move the manufactured aluminium ingots and such other cargoes as are available from Bell Bay to mainland ports. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Flaherty</inline> has asked whether it is the intention of the Government to  hand over the aluminium plant at a later date to an international cartel, the amplication being that if the plant is so disposed of, it will be sold at much less than the cost. I remind the honorable senator that the political party to which he belongs commenced this socialist undertaking, and that he supported the project. "When the present Government came to office, the  project  was well under way. Indeed, it was half completed, or perhaps I should say, it was suspended, like Mahomet's coffin, between the earth and the sky. One of the factors that incline me to support this bill which, I admit, endorses the socialistic principle, is the simple fact that this undertaking has reached such a stage of development as would cause the Commonwealth great losses if it were abandoned. It goes against my grain to approve of the expenditure of an additional Â£4,250,000 in what [ believe to be a socialist undertaking. As time passes, it may be found that the initial investment represents the least cost of the undertaking. It is not unlikely that a heavy loss will be incurred in the operation of the enterprise. 1 have been in the political life of this country for a long time, and I have seen the ebb and flow of socialist activities of this kind. In Quensland, we had  ample  evidence of the failure of such undertakings. To-day, not one member of the Queensland Parliament, or one citizen of that State, wants to repeat the sorry experience of State enterprise in fields that are best left to private enterprise. In every instance large sums of money have, been frittered away in such ventures. Some one has always been ready and eager to chase the pot of gold at the foot of the rainbow, and when one State enterprise has failed, another has taken its place. During the last twenty years, every State enterprise handled by successive Queensland governments has proved to be a losing proposition. "We have had ample evidence that people will not work so well for the State as they do for private  employers </para>

                            <para>- We have to continue the railways as a public utility, because they provide services to the outback of Australia, the needs of which could not be met by private enterprise. The aluminium project is in a different category. It is solely a business enterprise. Canneries were established by the Queensland Government against the wishes of many people. Where are those canneries to-day ? They do not exist. When I -was in Western Australia many years ago, a Labour Government led by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Scadden  established the State implement works. Where are those works to-day? They no longer exist. The Queensland Government established State butcheries, State cattle stations, and, save the mark, State  fishshops.  All those undertakings were bound to be losing propositions, and, indeed, many of them were liquidated by socialist governments which found that their belief in State enterprise was wrong. To-day, not a single State undertaking in Queensland may be described as a socialist enterprise. In New South Wales, we have seen the failure of the shale oil undertaking at Glen Davis, another State enterprise which was established with a great fanfare of trumpets by a Labour government. A great outcry was heard recently about the decision of this Government to close those works. Can any levelheaded member of this Senate justify the continuance of the shale oil project at Glen Davis as a business proposition? Of course, he cannot! It is a losing proposition and, no matter how much may be said to the contrary, it cannot be anything but a losing proposition. </para>

                    <para>In discussing this bill, I do not want to be unfair to my colleagues who represent Tasmania. I am gratified when industries are developed in Australia. The growth of industries such as the aluminium project will enable Australia to play a more important role in the defence of the Pacific. If this undertaking is as good as it is represented to be, why has not private enterprise been attracted to it? When the Minister introduced this bill, he overlooked several important points that are of interest to honorable senators who are called upon to support the continuance of an undertaking which will involve the expenditure of Â£4,250,000 in addition to the amount that has already been expended on it. For instance, the </para>
                    <para class="block">Minister gave us no estimate of the profit likely to be earned by the undertaking. Does the Government admit that this is to be a losing proposition, as all other State enterprises in Australia have been? Or does he expect that the undertaking will show a substantial profit after provision has been made for working expenses and overhead ? T should be glad if he would enlighten the Senate upon that aspect. Those who invest their money in private concerns ask for an honest estimate of expected profits. We should not be called upon to invest the taxpayers' money in an undertaking of this kind without being given similar information. Indeed, I doubt whether we are justified in investing the people's money in an undertaking which apparently offers no hope of a profit. A factor which influences me to support the bill is the statement by the Minister that the undertaking will make an important contribution to our defence preparation. He did not indicate the proportion of the production of aluminium that will be earmarked for defence purposes. I think that that is an important aspect of the matter, and when he replies to the debate I should like him to give the Senate some information on that point. </para>
                    <para>As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Flaherty</inline> has stated, there are big cartels, corporations and companies in other parts of the world which are engaged in the production of aluminium. We, in Australia, are experiencing very high cost levels at the present time. Wages have never been so high. But the high wage level is nullified by ever-rising costs. </para>

In view of those facts, I ask the Government whether it is not possible, after our aluminium industry is established, for the large concerns which manufacture aluminium in other countries of the world seriously to undercut us. That is a business aspect of this proposition. I do not submit these matters in a spirit of hostility to the bill, which I intend to support. I do so because they are matters upon which the Senate is entitled to information. </para>

                    <para>I greatly fear that with the passage of . five or ten years, this enterprise will rank with the_ Glen Davis shale oil refinery and other  State-run  undertakings in Queensland, Western Australia and New South Wales. It will then be a losing proposition. The taxpayers will be obliged to dig deeper into their pockets in order to make good the losses incurred by the undertaking. It is all very well for us to come here with starry eyes and dreamy hopes about the production of aluminium in Tasmania. I wish that I could see the matter in that way. Unfortunately, I prefer to look at the realities of the position and to face the facts. Usually it is found that the affairs of State-run undertakings are not .as healthy as the socialist dreamers of the Opposition would like them to be. I am sorry to think that perhaps a few of my colleagues - not necessarily in the Senate, but generally in the Parliament - have been carried away by this idea of a government-owned aluminium industry. The mitigating factor in their case is that at least the present Government did not start the enterprise. It did not embark upon it but is merely caught up in it. A certain investment was made by a socialist government, and the present Government was left in the unhappy position of having to decide whether it would be better to scrap the undertaking and cut the losses which would be involved thereby, or whether it would be better to go ahead and give the project a chance. As I have said, the defence aspect of the matter weighs heavily with me, and that is why I should like to know the proportion of aluminium production which is to be earmarked for defence purposes. In addition, I wish to know what the Government expects to receive in the way of profits, a matter which has not yet been discussed. </para>

I understand their position very well, but with great respect to the honorable senators, I do not agree entirely with their views. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henty</inline> stated that, in his opinion, once this undertaking is fully developed, it will be able to compete successfully with the aluminium production enterprises of any other country. I respect the honorable senator for his judgment as a Tasmanian businessman, and I hope that his opinion is correct in this instance, not only for the good of Tasmania but also for that of the Commonwealth generally. The honorable senator also stated that, because of various factors which he enumerated, aluminium will be produced at Bell Bay more cheaply than anywhere else in the world. I hope that his optimistic declarations will be fully justified by subsequent events. </para>

                        <para>. - I did not intend to speak on this bill until certain remarks were made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> At the outset, I wish to tell the Senate where I stand. I favour the measure, with the exception of those clauses which confer on the Government the right to sell this project when it is established. I believe that the people of Australia should not be taxed in order, to provide money for a project which, when it is completed, will be handed over to private enterprise. That course has been taken by this Government in other instances. That proposition reminds me that a great government-owned shipping line, which cost approximately Â£8,000,000 was sold for Â£1,500,000, of which the Government actually received a little more than Â£500,000. </para>

                    <para>Honorable senators opposite have complained that a government-run undertaking is not able to function as efficiently or as economically as an undertaking managed by private enterprise. I invite honorable senators to cast their minds back to the days of World War II. They may remember that businessmen throughout Australia ran to the government of the day, saying, " Take over our businesses and control them. We will work for you ". Even the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, and other large concerns, asked that that be done. They appreciated that they would be able to plan to greater effect under government management than under an anarchic system of private enterprise. They also appreciated that by that method production would be facilitated and achieved more cheaply. The government was asked to take over most industries, which it did. </para>
                    <para>Although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henty</inline> considers that the production of aluminium by this undertaking will be less costly than in any other part of the world, apparently, the Government proposes to sell the project when it is completed. I was astounded when the honorable senator made that statement, because it was apparent that he was boosting government enterprise instead of private enterprise. Recently, Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited complained that it could not compete effectively against TransAustralia Airlines, and it asked for a greater proportion of government business. </para>

Yet, it imposes landing charges on the people of King Island in respect of each of its planes which lands on the island. A certain person who lives on the island charters a plane from the company at a cost of Â£100 and is obliged to pay Â£18 for landing charges.

                            <para>- We are discussing government-run enterprises. I remember that when a Labour government commenced the Snowy Mountains hydroelectric scheme, which was a Â£250,000,000 project, the members of the Opposition of the day boycotted the opening of the project. Only a couple of members of the Liberal party attended. Now honorable gentlemen opposite are claiming that the scheme is one of the greatest of all time. Australians had  talked for 80 years of such an undertaking, but it took a Labour government to do something about it. It did so because it appreciated that such a project would assist not only farmers and manufacturers but also the defenders of the country. </para>

                        has eulogized the new manager at the Bell Bay works. I admit that he has done a good deal, but the employees have really brought about the improvement in conditions there. The accommodation and amenities that were provided for the employees at Bell Bay were so bad that the men were forced to strike. The food was bad, the hut accommodation, bathing facilities and lavatory accommodation were all unsatisfactory and inadequate. Consequently, the men were forced to impress their claims upon the management. This Government is now taking upon itself credit for something that it did not do. It was the men on the job who were responsible for the improvement of conditions. I went down to Bell Bay on one occasion in order to investigate the conditions. I had a meal with the men. In the cookhouse there were cooking facilities for approximately fourteen men, but the cooking staff was trying to cook for 250 men. There were only four tea urns. The carving of the meat commenced at 4 o'clock in the afternoon and the meal was served by 6 o'clock. By that time, the food was either burnt to a cinder or was stone cold. I inspected the lavatory accommodation, which was adequate for only fourteen or fifteen men. After 30 men had had a bath in the bathhouse, there was no more hot water. The huts were full of cracks and the wind blew in so strongly that a candle could not be kept alight. As honorable senators may be aware, it is very cold at Bell Bay. Because of those conditions the men went on strike and by that means attracted the attention of the Australian Aluminium Production Commission to their needs. The commission was so hidebound that it declined to take action for a considerable time. Honorable senators opposite should not run away with the idea that the manager was responsible for the improvement of conditions. The truth is that action was forced on him.

                    <para>As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Flaherty</inline> has stated, it is well-known that certain American cartels enjoy a monopoly of the production of aluminium. Should a blockade occur in the Pacific, this country would not be able to obtain aluminium. With that in mind, a Labour government looked a long way ahead and decided to commence an aluminium industry in Australia. The object was not to make huge profits, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maher</inline> seems to think it was. The government of the day related this project to our defence requirements. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maher</inline> has asked whether further government contributions will be required. On the authority of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henty,</inline> there will be no annual losses, because the aluminium produced at Bell Bay will be as cheap as the overseas product. In any case, losses do not matter. We need aluminium. </para>

If they cannot see an opportunity to exploit the worker in order to obtain a good return for their money, they are not interested. Many people believe that industries that do not show a profit should not be continued. If that principle were applied, we would have no roads and no railways. Obviously, private enterprise would not run railways because they are not profit-making. The truth is, of course, that our railways to-day are transporting goods required for secondary industries, at less than cost. In other words, the people of this country are being taxed to subsidize secondary industries. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">in reply -</inline> I have listened with interest to the speeches that have been made on this bill. It is clear that, generally speaking, the measure is supported by honorable senators. At least, it is supported by those honorable senators who have addressed themselves to the bill. Other speakers, unfortunately, were rather wide of the mark, and dealt with topics that have no relation to the bill. Honorable senators opposite have suggested that the Government has been converted to socialism. We on this side of the chamber have always favoured the development of this country by private enterprise; but we are not biased enough to throw away the millions of pounds of the taxpayers' money that has already been expended on this undertaking. We have decided to proceed with the establishment of the aluminium industry, and to invest more money in it to assure it of success. </para>

                        claimed that due to the inability of this Government to stem inflation, it was now faced with the necessity to contribute much more to this venture than had originally been intended. It is true that the Commonwealth will pay a* further ?4,250,000, whereas the total cost was originally estimated at ?3,000,000, but, as 1 said in my second-reading speech, the additional contribution is required, first, because the cost of the undertaking was underestimated at the beginning, and, secondly, because provision is being made for an output of 13,000 tons of ingot aluminium pei annum instead of 10,000 tons. It is well known, too, that not only labour costs, but also the costs of imported materials have risen steeply since the project was first undertaken. I make no apology therefore for the Government's decision, even in this period of. financial stringency, to invest a further ?4,250,000 in the industry. It is a work of great national importance and it will play a vital part in our defence preparations.

                        has asked whether I can give some1 indication of what the profits from the undertaking will be. That would be most difficult. At this stage- any figure that I might give could only be a guess. However, I have the authority of the Minister for Supply
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beale)</inline>
                        to say that it is expected that ingot aluminium will be produced at a price comparable with world prices.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maher</inline>
                        also asked what- percentage of the production would be allocated to defence. Naturally, defence needs will have a priority, but I remind honorable senators that" only aluminium will be produced at Bell Bay. The aluminium will have to be taken elsewhere to be processed into forms in which it is used in industry. It is difficult to say, therefore, what percentage of the production will be devoted to defence. The allocation will, of course, vary according to defence needs. It is not expected, that there will be any lack of demand for Australian-produced aluminium. Again I remind the Senate that Australian

                        consumption of this valuable metal is only 3 lb. per annum, compared with 15 lb. per annum in the United States of America. Obviously, the market for aluminium in this country is almost unlimited. I thank honorable senators for their support of the bill, and I hope that it will be given a speedy passage.

Does the Government intend to set up a fabricating plant so that the ingots can be rolled, extruded, or processed in any other way at Bell Bay? If that is not the Government's intention, will the Minister impress upon the Aluminium Industry Production Commission the importance of keeping private aluminium fabricating factories alive to the fact that 13,000 tons of ingot aluminium will become available annually in about two years time so that limited fabricating facilities will not form a bottleneck in the production of aluminium goods ? I ask the Minister also to explain, if he can, how the profits from the industry are to be applied in accordance with the second schedule to the bill. </para>

                <para>SenatorCOURTICE(Queensland.) [9.17]. - I do not intend to indulge in a general indictment of the Government in connexion with this statement. A similar statement which was presented in another place was not received with very great enthusiasm, and, undoubtedly, it was received with considerable dissatisfaction by the people of Australia. That statement, as is the case with the one that has now been presented by the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'Sullivan),</inline> did not contain any proposal which could afford the people some hope that the Government would deal with the problems of the country in a more satisfactory manner than it has dealt with them during the last two years. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline> covered a very comprehensive field in the course of his most effective criticism of the Government. Consequently, there is no reason why I should take up much of the time of the Senate, particularly as a number of other honorable senators wish to speak to this motion and there is some doubt whether the Government will permit this discussion to continue for any length of time. I was surprised that the motion was submitted to this chamber. As I have said, a similar statement was severely criticized in another place and no doubt the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong</inline> made Government supporters wonder whether the Government had done all that it could have done in connexion with this matter. </para>
                <para>I propose to deal only with the Government's abrupt and drastic action in connexion with the restriction of imports. I am certain that the Minister for Trade and Customs has found it a physical impossibility satisfactorily to administer the Government's policy in this respect. A watchful, careful government would have appreciated the position as it developed from month to month. It could then have prevented the economy of this country from going so far down the drain without taking the abrupt action on which it decided. I was surprised to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton</inline> say that the Government's policy was in accordance with the policy of the Government of the United Kingdom. No other honorable senator has expressed such an. opinion. I could understand that the Government of the United Kingdom had drawn the attention of the Australian Government to the fact that the overseas credits of this country were being frittered away. </para>
                <para>There was no need for the Government to take this action which has brought about so much dissatisfaction and unrest among business people and in industry. I seriously indict the Government because I consider that its policy has done great harm, particularly to the hitherto harmonious trade relations which existed with the United Kingdom. It has brought great hardship to a number of business people in this country which I consider could have been avoided if the </para>
                <para class="block">Government had appreciated its responsibilities. The previous Government had an experience similar to that of this Government in connexion with imports from America. Over a period of many months imports from America were controlled by the previous Government in a manner favorable to the development of this country. For instance, that Government obtained machinery and equipment which made possible the increase of coal production for which the present Government has claimed credit. The previous Government ordered millions of pounds worth of machinery and in that way overcame the difficulties that were interfering with the progress of the country. The present Government could have adopted a similar policy in regard to imports. The present situation is a novel one; it has never occurred before. It is bad for the country and has created a lot of difficulty and discontent. Business people and those who are engaged in industry are greatly alarmed and they consider that the Government could have avoided this situation. On that score alone I consider that the Government has failed the people of Australia. </para>
                <para>It is a very serious matter that the trade of this country has been dislocated to the extent that it has. The Government has restricted imports on the basis of the value' of goods imported during 1951. A business enterprise may have imported little in that year, although it imported a great deal during the previous year. Does the Minister exercise his prerogative in cases of this kind in order to alleviate the hardship that some people may suffer because of the action of the Government The Government's action has affected all sections of industry. Millions of pounds worth of goods were imported into this country during 1951, but I understand that machinery represented only about 13 per cent, of them. The previous Government ensured that dollar expenditure was used in such a way as to supply the needs of industry to the maximum extent and assist in the development of this country. The action of the present Government has affected all industries in a similar way. Some industries may require imports for the purpose of manufacturing goods for export. Because of the Government's restrictions they have been unable to continue the manufacture of their product and, consequently, the quantity of our exports has been affected. Adequate consideration has not been given to the very many aspects of the importation of goods which affect the economy of this country. </para>

                        <para>- I know that. But the Government should have known that millions of pounds were being frittered away in the importation of goods with which this country could have done without. On that score alone the Government has caused a great deal of dissatisfaction. The people have lost confidence in this Government because it has taken no real corrective action to stem the flood of inflation. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Running parallel with the Government's policy of restricting imports is its policy in relation to the restriction of credit. Many millions of pounds of credit are normally used by private enterprise in connexion with the- business of the country. Credit has now been seriously curtailed. Many concerns' have been hampered in their operation and their difficulties are very serious. The Government failed to appreciate the position earlier when it knew that Australia's overseas credits had been reduced by Â£6,000,000 in a few months. The Government must have known of that position. If it did not, it was guilty of neglect. If it did know of the position it failed to meet its responsibility because it did not take action earlier. Action of some kind had to be taken but it could have been taken much more gradually. Had more selective restrictions been placed upon imports they would not have affected the economy of the country to the same extent as this drastic action has done. The Government says that it does not know how long the restrictions will last. Australian manufacturers have the jitters because they do not know how soon the Government may change its mind. Business people want some assurance of security. The Government has failed the country in its time of need. I know that the situation developed suddenly, but the Government has met it clumsily. Not so long ago Ministers were telling us that one of the best ways to combat inflation was to import more goods; and more goods were imported. Then, after having encouraged imports, the Government suddenly imposed import restrictions. The same policy was followed in respect of capital issues. First, the Government removed control; now it has restored control. Its rapid changes of policy have produced an unfortunate psychological effect. This Government obtained power by deceitful and dishonest methods. It promised the people many things. It was either ignorant of the economic situation, or it deliberately promised what it knew it could not perform. I believe that some of the leaders of the present Government did know what the situation was, but they went on making promises just the same. They even promised to reduce taxation in order to combat inflation, but taxation has, in fact, been increased. There are not many people in Australia who would not gladly go back to the conditions of 1949. There are not many businessmen who would not accept the policy of the Labour Government of 1949 if the conditions that prevailed then could be restored. </para>
                    <para>The present Government abolished capital issues control, and gave private enterprise a free hand. So far as the Government was concerned the sky was the limit. Its policy was to give private enterprise complete freedom because it professed to believe that by so doing all our economic problems would be solved. People were allowed to invest their money in luxury and semi-luxury industries; then, when the industries were established, the Government re-imposed capital issues control and restricted credit. Unless something is done to restore public confidence there can be no hope for the country; yet there is no indication that the Government will give the people a lead. There is nothing in the financial statement to indicate that the Government has discovered a way out of our difficulties. </para>
                    <para>Members of the Government have talked much about the need for greater production of food. They were talking about it in 1949, and they have been talking about it ever since, but nothing has been done. If talk could solve our problems they would all have been solved long ago. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> is a great orator. Not only does he " put it over " the people, but he is able to " put it over " his own followers, also. Before each sessional period begins Government supporters meet, and many of them are resolved to demand action from the Government. They go into the party meeting like lions, but they come out like lambs. As I have said, the Prime Minister is a great orator. Probably he would have made a good High Court Justice, but he is not a proper and fit person to lead a government because he is not sufficiently practical. I say that more in sorrow than in anger. It matters little to me personally, but I am concerned for the welfare of the people. </para>
                    <para>In 1949, supporters of the present Government tried to make the people believe that the Chifley Government wanted economic controls for their own sake. Of course, that was not true. "We imposed controls only because they were necessary. When the people, at the instigation of those who now constitute the Government, refused to give the Commonwealth power to control prices, the slide into inflation began. At that time, I was in. charge of the organization for the control of prices, but I never contended, nor did any other Minister, that price fixing by itself would overcome our difficulties. However, during a time of racketeering and profiteering, the knowledge that the Government was doing its best to keep prices at a reasonable level would have greatly encouraged the public. We shall remain in the doldrums unless there is more intensive effort. In a country like this it should be possible to maintain and even improve our standard of living, but we must work for it. There is no substitute for work, and the people must be encouraged in order to give of their best. It is necessary that all sections of the people shall co-operate with the Government and the Government must give a lead. This Government has failed to do so. On the contrary, its policy has tended to foster unrest and discontent among those upon whose efforts we depend for greater production. I have never believed that we can dispense with imports. I know that we can be paid for our exports only if we accept imports. Nevertheless, if we are to grow up as a nation we must develop our secondary industries. In what other way are we to provide employment for an increasing population? </para>

Apparently, she does not know that, because of the mechanization of farming, more can now be produced from the land by fewer people. If we are to have a balanced economy we must develop our secondary industries.  As I have said, the policy of import restrictions has been clumsily administered. In some instances raw materials necessary for developmental purposes were stopped when they were already on the wharfs <inline font-style="italic">overseas</inline> awaiting shipment to Australia. 1 do not blame the Minister for Trade and Customs. Indeed, I am sorry for him. He has had to bear a great responsibility, one that it is almost physically impossible for a man to discharge. </para>

                    <para>I believe that the Government, before taking action, should have taken others into its confidence. Just before the last parliamentary recess I asked in this Senate what action the Government contemplated to remedy our worsening financial position overseas. I was given no satisfaction, but immediately the' Parliament adjourned, import restrictions were imposed.. It is a pity that the Government did not take the Opposition into its confidence. All the knowledge and understanding are not on the Government's side. Some men on this side have bad years of administrative experience in situations similar to the present one, but they were not consulted. We are often twitted with failing to suggest alternative proposals in place of those we criticize, but in practice we are not invited to co-operate. The Opposition is always willing to co-operate in furthering the .welfare of the country, but we are not encouraged when honorable members opposite refer us to, as one of them did last night, as Marxists and Communists. </para>
                    <para class="block">That is soap-box stuff which does not cut any ice with the people of Australia. They are getting tired of it. Indeed, many supporters of the Government  also  are tired of it. During the 1949 general election campaign supporters of antiLabour political parties told the people of this country that the Australian Labour party was a party of Communists in sympathy with Russia. That was a most diabolical thing. There appeared to be a conspiracy between the anti-Labour parties and the newspapers of thi3 country to discredit the Labour party. The opponents of Labour knew that the best way to do that would be to discredit the then Leader of the Australian Labour party, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> P&gt;. Chifley, who was probably the greatest man ever to sit in this Parliament. Yet, even until shortly before his death, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley</inline> continued to give the Government good advice. Honorable senators who support the Government parties promised the people that if returned to office they would see that the conditions of the people were improved. To-night, however, the Government parties stand indicted by the people because they have failed to honour that promise. The Government has failed utterly in its attempts to deal with the problems confronting the Australian nation. Indeed, its efforts to overcome our difficulties have resulted merely in greater dislocation of business and industry. The best thing that the Government could do would be to go to the people and seek endorsement pf the policy that it has pursued during the last two years. I do not believe for a moment that the people in the lower income brackets would endorse that policy. If the leaders of the Government parties had been wise they would have told the workers that if Australia was to get out of the mire the workers would have to do their part. The Government has failed to secure unity and the co-operation of the people in the way that the former Labour Government did during the war period, with the result that the inflationary trend has made it almost impossible for young married couples to obtain homes. It is likewise impossible for young rural workers to obtain farms of their own. I agree with the contention of a Government supporter this evening that it is necessary for primary pro.duction to be increased. This country should be developed quickly. But this Government is offering no encouragement to young people to settle on the land. Although the Government parties promised to ease the burden of taxation, they have greatly increased it. It almost appears that that has been done by design, in order to increase the difficulties and obstacles confronting the people. </para>
                    <para>Hitherto, Australia's trade relationships with other countries have been most satisfactory. Our word has always been our bond. But this Government, without a word of warning, has destroyed those relationships. During the regime of the former Labour Administration there was frequent consultation between the Australian Government and the Government of the United Kingdom in relation to trade. That practice was apparently discontinued by the present Government, which called in the doctor when the undertaker should have been called. I blame the Minister for Trade and Customs only to the extent to which he participated in framing the policy of the- Government. I am sure that if the Minister advocated the present policy of import restriction he is now very sorry that he made such a proposal. In view of the outspoken public criticism of the Government's policy in this respect, I consider that honorable senators opposite would be wise to look to their laurels and consider taking immediate remedial action. The Government should seek the cooperation of the trade unions. Although I cannot speak officially for the unions, I do know that they were most willing to co-operate with the former Labour Government. However, they have received no encouragement from the present Government, which has repeatedly criticized the workers in the lower income groups. There should be a change of mind on the part of the Government. Of course, I realize that the professional and business people in the community have had an easy time during the past few years and have made a lot of money. Their attitude now is that they want to get thingswith the expenditure of a minimum of effort. </para>

We would be candid with the people, tell them about our problems, and advise them, how those problems could be overcome. I am sure that we would receive the same helpful co-operation as was given to Labour during the period of the war. The Government is indulging in policies that Australia cannot afford. Every Wednesday, thousands of people may be seen proceeding to a race-course near Brisbane. At least a thousand motor cars are parked in the adjoining streets on. these mid-week race days. Race-horses, are getting the feed that dairy cattle should receive, because the dairy-farmers are unable to compete with race-horse owners who pay high prices for oats. A young country like Australia cannot hope to progress while such practices persist. The first thing that the Government should do is to stop fiddling while Rome burns. </para>

                            <para>- df the situation was not so serious, the honorable senator's interjection would be amusing. It is tragic that many young people in this country are starting out on life deprived of the possibility of marriage and with little prospect of being able to enjoy a normal living, due to the chaotic economic conditions now existing. If the Minister for Trade and Customs shares <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robertson's</inline> request for information about what Labour would do if elected to office, I assure him that if he makes representations to us we will endeavour to help him out of the present difficult situation. Had he consulted me before introducing the present terrible import restrictions I should have given him some good advice. I believe that the present policy of the Government in thisrespect must fail, because Australia will receive no benefit from the restrictions, which will, succeed only in injuring the good .trade relationships that Australia has enjoyed for a lengthy period with other countries. If there is anything worse than a coalition government, it is a three-party government. </para>

If the Government parties are sincere, they will go to the people.

Is it any wonder that the people of New South Wales have realized how little <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> knows about what goes on in his own State? The assets of that magnificent women's association increased in value by Â£59,000 last year and now total more than Â£426,000. It is a pity that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> did not know some of these facts. In every State of the Commonwealth these magnificent bands of women have pledged themselves to honour God, to be loyal to the Throne and to give service to the country. They believe that women working together for the good of women generally, are, at the same time, making a much-needed contribution to the nation, and, indeed to the whole world. These are the women about whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> asked a facetious question which was smirked at by many honorable senators opposite. </para>

The service constitutes a very important link of communication between the eastern States and South Australia as it conveys air-mail posted in the eastern States in the afternoon and enables it to be delivered in Adelaide on the following morning. There is serious disquiet, particularly among the members of the commercial community of South Australia, because of the cancellation of this service. In reply the Minister was good enough to say that he would look into the matter. He did so with his usual promptness and he has since been good enough to give me a copy of a statement he has received from the Minister for Civil Aviation. Having regard to certain facts which I shall present to the Senate I regard that statement as completely unsatisfactory. The statement is as follows: - </para>

Country airline services have been far more drastically reduced than have trunk-line services between capital cities, and there is no prospect of increased capital city services at their expense. The airlines themselves have rearranged their schedules in accordance with overall traffic and community requirements throughout Australia. I. very much regret the inconvenience caused, but it is inescapable in existing circumstances regarding the supply of aviation fuel. </para>

                <para class="block">I have examined the schedule of air services to and from this capital city and have ascertained that none of the services by Trans-Australia Airlines to Melbourne from Canberra has been cancelled, and that none of the services provided by that instrumentality from Canberra to Sydney - incidentally there are five daily - has been cancelled. No services provided by Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited from Canberra to Sydney, have been cut. Indeed, the company to-day added an additional service to its scheduled flights between Canberra and Sydney. The provision of  an  additional service between Canberra and Sydney  in  present circumstances should be investigated. I ask the Minister  to do  what  he  can  to  restore the service between Melbourne and Adelaide  to  which I have referred. </para>

                    <para>. -  I was keenly interested in the question asked  by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laugh</inline> t this morning and  in  a moment  of  inquisitiveness I took the trouble  to  ascertain whether any other air services  of  equal importance had been discontinued. I found that  no  comparable service had been cut and that the statements made  by  the honorable senator  in  his question this morning were perfectly true. I sin- ' cerely trust that the  Minister  will cause investigations  to be  made into the discontinuance  of  this important service. </para>
