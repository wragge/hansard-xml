Is it not a fact that Trans-Australia Airlines has a daily service from Hobart which arrives in Canberra at 12.40 p.m. on the day that it leaves Hobart, and that Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited has a daily service from Hobart which arrives in Canberra at 1.20 p.m. on the same day as it leaves Hobart? Is it not a fact that the daily Trans-Australia Airlines service from Burnie arrives in Canberra at 5 p.m. on the same day as it leaves that town? Are you aware that, notwithstanding the arrival of these aircraft at the times mentioned, the Hobart <inline font-style="italic">Mercury,</inline> which is supposed to be placed on the files in the Parliamentary Library at approximately <inline font-style="italic">3</inline> p.m. on the day of issue, is often 24 hours late; and that the Launceston <inline font-style="italic">Examiner,</inline> which could and should be on the same aircraft, is not placed in the library until the next day and is often not placed there for 27 hours after the arrival of the aircraft? Are you aware that the <inline font-style="italic">Advocate</inline> is usually placed on the files 48 or more hours after the arrival of the aeroplane from Burnie? Can arrangements be made whereby Tasmanian newspapers will be sent on the first aircraft from Tasmania and placed on the files in the library on the day of issue ? </para>

                        <para>- I have had an opportunity to consider the report of the Jute Controller, who is in charge of the importation of jute goods, with particular reference to cornsacks. Honorable senators will appreciate the fact that for a number of years supplies of cornsacks have been very difficult to obtain. The Jute Controller has ensured each year that adequate supplies of cornsacks and woolpacks would arrive in Australia at the appropriate times. As honorable senators are aware, the wheat industry would be placed in a very embarrassing position if ships arrived to transport the harvest and sufficient supplies of cornsacks were not available. In other years, when the price of jute has been increased after orders have been lodged overseas, the farmers have received the benefit of the lower price. This year, the price of jute has fallen very considerably since orders were lodged and farmers and other jute users will have to pay a price based on the cost. I understand that the prices of cornsacks in stock and of those arriving in new shipments are averaged and that, apart from a small commission paid to those responsible for effecting deliveries, farmers and others buy cornsacks at the average cost price. I very much regret that the price of jute has fallen considerably since orders for cornsacks were placed. Those of us who are in business know what the fall in the price of jute will mean. Jute is not the only commodity in respect of which merchants are now making substantial losses. </para>

                        <para>I desire to ask a question of the Minister representing the Minister for Supply. By way of explanation, I point out that the road between Launceston and Bell Bay, in Tasmania, is in a very bad condition and is rapidly becoming worse, because of the cartage of heavy materials for the construction of the aluminium works at Bell Bay. This project is more or less a defence undertaking. The Australian Government subscribed four-fifths of the capital, and the Tasmanian Government only one-fifth, and it may be claimed that the road is, in some measure, a military road. Will the Minister consider the possibility of assisting financially the Tasmanian Government in the repair and reconstruction of this road? </para>

                        <para>The Commonwealth's concern in this road is limited to the interests of the Australian Aluminium Production Commission, the highway itself being a State public works project which the Premier of Tasmania announced would be undertaken as an alternative to railway connexion. The commission has neither the authority nor the financial resources to participate in the building of this road. It is also pointed out that during the present financial stringency, it would be out of the question for the Commonwealth to assume a further burden of possibly Â£1,000,000 for work which the State of Tasmania should provide in its loan works programme. The Australian Aluminium Production Commission, though naturally eager to see the highway constructed us early as possible, has taken a realistic view of the position by urging the  Tasmanian  Public Works Department to make an early start on the construction of a new section of the highway from the vicinity of Hillwood to Bell Bay - .the worst section - with adequate maintenance of the LauncestonHillwood portion until Suite finances permit its reconstruction. This appears to be a reasonable proposition which, I hope, will he favorably considered by the Public Works Department, and put in hand by stages according to the amount of funds which the State is able to provide. </para>

The Minister then stated that the Australian Aluminium Production Commission has neither the authority nor the money to provide such assistance. As the Tasmanian Government has stated that it has not sufficient funds to undertake this very urgent work, would the Minister give sympathetic consideration to a request by the Premier of Tasmania that the Australian Government should purchase the one-fifth shareholding of the Tasmanian Government in the aluminium industry on condition that the money paid for that shareholding shall be expended by the Tasmanian Government on the provision of such a road and railway? </para>

                        <para>- I preface a question to the Minister representing the Minister acting for the Minister for Civil Aviation by pointing out that, according to press and radio reports, Australian airline operators intend to purchase turbo-propelled aircraft for use in Australia. I understand that such aircraft could save from nine to ten minutes on the journey from Melbourne to Sydney, compared with the aircraft that are at present in operation on that route. Will the Minister inform me whether a large expenditure of public funds would 'be involved in the provision of reinforced concrete standings on the major airports of this country. I understand that their purchase would make heavy inroads into our much-needed exchange. Would it not be possible to purchase, instead, pistonengined aircraft that have an extensive life still ahead of them, for use on the ordinary airlines of Australia? Such aircraft are capable of travelling just as quickly as the jet aircraft, have a greater range, operate more economically, and their purchase would not involve such a large expenditure of public moneys. Will the Minister assure the Senate that contracts for the purchase of turbo-jet aircraft will not be entered into until the Parliament has had an opportunity to examine the matter? </para>

                    <quote>
                        <para>European  immigrants who become unemployed while living in hostels are charged the same rates for board and lodging as those charged to British immigrants in similar circumstances. It is true, however, that some time ago it was decided to speed up the placement in employment of newly arrived immigrants by transferring some of them from reception and training centres operated by the Department of Immigration to hostels operated by Commonwealth Hostels Limited, where they would be on the spot for interview and engagement by employers. Immigrants so transferred cannot be regarded as ordinary hostel residents since they are awaiting their first placement in employment in the same way as those in reception and training centres and the Commonwealth Government is just as liable for their support as it would have been had they remained in the centres. The presence of these immigrants in a hostel is a matter of convenience to facilitate placement in employment, and they cannot, therefore, be asked to contribute more towards their upkeep than those who await placement in a reception centre. Immigrants awaiting initial placement in employment receive a special Social Services Benefit from which they contribute towards the cost of their maintenance in the reception centres or hostels as the case may be. This benefit is equal in amount to the unemployment benefit and when this was 25s. a week, the single immigrant contributed 20s. a week towards the cost of his accommodation. Following the recent increase in the amount of this benefit from 25s. to 50s. a week, there will be a corresponding increase in the contribution hy the immigrant towards accommodation costs, hut the actual amount has yet to be determined. In the case of those accommodated at hostels, the Department of Immigration meets the cost of the balance of the hostel tariff. </para>
                        <para>To date, 415 immigrants have been moved to hostels under these special arrangements and of these 360 have already been placed in employment. I would emphasize that immediately an immigrant residing in a hostel is placed in initial employment, ho becomes liable to pay the full hostel tariff, and if he subsequently becomes unemployed he is charged the same tariff as that applicable to other unemployed residents. The concession mentioned is extended only until his initial placement in employment. It will, therefore, be seen that immigrants placed in this manner enjoy no advantage ill the matter of hostel charges over any other immigrants arriving in Australia under inter -governmental agreements, and that there is no discrimination as between European and British immigrants in the rates -charged by Commonwealth Hostels Limited. </para>

                        <para>- By way of personal explanation,  I  should like to take this opportunity to place on record my denial of a report which appeared in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> yesterday, Tuesday, the 14th October, 1952. The <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> stated that in a speech which was made by me in the Senate some weeks age I advocated the transfer of Australian industries to Singapore and to other places in the East in order to get the advantage of cheap coloured labour. At no time did I intend that construction to be placed on what I said, and at no time did I say that. I did suggest that we should encourage Australian industry to move into South-East Asia, and later in my remarks, I suggested that we encourage every Australian industry that could possibly do so, to establish branches in South-East Asia. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>In advocating that course I followed exactly in the footsteps of cur late Prime Minister and Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley. Mr. Chifley</inline> gave tangible help to Australian industries which wished to expand into those areas.  His  help has been publicly acknowledged by industrial leaders in this country.To suggest, as some would, that I advocated the closing down of Australian factories, and their re-opening outside Australia, is a complete and utter falsehood. I, with my party, have advocated and fought for the expansion of Australian primary and secondary industries, so that high standards and full employment would be a part of our normal way of life. But, if Australia is to play its part in the Pacific; one of the most important ways that it can do so, is byexpanding and developing our industries in Asia. </para>

                        has said, and I say now, that the most tangible expression of the desires that were written into the Colombo plan would be the establishment of branches of our industries in those countries which sorely reed our help. The leaders of those nations have pleaded with the great industrial countries of the world to come intotheir countries and play their part in helping to industrialize them and so lift their standards.

                <para class="block">This bill; in conjunction with legislation submitted to the Legislative Council for the Northern Territory, is designed to give effect to certain proposals which were announced by the Minister for Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hasluck)</inline> on the 6th September in a statement respecting native welfare. In that statement the Minister referred to the conditions under which land might be resumed from aboriginal reserves, the method by which it might be resumed and the conditions under which prospecting and mining might bepermitted on reserves. A significant part of the announcement was to the effect that, if mining took place on an aboriginal reserve or on any land which had been resumed from a reserve, a royalty should be levied on the minerals won and those royalties should be paid into a trust fund which would be applied for the benefit of aborigines. </para>
                <para>In order to put the proposal into effect, legislation is necessary both in this Parliament and in the Legislative Council for the Northern Territory. A bill which  was recently introduced into the Legislative Council for the Northern Territory to amend the Mining Ordinance of the territory sets out the conditions under which mining may take place on aboriginal reserves, and lays down the procedure for the resumption of reserves for the purposes of mining. It also lays down that a royalty shall be levied on any minerals won and that these royalties shall be paid into a trust fund to be known as the Aborigines (Benefits from Mining) Trust Fund, to be administered for the benefit of the aboriginal native inhabitants of the Northern Territory. The ordinance provides that, with the consent of the Minister, the Administrator of the Northern Territory can make payments or grant benefits from the fund either direct to, or through the agency of any person or association of persons on behalf of an aboriginal native' inhabitant of the Northern Territory or a group or class of aboriginal native inhabitants of the Northern Territory in such a manner as the Minister sees fit. </para>
                <para>Legal advice was given to the Government that the Legislative Council for the Northern Territory did not have the power to create a trust fund and the purpose of the bill now before this Senate is simply to establish the fund. The bill contains one substantial clause to the effect' that a. new section shall be inserted in the Northern Territory (Administration) Act .1910-49, establishing the trust fund as a trust account within the meaning of section 62a of the Audit Act 1910-50, and providing that there shall be paid into the fund, out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which is appropriated accordingly, amounts equal to the  amounts  from time to time received by or on behalf of the Commonwealth by way of royalties under any provision of the law of the territory relating to mining on aboriginal reserves or on lands which have been included in aboriginal reserves. The clause also provides that payments of such amounts as the Minister directs or approves may be made out of the fund and applied to or for the benefit of aboriginals or aboriginal institutions. Interest received from the investment of money standing to the credit of the fund will form a part of the fund. </para>
                <para>In commending this bill to the Senate, I should like to repeat the assurances which were given in my colleague's earlier statement that great care will be exercised in the granting of permits to persons to prospect or mine on aboriginal reserves, and that the interests of natives will be safeguarded at all times. It is not the policy of this Government to throw open aboriginal reserves or to reduce them thoughtlessly ; nor should any prospector or miner be misled into thinking that he will be encouraged by this Government to enter on reserves. The effect of the action we are taking is that, in those cases in which reserves or portions of reserves are not necessary for the useand benefit of aborigines, and where the presence of minerals is suspected, we will in future have the legal power to permit the entry of the prospector or the miner, and, if minerals are found in such quantities as to make the action worthwhile, we will have the legal power to resume a part of a reserve for mining purposes. In every case, however, the interests of the natives will be watched carefully. There will be no general rule in favour of miners and prospectors. Each application will bo determined in the light of the surrounding facts and will have to be justified by the facts. Each permit to enter a reserve and the granting of each mining lease will be subject to such conditions as may be necessary to ensure that the remaining interests of the natives are respected. No resumption of any part of a reserve will be made without reference to the Governor-General, and any resumption will have to be notified to this Parliament, which will, of course, be able to exercise its customary powers if it wishes to disallow such resumption. </para>
                <para>In some quarters, the question has been asked why the natives themselves should not work any minerals that may be found on the reserves. In general, mining would be beyond the skill and the resources of most of the natives in the Northern Territory. If it should happen that any natives living on reserves show an interest in, and capacity for, either prospecting or mining on those reserves, they will receive every possible encouragement and opportunity to engage in this activity. Natives outside the reserves, who would be entitled to apply for a miner's right or a mining lease can, of course, do so. It may be that natives will be able to work on their own account and benefit from it, but in the great majority of cases the present condition of the natives in the territory and the nature of their interests are such that, both as individuals and as a group, they are likely to receive a more practical and more immediate benefit by a system of royalties which will provide funds to be expended for their social advancement. I commend to the Senate this bill to create a trust fund for natives. </para>

                    <para class="block">The purpose of this bill is to amend the Wool Realization (Distribution of Profits) Act 1948 to permit a distribution to persons who have left the wool industry of their full entitlement of profits arising from the operations of the Joint Organization, and to set a final date by which all profits shall be distributed. The profits result from the sale by the Joint Organization of approximately 0,800,000 bales of Australian wool which could not be sold during the war. The United Kingdom is entitled to receive one-half of the profits made on the sale of this wool. The share of profits which has accrued to Australia so far is approximately Â£92,000,000. It is expected that a relatively small additional amount, perhaps of the order of Â£1,000,000 or Â£2,000,000, will accrue to Australia during the liquidation of the Joint Organization. </para>
                    <para>Late in 1948, the Parliament passed the Wool Realization (Distribution of </para>
                    <para class="block">Profits) Act to give legislative effect to the several governmental promises that Australian wool-growers would receive the profits made from the sale of the wool supplied by them in war-time. That act enabled the Government to make advance distributions out of the expected net profit, and to make a final distribution when the full profit had been ascertained. Further, it established the right of all wool-growers, who had submitted participating wool during the war, to share in all distributions of profits by reference to the value of wool submitted by them for appraisement. In November, 1949, the first profit distribution under the act was made. Approximately Â£25,000,000 was thus paid out in the middle of the 1949-50 wool year, when wool prices reached quite high levels. In the following season, 1950-51, wool prices attained unprecedented heights - the seasonal average price for greasy wool was 144d. per lb. - but, late in that season, they fell substantially. The somewhat lower levels then established prevailed during the 1951-52 season, when the average price for greasy wool sold at auction was 72d. per lb. In March of this year, this Government arranged for a further Â£25,000,000 to be distributed. In the last three years, therefore, wool-growers have received two payments totalling Â£50,000,000, representing profits on wool supplied by them in war-time, and, in addition, they received very satisfactory returns from the sale of current clips at high prices. Thus, the undistributed profits amount to approximately Â£42,000,000. </para>
                    <para>The Government has decided that a programme shall be established for the distribution of the balance of profits. It has become increasingly evident that many wool-growers who left the wool industry before the high level of wool prices became established have been experiencing hardship of one form or an- . ' other. Some are aged and infirm, and have been looking forward to receiving their shares of the profit to assist them to carry on. After considering the possibility of making special provision to meet cases of hardship, the Government came to the conclusion that the most satisfactory way to deal with the many such cases that had come to its notice would be to make to all the growers who had left the industry a distribution of their full entitlement of profit. As I have said, the people who were affected were those who left the industry before the higher level of wool prices became established. Such a distribution was not necessary for those who enjoyed the high wool prices prevailing during and after 1949-50. Therefore, after discussing the matter with representatives of wool-growers' organizations, the Government decided that the special distribution should be extended only to those who had left the wool-growing industry before the 1st September, 1949, which marked the beginning of the higher level of wool prices. </para>
                    <para>The Government decided, further, that following the interim distribution of Â£25,000,000 in March, 1952, in which all entitled persons participated, there should be further interim distributions to those persons who had remained in the industry after the 1st September, 1949, the object being to make, as provided in the bill, the final distribution not later than the financial year 1954-55. Subject to developments in the <inline font-style="italic">Poulton</inline> case, to which I shall refer in a moment, the Government's intention is that there should be three further such distributions at annual intervals. </para>
                    <para>Three main factors were responsible for the Government's decision not to distribute at once all the profits available. First, the level of taxation was, and still is, such that, had the full profit entitlement been distributed to all growers at once, a great many of them would have retained very little of the money. The principal beneficiary would have been the Consolidated Revenue Fund, and that would have been contrary to the Commonwealth's intention. The second reason - and from the point of view of the national economy a very important reason - for the Government's decision not to make a complete distribution of the profits immediately was that the addition of such a large sum to the monetary system in a period of high wool prices and rising prices in general would have greatly magnified the inflationary problem, the effect of which the Australian economy is still feeling. If all the profits had been paid out in the financial year 1951-52, and not merely the Â£25,000,000 which was distributed last March, approximately Â£67,000,000 would have been added to the currency stream. The third reason is that there is still pending in the High Court the case known as the <inline font-style="italic">Poulton</inline> case, in which the plaintiff, who is. a dealer, not only claimed, as against the grower, to be entitled to payment under the act, but also put in issue the whole basis of the war-time wool acquisition scheme. The hearing of the case has been completed, but judgment on it has been reserved. The Government has felt that the implications of this case are such, and the amount which could possibly be involved is so large, that the proper course for it to take was to postpone the completion of distribution of moneys under the act. This third reason is of course the only factor responsible for the delay in making payments of the current full entitlement to persons who left the industry before the 1st September, 1949. How long this situation will prevail will depend on the length of time the litigation may take. If, as is hoped, the case is settled promptly, passage of this legislation now will enable the Government, as soon after the court's judgment as applications can be dealt with, to make the special distribution to persons who have left the industry. </para>
                    <para>The Government realizes, however, that the legal proceedings could be prolonged. In that eventuality, adherence by the Government to its decision to postpone, during the litigation, further payments under the act, would delay further distribution to those who have left the industry and thus negative the Government's objective of relieving hardship. The Government is eager to avoid this, and wishes, in the event of prolonged litigation, to be able to distribute to those who have left the industry at least a portion of their full entitlement, pending settlement of the <inline font-style="italic">Poulton</inline> case. The Government cannot decide what portion could safely be distributed until it is aware of the total amount involved in payments under the special distribution. This will be disclosed by the applications from persons entitled to participate in the special distribution and a decision can then be made and an appropriate amount distributed. Applications will be called  for  immediately the legislation is passed. </para>
                    <para>The bill has therefore been drafted to cover the alternative possibilities of a prompt or a deferred settlement of the litigation. It is not proposed that these special arrangements should apply to persons who had not left the industry before the 1st September, 1949 - that is, to the participants who would normally share in the three annual distributions - and, of course, they would not apply in respect of any profit moneys relating to wool submitted for war-time appraisement through dealers. Such moneys are directly at issue in the <inline font-style="italic">Poulton</inline> case, and can be paid only when the court has determined whether the dealer or the grower should receive them. The bill allows of the annual instalments to which I have referred being paid as decided by the Government, provided that all the profits arc distributed not later than the 30th June, 1955. There would thus be flexibility, which would enable the Government to make a final distribution much sooner than the 1954-55 financial year, should that course be considered necessary or desirable. </para>
                    <para>The bill provides for the establishment of a trust fund, to be known as the Wool Disposals Profit Fund, into which will be paid all the profits - most of which are now held by the Australian Wool Realization Commission - arising from the operation of the Joint Organization, other than those already paid out or reserved for later payment under the terms of previous distributions. </para>
                    <para>As was contemplated by section 25 of the existing act, the interim  distribution  effected last March was made out of an advance made by the Commonwealth Bank to the Australian Wool Realization Commission. Repayment of this advance would te made out of the Joint Organization profit moneys, which the commission is authorized by the bill to retain. Legal advice that has been received by the Government suggests the advisability of validating the method of distribution adopted in 1949, and there is a provision in the bill to cover this aspect of the matter. Payments in connexion with subsequent distributions will  be made out of the Wool Disposals Profit Fund. </para>
                    <para>The bill will introduce into the existing act a completely new part which will enable the Government to make the special distribution to persons who left the industry before the  1st  September,  1949.  Each person's share in that distribution will be calculated as a percentage of the appraised value of all wool that was submitted by him for appraisement in the war years, and which was regarded in the war-time scheme as " participating wool ". The percentage will be calculated according to the amount in  the  Wool Disposals Profit Fund at the time of the special distribution, and the total appraised value of all participating wool. Persons sharing in the special distribution will ' receive in one payment their full share of all profit moneys held in the fund at that time, provided that the <inline font-style="italic">Poulton</inline> case has been settled by then. Otherwise, as I have already indicated, they will receive, as an advance payment, as much as the Government considers may safely be paid out, having regard to the total amount payable under the special distribution and the implications of the <inline font-style="italic">Poulton</inline> case. Suitable provision is made in the bill to ensure that persons participating in the special distribution will receive their due share of any moneys received by the Commonwealth from the Joint Organization after the special distribution has been made. Expenses in each distribution will be borne by the participants in that distribution. Participation in the special distribution will be by application. The applications will be examined by the Australian Wool Realization Commission, which will include a majority of growers, and which will make recommendations to the Minister on whether the claims come within the provisions of the legislation. Each person whose application is approved will become entitled to be paid an amount equal to the declared percentage of the appraised value of participating wool that was supplied by him during war time. In connexion with the proposed special distribution, it has been necessary to make specific provision for the treatment of trustees, holders of securities, companies and partnerships. The bill also contains a clause  to ensure that, although a person may qualify technically for the special distribution, he may be excluded from payments under it if the Minister considers that, in all the circumstances, he cannot fairly be regarded as having left the industry before the 1st September, 1949.  His  overall entitlement, of course, will be thereby affected. </para>
                    <para>Under the existing act, payments of less than Â£1 are not made in any distribution, but because it is how contemplated that there will be five distributions in all, the act is to be amended to provide that, as a part of the final distribution, the total of such unpaid amounts will be paid to entitled persons, provided they exceed Â£1 in all. Many of the provisions of the amending bill are of a machinery nature, to implement the proposed alteration of the present scheme. I need not refer to them at present. I commend the bill to honorable senators. . </para>

                <para>The bill will amend the Customs Act 1901-1951 so as to remove doubts of the validity of certain regulations and administrative procedures, and in order to bring certain provisions of the act into line with present-day commercial practice. It will also simplify procedures in the interests of people who transact business with the Department of Trade and Customs. Section 4 and other sections of the act refer to aerodromes that have been appointed for the purposes of the act. As the term " airport " is now used internationally, it is therefore desirable for the term to be substituted for " aerodrome " in those sections. </para>
                <para>Division 1 of Part IV. of the act provides that the goods specifically enumerated in the division, and all goods the importation of which is prohibited by regulation, shall be prohibited imports. In addition, certain sections of Division 1 are either redundant or similar in effect to other sections of this act and of the Copyright Act 1912-1950. It is therefore considered desirable to repeal and re-enact the whole of the division. The effect will be that goods which are prohibited imports will be prescribed in the regulations. </para>
                <para>It has been found necessary in certain circumstances to issue import licences subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions after importation, such as, for example, that the goods shall not be sold within a specified time. Experience has shown that when import licences have been issued subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions after importation, and such conditions have not been complied with by the importer, the Department of Trade and Customs has no power to enforce the conditions, and it has no right of action against the goods or the importer. It is proposed therefore, to amend the act in order to provide the necessary power to issue import licences subject to certain conditions to be fulfilled after importation, and to enable the taking of securities to ensure that the conditions upon which importation has been allowed shall be complied with. </para>
                <para>Under section 97, warehoused goods may be removed from a warehouse for the purpose of public exhibition, as prescribed by regulation. It has been found impracticable to deal with such matters expeditiously by regulation. The amendment of the section will enable Collectors of Customs to approve the quantities, and specify the periods during which the owner may retain the goods outside the warehouse without entering the goods for home consumption. </para>
                <para>Section 132 provides that all import duties shall be paid at the rate in force when the goods are entered for home consumption. As it is  not practicable to apply that section to stores for ships and aircraft, owing to the fact that they are consumed before they could be entered for home consumption, it is proposed to add a new section in Part VII. to provide for the acceptance of duty at  the  rates in force on the date the declaration of stores consumed is signed. </para>
                <para>As Part VII. is considered unsatisfactory from a drafting point of view, the bill proposes to repeal and remake the Part. The provisions of the proposed new Part VII. will not alter any of the existing practices in relation to the control of stores for ships and aircraft. </para>
                <para>The proposed amendment of section 162 will enable security, in lieu of a deposit of duty, to be given to the Customs authorities that goods imported into Australia will be re-exported within a period of twelve months. It is proposed, also, that the period during which the goods may remain in Australia may be extended at the discretion of the Minister. The insistence upon a deposit of duty, and the inability to extend the period beyond twelve months, have proved unduly onerous to importers, in certain circumstances. A new section 234a has been included in the bill, whereby unauthorized persons may be refused entry to any ship, aircraft, wharf or place where passengers are being cleared through the Customs until such time as the necessary customs formalities have been completed. Experience has shown that the presence of unauthorized persons hinders the speedy clearance through the Customs of passengers and their baggage and is an obvious aid to smuggling. In this connexion it has been found imperative, particularly with immigrant ships, to control the many visitors who come to the wharfs to meet their friends. </para>
                <para>The customs tariff authorizes the Minister to make by-laws under which goods are admitted at concessional rates of duty. Numerous applications for entry of goods under by-law are received, necessitating, in many instances, inquiries in Australia and the United Kingdom to determine whether the goods are entitled to the benefits of by-law admission. It is frequently the case that, before a by-law is gazetted, the goods have arrived and are entered at the normal rates of duty. A subsequent refund of the difference between the duty paid under the normal tariff item and that due under the by-law enables the importer to obtain the full benefit of the tariff concession. As there is doubt as to the authority in section 163 to pay such refunds, it is proposed to amend the section to authorize these payments. </para>
                <para>In isolated cases the situation also arises that a by-law item under which the goods would have been eligible for entry has been repealed before the bylaw could be gazetted. The inability of the Minister to make by-laws in such circumstances imposes severe hardship on importers. It is therefore proposed to insert a new section 271 which will provide, <inline font-style="italic">inter alia,</inline> that a by-law may be made in respect of any item of the customs tariff in relation to any goods entered for home consumption during the continuance of that item, notwithstanding that the item has been repealed prior to the making of the by-law. </para>
                <para>The remaining amendments are of minor importance and are designed to simplify certain customs procedure in the interests of those transacting business with the Department of Trade and Customs, and also to authorize various practices which have been operating satisfactorily in the past.

I understand that it is more or less a formality in order to- get business through the Senate. In the last week or ten days of a session,, the Senate usually agrees to the suspension of that standing order to enable the business of the Senate to be completed. </para>

                <para class="block">The real purpose of the standing order is to. present a process of legislation by exhaustion. After honorable senators have addressed themselves to the business of the Senate, from either eleven o'clock in the morning or three o'clock in the afternoon, I consider that 10.30 p.m. is at seasonable hour at which to terminate the1 introduction of new business. If, after that hour, the Government sees fit to-' introduce new bills,, the intention is obviously not merely to float such business1,, but also- to carry it to a conclusion.  That  plainly involves sitting into the small hours of the morning.. When that practice Is repeated,, or even' if it  occurs  only once, it is most detrimental to the health of honorable senators and all who are associated with the Senate. The terms of the motion indicate very plainly that the Government has made up its mind that this sessional period shall end on the 31st October. On behalf of the Opposition, I oppose that proposal most wholeheartedly. So far as the Opposition is concerned, there is before the Senate a vista of vastly important bills, many of which are highly controversial. The Opposition sees no reason why the next two months of this year should not be available for adequate debate of those bills. No Minister who has spoken about the 31st October as a.n objective for the ending of this sessional period has given a single reason why that date has been decided on. </para>
                <para>The Opposition has continuously cooperated with the Government, particularly in the closing stages of a session when many bills which are not of a controversial nature are introduced. The Government has not the slightest justification for any claim that it has not had the full co-operation of the Opposition. I leave that as a challenge to honorable senators on the Government side ot the chamber. Again and again they have received the fullest co-operation from honorable senators on this side. It now appears that to the ruthless gagging of debates which has marked the conduct of the Government in this chamber recently, and of which I suspect we are to have- one more outstanding example- later to-day, is to be added a process of legislation by exhaustion. I do not propose to address myself to the motion at greater length, but I do not wish anybody to think that the relative brevity of my protest is not matched by the intensity of the objection of the Opposition to the proposal'. The Opposition will oppose and vote against the motion. </para>

                        <para>- I may have been a Minister when such a motion was proposed on behalf of the government of the day, but I know that no such motion was ever introduced weeks before the end of a sessional period. The Government has received a high degree of co-operation from the Opposition in this Parliament, and if the Government had approached us and indicated its wishes in regard to each of the several bills that it proposes to introduce, it would have received every assistance from us. However, in view of the conduct of Ministers in this chamber during recent weeks, when debate has been ruthlessly gagged by the Government on many occasions, I warn them that they cannot expect to continue to receive the same measure of co-operation from the Opposition as they have been privileged to receive from us in the past. And in using the word " privileged " I do so advisedly. </para>

                        has come to the conclusion that the Senate will necessarily rise by the 31st October. My remarks did not imply any such intention on the part of the Government. Concerning the honorable senator's suggestion that the Senate might be kept in session for another two months, I say that whilst honorable senators on this side of the chamber would be quite prepared to sit for another two months, we cannot see any purpose in remaining in session for an. extended period during which there would not be one member of the Opposition present. It is very difficult to keep them here now. In fact, it is an amazing and encouraging experience to see three or four of them present in the chamber now.

                        <para>- The honorable senator did not do so for a very good reason. That reason is that such a motion is almost invariably submitted by the Leader of the Government in this chamber, and the honorable was not, of course, the Leader of the Administration of which he was a member. My recollection, like that of many other honorable senators, of the procedure adopted by the last Labour Administration is that similar motions were repeatedly and ruthlessly introduced by it towards the close of sessional periods. And the members of that Administration did so notwithstanding that the Opposition was composed of only three members. </para>

                    <para>. - The purpose of the bill is to amend the Navigation Act. Fortunately, I can make at least one non-controversial statement in the course of my remarks; it is that the bill is both comprehensive and important, and the act that it proposes to amend deals with matters of vital importance. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I invite the attention of honorable senators generally to the fact that the bill occupies 21 pages of print and consists of 38 clauses. At the commencement of his second-reading speech yesterday, the Minister for  Shipping  and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> shocked the Opposition when he intimated that the Government wanted the bill to be passed by the Senate to-day. In fact, we were doubly shocked by his intimation after we had had an opportunity to ascertain the length of the printed bill and the importance of the matters with which it deals. If the Minister adheres to his intention to force the bill through the Senate to-day, the result will be that the 60 members of this chamber will have only a few hours in which to debate the motion for its second-reading and to consider in detail all its clauses. </para>
                <para>Some of the 3S clauses in this bill provide for the insertion of many  new  sections in the act. For instance, clause 30 provides for six new sections to be incorporated in the principal act,  and  clause 37 provides for fifteen. new sections to be placed in it. This bill deals with 60 or 70 substantive matters each of which will require full and complete consideration in committee. There are many matters on which the Opposition desires information and I have little doubt that information will be wanted by Government senators also. I invite the Senate to examine the act that is to be amended. The Navigation Act was prepared after years of study, royal commissions and general consideration and is incorporated in 241 pages. It has 425 sections and 94 pages of schedules. I, personally, am not familiar with the measure that is to be amended. I doubt very much whether more than two or three honorable senators could honestly claim that they were familiar with such a comprehensive and technical piece of legislation as the Navigation Act. One cannot have a clear understanding of the very comprehensive amendments that have been submitted to the Senate without a background knowledge of this legislation. In these circumstances it is obvious that I and many of my colleagues have not had adequate time in which to consider the measure. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to hear that interjection from a Government supporter. After this bill was introduced yesterday, honorable senators were busily engaged in this chamber until after 11 o'clock at night. It is common knowledge that honorable senators on both sides of the chamber have been engaged throughout the whole of this morning at executive and party meetings. So the one opportunity that we have had to examine these proposals, which cover 21 pages, was in the small hours of this morning. Neither I nor any of my colleagues have had an adequate opportunity to study the implications of this measure. </para>

                        <para>- I propose to ask the Minister that question at a later stage of my remarks. In order to study the maritime industry it is necessary to have a knowledge of the operations of the Maritime Industry Commission which was  set up in 1942. That body had promulgated 63 major orders by early 1948. An intelligent approach to this bill requires at least some knowledge of those orders. I acknowledge that the continuance of the operations of the Maritime Industry Commission under a national security regulation, long after the war has ended, is far from desirable. I think it is very necessary that matters concerning the maritime industry should be incorporated in permanent legislation. I can  support  the Minister to that extent. But the Government has had almost three years in which to prepare the amendments to the Navigation Act. Yet it wants all these comprehensive amendments to be disposed of to-day. The Minister has given no reason for treating the bill as a matter of urgency. I hope that the Minister will not prevent himself from replying to honorable senators who speak on this measure by moving " That the question be now put ". If the Minister intends to gag this debate I invite him to make some opportunity available to himself to reply to the very important submissions which I am certain will be made to him from both sides of the chamber. </para>

Honorable senators are entitled to know why the Minister wishes to limit this debate. This bill is of vast importance, not only to ship-owners, charterers of ships, and officers and crews, but to every individual in Australia because sea transport is of vital importance to everybody. It has an impact on the daily life of every individual although very often the individual does not realize that fact. This industry, which is now under considera tion for the first time in many years in this chamber is, without doubt, of fundamental importance to defence. One would expect that before the Government proposed to amend the Navigation Act, which has stood almost unaltered in all its majesty and volume for many years, it would have consulted the practical people who are concerned with the maritime industry. I ask the Minister whether the Maritime Industry Commission which has guided this industry for the past ten years has been consulted regarding the bill. 1. am prepared to suggest to the Minister, on the information available lo me, that the commission was not consulted prior <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the introduction of this measure. </para><interjection>

                        <para>- I do not know what the Minister means by that remark. He seems to have some phobia in relation to Moscow. The Government knows that the Maritime Industry Commission has done an excellent job in a period of ten years. The Government itself has allowed the commission to function for the last three years. Yet I did not hear, in the second-reading speech of the Minister, one word of thanks to the members of that commission who have served long and well. There was an implied suggestion in the Minister's speech that the commission had been responsible for the disastrous delays that have taken place in the maritime industry. I think that the Minister might at least have uttered some word of appreciation to the members of the commission. From the national viewpoint, surely those who, for the past ten years, have controlled this important industry should have been consulted about every detail of this bill. Both the shipowners and the employees' union should have had the fullest opportunity for consultation with the Government. </para>

From the inquiries that I have been able to make in the very limited time at my disposal I have learned that the provisions of this bill have not been referred to the Marine Council. I invite the Minister to say "~hy the council was not consulted. Why was not the spirit of section 424 of the act observed? Does the Minister consider that all wisdom and knowledge in relation to this important industry, with such varied ramifications, lies within the ambit of his mind and the minds of those in his department who advise him? Surely it would be common sense to seek the advice of those who are engaged in the industry. </para><para>It is exceedingly unfortunate for the prestige of the Senate that one of the rare bills which are first introduced in this chamber should be dealt with so contemptuously and gagged so unmercifully. This is one of the worst blows that has been struck against the prestige of this chamber. The Minister for Shipping and Transport, who should have the standing of the Senate at heart, has denied honorable senators the right to make a real contribution to the debate on the bill. I deplore the attitude of the Minister, which apparently is supported by all other members of the Government and by all members of the Government parties in this chamber. It is regrettable indeed that honorable senators opposite should lend themselves to a practice of this kind. Their action is derogatory to the Senate and injurious to its status'. The Minister is driving one more nail into the coffin of this chamber. Practices such as this can only hasten the abolition of the Senate. I have had occasion to make that comment several times in the past few days owing to the behaviour of the Government. The Government's action in connexion with this measure is in marked contrast to what was done, under the aegis of the . Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spicer),</inline> recently in relation to the Patents Bill. That measure was introduced in the ordinary manner, and so that honorable senators could absorb its very voluminous contents, a considerable time was allowed to elapse before the debate on it was called on. Those people outside the Parliament who are interested in the measure also had ample opportunity to examine it and express their views upon it. When the bill had been passed by the Senate, it was introduced into the House of Representatives, and once again the normal leisurely process was followed. Many suggestions that emanated both from the Parliament and from the general public were found to be practicable and desirable, and they were adopted. In due course, the bill came back to the Senate with many amendments, and, in its amended form, was approved unanimously by this chamber. That example could well have been followed on this occasion. It is most  unfortunate that the Minister, backed by his Government, had decided otherwise. It is an insult to this chamber to ask it to dispose of this vastly important and comprehensive bill to-day. It is also an insult to every individual member of the Senate. I certainly regard it as such. If the present tendency to curtail debate continues, we shall very soon have a Minister moving, at the conclusion of his second-reading speech, " That the question be now put". Surely all honorable senators opposite will concede that the Opposition has not merely a right to investigate bills, but also a duty to do so. I do not question the accuracy of second-reading speeches by Ministers, but our duty, as well as our right, is to apply our minds objectively and independently to the contents of those speeches and to probe and test them with every means at our disposal. That right has been denied on this occasion. If the Minister adheres to his announced decision to secure the passage of this bill to-day, he will be acting not only unreasonably but also outrageously. I go further and say that the proposal is totalitarian. If the present trend continues we shall very soon reach the stage at which, just as in certain, other countries there is only one candidate to vote for at election time, so, in this Senate there will be only one effective voice. I regard this matter as being of such importance that I fear Â£ am unable to protest adequately against the Government's attitude. I should like to he able to protest much more strongly than I am capable of doing. Having said that, I put it to the Minister that he should indicate before I conclude my speech that he will allow the debate on this measure to be adjourned until next week. If, in the course of my remarks, the Minister will indicate that I may move that the debate be adjourned, he will be doing the right thing by the Senate, by the maritime industry, by the Parliament and by democracy. </para><interjection>

                        <para>- I am dealing with the bill now before the Senate. I have been speaking only for a few minutes, yet already the Minister is talking about stone-walling. That shows how completely unreasonable his outlook is, and merely strengthens my determination to protest. If the Minister is not prepared to permit me to move for the adjournment of the debate, I shall, at a later stage, move for the appointment of a select committee to examine this measure. I shall inform him now of the terms of the investigation that I have in mind. </para>

                        <para>- It is a very real reason. At least, I do give plain reasons for my attitude. The Minister has not given even a hint of the reason why he proposes to gag this bill through the Senate in less than a day. I notice that although he is always very voluble whilst I am on my feet, when honorable senators on this side of the chamber are seeking information, he is completely inarticulate. Now that we have a clear understanding of the attitude of the Opposition and I have answered the question that the Minister asked me earlier in my speech, I come to the bill, and I remind honorable senators opposite that there is ample time in which I may deal with the measure at this stage. </para>

                </continue><para>The main purpose of the bill is to abolish the Maritime Industry Commission which, as I mentioned earlier, was established under the National Security Regulations in 1942. There was a real reason for the establishment of the commission. We were at war, and the maritime industry had to play a very large and very important part in the furtherance of that Avar. The Government did not have to rely entirely upon its defence power to establish thecommission. TheCommonwealth has full  power over overseas trade, interstate trade - subject to the provisions of section 92 of the Constitution - and maritime activities between the territories of the Commonwealth. Therefore there were those three heads of power on which the Government could draw to set up the Maritime Industry Commission. The one great activity not covered by those three heads was intra-state shipping. ' Almost plenary power was invested in the commission. It consisted originally of nine members. Later, in 1948, it grew to ten members. I understand that as the result of a recent High Court judgment, there are real doubts about the validity of the totality of powers exercised by the commission at present. </para><para>I come now to the individual provisions of the bill. Scattered throughout the measure there are numerous amending clauses. In the limited time that I have had to study this measure, I have endeavoured to examine the effect of those clauses on the act. They deal with such important matters as definitions - important definitions - and their effect will be threaded through the whole of the Navigation Act, which consists of 420 sections. I certainly have not had time to trace the effect of the proposed alterations right through the act, and I am prepared to say that no other honorable senator has had time to do so. The machinery clauses, too, deal with very important matters. The calculation of wages, the payment of crews after wreck or loss of ship, the allotment of pay, the engagement of aliens in the service, the recruitment of minors, the extension of the term of the agreement of service from six months to twelve months, the care of seaman left on shore when sick or injured, :we all vastly important matters affecting employees in the industry. Although T have endeavoured to trace the effects of the proposed alterations of the principal act and although I believe that many of the alterations will be beneficial, I am not in a. position to give unqualified approval to them. The main purpose of the bill, of course, is to abolish the Maritime Industry Commission. </para><interjection>

                        <para>- I am not at the moment disputing the justification for that proposal. I am merely stating what the bill will do. I agree that the Chifley Labour Government did very much the same thing with the Australian Stevedoring Industry Commission, but it did that for the very clear and specific reason - a reason that it had the courage to announce - that the representatives of the employees on the commission included Communists who were sabotaging the work of the commission. We have heard no such explanation from the Minister for Shipping and Transport of the Government's decision to abolish the Maritime Industry Commission. The Minister has merely said that there has been a great number of stoppages on the waterfront, and I am sure that the implication that that is attributable to the Maritime Industry Commission will be strongly resented by that body. The principle of investing this industrial power in a single judge is not opposed by me personally or by my party. I could quote some instances in which Labour governments have done something similar. Analogies may be found in the Coal Industry Tribunal and in the industrial authority in the Australian Capital Territory. Therefore, there is no conflict between the Minister and me on that point. I notice that the most specific power is to be conferred on the single judge of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court apart from the arbitral power. Sub-section 2 of proposed new section 405rÂ» states -  (2.) The Court has power to hoar and determine industrial matters submitted to it in so far as those matters relate to trade and commerce with other countries or among the States or in a Territory of the Commonwealth, whether or not an industrial dispute exists in relation to those matters. </para>

                </continue><para>In other words this bill proposes to confer upon the new tribunal, which is to consist of a single judge, as plenary a power as the Commonwealth could confer. To that there is no objection. I record the fact that, in appointing a  judge, the bill specifically ousts, apart from appeals jurisdiction, the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court and the power of the conciliation commissioners. The bill further specifically confers upon a single judge the power of the court and of the conciliation commissioners. </para><interjection>

                        <para>- Yes, but I point out that the bill does not contain a. provision similar to the provision in the Stevedoring Industry Act that the judge shall have regard to the decisions of the Full Court in relation to standard hours and the basic wage. I ask the Minister in charge of the bill to indicate why such a provision was omitted from this measure. Is there a reason for its omission? Was it omitted because the Minister wishes the judge to be completely free of decisions on these major matters made by the Full Court of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court? </para>
                    </talk.start>
                </continue><para>The Opposition opposes two aspects of this tribunal. In the first place the penalty clauses to which the Labour party objected when they were embodied in an amendment of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act have been expressly incorporated in the powers of the judge. Insofar as the Labour party opposed the incorporation of those provisions in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, it records its opposition to their perpetuation in this measure. The provisions in this measure which relate to appeals from the decision of the judge are very similar to those which were written into the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. For the reasons that we advanced when that act was amended to incorporate those provisions we oppose the inclusion of similar provisions in this measure. The bill provides for appeals of three kinds. First, on application by a party the judge, with the concurrence of the Chief Judge, may refer a matter to the Full Court. Secondly, after a matter has been determined by the judge, again upon the application of a party, the Chief Judge may grant leave to appeal to the Full Court. Thirdly, the judge may, at any stage, refer questions of law to the Full Court. The judge is not bound to await a decision, but in due course he must follow it by amending, if necessary, such awards as he has made. I do not propose to detain the Senate by restating all the reasons for our objection to these penalty and appeal provisions. Any honorable senator who is interested to ascertain them may do so by a perusal of recent debates on this subject. I merely record the fact that we oppose them and that we shall vote against them. </para><para>I come now to the very important matter of crew accommodation in ships. At present the minimum requirements to be observed in the housing of seamen in vessels are laid down in the principal act. In this bill it is proposed that the Governor-General may make regulations prescribing minimum requirements and standards of accommodation. The Opposition also objects to that proposal. We believe that minimum standards should bc prescribed by legislation and not left to control by regulations issued by a Minister, who may or may not be properly advised and who may or may not have a proper understanding of the very important issues involved, and whose decisions may cause no end of industrial turmoil in this rather difficult and turbulent industry. The Minister, in his second-reading speech, indicated that the bill would provide for the appointment of a crew accommodation committee on which shipowners and unions directly concerned will be represented, and that the committee will be assisted by the expert advice of governmental shipping and shipbuilding officers. He has said tha.t the decisions of the committee on accommodation problems will be final. Let me relate those, statements to the provisions contained in the bill. An examination of the measure reveals that no obligation rests upon the Minister to appoint such a committee. Proposed new section 138 reads as follows : - (1.) The Minister may, for the purposes of this Division, appoint a committee to bo known as the Crew Accommodation Committee. </para><para>Thus, the Minister may please himself whether he appoints such a body. The appointment of the committee should be made obligatory in accordance with the terms of the Minister's second-reading speech. Again, the bill contains no provision that the committee shall <inline font-style="italic">he</inline> representative of the various interests in the industry. That proposal also should be embodied in the measure. If the Minister has correctly interpreted the mind of the Government, let the appointment of this body be made mandatory, and let the Minister be bound to appoint to it representatives of the various sectors of the industry. If the committee is appointed accommodation problems can be thrashed out while ships are in course of construction and before industrial troubles reach the dispute stage. </para><para>Examination of the industrial pro- visions of the measure reveals that an industrial dispute relating to accommodation may be referred to the judge. Proposed new section 405q reads as follows : - </para><quote>
                    <para>An order or award under this Part does not have effect to the extent (if any) to which it is inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth other than Division 15 of Part II. of this act. </para>
                </quote><para class="block">In other words, an award must observe Commonwealth law except in respect of accommodation. Once an industrial dispute occurs an award of the industrial tribunal will completely override the provisions of this legislation. Why does the Minister need power to prescribe by regulation very important matters relating to accommodation and standards which may be altered from time to time? Why shouldnot clear minimums be prescribed as asafeguard to everybody concerned in the industry? In inserting this provision did the Minister have in mind the saleof the Commonwealth ships? It is in the mind of Opposition senators that the Minister is merely clearing the way to make it easier for the Governmentto find buyers for the Commonwealth shipping line, which it is obviously committed to sell. Will the Minister indicate whether there is any justification for our Suspicion on that matter? </para><interjection>

                        <para>- I should not be so concerned if I believed that the ultimate discretion would be completely exercised by the master of the vessel. I am not so unreasonable as to refuse to concede that it is very necessary to avoid pin-pricking tactics from being employed to prevent a ship from leaving because of a shortage of one or two members of its complement. Although I agree that something should be done about that aspect of the matter, I submit that the main consideration of the Parliament in this connexion should be the safe transport of people by sea. There is no specified percentage in relation to officers-, but a ship is to be permitted to go to sea with only four-fifths of its prescribed minimum complement of various categories of crew, which are defined. Again, this provision will be all right as long as the master is not influenced in his decision on whether he will or will not take advantage of the authority that is proffered to him. </para>

The High Court held thatimportant matters such as annual leave, compensation, and intervals of duty were matters that should be determined by a conciliation commissioner, but that a conciliation commissioner should not deal with the subject of pensions for seamen. I understand that the hearing has been almost concluded, and that about 90 per cent, of the claims have been disposed of.

Foi- the sake of this very important measure, and the future relationships between the Government and the Opposition in this chamber, I appeal to the Minister to reconsider the answers that he has given to me to-day, namely, that there may not be an adjournment, and secondly, that a select committee will not be appointed. If he considers that a period of fourteen days for a select committee to function would be too long, and suggests a period of seven days, I shall agree to the shorter period. I have made two proposals to the Government. The first was that the bill should be set aside for fourteen days and then considered in the light of a report by a select committee; the second was that the bill should be stood down for seven days to enable its various aspects to be fully considered by a select committee. If the Government's acceptance of either proposition is not forthcoming I can only conclude that the Government is ruthlessly determined to gag this measure through, for some reason which it has not had the good grace to disclose. </para><interjection>

On behalf of the Opposition I inform the Minister that if neither proposition is acceptable to the Government the Opposition will be left with no choice but to record, an emphatic protest against the bill by voting against the second reading of the measure, despite, the fact that there are many features of it that we support. </para>

                    <para>. - The speeches of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline> frequently contain constructive criticism. Apparently, however, that is not a characteristic of speeches that he delivers on Wednesdays, when the proceedings of this chamber are broadcast.  His  submissions then usually lose much of their effectiveness, because of the propaganda in which he engages. The Leader of the Opposition devoted more than half of his speech to a criticism of matters other than the provisions of the bill. Much of his remaining time was devoted to commenting on provisions which apparently give mutual satisfaction to all. The Leader of the Opposition has complained that he has not received answers to his questions. As the Minister for Shipping and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> has supplied answers <inline font-style="italic">ex tempore</inline> to many of the questions that he has raised - ;i practice that is not often followed in this chamber - I believe that the complaint of the Leader of the Opposition has arisen not from the non-supply of answers but because he was dissatisfied with the decisions that have been announced by the Minister. I consider that the Minister's answers have merited the full support of the Senate. </para>

                <para>The main purpose for which the bill has been introduced is to amend the Navigation Act 191.2-1950, by providing for the replacement of the Maritime Industry Commission. The Leader of the Opposition has commented about the length of the principal act.  The  bill before the Senate deals only with some aspects of the matters that are contained in the existing legislation. I consider that the navigation legislation should be completely overhauled, and that a full discussion of all details associated with it by the legal members of this chamber would be beneficial to all honorable senators. I shall direct myself to weaknesses of the administration of the Maritime Industry Commission. The commission consists of ten members who were appointed, according to Statutory Rule 68_, for the maintenance of discipline on ships and in the maritime industry. For various reasons, the commission has never been entirely successful. In my opinion, the main reason for its lack of success is due to the fact that the Curtin Government, which established it, failed to support its decisions. It soon lost the services of its first  chairman,  who resigned because the Government was not prepared to back decisions which the commission had made. In my opinion, nothing but good can come of the proposed replacement of the commission by a single judge of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. I was glad to hoar the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline> agree that such a step is necessary. </para>
                <para>The Maritime Industry Commission was really a product of that arch-socialist, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dedman.</inline> He is one of those dreamyeyed socialists who have a great capacity to mesmerize themselves. Only a person with the ability to mesmerize himself could have high hopes of a commission to which had been appointed such a well-known militant Communist as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> V. Elliott, who is the  president  of the Seamen's Union of Australasia. It should not be overlooked that the Australian Labour party has never been able to legislate unless it first compromised with, militant Communists. I suggest that one. of those compromises was the appointment of a commission to administer discipline in the maritime industry, and the appointment of a militant Communist leader to the commission. Naturally, no discipline was administered. Frequent instances of petty disputes being fostered by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Elliott,</inline> on the most trivial excuses, have occurred. There have been many hold-ups and delays of shipping. To illustrate that statement it is only necessary to point out that 74 Commonwealthowned ships and 287 privately owned ships engaged in interstate trade have been held up during the last two years, with the appalling loss of 4,237 shipping days. Can it be wondered at that freight rates have risen by more than 400 per cent. ? This lack of proper discipline is just one of the factors which have contributed to a vast increase of freight rates in Australia. We in Tasmania have suffered most ' severely from these increased rates, because Tasmania is a maritime State. We find that this large increase is particularly detrimental to us. The actions of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Elliott</inline> have been largely responsible for that increase. Therefore, I commend the Minister for Shipping and Transport and the Government for seeking to replace this commission by a judge of the court. </para>
                <para>It is a pity that it is almost invariably necessary to resort to arbitration in industrial disputes. In my opinion, arbitration should be the last resort. I am strengthened in that belief by the reported views of a great English trade unionist. I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Arthur</inline> Deakin, who is general secretary of the Transport and General Workers' Union of Great Britain, the largest union in' the world, with a membership of approximately 1,300,000. </para>

                    <para>The bill preserves the orders of the MaritimeIndustry Commission. Under these orders, a disciplinary code for seamen has been developed by which seamen are excluded from employment if they receive three bad discharges or are guilty of particularly serious misconduct, failure to join ship or desertion being included as a bad discharge. Seamen are also required to serve a minimum period at sea each six months, upon penalty of exclusion  from  the industry.

                <para class="block">Industry Commission and to place it under the control of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. The original purpose in establishing the commission was to provide a body to maintain discipline oh ships and throughout the industry. Although the commission has endeavoured to achieve its purpose, I think that it has failed to do so. The court, which is clothed with certain " penal powers " - to borrow a phrase from members of the Opposition^ - will be much better equipped to administer the industry than is the Maritime Industry Com mission. </para>

The decision of the wartime Labour Administration to establish a commission of ten members, amongst whom were included <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.- E.</inline> V. Elliott, the Communist leader of the Seamen's Union, was obviously unsound.

In fact, I think that we are' fortunate that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLeay</inline> occupies the portfolio o'f Shipping and Transport because', during the comparatively short time he has held it, he has  so'  administered the Commonwealth' shipping Hae' tha't,- from having . been a big financial liability, .it is' now  beginning to show a small profit. The reason that he has made such a success of his administration of the portfolio is that he makes clear-cut decisions and adheres to them. Furthermore, the Minister brings to bear in his administration considerable practical business experience. </para>
                <para>Although the bill represents merely one instalment of the Government's plan to overhaul the Navigation Act, its passage will remove one of the principal causes of discontent in the industry. The proposal to establish an accommodation committee is most commendable. There have been far too many hold-ups on the waterfront because of petty pretexts such as the position of a door in a crew's quarters or the fact that a seaman's bunk happened to be 2 inches short of the prescribed length. Such hold-ups, which have cost the community many thousands of pounds, have occurred, notwithstanding the fact that the accommodation for ship crews is examined and approved of by representatives of the Seamen's Union when ships are being fitted out. The proposed committee will include representatives of ship-owners and seamen and will have available the advice of experts. This proposal represents a practical approach - one might say a typical McLeay approach- </para>

                        <para>- When the Labour party was in office it always had to run to the Communist-controlled Seamen's Union before it took any action to alter conditions in the industry. It was not game to introduce any legislation unless it first consulted the Communistcontrolled unions. In fact, members of the Opposition to-day still maintain the same attitude towards the militant Seamen's Union. I noticed that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline> in the course of his speech complained that .the Government had not consulted the Communist-led unions before it introduced this legislation. The fact is that the present Government does not do things that way. It feels that it has a duty to remedy the unsatisfactory state of affairs that prevails in the Australian maritime industry, and this bill represents an important step in that direction. </para>

                <para>In supporting the bill, I commend the Government for its enlightened attempt to remove from the maritime industry some of its greatest defects. Amongst them is the painfully slow turn-round , of ships, which has caused such a great increase in freight charges, and has been responsible in such a large measure for the increased cost of commodities. When this bill becomes law the implementation of its provisions will benefit the community as a whole, and that is something which this Government always aims to do. I look forward to the introduction of further legislation to complete the Government's aim to improve the efficiency and the smooth operation of the maritime industry. Finally, I emphasize that when the political parties in power to-day decide to introduce some reform they do not consult the Communists, and that is' something which I am sure the electors of Flinders will bear in mind at the by-election to be held in that constituency on the 18th October. </para>

                        <para>. -  I join the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline> in uttering a most emphatic protest against the manner in which the Government is endeavouring to force this bill through the Senate. The Navigation Act, which this bill proposes so drastically to amend, was drafted following inquiries and research by a royal commission, whose recommendations, and expert comment thereon, were exhaustively considered by both Houses of the legislature. In fact, a period of many years elapsed before the original proposals for a navigation bill became law. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                </continue>
                <para>Notwithstanding the complexity and importance of the matters with which that' act deals, the Minister for Shipping and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> informed us yesterday that he was determined to have this bill, which includes so many radical changes in the present legislation, passed through the Senate to-day. I trust that there are still some supporters of the Government who are sufficiently fair-minded to realize that it is utterly impossible to discuss adequately a comprehensive measure of this nature in the few hours allowed to us. The bill was introduced only yesterday, and in fairness to the Government's own supporters, quite apart from members of the Opposition, the Minister should allow debate on the bill to continue until next week. This measure proposes, in one stroke, to delete whole sections of the Navigation Act, notwithstanding that it has required many years of experience and consideration to evolve the comprehensive code set out in the act in its present form. Before we throw that act overboard we ought to satisfy ourselves that we have had the best advice. In any event, the Navigation Act deals with matters of such vital importance that we cannot afford to indulge in any hasty or ill-considered amendments. This bill contains 21 pages of print and is composed of 38 clauses, many of which are quite revolutionary. </para>

Furthermore, I remind honorable senators that the control of the maritime industry is a matter of grave seriousness to the thousands of Australians who take their lives in their hands in our coastal ships. Before we interfere with the safety margins that have been laid down by the experts over the years and before we interfere with those standards that have stood the test of time we should be very sure that the changes we propose are for the better. I challenge the Minister and Government supporters to say that, having received the bill into this Senate a few brief hours ago, if they dispose of it to-night they will walk out of this chamber sure that they have acted wisely. </para>

                        <para>- I bow to your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President.</inline> But I know that you will allow me once again to make an emphatic protest against the manner in which this bill has been presented to us. This industry has been in a depressed state for a long number of years. At the turn of the century this Parliament decided that those who work in the industry and those who place their capital in it should be provided with a code to ensure the safety of the ships and the people who worked in them. In those days poor accommodation and food was provided for those who worked in the shipping industry. Their conditions were dangerous. The Commonwealth Parliament decided to pass a navigation act. It was decided that the conditions which men had to endure on ships should not be allowed to continue on the Australian coast. Part of the act was devoted to the subject of how those who worked in ships on the Australian coast should be accommodated. It laid down minimum standards for them. It had been common for fifteen or twenty seamen to be accommodated in hammocks slung up in the forecastle of the ship where they had to live out their lives in all weathers. The parliamentarians of 40 years ago, who had some feeling for their fellow men, laid down standards to be observed in providing accommodation for the crews of vessels. They stipulated the number of cubic feet of space each man should have and set out in detail the minimum conditions to which seamen were entitled. The act provided  that the Minister should consult the marine council before any changes or regulations weremade. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                </continue><para>The Government could have referred this bill to a committee of experts monthsago. But without obtaining any expert advice the Minister has submitted to the Senate a bill which would have the effect of deleting the whole of the provisions of the act which relate to accommodation  in  ships. These provisions have stood the test of time and raised the standards of Australian seamen higher than those of seamen in any other part of the world. Yet the Minister has proposed, that in a few hours, a bill shall be forced through the Senate for the purpose of withdrawing these conditions. He has said, in effect,. " In my wisdom, I shall make regulationswhich will provide for these conditions He has not even stated the provision, that will be contained in the regulations. Hehas not even done the Senate the courtesy of stating that he proposes to- make- regulations which will give effect to the- provisions of the existing legislation.. Hehas simply stated that he will prescribethe accommodation to be provided ii* the future. If the Minister considers that the requirements as laid down in the act 40 years ago were not sufficient he should improve them by incorporating new requirements in the act. He should not take away the protection which the act. provides for seamen.  He should not put them in the position of Italian and other seamen who still suffer the conditions which existed on the Australian coast 50 years ago. When certain ships arebrought to Australia from overseas it costs thousands of pounds to alter theaccommodation for the crews in order to make it conform to the standard required for Australian seamen. Does the Minister intend, when a. ship with pooraccommodation is brought to Australia infuture, to make regulations that the accommodation in it is good enough for Australian seamen? If that is not his intention why has he not said so? Whyhas he proposed the deletion of thissection without informing the Opposition or his supporters of the provisions to be contained in the regulations that are to be made? </para><para>The bill is silent on the committee which will consider the subject of accommodation. The Minister said that the seamen would be represented on the committee. Why has he not provided in the bill for them to have. that representation ? Any new measure should improve the provisions of the Navigation Act and mot take away from seamen the conditions that have been established. The measure proposes that, in certain circumstances, ships may go to sea with four-fifths of their minimum crew. On this matter, the Minister has not been specific. Again he proposes to deal with this matter by regulation. Those who framed the Navigation Act laid down, after due consideration, the minimum number of seamen who could safely operate a ship on the coast of Australia. Of course that minimum became the maximum. However, it is the minimum that can safely operate our ships. Now, this measure proposes, in effect, that if it has been stipulated that 50 men are required to man a ship, and somebody is delaying its departure it shall be permitted to go to sea with 40 men instead of 50. What will happen when a ship goes to sea with only four-fifths of the complement that is regarded as necessary for safety ? Will the Minister accept responsibility for the safety of that vessel should a storm or some other sudden emergency arise? <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Henty said that the purpose was to provide for the disciplining of seamen. I suggest that the price that may have to be paid for the disciplining of seamen may be too great. Surely some other way could be found to discipline seamen.</inline></para><interjection>

                        <para>- I hope that the Government will continue to try to find some other means. The maritime industry has been a depressed industry. It "has been unattractive as an avenue of employment. It has had nothing to offer to ambitious men. A man who goes to sea as a seaman has little to look forward to. He has to sacrifice his family life. He is condemned to a life of continual travel round the coast of Australia. I believe that an attempt should be made to make the maritime industry attractive. For instance, permanent employment should be offered, and seamen should be encouraged to seek promotion. They should be given opportunities to study and to progress in the service. Perhaps a superannuation scheme could be devised. The problems of the maritime industry could, I believe, be tackled by some means other than coercion. This bill merely means that the influence of the Communists upon the maritime industry today is to be countered by totalitarian methods. The seamen will be caught between the two forces. Again I say that the limited time that has been available to honorable senators to study this, measure has not been adequate for a thorough examination of it. Any points honorable senators on this side of the chamber may raise to-night are the result of a quick perusal of the bill. Had we been permitted sufficient time to examine the bill thoroughly, we might have been able to assist the Government to improve it in many ways. The Minister has done a great wrong to the Senate by insisting upon the rapid passage of this legislation. Having voiced my protest, I ask the Minister in all seriousness to see whether it, is possible to raise employment standards in the maritime industry, and to encourage seamen in- such a way as will cause them to want to take our ships to sea. </para>

                    <para>. - I congratulate the Government upon the introduction of this very necessary measure. The Minister for Shipping and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> has foreshadowed further amendments of the Navigation Act in the next session of the Parliament, and he has been good enough to ask me to submit my ideas for consideration. I looked forward to this debate because I believed that it would be an entirely non-party discussion. We are dealing with a matter of great national importance, and I regret very much the reasons given by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline> for opposing the bill. Honorable senators opposite have decided to' oppose the measure merely because they have not been able to get their own way in certain directions. However, I have no doubt that the Minister will deal with that matter when he replies to the second-reading debate. Had  the Opposition decided to oppose the bill on definite grounds, I should have been able to understand its attitude. </para>

As one who has spent 35 years at sea, I believe it to be' my duty to endeavour to explain some of the provisions of this bill to honorable senators opposite because obviously they do not know very much about it. I believe that if I can do that with any degree of success, I shall be contributing something towards an improvement of the standard of debating in this chamber. My explanation may be a little tedious. I shall not go through the bill clause by clause because my time is limited, but I shall deal with the clauses that I consider to be most important. Legal matters I shall leave to my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> who, I understand, will address the Senate at a later hour. </para>

                <para>Some honorable senators may not understand why certain changes have been made in definitions. For instance, clause 4 provides for the omission from the definition of " Australian-trade ship ' the words " the islands on the Pacific " and  the  insertion, in their stead of the words " the islands of the Pacific Ocean south of the equator and west of the one hundred and eightieth meridian of longitude". The reason for that alteration is quite obvious to me though not perhaps to other members of the Senate. As the definition is worded at present, an Australiantrade ship can trade to any of the islands of the Pacific. There are, of course, many islands of the Pacific north of the Equator. They include Japan, Hawaii and the Aleutians. It is quite possible for an Australian-trade ship, therefore, to go as far .north as the Aleutians. This measure will stop that by substituting for the words " the islands of the Pacific " the words " the islands of the Pacific Ocean south of the Equator and west of the one hundred and eightieth meridian of longitude ". That altera tion will prevent conflict between hometrade ships and foreign-going ships. The definition of " Limited coast-trade ship " is being altered to avoid conflict between Commonwealth and State laws. There is nothing very much in either of those definitions. </para>
                <para>The new definition of " desertion " is worthy of note. In short, it means that if a seaman is absent from his ship for 48 hours without leave or reasonable excuse, he may be deemed to be a deserter, and the master of the ship may engage a man to replace him. This alteration will obviate the necessity for the master to wait until just before a vessel is due to sail before trying to engage a new man, which perhaps would delay departure for a day or two. The new definition will be of considerable assistance to masters of ships. Paragraph (Z&gt;) of proposed new section 14 (1.) provides that the master of a ship registered in Australia or engaged in the coasting trade shall not take the ship to sea unless the ship carries the prescribed complement of officers for that ship. That paragraph differs from the provision in the principal act in that it gives a direct order. In the principal act the word used is " may " and not " shall ". That is a small but important change. The Leader of the Opposition referred to the provision which permits a ship to go to sea with less than its prescribed complement of officers. I point out that the average ship on the Australian coast carries one, two or even three officers more than the complement prescribed.- In other words, ships on the Australian coast generally carry more officers than are necessary for safety and efficiency. There are many reasons for that. There is much more work to be done in port than at sea where it is mere watch-keeping. Under the British Merchant Shipping Act, <inline font-style="italic">Queen Mary,</inline> one of the largest ships in the world, can go to sea with only a master, a mate and second mate and the latter two need have only a mate's ticket and a second mate's ticket respectively. Of course, that is never done. <inline font-style="italic">Queen Mary</inline> generally carries nine officers. </para>

                        <para>- Because there is plenty of work for them to do. Ships of less than 1,000 tons operating on the Australian coast need carry only one officer. Ships of over that tonnage have to carry two officers, but there is hardly a ship on the Australian coast of more than 1,000 tons that carries less than three or four officers. Consequently, if an officer becomes ill and has to be taken to hospital at an outport, the ship need not be delayed. It can sail with one officer short provided it will not be at sea for more than nine days. The absence of one officer makes no difference to safe navigation. Ships are often one officer short. In fact, I know from my own experience that junior officers are often very keen to collect a little extra pay for a short run. The pay of an officer who has been taken off a ship is divided amongst the remaining officers. However, the important point is that the absence of an officer makes no difference to the safe navigation of the ship and involves only a few hours' extra work for the remaining officers. Sub-section 9 of proposed new section 14 states - (!). ) Where the number of duly certificated officers included in the prescribed complement nf  officers  for a shi]) has not been obtained, the Deputy Director shall not approve, and the superintendent shall not authorize, the taking to sea of a ship unless he is satisfied that the officers to be carried on the ship are able to perform all the duties to be performed by the duly certificated officers included in the" prescribed complement of officers for that ship. </para>

                <para class="block">No deputy director or superintendent that I have ever known has failed to discharge his responsibility not only to the Government but also to his cloth by sending a ship out inadequately manned. I very much approve of the word " shall " in that provision, although in the next sub-section the word " may " is' preferable. It states that the master " may " take the ship to sea if the superintendent agrees. There is no obligation on him to sail. The onus is placed on the master. I am satisfied as the result of my own experience in the cloth that no master would take his vessel to sea if he were in doubt about its safety. </para>

                <para>The bill also seeks to amend the provisions of the principal act which relate to the complement of snips' officers and crew. In certain circumstances, a ship will be allowed to sail with one-fifth of its complement short. A provision of that kind, has existed in the principal act for many , years. The amendment proposed by this measure is designed to improve slightly the wording of the provision in order to express more clearly its intention. The average ship engaged on the Australian coast carries a good many more crew members than are necessary for its safe navigation at sea. Additional crew has to be carried to meet the additional work that arises when the ship enters port. In order to navigate a ship, say, from Brisbane to Sydney, only three quartermasters' and a couple of look-outs are needed; but when the ship arrives in port a great many more men are needed to handle the work in port. Over the years the provision in the principal act that a ship may sail with one-fifth of its complement short has always been accepted. </para>

                        <para>- I did not say that, nor does the bill contemplate that such a practice shall be followed. All that is proposed is that, in an emergency, and in special circumstances in order to circumvent the tactics adopted by certain unions, a ship may be allowed to sail with a complement two men short of requirements. Honorable senators are well aware that frequently a couple of men in a crew deliberately absent themselves from their ship and that no other seamen in the port will stand up in the pick-up and offer to make up the required number. Under the provisions of this bill a master will be able to take his ship to sea without having to make up the full complement of crew and, by so doing save some of the ship days lost through hold-ups of that kind. The Minister has told us that in the last two years, no fewer than 4,237 ship days were lost through one cause or another. Hold-ups caused by the failure of crew members to report for' duty are an important ingredient of the problem of the slow turn-round of ships. . I assure honor : able senators that 90 per cent, of the seamen employed in the Australian coastal .shipping trade do not want these stoppages to occur. The trouble is caused largely by a handful of persons in the industry. During the seamen's strike in 1933, I discussed this problem with the crew of my ship. They said, " "We do not .want to go on strike, but if we do so we shall be forced out of the industry and never get our jobs back again ". </para>

                <para>Proposed new section 14 (8.) prescribes that when the master of a ship has made all reasonable efforts to obtain the required crew for the vessel the superintendent at the port of departure of the ship may, in certain circumstances, authorize him to take the ship to sea. The purpose of the sub-section is to give to the master authority to command the ship's company to sail. The Government has wisely decided to give to a ship's master some authority to decide these matters. I have the greatest sympathy with those who command ships on the Australian coast at present. Indeed I am glad that I" came ashore when the war ended and that I have had nothing to do with the extraordinary system under which ships are run at present. I would not put up with it for one moment. </para>
                <para>The bill provides that superintendents shall refuse to approve the engagement of a seaman who has received three bad discharges during the preceding five years, or who is guilty of serious misconduct, or who fails to serve a minimum period of service during any six months. Those provisions are very fair. Every man who receives a bad discharge should be given a second chance and, in certain circumstances, even a third chance, but if seamen are guilty of repeated misdemeanours they should wake up to themselves and get a job in some more congenial industry. After they have settled down ashore for some time they may regret that they deserted the sea. </para>
                <para>Whilst I am dealing with this subject I inform the Minister that I have never at any time agreed to the system under which loose paper discharges are handed to seamen. Under present conditions, when a seaman is discharged before the shipping master he is given a loose piece of paper which constitutes his discharge. He may take it home and accidentally burn it or lose it. Under the British Merchant Shipping Act, a continuous record of discharges is kept in a book. It is possible to examine the book and run through the list of discharges shown on each page. I suggest that a similar practice be adopted in Australia. Proposed new section 45a (4.) reads as follows : - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>A .seaman who deserts a ship or, after signing ari agreement to serve in a ship, refuses or fails, without reasonable cause, to join that ship or to go to sea in that ship shall, for the purposes of this section, be deemed to be a seaman in respect of whom a master has, on the date of desertion, refusal or failure, delivered a report under section 07 of this act showing the conduct or character of that seaman as " bad ". </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">That is a very fair provision to which no objection can be taken. </para>
                <para>I was astonished to hear some honor-' able senators say that the provisions that relate to the Maritime Industry Commission are the most important provisions in the bill. I do not agree with them. I  believe that there are other far more important provisions in the measure. The Maritime Industry Commission was established under National Security Regulation during the war to deal by regulation with matters concerning the maritime industry. It was never intended that the commission should be a permanent body. The council, which it replaced, and which was provided for in the original legislation, was composed of representatives of the owners, engineers, masters and mates, seamen, firemen and stewards, and all the employees that go to make up a ship's company. The reason for the establishment of the Maritime Industry Commission no longer exists and the Government in this bill merely proposes to revert to the normal peace-time council as provided for in the principal act. The Maritime Industry- Commission did a splendid job during the war. At one time I was worried lest trouble makers in the industry, who had been shut out of it as  the result of a regulation promulgated by the commission, would be allowed to return to it. I am glad that provision has been made in the, bill to ensure that those men will continue to be excluded from employment in the Australian coastal shipping trade. </para>
                <para>One amendment in the bill seeks the deletion from, the principal act of the provision relating to the employment in the industry of aliens. That provision, which has remained in the act since World War I., is now outdated and is to be removed. Many of the immigrants who are arriving in Australia will subsequently seek employment in the industry. Alien immigrants will eventually become naturalized and be permitted to enter the industry. Provision has also been made to enable seamen to make allotments of pay commencing after the end of one month's service if they are absent from Australia. A two months' period is prescribed in the principal act. That is a very long time for the wife of a seaman to have to wait for her allotment money. I welcome the new proposal. The bill also provides that wages and salaries due to seamen may be paid into a trading bank instead of, as at present, only into a savings bank. That provision will be of benefit to seamen who wish to operate on bank accounts other than savings bank accounts. </para>
                <para>Under the provisions of the bill, when the service of a seaman is terminated before the time contemplated in his agreement, by reason of the wreck or loss of the ship or, in war-time, the torpedoeing of a vessel, he will be entitled to wages for each day on which he is unemployed whilst returning to his home port, up to a period of two months. In the early days of World War I., after a merchant' ship had been torpedoed, no matter how long it took a seaman to get home, his pay was stopped on the day his ship was torpedoed because on that day its articles were closed. I recall that, in 1915, although a month elapsed before I was able to get back to my home port, I did not receive a penny in wages in respect of that period. The amendment proposed is a step in the right direction. The amendment proposed in clause 23 highlights the fallacy of the paper discharge to which I have already referred. </para>
                <para class="block">There should be a continuous record of the service of all seamen. </para>
                <para>The bill proposes to make a number of minor machinery alterations. Clause 27 makes provisions with relation to fines for breaches of discipline, &amp;c. The effect of the clause will be to place on the superintendent of a mercantile marine shipping office, rather than on the master of a ship, the onus for various things. In view of the many difficulties that have been encountered in connexion with shipping on the Australian coast during the last two or three years, which have added to- the duties and responsibilities of masters, I consider that this is a good clause. </para>
                <para>Clause 28 provides for the omission from paragraph (b) of sub-section. (1) of section 127 of the principal act the words " venereal disease, or ". I thing that that is a very desirable amendment because, after all a sailor is no better and noworse than other men, and a member of the crew is not worse than any other man because he has had the misfortune to contract that disease. </para>

If the construction of a new ship were under consideration, such a committee could supply valuable information about the accommodation that should be provided for the sailors, firemen, engineers and deck officers.

                        <para>- That is so. I consider that the appointment of the proposed committee will be a step in the right direction. The standard of accommodation that is now provided on merchant ships for the officers and crew is very good by comparison with the standards that obtained when I- was a boy. I consider that the standard of accommodation that is provided for them on vessels in Australian waters is first class. Despite the gradual improvement that has been made in this connexion, I remember that about eighteen months ago a ship was held up for about a week because the bos'n wanted a red carpet on the deck of his cabin. The average sailor is happy as long as he can get a good steady job at his home port, so that he will be able to see his family at regular intervals. </para>

I look forward with a. great de'al of interest to the introduction next year of another navigation measure, in which, I hope, effect will be given to some of the suggestions that I have made. I hope that the Minister will adopt my suggestion about continuous discharge books. I should like to see introduced a system for the payment of sailors by the  day instead of by the month, because- the present racket has been going on for as long as I can remember. It is most unsatisfactory to the men. I should like the Government to repeal at least a portion of the Shipping Act 1949, particularly section 3, which, in my opinion, places too much power in the hands of one man. Under that section, one man- may refuse to grant a licence for the construction of a ship; a licence for a ship to trade oh the coast; or a licence in respect of a ship which is more than 24 years old.

                <para>I shall now direct myself to the service of able-bodied seamen. <inline font-style="italic">A</inline> letter that I received recently from a friend of mine connected with the merchant service contained the following paragraph: - </para>
                <para>One nf the most frequent complaints received at the present time is about the general incompetency of seamen eni ployed on the Australian coast: on many ships not one of them can splice a wire, and they seem to regard the stop-watch as a much more important item of equipment than the knives and spikes that were carried by the old type of sailor. </para>
                <para class="block">Under the British Merchant Shipping Act, before a seaman may qualify for promotion to able-bodied seaman, he must serve for three years on different kinds of ships and pass examinations that are prescribed in the schedule to the act. When I was younger it was taken for granted that a seaman would be required to serve for a reasonable period and pass an examination before he could be rated as an able-bodied seaman. I urge the Minister to consider seriously the introduction of an examination for seamen who are serving on the Australian coast, many of whom are not qualified to be elevated to the rank of able-bodied seaman. </para>
                <para>A considerable proportion of the trouble that has existed on the Australian waterfront has been attributable to the practice of men who have gone to the pick-up sheds and refused to answer the call. As honorable senators are aware, the practice that has been followed for the picking up of a crew has been for the chief officer, or the second engineer of a ship to go to the pick-up shed, which  i3  usually near the shipping office, and to announce that he wants so many men for such and such a ship. The seamen have adopted signals to indicate, to one another that a ship has been declared black. It has frequently happened that following the giving of such a signal, the men have refused to sign on. Following such a refusal the men may return to the pick-up shed on a dozen occasions. I consider that a provision should be inserted in the legislation to provide that a man who has not answered the call for a pick-up' on three occasions should be suspended for twelve months, and that if he again refused to answer the call after that period he should be excluded from the industry. I congratulate the Minister on the splendid start that he has made to overhaul the navigation legislation, and I support the bill. </para>

                        <para>- That was virtually the whole of the bill. This is a terrifically complex measure, which has been designed to change the fundamentals of the law in many respects. It should bo closely scrutinized. It is not possible at this late stage of the sessional period for honorable senators to discharge adequately their responsibilities to the people in connexion with the proposed legislation. The Government's action is most unfair not only to the people outside but to honorable senators who sincerely wish to carry out their duties efficiently. Prior to the suspension of the sitting, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henty</inline> stated that the bill did not contain many amendments. However, I point out that the Navigation Act contains 425 sections, and that the measure before the chamber proposes to amend 26 of those sections. Whole new divisions are to be inserted; at least three new substantial sections are proposed, and the bill provides for a number of substitutions. Honorable senators should have ample opportunity to study the effect of the proposed amendments of the principal act, in order to ascertain whether existing provisions are to be deleted <inline font-style="italic">in toto,</inline> or merely varied. That opportunity has been denied to them. The Government's action is grossly unfair to the many interests that will be affected by the legislation. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kendall</inline>
                    also referred to that matter. Of what use is it for the Government to bring down an amending measure precipitately, when a completely new code is in active contemplation? The navigation legislation affects the lives of all people who go down to the f983 sea in ships, and seaborne commerce. It is based on common law, admiralty law, and old maritime practices. It is not possible to alter one part of it without affecting the remainder. The Minister stated in his second-reading speech that the proposed provisions would streamline the industrial machinery in the ' shipping industry. Again, that is an integral part of the code, which has a distinct relationship to the prosperity of the nation. I urge the Government to adopt the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition to set aside the bill until a report has been received from a select committee. The shipping industry is most important to Australia. We have inherited a seagoing tradition from our forebears. Geographically, our position is similar to the position of the Mother Country. Much of our prosperity depends on sea-borne traffic. That is why we on this side of the chamber are as solicitous as is any other section of the community for the efficient operation of the shipping industry.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henty</inline>
                    was guilty ,of gross misrepresentation when he alleged that the Leader of the Opposition had confined his remarks on the bill to the welfare of the maritime unions, which, the honorable senator stated, are Communist-controlled. The Leader of the Opposition did nothing of the kind. In his speech he recognized all the interests which are affected by the Navigation Act and which, necessarily, are affected by any amendments of that act. The interests which will be affected by the bill now before the Senate are many and varied, and all are important. For instance, there are the rights of the Australian people to a sound economy which, in this instance, depends on the import and export of goods. Such trade can, and is in the main, carried by sea, although a small contribution can be made by airborne craft. Secondly, there are the rights of those employed in the industry, on whose work and energy the success of the shipping trade depends in large measure. Thirdly, there are' the rights of the men who own the ships and who build and pay for them. Fourthly, there are the rights of those who charter ships. Fifthly, there are the rights of the people who are merely passengers in ships. All these rights will be affected by amendments of the Navigation Act. The Leader of the Opposition contemplated all such rights and expressly referred to them, although
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henty</inline>
                    has chosen to brush aside such references.
                </para>
                <para>The Navigation Act cannot be amended  in  a particular way without the amendment affecting not only the rights of Australian people but also those of other countries of the world. The Navigation Act deals with such matters as salvage, collisions at sea, and the apportionment of damage. If any part of the act is disturbed in relation to Australian shipping, the rights of persons in remote corners of the world may also be affected. If the safety provisions are disturbed.it may happen that a ship which is sent to sea in an unseaworthy condition will collide with a ship coming from Venezuela and, because of the amendment, the rights of the Venezuelan seamen may be trampled upon. That is why it is essential to approach such amendments on a wide basis. It is necessary to safeguard the universal rights of all those who use the sea. The Opposition considers' that the matter is of vital importance and cannot possibly receive the consideration that it merits and demands in the short time at our disposal. </para>
                <para>The Navigation Act is a code consisting of 425 provisions. This bill purports to establish new jurisdictions to deal with the rights of employees, including their right to work, which is one of the fundamental rights of all people. The bill purports to deal with that right in such an important manner that it requires our closest scrutiny. Yet we are not to be permitted to so scrutinize the measure. I should like to know who was consulted by the Government in the preparation of this amending legislation. Did it consult the Maritime Industry Commission which, by reason of the wide experience of its members, would have been worth consulting and which, in its industrial jurisdiction, has had ten years of solid experience which could have been called upon? I point out that the personnel of the commission include men who represent intrastate trade, shipowners, the Merchant Service Guild, marine engineers, cooks, stewards and seamen, and interstate shipowners. The com- billed experience of the members of the commission represents a wealth of know- ' ledge upon which the Government could have called. Has the Government been guided in this matter by the moon or the stars, or has it set its course by dead reckoning ? lt seems as though the latter method has been adopted, and that it does not altogether know where it is going. </para>
                <para>In the rather short time at my disposal 1 wish to deal particularly with the rights of those employed in the shipping industry. The disciplinary code which is set out in the bill is apparently a reenactment of the existing disciplinary code contained in the orders of the Maritime Industry Commission, although I have not had an opportunity, because of lack of time, to check this matter. Because it is a re-enactment, the Government suggests that the code must be satisfactory. I point out, however, that this bill does not envisage the mere gathering together of provisions from the principal act, or the mere taking over of a code already in existence. Disciplinary matters are to be placed in a different jurisdiction. Whilst the disciplinary code established by the Maritime Industry Commission may be acceptable in the circumstances under which the commission operates, it may need to be completely re-oriented when such matters come within the jurisdiction of one individual, such as a superintendent, as this bill proposes. The mere fact that the Government proposes to re-enact the disciplinary code of the Maritime Industry Commission is not in itself a justification of that code. I suggest that that matter again illustrates my point that honorable senators should have been given sufficient time to examine in detail all sections of the existing disciplinary code in order to see whether they are completely applicable, desirable or even justifiable under the proposed new organization. </para>
                <para>I wish to deal particularly with a proposed amendment of the act which, in my opinion, is fundamental to the rights of the employees engaged in the industry. Section 6 of the principal act defines " desertion " as - </para>

The fact that a seaman has received a bad discharge will immediately affect his future right to engage in the industry. A person who, from one cause or another, has been absent from his ship for 48 hours without lawful justification or excuse, but who in fact never intended to desert and who receives three bad discharges on that ground is precluded from engaging in the industry. I say that that is an extremely bad provision. Nobody would attempt to condone a lax approach to working conditions by an employee, but I suggest that there could be many occasions on which a seaman might accidentally fail to join his ship within 48 hours. I contend that it is a very serious matter to deem him a deserter in such circumstances and to give him a bad discharge. </para>

                <para>The members of the Opposition consider that this bill deals with complex matters, including the rights of many persons, and that it has possibilities which probably have not been foreseen by the Government. That fact may persuade the Government, in the cold, calm and dispassionate light of reflection, to withdraw the measure and redraft it. No opportunity is being given to the Opposition to co-operate with the Government on this matter. Indeed, the Government is denying to honorable senators on this side of the chamber, and to the Parliament as a whole, the right to scrutinize closely a most important measure which will affect every person in the community and, ultimately, the stability of the country. The Opposition believes that that denial amounts to wanton disregard of and disrespect for the Parliament and the people whom we represent. </para>

                    <para>. - This measure, which is designed to deal with the critical emergency that has developed in the coastal trade of Australia, is eminently practicable, as one would expect of any measure introduced by the Minister for Shipping and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay).</inline> I sympathize with the predicament in which members of the Opposition have been placed by its introduction. In fact, they have demonstrated by their utterances during this debate that they are completely unaware of the serious  crisis that has developed in the maritime industry. In reply to their repeated complaint that they have not had sufficient time in which to appreciate the real purpose of the measure, I point out that notice of motion of its introduction was given a week ago and the second-reading speech, which was couched in clear terms, was made by the Minister yesterday. It is utterly futile for individual members of the Opposition to spend half the time allotted to them for discussion of this measure in reciting the number of printed pages it occupies and the number of clauses it contains. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The plain fact is that in the period of approximately eighteen months  that has  elapsed since the Government was relieved of the obstruction caused by a Labour majority in this chamber, the Communistcontrolled unions in the maritime industry have been responsible for the loss of more than 4,000 shipping days. In the light of that fact it is surely not to the credit of members of the Opposition that they have been unable to make any intelligent contribution to the debate. In fact, if I were not burning with indignation at the deplorable conditions of the maritime industry, I would shed a tear for the pitiable barrenness of the contentions of honorable senators opposite. </para>
                <para>Like the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline> I represent the island State of Tasmania, but unlike him I welcome the introduction of this measure because I believe that its passage will ameliorate the hardship imposed upon Tasmanians by the present Communist control of the shipping industry. As an indication of the degree of suffering imposed upon Tasmanians by the militant unions, I shall recall the unpleasant facts connected with the cargo vessel <inline font-style="italic">Dubbo.</inline> In fact, I am astonished that that incident in itself has not inspired even the Leader of the Opposition to assist the Government in its attempts to speed up the movement of our shipping. </para>
                <para>On the 25th March last <inline font-style="italic">Dubbo,</inline> which had a full cargo pf wheat for Tasmania, was tied up at Port Adelaide because of a dispute initiated by the ship's firemen, and the sailing of the vessel was delayed for 33 days, with a consequent loss of Â£22,640, to the Australian Shipping Board. which is a government instrumentality. The firemen alleged that the quality of bunker coal carried on the ship was so inferior that it was dangerous for the vessel to put to sea, and demanded of the master that he undertake to proceed only at reduced speed. Later they shifted their ground and claimed that it was unsafe for the vessel to proceed to sea at all. The Australian Shipping Board had samples of the coal analysed, and it was reported to be of higher than average quality. Later a conciliation commissioner, after a most patient hearing of the firemen's case, found that the board's proposals for settling the dispute were utterly reasonable. However, Communist influence caused the dispute to be prolonged, and even when it had ended, the secretary of the Seamen's Union  refused to allow the vessel a full complement to enable it to sail. .The consequence of this nefarious conduct on the part of the Communist unions concerned was that Tasmania was left so short of wheat that bakers in the southern half of the island did not have sufficient flour to bake bread for the people. </para>
                <para>I propose now to recall the incidents associated with another completely unjustifiable hold-up. In fact, the circumstances of this case are so bad that they ought to galvanize every honorable senator into a determination to rectify this critical situation at the earliest opportunity. A tug built in the United Kingdom for Howard Smith Limited arrived in Melbourne under its own steam about last June. Subsequently, representatives of the Seamen's Union refused to man the vessel on the pretext that the accommodation for the crew was unsatisfactory.  They  went further, and urged that the vessel should be converted from coalburning to oil-firing on the alleged ground that the space in the boiler room was too cramped to permit firemen to engage in co al -firing, and they also demanded other costly structural alterations. Technical officers of considerable repute in the shipping industry were consulted, and every possible concession was made to the demands of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bird</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Elliott,</inline> the Communist leaders of the two maritime unions concerned. The shipping company even offered to give the ship a trial run in order to demonstrate that the conditions for the firemen were satisfactory, but this request was refused. The net result of all this Communist manoeuvring is that although nearly four months have elapsed since the tug arrived it is still lying idle, notwithstanding our urgent need of these vessels. </para>
                <para>It is an odd circumstance that the Maritime Industry Commission, which the bill seeks to abolish, was brought into existence, not by legislation, but by regulation. In fact, the regulation concerned was never submitted to either House of the Parliament but was merely signed by a Minister in his office. It is ironical therefore, for the Leader of the Opposition to criticize this bill on the ground that it will empower the Government to implement its requirements concerning shipping accommodation by mere regulation. Would any one but the Labour senators opposite contend that in 1952 Australian ship-owners would provide accommodation for crews no better than that provided in 1912 or 1921? The contention of the Leader of the Opposition that the Government should not be empowered to prescribe by regulation accommodation standards in vessels is answered by the obvious fact that shipping design alters and improves as time goes oh. The accommodation for the men of our mercantile marine must be the best possible accommodation, and we should not restrict the skill and ingenuity of our marine architects by shackling them with static legislation. The prescription of standards of accommodation and shipping design by regulation, instead of by legislation, permits of flexibility and improvement in these standards. </para>

                <para>After all, Australia has a coastline much greater than that of the United Kingdom, and possibly also that of the United States of America.

                <para>In a moment of aberration <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline> told the truth when he said that the Navigation Act had grown into a magnificently complete code for the protection of our seamen. I thoroughly agree with that statement, - but it  is obvious that it is our duty, as members of the Legislature, to use both elbows to jockey the Communist monkeys off the hacks of our seamen. However, I have no sympathy with members of the Labour Opposition, who find themselves in. a dilemma because they have not had time to consult either the executive of . their political party or the Communist unions concerned in order to determine their attitude towards this bill.  "When the Curtin Government introduced the regulations to establish the Maritime Industries Commission it realized that the responsibilities of that commission, particularly for maintaining discipline in the industry, were such that its  chairman  should be a judge. Accordingly, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> De Baun  was appointed  chairman,  and he rendered signal service in that office from 1942 until 1944. In 1944 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> De Baun  reviewed the scale of war bonus that had been granted in the more perilous days of 1942, and came to the conclusion that the scale of payment should be reduced in view of the lessened risk to seamen. However, the Labour Government of that time, in accordance with its practice of undermining the judiciary, directed the commission to review its decision. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> De Baun  who was true to the traditions of the judiciary, replied in these terms - </para>

During the five barren years of Labour administration that followed no one was appointed to succeed him as  chairman,  and the consequence was that this lame duckling was left to function without a  chairman.  Whatever success it has achieved, as the Minister for Shipping and Transport so properly pointed out, has been due to the personality of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. S.</inline> T. Edwards, who has acted as  chairman  since <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> De Baun's  resignation. In the fifteen months that followed the last general election the Government has made great strides which have been too hasty for the Opposition. The Government has now proposed to give the seamen the right of access to the Common-  wealth Arbitration Court "for the settle- ment of industrial disputes. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline> has approved of that proposition, except in one respect. The bill makes the Government's power to prescribe regulations subject to alteration by decision of the Arbitration Court. The Leader of the Opposition has objected to that aspect of the bill. I consider that the Government can take great credit for the fact that it does not wish to have the final word in determining the amount of accommodation to be provided for crews. The final word, if there is any appeal against the regulations, is to be spoken by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. That is made clear in proposed new section 135 which states that the provision relating to accommodation shall be subject to any order or award made by virtue of Part Xa of the act. That is the part which commits all industrial matters to the Arbitration Court. Proposed new section 405q of the bill states that an order or an award under this part made by the Arbitration Court does not have effect to the extent that it is inconsistent with any law of the Commonwealth except a regulation made under the division of the act which entitles the Government to make regulations in regard to accommodation. </para>
                <para>I express my complete contempt for Opposition senators who, with this display of the principles of British justice before them, have accused the Government of attempting to introduce Italian conditions into the ships that sail along the Australian coast. Let me deal with the manning of the ships. It is a part of the tradition of the British mercantile marine to have a Superintendent of Mercantile Marine in every  por.t  of note to act as guardian and protector of the interests of seamen. Who is better equipped than the Superintendent of Mercantile Marine to decide whether a ship has a sufficient complement of officers to go to sea? The bill provides that the superintendent shall make that decision. When the superintendent has authorized the master of a vessel to take his ship to sea the final decision as to whether he will put to sea will still be the responsibility of the master whose tradition is worthily represented by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kendall</inline> who sits on this side of the chamber. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kendall</inline> has stated that a master would not put to sea if the safety of his crew or his passengers was, in his judgment, likely to be endangered. The bill makes it abundantly clear that, having received authority from the Superintendent of Mercantile Marine to put to sea, the final decision is left to the master, and if he decides to sail he may give a lawful command which his crew is bound to obey. It is the tradition of the Mercantile Marine that the master is the god-father, the law-giver and- the guardian of all who go down to the sea with him. </para>

                <para>This bill should receive a little consideration in committee in order to determine whether it would not be appropriate to introduce a provision to prevent persistent Communist malingering and exploitation of conditions that have been built up- for the protection of the seamen's unions. If a seaman refuses, without lawful excuse, to accept three offers of engagement in succession he should be deregistered and so disentitled to the benefits of unionism that have been built up around the Arbitration Court. Even Labour senators might find that proposition worthy of consideration. So far from this measure being dealt with precipitately. I regret that, after eight years of Labour government, it has been delayed for fifteen months after the Labour majority was removed from this chamber. The bill provides that from the end of this month there shall be in charge of this industry a practical organization which will have a reasonable prospect of enabling ships to operate to the benefit of 90 per cent, of seamen who are bona fide and to whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kendall</inline> referred. It will also bring prosperity to other sections of the community in whose welfare <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline> professed to be interested. </para>

                    <para>. -  The Senate has listened to a very humorous but tragic address by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Wright. Throughout the whole of his speech, the honorable senator attacked Australian seamen. He also sought to make as much political capital as possible out of Labour's decision to oppose this bill.  I submit that by drawing attention tq one glaring inaccuracy in the honorable senator's statements, I can discredit the whole of his speech, and show that his remarks are not worth a tinker's benediction. The honorable senator stated that, under this measure,. crew accommodation will be dealt with by the Crew Accommodation Committee, and that, in the event of any dispute, the matter can be taken to the judge of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, who will constitute the maritime tribunal. However, according to the Minister for Shipping and Transport, who introduced this measure and, presumably, should know something about it, there is no appeal from decisions of the Crew Accommodation Committee. </para>

                        <para>- I am not concerned about that provision. The position is that the Minister has said one thing and the honorable senator has said another. In this instance, I am prepared to accept the version given by the tubby Minister. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> went on to tell us something about certain ships that had been held up and how the despatch of cargoes to Tasmania had been delayed. Once again he attacked only the seamen although, quite obviously, there must be at least two parties to every dispute. There again, I submit, we can discount the honorable senator's statements. He is worse than biased. A biased man can usually see his own bias, but a one-eyed man can only see the bias of his adversary. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> is one-eyed. </para>

                <para>I join with other honorable senators on this side of the chamber in objecting strongly to the Government's attempt to rush this legislation through the Senate. It was quite obvious from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright's</inline> statements that even he had not been able to consider the bill thoroughly.  His  speech was full of inaccuracies and clearly he did not know what he was talking about. For instance, he said that certain provisions of this amending legislation had been in force since 1921. If that is so, how does the Government expect to overcome the trouble on the waterfront by means of this legislation? If honorable senators opposite believe that our waterfront difficulties can be solved by tackling only the seamen, they are making a grave mistake. The bill provides, for instance, that a superintendent - one of the dictators who are to be appointed - may refuse to permit the engagement of seamen. I believe that if the provisions of this measure are enforced there will not be a seaman left in the Australian coastal trade at the end of twelve months. That will not be because the seamen do not want to man the ships, but because superintendants will refuse them permission to do so. That refusal is mandatory in certain instances. Superintendents will be obliged to deprive seamen of their right to ply their trade. If the Government believes that our shipping problems can be solved in that way, it has another think coming. The only result will be to tie up vessels all along the Australian coast and to deprive seamen of their livelihood. </para>
                <para>The measure provides that a vessel may go to sea with four-fifths of its complement. I cannot see what assistance that provision will be because, to tie the vessel up, it will only be necessary for another seaman to walk off the ship. I contend that the Government should make a thorough inquiry and endeavour to ascertain the cause of what it terms petty stoppages. My experience has been that 90 per cent, of disputes on ships are over accommodation or amenities. The Maritime Industry Commission did npt deal effectively with accommodation problems. The proposal now is that accommodation requirements are to be variable by regulation. It is quite obvious that pressure is being brought to bear on the Government to alter the accommodation requirements for ships trading on the Australian coast. We all know that in the past shipowners have been compelled in many instances to improve accommodation on vessels that have been purchased overseas for the Australian shipping trade. 'When this measure becomes law, it will be possible for a regulation to be issued stating that the accommodation provided on a certain vessel is adequate, whereas in fact it may be a long way below Australian standards. Unfortunately we shall not have an opportunity to examine, and if necessary, disallow such regulations because they will not come under the statutory rules which cover regulations issued under other legislation. Therefore, the regulations may be kept secret. A regulation may apply to only one ship, and only those associated with that ship may know  about it. It is true that the master would have the right, in the event of a prosecution being launched, to produce the regulation to prove that he had not infringed the law, but the regulation could be kept secret. In that provision, therefore, we have a starting point for the breaking down of minimum accommodation standards provided for ships on the Australian coast. It is quite obvious that shipping companies have enormous power over this Government. Apparently pressure has been brought to bear on the Government to give the shipping companies some relief from maritime controls. We must remember, of course, that some shipping companies have wide interests. For instance, certain airways in this country are owned by shipping companies. Relief is to be granted in that direction also. Shipping interests are also concerned in the distribution of oil, and they are getting something there, too. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. Their ramifications are very wide indeed, and in every direction they are being given something by this Government. There are only four clauses of this bill under which action may be taken against employers or masters. The rest of the measure is aimed at the seamen.

                    referred to the subject of petty hold-ups. It is all very fine for honorable senators who are living in the lap of luxury, and who have never been engaged in the rough and tumble duties of a seaman, to characterize disputes in the shipping trade as petty hold-ups. They should seek to discover the reasons for the hold-ups rather than attempt to make, party political capital out of them at every opportunity. I do not suppose that any official of a trade union has not at one time or other .committed a foolish act. Like us, trade union officials arc human; they are not angels. Instead of condemning them for their ideological beliefs, and blaming them for all the disputes that arise in the industries with which they are associated, honorable senators opposite would do better if they applied their minds to the possibility of remedying the causes of the disputes.
                </para>
                <para>Throughout this bill emphasis is placed upon the need to discipline seamen. In the eyes of the Government seamen are to blame for every dispute that occurs in the industry in which they are engaged. I wonder whether the marine- cooks, the marine engineers or the marine stewards have ever had a dispute with the shipowners. ' Persons engaged in those callings all work in ships, but we hear very little of them; the emphasis is always upon the so-called recalcitrant seamen. Honorable senators opposite never fail to take every opportunity to make political capital out of industrial disputes by endeavouring to prove tha.t the Labour party, allied with  the Communist party, has been responsible for  fomenting  them. Nothing is further from the truth. </para>

                <para>That statement was commented on by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> I remind honorable senators opposite that in November, 1944, Australia and the Allied nations were experiencing perhaps the most dangerous period of the war. The government of the day had to keep ships moving at all costs. Probably it gave way to some degree on this matter as it had to do in respect of many other matters. It ill becomes the Minister or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> to make political capital out of the fact that the Labour Government;  during the darkest days of the war, was forced to take certain action in order to enable it to prosecute the war with the utmost vigour. Honorable senators opposite should not forget that they and the parties to which they belong stood firmly behind that government in all the actions, that it took to bring the war to a successful conclusion. </para>

                        <para>- That is not so. The Labour Government did everything possible to ensure a steady flow of food and weapons of war to the armed forces, not only of this country but also of the United States of America, Great Britain and allied countries in the Ear East. I regret that honorable senators opposite should endeavour to make political capital out of troubles that were the direct outcome of war conditions. </para>

                <para>Members of the  Government  and the shipowners, who are bringing pressure tobear on it, may believe that, as a result of this legislation, disturbances will not occur on the waterfront. Undoubtedly, the Government is eager to organize another seamen's strike and to endeavour to prove that there is a link between the Labour party and the Communist party. I warn the Government that if this bill be passed the inequitable clauses in it will be repealed as soon as a Labour government is returned to office. We have no desire to see an Australia-wide industrial disturbance. I remind the members of the Seamen's Union of Australasia and the other maritime unions that there will be no need for them to strike in order to defeat the provisions of this bill. The provisions of this bill, if properly availed of by them, can be used to defeat the objectives of the Government. I advise those who go down to the sea in ships to examine this legislation carefully before they take precipitate action. </para>

                    <para>. -  I cannot too strongly deplore the action of the Government in this matter. The proposition that the Senate is asked to agree to is that, after only eight honorable senators of the total number of 60 members of this chamber have spoken to the motion for the second reading of the bill, only another quarter of an hour shall be allowed for the completion of the second-reading debate. Only four of 28 Opposition senators have been allowed to voice their views on this important and comprehensive bill. The Government must take the responsibility before the people of its ruthless gagging of the debate, and of its completely undemocratic action. The hill comprises 21 printed pages, and contains 38 major clauses. As new sections are proposed to be inserted, it will be necessary to consider 60 substantive clauses at the committee stage. It is proposed that the bill shall be passed by 11.55 p.m. The committee stage must be completed within an hour. Only one minute has been allowed for a consideration of each of the 60 clauses. I point out that, on behalf of the Opposition, I am charged with the responsibility of moving eight amendments. It is quite certain that I shall not have an opportunity to move even half of that number. Moreover, several of my colleagues had intended to propose amendments. The Government has asked for co-operation, yet when the Opposition is ready to make constructive suggestions the Government denies them the opportunity to do so. I should like to know whether the Minister for Shipping and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> will give to the Senate the courtesy of a reply to the matters that have been raised. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">in reply</inline> - I want to take this opportunity to congratulate both <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kendall</inline> on their excellent speeches, and I give to the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator. McKenna)</inline> credit for his analysis of variouis aspects of the bill. The remainder of the Opposition speakers devoted about  90 per cent, of their time to matters outside the scope of the bill. In the limited time at my disposal, I want to make it quite clear to the Leader of the Opposition that it is well known that there has been a conspiracy between the Communistcontrolled Waterside Workers Federation aud the Communist-controlled Seamen's Union of Australasia to cause chaotic conditions on the Australian coast. The Government has received protests about the actions of those unions, and <inline font-style="italic">At</inline> has been urged to take appropriate action to lift the Queensland sugar that -is awaiting shipment. It is important that this matter should be dealt with  promptly.  I make no excuse for hurrying  the  bill through the Senate and, for the benefit of the many people who may be listening to the broadcast of the proceedings in this chamber, I say quite frankly that the stonewalling of the Opposition during the last month has been responsible for the worst delay that I have seen during the seventeen years that I have been a member of the Parliament. Their propaganda 'does not cut any ice with me. Unless the Opposition is prepared to co-operate with .the Government in the passage of important legislation it shall receive no respect by the Government. </para>

                            <para>- The Leader of the Opposition has stated that the Maritime Industry Commission was not consulted about the matter. It is not usual for the Government to consult a body that it proposes to displace, when it is intended to transfer to the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration the matters that have been administered by that body. However, the acting  chairman  of the commission, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edwards,</inline> was informed that the Government was giving consideration to the proposal. One of the reasons why I was not prepared to consult the commission was that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> V. Elliott, the secretary of the seamen's union, who has caused 90 per cent', of the trouble on the waterfront, was not prepared to play the game. I cannot understand why Opposition senators who are just as hostile as I am to the Communists are not prepared to get behind the Government in its attempt to deal with the Communist menace. It is well known to honorable senators that the legislation that was introduced to provide for secret ballots in the trade unions did not have the desired effect in relation to the seamen's union. For a long time , I have striven to provide a regular shipping service on the Australian coast, particularly to the distant ports. It should be unnecessary for me to remind honorable senators of the many hold-ups that have occurred on the waterfront during the last two years. </para>

If the' honorable senator will refer to section 44 (2.) of the original act he will find that the provision for a ship to go to sea with only four-fifths of its complement has operated for many years. The Government has decided to appoint a committee of experts to advise on matters relating to accommodation, because it has been the practice of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Elliott,</inline> the Communist, to decide whether or not a ship should go to sea, and to stipulate the accommodation that should be provided for the crew. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bird</inline> decided when seamen should offer for a tug that has been held up in Melbourne for some months. The Government has accepted the advice of its technical officers, one of whom has occupied his present position for 37 years. I cannot understand the action of the Opposition in opposing some of the proposals contained in the bill. The staff of the commission are four in number.

                    <para class="block">During my speech on the second-reading debate I foreshadowed this amendment. I gave notice to the Government of my intention to take this action. Also during the second-reading debate the Minister for Shipping and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> indicated that the Government would oppose the motion. Therefore, I have no hope that it will be accepted by the Government, and I do not propose to address myself to it at any length. I have already voiced my objection, on behalf of the Opposition, to the very limited time that has been made available for the consideration of this measure, and I move this motion now primarily to give to the various sections of this very important and diverse industry an opportunity to consider the contents of this bill. From that consideration may well come suggestions that will prevent the Government from making very serious tactical errors. Even though in the motion I suggest that the report shall he brought up within fourteen days, I say to the Minister that if he is happy with seven days I shall accept a proposal to. shorten the time, in order to give an opportunity for these matters to receive proper consideration. I ask the Minister why when this measure has lain idle for three years, the Government is now obliged to gag it through this chamber in one day. Let us look at the record of the Government during the last two years, as indicated by the Minister himself in the course of his second-reading speech. Almost with pride, the honorable senator referred to the achievements of the Government. He stated that in the last two years 4,237 ships days have been lost. If the honorable senator, who is in charge of this bill, is proud of the fact that his Government has presided over that record series of hold-ups in the shipping industry, he may have his pride on his own. </para>

                            <para>- I do not wish to delay discussion of this issue, but if the Opposition is prepared to continue these tactics' it must accept fair criticism from the Government. We accept full responsibility for this bill. We also accept full  responsibility  for the proposal to transfer authority from the Maritime Industry Commission, which was set up by a Labour government, to the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. It is well known to honorable senators, and also to the people of Australia, that because of the limited powers at present possessed by the Commonwealth it is impossible to remove undesir able persons from the two unions to which reference has been made in this debate. However, when an attempt was made before the High Court of Australia to deal with this matter, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt,</inline> the Leader of the Australian Labour party, defended the Communists. </para>

I referred to certain causes of delay in shipping during my speech this afternoon, you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> held that my remarks were irrelevant  to the bill. Now, the Minister for Shipping and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> is trying to discuss the Communist menace in the -course of debate on a measure which does not relate in any way to communism. If the Minister can point to any reference to communism in this bill I shall withdraw my point of order, but in the meantime I submit that the Minister is completely out of order in referring to the Communist menace during discussion of this bill. </para>

                    <para>. -  I said earlier that the Government would not accept the motion. Honorable senators must appreciate the situation that has arisen in the Australian maritime industry. This bill represents an honest attempt on the part' of the Government to rectify that situation. It was drafted after very careful consideration and after a thorough examination by a number of experienced officials of my department. They recommended that industrial disputes arising in the maritime industries should be brought within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, which has full power to deal with such matters. It. must be obvious to honorable senators that the powers at present possessed by -the Maritime Industry Commission, which was established as a war-time expedient, have faded, and that the efforts, during the past three years, of conciliation commissioners to bring about peace in the industry have not been successful. In fact, certain conciliation commissioners have publicly exhorted the steamship owners not to be blackmailed by the tactics adopted by some of the union leaders. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I am surprised that members of the Australian Labour party should oppose this measure because, as I said earlier in my remarks, I know that that party is opposed to communism and that a number of men in the Labour movement and in the maritime industries have done a great deal to remove the Communists from control of the unions concerned. Furthermore, as the result of my association with men engaged in the industry, I know that 90 per cent, of them will be pleased if the present Government can devise some means of overcoming the troublesome elements in the industry. They do not want industrial disputes, and the loss of wages which those disputes entail. </para>
                <para>I repeat that the Government accepts full responsibility for its proposal to place the control of the maritime industries in the hands of a judge of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, and, it believes that that is the best proposal it can make at present, having regard to the limitations imposed by the Commonwealth Constitution. In. conclusion, I regret that the Opposition is not prepared to support us. In fact, it is evident that the Opposition is not prepared to help us at all in this matter. </para>

                    <para>. -  Iregret that the Government is not prepared to accept our proposal to refer this matter to a select committee, because I think sufficient has emerged during the debate to show that the bill has not been properly considered. Honorable senators generally have not had a proper opportunity to examine it. The Minister for Shipping and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> accused me of having made a mistake when I referred to a particular clause of the bill. However, the Minister himself is not clear on this matter, because he has proposed a vital alteration. These facts make it quite clear that the bill has not received proper consideration. All that the Opposition asks now is that a. select committee should be appointed to examine the proposals contained in the bill and to report its findings to the Senate within fourteen days. If that course is followed, a proper and adequate judgment can then be formed of the merits of the bill. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I am unable to say whether the proposals in the bill will deal effectively with the Communist menace in the maritime industries. However, I know that the bill presented to the Parliament by the Government some time ago for the express purpose of dealing with the Communists was subsequently rejected by the people, who regarded it as a totalitarian measure that was wholly unacceptable to them. The Minister has accused members of the Opposition of criticizing this bill because they seek to defend the Communists. .However, I say that we are defending the liberties of the people of Australia, just as we defended, so courageously, the liberties of the people when we opposed the Communist Party Dissolution Bill. To-night we again protest most vigorously against the Government's attempt to foist a totalitarian measure upon us. If the people of Australia had the opportunity to pass judgment on such a method as the Minister has proposed to use they would return the same ringing answer as they gave some twelve months ago. </para>
                <para>The Minister for Shipping and Transport, has had three years . in which to introduce amendments to the Navigation Act. No emergency has arisen in the last couple of days which would require this bill to pass through all its stages in a few hours. The Opposition has asked only that the debate be adjourned for a short period so that we may properly examine the measure. No doubt the Minister will try to convince his supporters that there is some reason for his haste. The Opposition is afraid of the totalitarian methods that the Government has adopted and which the people of Australia have rejected. "We demand reasonable time in which to examine measures that are brought before this chamber. If this practice is to be continued the Government cannot expect the Opposition to acquiesce meekly in what it proposes. We are suspicious of any Minister who tries to hasten a bill through the Senate in a few hours without giving any explanation of its urgency, without having had it examined by any body of experts and without Opposition senators having been able to obtain any information about it. Consequently, we have submitted that the bill should be examined by a select committee and if honorable senators opposite believe in liberalism they will give the minority in this chamber an adequate chance to discuss the measure and vote for the establishment of that committee. </para>

Surely the intelligence which he possesses- above that possessed hy other Opposition senators enables him to recognize that this bill has been designed to deal with a critical national situation.

                            would not expect me to do that because he himself is incapable of absorbing anything that relates to democracy. He has given an exhibition of his attitude to democracy by supporting the Minister for Shipping and Transport who wants to overthrow democracy. If Gladstone knew what was happening in this chamber under the name of liberalism he would rise in his grave and come out of it. Opposition senators have asked the Minister to give us fourteen days to consider this measure and collect evidence in relation to it. Indeed, the Leader of the Opposition has asked for only seven days. What is behind this bill? Why must the Minister have it passed to-night ? I venture to say that it will not be passed in another place for a fortnight. The Minister said that he must get rid of the Communists. If Communists are sabotaging industry he has power to deal with them under the Crimes Act. The reason that he has not done this is that he lacks the courage. He is game only when he can play the part of a dictator. He then says, " I have the numbers behind me. To the devil with democracy. I do not believe in it ". fs there any democracy in the Government's attempt to have this bill passed by five minutes to twelve although no honorable senator on this side of the chamber had any information concerning it until yesterday? If the Government wishes to overthrow democracy in this country it has only to continue to use the tactics that it is using now, to continue to give champagne dinners to the Communists, and to continue bringing to Canberra delegations such- as that which visited this city to-day. I would not be surprised to learn that the Minister played a part in paying for the bus which brought that delegation to Parliament House.

                <para>The only other argument that Government senators have put forward has been that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt</inline> defended the Communists. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt</inline> never, at any time, defended the Communists. He acted in defence of the civil liberties of people who had had the bone pointed at them. Certain individuals had been branded unjustly but had had no right of appeal against this blackmail. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt</inline> proved that the Government was wrong and that it was running away from democracy in introducing legislation to brand private individuals who were not connected with Communists. The Minister stated that we must get rid of Communists. If Communists have disrupted industry nobody is to blame more than the Minister.  The  Minister has proposed that one judge should control the whole of the maritime industry. If the conditions of the last two years in this industry continue that judge will have to settle 352 disputes during the next two years. That would occupy his time fully and even then I do not think that he would be able to do justice to the parties. </para>
                <para>The Government wishes to press this measure through the Senate because it knows that it is flouting the fundamental principles of unionism. That is why it will not give the Opposition the opportunity to set up a committee to inquire into the matter. The Government knows that if it piles all this work on to one man, ships will be held up throughout Australia. The Government wishes to bring about that state of affairs. The Government's action has been sinister from start to finish. The Minister has revealed that fact every time that he has ' spoken on this measure, which he has been unable to debate civilly. By way of interjection, he has immediately said " No " to propositions which Opposition senators have put to him. He has  not been prepared to listen to reason. If lie intends to apply the same tactics to seamen as he has applied to Opposition senators all the ships in Australia will be tied up and the Minister will have something on his back which will drag him down. </para>

                    <para>. - The only way in which the people of Australia will be able to get the champagne dinners to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> referred will be by putting an end to the strife which has occurred on the waterfront during the last two years. The time lost on 74 Commonwealth ships and 287 privately owned ships during the last two years has been equal to the time that would be lost if one ship were laid up for eleven years. This has been due to the trouble that has been caused by the Communist-controlled Seamen's Union. By providing that a judge of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court shall be invested with the powers that are set out in this bill we shall make it possible to obtain the shipping necessary to export the produce of this country. In Western Australia Ave have suffered for five years because we have not been able to get ships turned around fast enough to transport urgently needed goods. We have not been able to do the developmental works that we would like to have done. We have had to rely on road transport on many occasions in order to obtain goods. We have also had to rely on rail transport simply because ships have not been manned in sufficient strength to put to sea. Some vessels ' have been held up for as long as 100 days. Australia is a huge continent and efficient shipping services are essential to its development. Stoppages by seamen and wharf-labourers have cost Australian fruit-growers more than Â£1,000,000 on consignments to Great Britain. One vessel which was carrying refrigerated <inline font-style="italic">cargo,</inline> took 101 days to travel from Hobart to London. The ship was delayed at every Australian port and by the time it reached its destination, its cargo of fruit was rotten. The proposal of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline> for the appointment of a select committee is sheer hypocrisy. The committee would have to complete its inquiries within a few days. Obviously it would not have sufficient time to do the job properly. The motion is further evidence of the Opposition's intention to delay legislation. Honorable senators opposite want the Maritime Industry Commission to be retained so that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> V. Elliott, who controls the Seamen's Union may keep his job as a member of the commission. He holds up ships whenever he wants to. I have no doubt that sincere Labour members of Parliament are just as eager to end <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Elliott's</inline> influence in the maritime industry and in the Seamen's Union as the Government is. </para>

                        <para>- The Government is eager to have the bill passed. Honorable senators opposite claim that the Government has had three years in which to introduce this measure but I recall that when I first took my place in this chamber in 1949, the Senate was Labour controlled and every piece of legislation that was designed to benefit this country was blocked by the Opposition. The sooner this bill receives the Royal assent the sooner will our shipping problems be solved and the sooner will our producers be able to send their products overseas and so increase our earnings. I am sure that the measure has the blessing of every true Australian, including the truly Australian members of the Seamen's Union. There are not many Communists in that union, but unfortunately, they are able to control it. By placing the maritime industry under the jurisdiction of a judge of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, the time taken for the turn-round of ships will be halved  almost immediately. . I oppose the motion that has been moved by the Leader of the Opposition. </para>

                    <para>.  - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> endeavoured to foster the impression that ample notice had been given of this measure, whereas, in fact, notice of it was given only yesterday. That is borne out by the <inline font-style="italic">Journals</inline> of the Senate which states that -notice was given by the Minister for Shipping and Transport of an amendment of the Navigation Act. We had no indication that the legislation of which notice was given would abolish the Maritime Industry Commission, and we were not informed of the wide scope of the bill. Surely no member of the Senate could be expected to be fully acquainted with either this amending legislation or with the Navigation Act which, as the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline> has pointed out, consists of over 200 pages. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henty</inline> urged that we should adopt an attitude of mutual trust in our approach to industrial matters. I think the time has arrived when an attitude of mutual trust should be adopted in this chamber. A little more consideration should be given to the Opposition. All that the Minister for Shipping and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> has done is to allege that there is - an association between the Labour party and the Communists. He claimed that a rapid passage of this measure was desirable so that the Communists could be dealt with. He also referred to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Elliott.</inline> I remind him that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Elliott</inline> is not the only person who will be affected by the bill that is now being bludgeoned through the Senate. Does the Minister believe that the maritime engineers have anything to do with communism? Does he consider that the maritime cooks, bakers, butchers, stewards and others are Communists? I do not object to the proposal to place the affairs of the maritime industry under the jurisdiction of a judge of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, but I take strong exception to the claim that the change will in any way affect communism. The only political party that has ever really fought communism is the Labour party. The industrial movement of the Australian Labour party has done more to defeat communism in this country tha.i this Government will ever do. </para>

I shall not trespass further on the time of the Senate. I support the motion that has been moved by the Leader of the Opposition. I have not had an opportunity to examine the bill closely and I claim for the workers in the maritime industry the same right as has extended to the ship-owners. No mention has been made by honorable senators opposite of the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edwards,</inline> the acting  chairman  )f the Maritime Industry Commission and a representative of the ship-owners, has wired to the Government protesting against the proposal to abolish the commission. I hope that in future the Government will show more consideration for the Opposition than it has shown on this occasion. </para>

                <para class="block">It is obvious that honorable senators opposite have left their brains outside. They are in rather a quandary about how to vote because the3 have not been able to consult their leaders. In fact that is the only reason for their annoyance with this bill. The debate has shown quite clearly that the Opposition is not in the least concerned about the merits or demerits of the bill. I have listened to  speaker  after  speaker  on the Opposition side moaning that sufficient time has not been allowed for the consideration of the bill. Government supporters have had plenty of time to make valuable contribution to the debate, but I have hardly heard  one rational suggestion from the Opposition. The theme of speeches of honorable senators opposite has been, "We have not had time to discuss the bill ". If they genuinely desired to discuss the bill they would have exercised their right to do so. The motion that has been moved by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline> is merely a subterfuge to gain time in order that members of the Opposition may consult their masters on how to vote on this measure. I suggest that the only opponents of this bill are honorable senators opposite and comrade Elliott, who is about to lose a very good job. In recent years he has been able to order strikes at will. </para>

                    <para>- I direct your attention, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> to Standing Order 407b which relates to the limitation of debate on urgent bills covering the initial stages up to, but not inclusive of, the second reading of the bill; the second reading; the committee stage, and the remaining stages of the bill. No provision has been made in the standing order for the consideration of a motion that such a bill be referred to a select committee. I should like your ruling whether added time should be given because of the debate on the motion for the reference of the bill to a select committee. </para>

                        <para>. - I regret to have to detain honorable senators at this late hour, but during a debate in this chamber a few weeks ago certain criticisms and allegations were made about the administrative control of the Army. My colleague, the Minister for the Army (Mr.Francis) has taken such a serious view of those allegations that he has asked me to place on record in this chamber the facts of the matter. It relates to a conscientious objector named Private Mason. As I have already outlined to honorable senators, in a reply to a question, the details of the case, I shall not traverse that ground again. </para>

                    <para>On the 30th September, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Flaherty</inline> made serious allegations about the fairness of the treatment that had been extended to Private Mason. I shall disregard the historical facts which are already on record. When Private Mason was transferred to the Military Corrective Establishment at Holsworthy he was informed that if at any time he indicated his willingness to undergo normal training of a non-combatant nature, instructions would be issued for his release from the corrective establishment and for his transfer to the 16th National Service Training Battalion at Woodside to complete his period of training. Instructions were issued by the Minister for the Army to the Army authorities at the time that no undue coercion was to be brought to bear upon Mason while he was detained at Holsworthy to compel him to wear uniform, to train, or to work, unless he was prepared to doso. </para>

                        stated on the 30th September that while at Holsworthy Mason " has been subjected to treatment, of a kind that those who support the Government contend is meted out to certain persons in Russia, China, Korea and other countries ". The Minister for  the  Army has asked me to inform honor able senators that that statement was ill-considered, reckless, irresponsible, dangerous, incorrect, and unworthy of the honorable senator. Private Mason's legal representative,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline>

Treloar, of Treloar and Treloar, Adelaide, in personal interviews with the Minister for the Army and the Secretary, Department of the Army, advised that he had no criticism of the way in which Mason has been treated while undergoing detention at Holsworthy.

                    <para class="block">It is important to state that the Military Corrective Establishment generally is not run as a gaol or a rigid disciplinary punishment area, but, as its name implies, it has been established to comply with modern army conditions, with a view to training the undisciplined soldier to adopt a more reasonable and sane attitude towards military service, and thus become a good soldier and citizen. All of the activities at the corrective establishment are designed to that end, and honorable senators can be assured that, unless a serviceman proves incorrigible, he is given every facility and every encouragement to make good. </para>
                    <para>The basic principles which govern the administration of this establishment are that soldiers who are undergoing detention for disciplinary reasons are divided into two categories, namely (1) those considered capable of rehabilitation as soldiers, and (2) those considered not capable of such rehabilitation. In the case of former soldiers, the linking of rehabilitation with punishment is designed to return the soldier to his unit with his military training continued and improved and with a better understanding of the virtue of discipline. As soldiers in this category indicate by their behaviour that they are responding to their instruction, they are permitted to live under conditions which resemble the life- of a soldier living in barracks in a normal unit. An important aspect of this corrective establishment is that both staff and soldiers undergoing detention receive the same rations and the same meals. As I have already indicated," Private Mason was given especial treatment and was not subjected to any military discipline or required to carry out dutiesother than those he was prepared to undertake voluntarily. That statement completely refutes the reckless and irresponsible contentions of the honorable senator. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to speak of a matter which is closely connected with that referred to by the Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner);</inline> 1 refer to the treatment accorded to people who are genuine conscientious objectors to military service. I refer particularly to a man whom I knew during World War II., and who was a scientist and a naturalist. When war broke out he genuinely wished to direct his efforts to his life's work rather than to military affairs. He was taken before a court for refusing to undergo military service and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment. Immediately on release, he was. re-arrested and again imprisoned. Altogether, he spent approximately twoyears in prison. This man has now a. son eighteen years of age who is at presentundergoing a second term of imprisonment because he also is a conscientiousobjector to military service. It seemsto me that a man who sincerely believes that he should not be obliged to undertake military service should not be so treated. I should like the Minister to consider borderline cases of that kind. No one could say that the young man to whom I have referred is not a genuine conscientious objector. In my opinion, the fact that he objects to military service is his own business. It seems altogether unfair that because his life and character have been formed along certain lines, and his mind works in a certain way, he should be subjected to continuous imprisonment. Conscientious objection is a very difficult matter to define. It is possible that many men who are man-powered into the army may object to the manner in which their services are used. On the other hand, men who do not go into the armed services at all may consider that their services could be used to better advantage. It seems to me that a man who does not wish to take part in military activities should receive a greater measure of consideration than has this young "man in whose blood is an objection to military service. It may well be that it is not his fault that he objects to such service. Such cases should be considered closely in order to avoid victimization of genuine conscientious objectors. </para>
