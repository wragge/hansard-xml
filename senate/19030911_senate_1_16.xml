          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lt.-Col.</inline>NEILD (New South Wales. - It will be seen that both Houses are to be afforded an opportunity - and very properly so in my view - of dissenting from any regulation, and are to be allowed a certain number of sitting days in which to express their dissent by an adverse vote. But it is of no use to provide that either House shall have the right of vetoing a regulation if it cannot exercise that right. While I admit that fifteen, sitting days is a long period, it would be quite possible for the Government to prevent the consideration of a regulation by either House. Your experience, sir, must lead you to indorse my assertion, that frequently, owing to unexpected events occurring in the course of parliamentary business - motions of censure, and all that sort of thing - there would be no such opportunity afforded during the first or last fifteen sitting days of a session, The regulations under the Act might be laid on the table of each House on the last day of the session, and neither House would have any say in the matter for six months, or possibly longer. A Minister -who wished to work a little point - and sometimes Ministers want to do these things - would only have to keep the House occupied with business, and so work the paper that no adverse motion could be considered. A notice of motion to disapprove of a regulation might be on the business-paper, but it might never be reached. </para>

          <para>. - I think that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> will reflect for a moment he will see that his proposal would be entirely unworkable. In the first place it is very vague. The object of the clause is to insure that there shall be finality - that the matter shall be settled within some reasonable time, and that time is fixed at fi teen sitting days, which may mean five weeks. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> proposes that if, at the end of that period, the Government have failed toafford  either House an opportunity to consider and dispose of a motion the regulation shall be suspended. How is he going to prove failure to afford the opportunity ? Any member of a Government who tables regulations would, if a motion were submitted with regard to them, be desirous of getting the matter settled as soon as possible. Regulations have the force of law. They will be operating all the time. They may be regulations as to pay and training, and affecting all sorts of matters. A Minister naturally wants to know what ground he is upon. But under this proposal we should not know at the end of the fifteen sitting days whether particular regulations had the force of law or not. Probably it would have tobe decided by the High Court whether there was sufficient justification for the suspension of the regulations. The men would not. know whether they were serving under particular regulations or not. The honorable senator must see that his proposal is entirely unworkable. It is impossible to repeal regulations simply by an indefinite failure on the part of the Government to do something. </para>

        <para class="block">The object of this new clause is to provide for the establishment of a Council of Defence. Exception has been taken to the proposal because it has been said that provision has already been made in the Bill for creating a Board of Advice. But this Board of Advice need not of necessity be constituted. The Cabinet have it entirely in their own hands whether it shall be&#39; appointed or not. We have no certainty that the Ministry will ever avail themselves of this clause of the Bill. Besides that, the Board of Advice contemplated by the measure is not a body that would perform the functions of such a Council of Defence as I suggest. The Board of Advice provided for in the Bill is, as I understand, to be a board of experts in military matters, who will advise the Minister for Defence. That is not the object of my proposal. My object is, in the first place, to , do away as far as possible, with the interference of party politics in defence matters. At present everything connected with defence - in reference to organization, financial policy, and so on - is controlled by a Minister who is purely a party official. He represents the party which happens to be in power in the House of Representatives, and looks at everything not from the point of view of the interests of the Commonwealth, but from the interests of his party. I say, most decidedly, after giving the matter very careful consideration, that the Minister never regards questions of defence from the point of view of the interests of the Commonwealth, but as subsidiary to the interests of his party. </para>

            <para>- From observation. I exercise my reasoning power. I see tilings advocated which should not be advocated, and I see neglect by the Government to advocate measures which should be advocated. I have to look around for a reason, and the only reason which can possibly be adduced for that state of affairs is that the Government are influenced by party considerations. We had lately very good evidence of a case in point. The General Officer Commanding has recommended, over and over again during the last eighteen months, that money should be spent in certain directions in equipping the forces. The Government, for party reasons, have not seen their way to press expenditure which they had actually placed upon the Estimates. They took that action for party reasons. I say so deliberately. They did it solely with the view of remaining in power. Almost without debate, they abandoned large sums of money which were placed upon the Estimates, and the expenditure of which they must have known - if they knew anything about the subject at all - was absolutely necessary. That is the answer which I give to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> when he asks me from what source I get my ideas of how a Government administer the departments.

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> cannot deny the fact that the Defence votes were reduced by a very large sum, after some trifling debate, in order that the Defence Estimates might be got through quickly, so as to allow the Prime Minister and the exMinister for Defence to go away to London by a boat that left the day after. The Defence Estimates were taken out of their order so that that result might be achieved. The honorable and learned senator does not deny that, I suppose? At a later date, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne brought in Estimates for the succeeding year, and, without debate, he accepted a reduction of some &#163;50,000 or &#163;60,000, simply in order to get them through.

Thehonorableand learned senator cannot deny that because it is in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> Therefore it in a perfectly fair thing to say that the interests of the Commonwealth are, time after time, sacrificed to party politics in matters of defence.

            <para>- I am content to leave it to the judgment of the Senate. My object in bringing forward this amendment is to do away as far as possible with the practice of treating defence matters in that spirit. Another reason is to obtain continuity of policy in defence matters. Any one who has devoted any study to the history of defence in any one of the States must be aware that with each change of Minister, and each change of General Officer Commanding, in a State, a new defence policy has been introduced. The lines which guided the system of defence under the previous General Officer </para>

            <para>- I do not care whether it was then or not. The fact remains that continuity of policy in military administration has never been achieved, and never will be so long as the present system continues. There is a third reason, which may be submitted in support of the council I propose, and that is that it is absolutely impossible for Parliament to get at the truth in connexion with defence matters under the existing system. One reason for this is that a large number of recommendations by the General Officer Commanding to the Minister must necessarily be treated as confidential. I admit freely that they cannot possibly be laid before Parliament, and, through Parliament, before the public. That, in itself, gives the Minister an undue power of concealing from Parliament and from the public the condition in which the defences are. That is inevitable, and the only way in which Parliament can possibly feel any confidence in the conduct of the Department is by providing that there shall be a certain number of members of Parliament forming a council before whom these recommendations will come. It is most unwise that one man in the position of Minister for Defence should have all this power placed in his hands, and it has proved to be unsatisfactory, not only in Australia, but in England. I do not propose to elaborate any of these points as I desire to be as brief as possible. Some honorable senators have asked me what precedent there is for any council of this sort, and I have fortunately in my possession extracts from the <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balfour&#39;s</inline> speech to the British House of Commons, in proposing the Committee of Defence which has been instituted in England.

            <para>- If the Council of Defence which I suggest were satisfied that it would be prejudicial to the public interest that communications upon such matters should come before Parliament, they would not submit them. My point is that this power should not be intrusted to one man who has only party interests to consider.

          <para>The new Defence Committee will make it its. duty to survey, as a whole, the strategical military needs of the Empire ; to deal with the complicated questions, which are all essential elements in that general problem ; and to revise, from time to time, their own previous decisions, so that the Cabinet shall always be informed, and always have at its disposal, information upon these important points. They should not be left to the crisis of the moment ; but where there is no special stress or strain, the Government and its advisers should devote themselves to the consideration of these broad and all-important issues. So much for the change of subject, scope, and design between the new Defence Committee and the old. It only remains for me to describe in what the constitution of the new committee differs from the constitution of the old one. The old Defence Committee was, in the strictest and. narrowest sense of the word, a committee of the Cabinet ; and, like all ordinary committees of the Cabinet, &#39; it kept no record, and it admitted to its council no outsiders. There are obvious disadvantages in that course. In the first place it is of the essence both of Cabinets and Cabinet Committees, in the narrowest sense of the word, to keep no records. </para>
          <para class="block">There are great objections to that procedure when you are dealing with the particular class of subject with which the Defence Committee is intrusted. In the first place, even during the continuance of a single Administration, it may well happen that the conditions of the problem change, and that they have to be reconsidered by the Defence Committee and by the Cabinet which it advises ; and it is an enormous additional labour that the whole matter has to be gone into again, and taken up in the midst of its -responsible and multifarious duties by the Cabinet. The members themselves, or some of them, may well have got rusty in the details of the problem on which they made up their minds before, and only remember the outline of their decision. If this new plan bears all the fruit which I hope it will bear, the conclusions of the Defence Committee will be embodied, not merely in resolutions, but in reasoned documents in which the whole ground upon which those conclusions have been arrived at will be set out for the information in the first place of the Cabinet of the time, and in the second place of the same Administration at a later period, for revision if need be, and last, if not least, for the information of their successors in office. (Hear, hear.) There are a great many things in which there is discontinuity between successive Administrations in this House, chosen, as they commonly are, upon different sides of the House. But there is one point on which there ought to be no discontinuity, and that is the military and naval policy of the Empire. There may be differences of opinion. There have been, indeed, in my own experience, most important differences of opinion, not between members of that bench and members of this bench, but between the First Naval Lord at one time and the First Naval Lord at another time, between two -successive Boards of Admiralty, two successive Commanders-in-Chief, two successive sets of experts belonging to either Department. It is most important that when these differences of opinion show themselves, the grounds on which the former decision was arrived at should be there in a simple, easily intelligible, easily accessible form. </para>

          <para>I have the profoundest respect, need I say, for expert opinion, whether naval or military : but I cannot help thinking that even the best of soldiers and the best of sailors give a better opinion after they have been thoroughly cross-examined by civilians than they do before they have undergone a process, which, 1 hope, is not unpleasant, but may be long and laborious. This Defence Committee, as I need not say, will be full of instruction for civilians and Cabinet members and I hope it will not be without its instruction for even soldiers and sailors. I entirely agree with those critics of our old system, our old national system, in which the Navy decided its own affairs without consulting the Army, and the Army decided its own affairs without reference to the Navy - I agree that was a very faulty system. </para>

            <para>- It is not proposed that the Board of Advice provided for in the Bill shall do away with Ministerial responsibility, and I say deliberately that the Council of Defence which I suggest, if adopted, would not do away with Ministerial responsibility.

I submit the question to the Senate in this way. Owing to the reductions made in the Defence Estimates, we find ourselves absolutely unarmed at the present time. </para>

            <para>- I shall not say that, but it is very uncertain. Another Government may be in office next year, and war may be declared, &#39;and where then will be the Ministerial responsibility <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> When it is found that we. are not in a position to defend ourselves who will be to blame? It is preposterous to say that the Ministry then in power will be responsible for the neglect of the Ministry who have gone out of office. All this has been pointed out with great care in the <inline font-style="italic">Times,</inline> and it has, been shown that there is no such thing as Ministerial responsibility in the matter of defence. But supposing there were, that responsibility would not be removed by the constitution of a Council of Defence. The Ministry and Cabinet would have all the power which they exercise at the present moment to bring measures and resolutions before Parliament, subject only to the condition that the Council of Defencewould also report to Parliament at the same time. When the Ministerial Budget was introduced, recommending certain expenditure, there would also be the report of the Council of Defence, the members of which, if they did their work properly, would express an opinion as to whether or not the suggestions of the Government were satisfactory, and give their reasons for approving or disapproving. The sole object of constituting a Council of Defence is to put Parliament in a position, which it does not occupy at present, to exercise an intelligent vote ; and until there is some body of the sort, either on the lines I ad vocate or on some other lines, we shall never be sure that the position is as it should be. At the present moment the recommendations of the General Officer Commanding and the Naval Commandant are reviewed by the Minister, who eliminates those portions which do not suit him or the Government. The Minister, at his own sweet will, instructs the General Officer Commanding as to the form of organization which the Government are prepared to recommend to Parliament, and though the General Officer Commanding may disagree entirely, he has to draft a scheme of which the Government of the day will approve. We know that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ed</inline> ward Hutton&#39;s views about army organization in Australia are very different from those which have been placed before us. I do not say whether either the Minister or <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Hutton is right or wrong, but the fact that there is a difference of opinion is well known ; and we are justified in asserting that the Minister does review, as one man and as a civilian, the recommendations of the General Officer Commanding, and places before us views which suit the party in power. Sub-clause 1 of the clause I submit, also provides that expert advice may be sought; and I make that proposal deliberately, in view of the speech made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Balfour,</inline> who laid great stress on the advantage which a Council of Defence would derive from such advice. We now have to consider how the recommendations of the Council of Defence are to be utilized for the benefit of the community ; and this matter is dealt with in sub-clause 2. I do not propose that the Council of Defence shall have any executive functions. </para>

            <para>- I propose to eliminate the Board of Advice and substitute this Council of Defence. The constitution of the Board of Advice would be optional with the Government, and, in any case, that board would never report to Parliament. We should never know what the real opinion of the Board of Advice was, because we should only get it filtered through the medium of a stone-drip filter, namely, the Minister ; we should have only the clarified drop of juice which he allowed to reach us. The Council of Defence would also - take such steps us may he necessary to secure effective compliance with the directions of Parliament in respect to all such matters. </para>

        <para class="block">By that I mean that the Council shall secure the efficiency of the Defence Forces. Very often sums of money which we are told by the Government&#39; are absolutely essential to efficiency, are voted on the Estimates, but are never expended, because it does not suit the Ministry in power to carry out the work, or the Treasurer does not care to provide the necessary funds. That will be found to be the case in regard to the present Estimates. Then, again, money may be voted by Parliament for the engagement of military forces. We read in the Estimates that the military establishment consists of a certain number of men ; and it is only when we made investigations as to the actual efficient roll that we discover that these men are- not employed- - that the Government never provided money for paying or equipping them. It is scandalous that we should be absolutely misled by the figures which appear in the Estimates year after year.

The honorable senator has made statements which may be correct, but he has distorted them in his endeavour to prove that everything a Minister does is done from a party point of view, and not with due regard to the welfare of the Commonwealth. So far as I am personally concerned, such a suggestion is distinctly incorrect, and it is so with regard to my colleagues. The honorable senator must know very well that the Minister who places on the Estimates the amount which he considers necessary for defence purposes does bo in the interests of the Commonwealth. Does he suppose that the Minister does not desire the Parliament to vote the money which he asks for? If he finds afterwards, as has happened, that it is impossible to induce the Parliament to vote the full amount of his Estimates, he has to be content to accept what it will grant, and to do the best he can with the vote. </para>

            <para>- The members of the board would quarrel among themselves, and instead of helping the Minister would make his position more difficult. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> anticipated what I would say, though not exactly in the same form.  His  proposal goes right against the wholesome rule that power and responsibility should go hand in hand. We should gain nothing by taking the power out of the hands of the Minister, and at the same time loading him with responsibility, because the Minister and the Executive Government generally must be responsible to Parliament for the state of the defences, and they would not be relieved of their responsibility, but would be hampered in their operations, if this Council of Defence were forced upon them. The honorable senator was rather unfortunate in the example which he gave us. Hesaid that in Victoria a lot of money had been spent over some barracks at the Heads : I presume that he referred to Portsea. It was a most unfortunate instance to give, because Victoria is the one State in the Commonweath which has had a Council of Defence. I do not go so far as to say that it was done on the advice of theCouncil of Defence ; but the fact remainsthat it did not prevent the expenditure of the money, which the honorable senatorstigmatized as absolutely wasteful. </para>

            <para>- It was constituted^ if not on these lines, on lines somewhatsimilar. Let us consider the position in England. A large section of the English people are dissatisfied with some incidents which occurred in the military operations in South Africa. Great Britain is generally found unprepared when she has to go to war, and after it is over they blame one another all round for the results of the want of preparation, which has existed in consequence of the British  poeple  not being disposed to respond to the advice which was given to them to make preparations in good time. &#34;When they are blaming one another all round they seek for a scapegoat, blaming first the Minister and next the CommanderinChief, and then they propose to have a Board of Advice and so get rid of all these difficulties. We know that such expedients have generally very much the same results. We have not yet received full particulars from England, but it will be a Board of Advice to advise the Minister - that is, the Cabinet. We have a similar -provision in clause 27 of this Bill, which says - </para>

          <para>- I think that the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> contains some good points. I have no desire to embarrass the Minister or the Department, or to say hard things with regard to its administration, unless I can justify them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> has claimed that the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> would destroy the responsibility of the Defence Department, but I would remind him that under the Public Service Act the Commissioner, in his relation to the Minister, is practically a Board of Advice. If it was a good thing to take that course in the case of the Public Service, surely it might also be taken in the case of a Department which is charged with enormous responsibility. Notwithstanding all that has been said both here and outside, I cannot shut my eyes to the fact that there is need for drastic reform in its administration, especially when we recollect that it is the largest spending Department in the Commonwealth. Quite recently I had to break a lance with the Minister in the case of two officers who, I thought, had been unjustly treated. I objected to one man exercising the power which had been placed in the hands of the General Officer Commanding. I contended then, and I contend now, that there should ,be an expert Board, to act between the Minister and the general public. I believe that if such a Board had existed, a great deal of the friction and dissatisfaction which prevails in the Department would not exist. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sargood</inline> had a high opinion of the Council of </para>

        <para class="block">Defence in Victoria. Both inside and outside Parliament he used to urge that greater power should be intrusted to that body. On many occasions he said that it had done good work in Victoria, and he was prepared to increase its powers. There is -no doubt that it did good work, but it was hampered in regard to its recommendations.  His  testimony of its worth is entitled to receive serious consideration. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> proposes to create a Council of Advice which shall include the Minister and the General Officer Commanding. The latter is an Imperial officer, who has been lent to the Commonwealth for a few years. He came here imbued with Imperial traditions, he will leave our shores after a certain period, and take his place again in the Imperial Army. So far as I have been able to judge he has not shown that sympathy with the aims and aspirations of the Australian people which I should like to see. The Defence Force of the Commonwealth contains some officers - and if it is necessary I could name one man - who, in my opinion, could discharge the duties of the position as well as, if not better than, he is doing. </para>

            <para>- I do not wish to mention the name publicly, but when it is mentioned to the honorable senator privately I think he will concur in my opinion. If  wefail  to give that opportunity, distinguished military officers in the service of the Commonwealth will never be able to prove that they are qualified to take this high position. We have the material in the service of the Commonwealth and it should be utilized. We have this gentleman who is an Imperial officer. He may be a good man, Then we have the political head of the Department for the time being, who, in nine cases out of ten, has &#39; no intimate technical knowledge in regard to military affairs to enable him to maintain a position on any point as against the General Officer Commanding. If the Minister is a strong-minded man, possessing some will-power, there is friction between him and the General Officer Commanding. Friction of that &#39; kind would be saved by having such a body as is contemplated. It is true that the Bill provides that a board may be established.

Consequently, I am led to believe that the Board of Advice is one of those things that are often put into Acts of Parliament as nothing more nor less than padding, and that the Government have no intention of carrying the proposal into effect. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> has provided for a fairly workable body. It is not equipped with legislative power. It is simply a Board of Advice. There will be at the head of the scheme the Minister for Defence, the General Officer Commanding the Commonwealth Forces, and the officer commanding the Naval Forces, and the other members of the board will be various persons including members of Parliament. I am not quite sure with regard to that latter provision. Probably it is not a wise one, unless the members selected are experts. If the Bill contemplates that such a body shall be established, let the Minister say so, and give us a clear indication of what the intentions of the Government are. It is certain that military affairs should not be left to the sweet will of the General Officer Commanding. There are elements in connexion with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson&#39;s</inline> proposal, which, it seems to me, will lead to good work being done, and therefore I intend to vote for it. </para>

          <para>-We are indebted to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> for having raised this question. He has devoted a good deal of thought to it, and the debate has brought out a good many views which are of great value. But I cannot help saying that the clause has raised false hopes or false issues. Reference has been made to South African affairs, and to the necessity of our being able to meet contingencies that may arise at a critical time. It has been said that owing to the failure of Great. Britain to cope with all the difficulties as they arose in South Africa, there was a. demand for somebody&#39;s head - somebody was to be treated as . 1 scapegoat. It has now been determined to establish a Council of Defence there. I do not know whether I am quite in order in ref erring to anything that is taking place in another part of the British Empire, but really I cannot honestly say that I think that a Council of Defence, proposed even by so august an authority as the Prime Minister of Great Britain, is a move in the right direction. I believe that every thinking man will agree with me, even if he has had no experience in military affairs, that the fault in connexion with the administration of the British army was in its deficiency of what is called the &#34; brain of an army.&#34; That means that if a country wants to have an efficient army it must possess a well-organized, sound, and thoroughly-equipped Intelligence Department. The proposed Board of Advice, as I understand it, will consist of civilians and others, who willcollect evidence ; whereas, what is wanted is a thoroughly wellorganized, systematic, well-thought-out plan for constituting an Intelligence Department inside the Defence Department. The Intelligence Departmentshouldbecomposed of those who will be not only the right hand men of the General Officer Commanding, but who will be able to give satisfactory information to the Government when required. If a country starves the intelligence branchof its army, as it has been stated the Intelligence Department in Great Britain was starved, it can expect nothing but failure.What took place previous to! the South African war ? There was a demand for &#163;2,000 a year, to be spent with the object of obtaining intelligence with regard to South Africa. But the Intelligence Department was only allowed to spend &#163;100. If. a country starves the brain of its army, how can it expect anything but disaster? If we do the same thing here, the sameresult will follow. To have a good Intelligence Department is of far more importance than to carry out a proposal which I fear is opposed to that which is essential to an Anglo-Saxon community like ours, and that is, government centred in and controlled by responsible Ministers. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator STANIFORTH</inline>SMITH (Western Australia). - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson&#39;s</inline> new clause proposes to establish a body which will be of a non-party character. This body will receive and review the recommendations of the General Officer Commanding and the Naval Commandant in respect of the organization, administration, and financial policy of the defence forces. Such a proposal is worthy of our most serious consideration. Of course there are many reasons that can be adduced by Ministers for the present state of affairs, but it must be admitted that the existing condition of our defences is most unsatisfactory and chaotic: We find the General Officer Commanding stating at a public meeting in Adelaide that if we had to send an army to certain portions of Australia, we should have to send them without arms. We are providing a large body of militia, but we have not sufficient arms and ammunition for them. I believe that if war broke out, and it were necessary to put our soldiers into the field, there would not be enough ammunition to last a week. We talk of the unpreparedness  of Great Britain for her wars, but her condition would .be a mere circumstance to ours in a time of emergency. We should simply be in a hopeless state of muddle. </para>

Another matter mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> was that there ought to be some continuity of policy. At the present time a particular policy lasts as long as a particular Ministry lasts. A new Minister  comes in, and alters the whole policy vitally. It is remarkable what very little power Parliament has regarding the regulation of our military and naval affairs. It is true that we do not want to discuss the smaller questions, but we have very little control over the large issues. This Bill is a machinery Bill. It lays down some of the broad principles with regard to defence, but it does not state the number of militia or the number of permanent men who are to be employed ; it does not say what forces shall be increased or decreased in any particular line. The only possible way in which we can deal, with that aspect of our defence is upon the Estimates. But the Estimates are brought in at the end of the session, and are often hurried through without receiving the consideration to which their&#39; importance entitles them. In Great Britain they have recently been giving the fullest consideration to the matter of defence, and the authorities now seem to be of opinion that some such board as that proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> is absolutely necessary. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> thinks that the proposal would not be a success. But the British Navy has been the best managed arm of the service in Great Britain. The British Admiralty system is one that the other nations of the world have copied. The navy has been controlled by a Board of Admiralty, composed, I understand, of. some people who are not necessarily actively, engaged in the navy. There we have an. instance where a board system has proved itself to be an admirable method of management. If that system is a good one with regard to the navy  I believe it will also be effective with respect to the army. The defects of the present system of control are obvious. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> haspointed out that previous to the war in South Africa the Intelligence Department was only allowed to spend &#163;100&#39; in collecting information, whereas it ought to have spent &#163;2,000. If there were a board to consider such matters, such a mistake of policy would not have been likely to occur. Major-General Hutton is, I believe, an exceedingly able and capable officer. .He is very zealous in the discharge of his duties, and does his very best for the forces. But he is essentially a military man. He looks at matters entirely from the point of view of a military man. I believe if it were said to him, &#34; You can do what you like, and we will vote you the money,&#34; his idea would be. to turn Australia into one armed military, camp. He would adopt German methods at once. He believes in professional soldiers, and I do not think that he cares much about our cadets and rifle clubs, which, in the opinion of most of us, are a most important means of defence for Australia. A clause such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> suggests will more accurately interpret Australian feeling than will an Imperial officer who believes only in professional soldiers. I have said that Major-General Hutton has not shown much enthusiasm for our cadet corps and rifle clubs. We had in the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Frederick</inline> Sargood a most enthusiastic supporter of those movements, aman to whom Victoria owes more than to anyone else for the establishment of rifleclubs  and cadets, and that State occupies the premier position in the Commonwealth in this respect. These branches of defence are now starved, because the policy adopted appears to be to go in extensively for militia, and not tq bother so much about volunteers, rifle clubs, and cadet corps. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer,</inline> in a most excellent speech the other day, pointed out that we, in Australia, surrounded by the sea, on an island continent, were going to places like Switzerland and Canada to seek models which we should adopt. Switzerland is really in the highway of the armies of the old world,&#39; and it is necessary that every man in that country shall be prepared to fight if Switzerland is to remain neutral, and is not to be involved in European conflagrations. Canada has a powerful nation alongside of her, and a nation with whom it is possible she may be engaged in war. But we in Australia are placed in such a position that  we do not require all the expenditure proposed with regard to what I call our third line of defence. We should rather follow the example of Great Britain in these matters. We are adopting a totally wrong course in dealing with expenditure upon our different lines of defence. We propose to expend &#163;880,000 on defence- &#163;200,000 on sea defence, &#163;60,000 on forts, and &#163;600,000 on our third line of defence, a line of defence which, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Zeal</inline> has pointed out, will probably never be required. I think that the policy adopted should be exactly the reverse of that. We are creating in Australia an army which will probably never be required, and which at the present time is absolutely unarmed and unfit to take the field. We have not enough ammunition in Australia to last a year for service purposes, or to enable us to continue a fight for three days. </para>

          <para>- I shall occupy very little time in speaking upon this proposal. I am oldfashioned enough as a politician to believe in the principle of responsible Government, and to believe that we ought not to hand the business of government over to commissions and committees scattered over the length and breadth of the country. What is the use of having Ministers if there is always to be somebody behind whom they can shelter themselves? If my honorable and learned friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake,</inline> commits a <inline font-style="italic">faux</inline><inline font-style="italic">pas</inline> in the management of his Department, he must take the consequences of it in his capacity as a responsible Minister, and I imagine that the honorable and learned senator will not be found so deficient in military zeal or in constitutional law, as to seek to evade his responsibility by thrusting it upon some inferior authority. I should be quite prepared to support a proposal on the lines submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson,</inline> if we had not already agreed to clause 27, which makes distinct provision for a Board of Advice. </para>

            <para>- We have also in clause 120 provided that the GovernorGeneral shall have power to make regulations in respect of the board, and those regulations, when framed, must come before Parliament for consideration. The composition of the board will not be known until the regulations are made public, and if it is found to be unsatisfactory to Parliament we can veto the board&#39;s suggestion. The proposal is experimental so far as the Commonwealth and the greater  mumber  of the States are concerned. I recognise the advantage of clause 27, as against a hardandfast line laid down by statute. It will enable Parliament to take exception to the board as constituted if it is not deemed satisfactory. </para>

            <para>- If the board is not constituted, and if in the opinion of the majority in Parliament there is occasion for it to be constituted, we shall be able to take such steps as will induce the Ministry to take the necessary action. When action is taken by the Government, whether by consent or by compulsion, if either House of Parliament does not approve of the course proposed it may be altered or sent back to the Government for review. Meanwhile I think that the power of alteration under this Bill, which is greater by regulation than it would be by statute, would give Parliament a freer hand than would the new clause proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson,</inline> As  the proposal in each case is experimental, and as the right of intervention by Parliament is more ample under the proposal of the Bill than under that submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson,</inline> I shall vote against the proposed new clause. I shall do so, as I have said, not because I do not think that a Council of Advice may do very good service - and there seems to be a tendency in that direction in the old country - but because I believe in the principle of Ministerial responsibility, and I do not believe in too much amateur tinkering with what is distinctly a technical and professional subject. There never is a discussion in the Commonwealth Parliament, or in any Parliament of the States, upon military or naval matters that does not disclose a very serious paucity of knowledge respecting technical details on the part of a large number of the members. It is not to be expected that a civilian can make himself master of the intricacies of a professional business such as soldiering. I may profess to know a little about citizen soldiering ; but, on the other hand, I profess to know absolutely nothing that would warrant me in attempting to guide the administration of naval matters. A naval man will occupy exactly the same position with respect to military administration. We know that artillery officers will plead entire ignorance of cavalry work, and cavalry officers will freely condemn the line work of Tommy Atkins. When we find that men in different branches, who are eminent in their own spheres of work, are not experts all round, I do not see how we can expect a civilian to achieve that which a professional man is unable to achieve. Besides we have the professional man here, and the General Officer Commanding is here not as a clerk to the Minister for Defence, or as a maidofallwork  to a Board of Advice, but as a man whose counsel is to be taken and depended upon. To put it bluntly, what do we pay this officer a handsome emolument for if it is not to secure an authoritative opinion and authoritative guidance ? I hope fiat the Board of Advice contemplated in this Bill will be appointed to deal with, matters that are outside, or that lie between, the actual military and naval services and the public - such matters as the supply of ammunition and kindred questions, to which Senators Matheson and Smith have referred. While speaking on this subject I may inform the Minister for Defence that if he makes inquiries in New South Wales he will find that in that State, at the present time, there is little or no blank cartridge even for training purposes. It is true that blank cartridge is not of much value in war time, and I do not attach very great importance to the matter on that account. I hope that there will be something at the end of the powder we have to burn in war time ; but if we desire to train men in field operations, especially under the new system in vogue of extended movements over rough country, we shall make but a very poor show if we cannot give the men a few cartridges to burn. The proposed Board of Advice will, no doubt, be useful if it gives the Minister of the day a little &#34; stiffening &#34; in facing those who desire to reduce the expenditure on the Defence Force, thus impairing its efficiency. I do not desire extravagance, but I urge, as warmly&#34; as does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> or any other honorable senator, that the necessities of the service should be adequately met. Otherwise, we shall be wasting &#163;700,000 a year, because it is of no use carrying on an inefficient service, or, in the old phrase, &#34; spoiling the ship for a ha&#39;p&#39;orth of tar.&#34; </para>

          <para>- I intend to support the adoption of the proposed new clause. It is not necessary for me to say much in support of my vote after the very excellent reasons put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson. Senator Neild,</inline> who has had a vast and varied military experience, evidently believes in some Council of Defence, but not in the particular council proposed. The difficulty about clause 27 is that it is too indefinite, merely providing that the. Governor-General &#34; may &#34; create a Board of Advice. </para>

            <para>- We are not here to consider what is, or has been, the usual policy, but to consider, from a commonsense point of view, what course shall be adopted now. Our Defence Force is based upon the idea that it is a citizen force, and it is extremely desirable that some citizens, occupying responsible positions in connexion with the government of the country, should have a voice in arranging our defence affairs. The action recently taken in the old country shows that such a course is desirable even where there are professional soldiers ; but in Australia it is absolutely necessary that the advice of prominent citizens should be sought, in order to assure volunteers that the system will be carried out in consonance with our national ideas. The fact that members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives will, if the clause be accepted, be eligible for seats on the Council of Defence will create amongst us an interest in defence matters. With one or two exceptions, members of Parliament usually content themselves with criticising the proposed expenditure ; and if the Minister for Defence proposes to spend &#163;700,000, we may reduce the amount to &#163;500,000. </para>

            <para>- That may be. I am anxious for a little more light and information ; because knowledge is a material aid to the proper management of any concern. Perhaps the strongest reason in support of the proposed clause is that purely official control of the army has been a lamentable failure everywhere. We all know how the Crimean War was bungled, and how bad administration in India led to the Mutiny ; and we have been witnesses of the dreadful bungling in connexion with the war in South Africa. Wherever Britain has been at war she has succeeded, not because of her good military organization, but in spite of her bad organization ; and now the authorises at home have awakened to the idea that something in the shape of a Council of Defence is necessary. I do not advocate the new clause because I believe it is proper that we should follow on the same lines as Great Britain, but because it is a proposal likely to lead to better administration. In a force in which the citizen element enters so largely, it is desirable to have civilians advising the professional men. We know what happened to France in that memorable war with Germany. The responsible Ministers of France told the French people that there were so many efficient soldiers and rifles, and so much ammunition, that the commissariat was in perfect&#39; order, and that in so many days the French troops would be in Berlin ; but .. all those statements were falsified. I need not multiply instances, but I believe that in almost every country in the world where there is anything in the shape of a military system, we shall find the same conditions prevailing. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> objects to the new clause on the ground that it would destroy Ministerial responsibility. That would not be the effect, because the clause is intended only to assist Ministers in bearing the responsibility which they have to Parliament and the country. The- last word in regard to expenditure would still remain with Parlia-  ment, with this difference, that Ministers and Parliament would be advised in each House by two members. It would be an immense advantage in discussing defence matters to have amongst us two senators who took an active personal interest, and, as members of the Council of Defence, possessed all necessary information. </para>

            <para>- In the conflict of opinion we should very likely be able to arrive at the truth, whereas now, if we want any information, the Minister for Defence shuts up like an oyster. Even when we get information we do not know whether it can be depended upon ; it may be only half information, and we know what is said about half truths. A Council of Defence would have a tendency to lift the whole question of defence administration above party considerations - all could agree to take a course absolutely independent of ordinary party considerations. </para>

On the whole, I think that the Committee will act wisely in agreeing to the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson.</inline> I believe that a Council of Defence constituted on these lines would be of immense advantage to the community, and would help the Minister for Defence, the General Officer Commanding, and both Houses of the Parliament. </para>

          <para>- The proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> contains some  good points. It cannot be got rid of by saying that it would away with Ministerial responsibility. The strongest part of his argument was that which referred to the cutting down of the Defence Estimates in another place. If I recollect rightly, certain parties in another place had two cuts at the Defence Estimates, and knocked off about &#163;163,000. That reduction must have made a drastic change in the policy of the Minister and of the Department, and must have upset all the calculations and advice of the General Officer Commanding. </para>

            <para>- 1 am not suggesting that the Government of the Commonwealth should have acted in a similar way. But in England the practice is different. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Brodrick  moved in Committee that the vote for ammunition was insufficient, his motion was carried against the Government, and next morning their resignation was sent in. That is a very good instance of Ministerial responsibility. In the second session of this Parliament, the Military Estimates were, to use an old saying, &#34;knocked to pot,&#34; and yet nothing happened. I do not suggest that anything ought to have happened, but I submit that, in this instance, Ministerial responsibility was a bogy. I contend that if there had been a Council of Defence, properly constituted, such an event could not have happened. </para>

            <para>- I do not believe that it could have happened. The General Officer Commanding would have put forward his policy ; it would have been considered by the Minister for Defence ; the Council of Defence would have conferred for hours over such an important matter as the Defence Estimates of the Commonwealth, devoted all their talents and experience to the study of the subject, and reported to Parliament. The other House would have had the report of eight or nine experienced men who had given deep thought to the state of the Estimates. I do not think that the Labour Party or any other party in the House would have been able to cut down the Defence Estimates as they did if they had been provided with a responsible report from a body of expert advisers. Certainly the proposed Council of Defence is not to be constituted of as many experts as it ought to be. I think it ought to include one member from each House, the General Officer Commanding, both military and naval, senior artillery officer, senior militia officer, and senior volunteer officer. Constituted in that way, every branch of the Defence Force would be represented ; more than two States would be represented. The General Officer Commanding would attend the meetings of the Council, presided over by the Minister, and in nine cases out of ten - perhaps in nineteen cases out of twenty - they would practically agree. The Minister would have to point ont the financial position pf the Commonwealth, and to indicate what he could cany in the House. I feel quite certain that any members of the Council who might hold extreme views would moderate them. The Minister and the General Officer  Cammanding  would exercise all the weight of their positions. To a certain extent every member of the Council would exercise his influence. No Council, constituted of military, naval, volunteer, and financial experts, could issue a report without it carrying great weight with the Parliament. Itis quite evident, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> admits,, that the practice in the old country is tending in this direction. If, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> said, -brain is needed to organize,, administer, and look after this enormousDepartment, it will be just as well to employ more than one brain. Should the Council at any time make a recommendation of which the Minister and the Cabinet did not approve, he would have to accept the responsibility of not carrying out its policy.. The Parliament would not be tied by the report of the Council ; it could do as it liked. It would not do away with Ministerial responsibility. Could there be a more terrible upsettal  of the policy of Ministers than the reduction of the Defence Estimatesby the other House last session <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> It simply knocked off &#163;163,000. It did not indicatein any way how that amount should be saved. There was no continuity of policy, and necessarily the Defence Force suffered in many directions. If there is a shortage of rifles and ammunition it is due to the looseand irresponsible way in which the Military Estimates were dealt with in another place. I support the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> ;. but, if he and the Minister can agree upon an improved constitution for the Council of Defence, I shall be quite willing to fall in with their views. </para>

        <para> <inline font-weight="bold">Senator WALKER</inline> (New South Wales). - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> has said a great many things which I had intended to say; and, perhaps, in a much better way than I could havedone. It was the extraordinary action of thelate Minister for Defence, in allowing his Estimates to be spoiled as they were in another place, which drew my attention to the necessity of constituting a Council of Advice. Clause 27, which provides fora Board of Advice, is permissive, not obligatory. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> said very truly that what was wanted in South Africa was brain. I have read in an old book that &#34; in the multitude of counsellors thereis  safety,&#34;and I have also been reminded by an honorable senator that &#34; too many cooks spoil the broth.&#34; If we could insure a succession of enlightened despots, no doubt despotism would be the best tiling for an army. But even in Russia, one good Czar is not always followed by another. We must recognise the facts as they are. We have to preserve parliamentary control of the Defence Force. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barrett</inline> seems to think that the General Officer Commanding has not much sympathy with the aspirations of Australians. For some years he was at the head of our forces in New South Wales, and he did splendid work. I believe that, if he had not been so much hampered by the want of means, he would have been able to make greater improvements in our Defence Force than he has done. I should have thought that the Government would be only too happy to agree to the institution of a buffer, such as a Council of Advice. The defence of the Commonwealth is a national matter, not a party matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> made a very sensible allusion to the necessity for creating an Intelligence Department. No doubt a Council of Advice would suggest the establishment of an Intelligence Department properly officered. It is proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Matheson</inline> that the Council of Defence, as he calls it, should obtain expert advice on any question arising out of its recommendations. I certainly agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> that the constitution of the Council could be improved. Evidently the Imperial authorities have come to the conclusion that there ought to be a Council of Advice in connexion with the British Army. The Board of Admiralty is not wholly constituted of naval experts. I have a distinct recollection that at one time the Bight Honorable W. H. Smith, a bookseller and stationer, was First Lord of the Admiralty. </para>

            <para>- I hope that in future the Government will show their faith in Ministerial responsibility when amendments are. proposed upon the Defence Estimates. I hope that they will stick to their proposals, and have the pluck to resign if they are defeated, so as to let others take their places. I was perfectly ashamed when &#163;160,000 was knocked off the Defence Estimates for one year. I believe there is a general feeling throughout the Commonwealth forces that they were not fairly treated in that matter. When we have &#39; a Council of. Defence established, I hope the members of it will pay more attention than is now paid to coastal defence. I believe in having thoroughly efficient, coastal defence. It is largely to coastal defence that we shall have to look for our safety. Australia is a huge island, and the very fact of its immensity of size makes a Council of Defence necessary. How can any one man know the requirements of an enormous territory like ours ? For these and other reasons I. intend to support the new clause. </para>

          <para>- The objection to the proposed new clause, is that it is unnecessary, seeing that commissions are in constant demand, and that it is very rarely an officer wishes to retire. The only case I could conceive in which the new clause would operate - and this only proves how objectionable the clause is - would be that of an officer who had committed some offence, and who might exercise his statutory right to resign before the charge could be investigated. </para>

      <para class="block">Honorable senators know that I entertain strong opinions on the drink question, and I should be recreant to my principles if on this, the first opportunity presented in Commonwealth ( legislation, I did not endeavour to carry those principles into effect. The new clause contains no revolutionary proposal, but simply follows the example set by Canada and America. As a matter of fact the new clause is almost a transcript of the resolution which was passed by both Houses of the United States Legislature. On this occasion I shall not so much express my opinions as the views of authorities in England and America, who are more competent than myself to speak on the subject; and I hope thereby to shorten the discussion. In America, in 18S9, there was an amendment of the law known as the &#34; Anti-canteen Amendment.&#34; It was declared by the army authorities - some of whom evinced a bitter opposition - that the resolution did not express that which was claimed ; p.nd, therefore, it was not put into effect. Their action evoked an animated discussion among the people, a further appeal was made to Congress, and in January, 1901, the law was amended. By a majority of 159 to 5 1 in the House of Representatives, and a majority of &#34;34 to 15 in the Senate - a majority of more than, two-thirds in each case - the following provision was enacted :  - </para>
      <para>The sale of or dealing in beer, wine, or any intoxicating liquors by any person in any post,, exchange, or canteen or army transport, or upon any premises used for military purposes by the United States is hereby prohibited. The Secretary for War is hereby directed to carry the provisions of this section into full force and effect. </para>
      <para class="block">That enactment is giving every satisfaction. This striking testimony from the great American Republic shows that the difficulties which are suggested in our limited field will not hold water. I ask the Committee tonotice that, notonly was the amendmentof the law carried by a large majority in each House, but that certain instructions were given to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Root,</inline> the Secretary of War, for its. enforcement.. The spirit of each House had been roused by the treatment of the previous decision, and so the Congress declared that the will of the nation should be obeyed. In the first instance, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Root</inline> adopted a decidedly hostile attitude; but, notwithstanding all his efforts to- defeat the law, he was compelled to carry out the will of the Congress and of the people. I hold that there is no necessity to provide intoxicating liquor in connexion with our army. That view is indorsed by the testimony of the greatest living British Generals - men who cannot be said to be teetotallers, and therefore to hold fanatical views. The best men in Great Britain as well as in America have declared that there is no necessity to provide intoxicating liquor. Distinguished soldiers like Lords Roberts, Wolseley, and Kitchener have given emphatic testimony that the British Army would be far better without a canteen than with it. The objection to the provision of a canteen for our permanent force is that it offers facilities to the men to drink. It exercises an evil effect upon the young recruits. If they have not already formed the drinking habit, it is soon acquired, and many lives are lost which otherwise would have been saved. We all remember that prior to the return of the soldiers from South Africa to the old country, Lord Roberts made one of the most fervent appeals which have ever been made to the British public in this direction. He entreated his countrymen not to tempt the returning soldiers with intoxicating liquor. The Imperial Government would have shown a noble example to the nation in this respect by excluding the canteens from military service. It would have imposed upon the men the necessity for exercising selfrestraint. They would have formed a higher conception of their duty, and under no circumstances, I think, would they have disgraced the King&#39;s uniform. I believe that in almost every State of the Commonwealth, Sunday trading in liquor is prohibited. But what do we find in the case of camps of exercise <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> They are not subject to the licensing law of the State. The sale of liquor is carried on to a very large extent, and the  will of the people is practically defied. The evil of the canteen does not exist to the same extent in Australia, but in other parts of the world its effect on the troops is very demoralizing. This &#34;innocent soldier&#39;s club,&#34; as it is called, is a purveyor of poison, and the policy of the States is defeated. Even if my proposal should not be accepted, the Government ought to consider and respect the laws of the States in framing the regulations for the control of the canteen. I propose to quote from the greatest military authorities in both hemispheres on the evil effects of intoxicating liquor. Speaking of the approaching return of the British troops from South Africa to the old country, .Lord Wolseley, when Commander-in-Chief, said - </para>
      <para>The time draws near when we may hope to welcome home many of the gallant soldiers who have so nobly fought our battles for us in South Africa. The reception will, I know, be cordial, and it is this assured cordiality that impels me to ask those wishing to do them honour to refrain, while extending to them a hearty welcome, from offering intoxicating liquor. Our soldiers are recruited from all classes of  Her  Majesty&#39;s subjects, and only differ from their brothers in civil life by the habits of discipline the}&#39; have acquired in the army. Like all of us, they are open to temptation. Many of them must soon resume the occupations and positions their employers have patriotically kept open for them. Others will have to seek for new situations, and will require a helping hand in doing so. It is, therefore, most important that all should endeavour to preserve a good name for steadiness and sobriety before entering upon their civil work. I trust that our greeting to the brave soldiers returning from this war may be something better than an incitement to excessive drinking, and that all will remember that whoever encourages  them in this, fan from being their friend, is really their worst enemy. </para>
      <para class="block">That testimony to the evils of the canteen comes from a British General who cannot be said to hold fanatical opinions. Field Marshal Lord Roberts, whose name will yet stand out in the history of the nation even more boldly than it does to-day, takes a similar stand on this question. Through the medium of not merely one, but many newspapers throughout the United Kingdom, he implored his countrymen in earnest language not to offer any temptation to the returning soldiers to drink. He said - </para>
      <para>Will you kindly allow me through the medium of your paper, to make an appeal to my countrymen and women upon a subject I have very much at heart, and which has been occupying my thoughts for some time past ? All classes in the United Kingdom have shown such keen interest in the army serving in South Africa, and have been so munificent in their efforts to supply every need of that army, that I feel sure they must be eagerly looking forward for its return, and to giving our brave soldiers and sailors the hearty welcome they so well deserve when they get back to their native land ? It is about the character of this welcome and the effect it may have upon the reputation of the troops, whom I have been so proud to command, that I am anxious, and that I venture to express the opinion. My sincere hope is that the welcome may not take the form of treating the men to stimulants in the public- houses or in the streets, and thus lead into excesses which must tend to degrade those whom the nation delights to honour, and to lower the soldier of the Queen in the eyes of the world - that world which has watched with undisguised admiration the grand work they have performed for their Sovereign and their country. From the very kindness of their hearts, their innate politeness and their gratitude for the welcome accorded them, it will be difficult for the men to refuse what is offered to them by their too generous friends. I, therefore, beg earnestly that the British public will refrain from tempting my gallant comrades, but will rather aid them to uphold the splendid reputation they have won for the Imperial army...... </para>
      <para>I know how keen my fellow-subjects will be to show their appreciation of the upright and honorable bearing, as well as gallantry, of our sailors and soldiers, and I would entreat them, in return for all that these grand men have done for them, to abstain from any action that might bring the smallest discredit upon those who have so worthily upheld the credit of their country. I <inline font-style="italic">am</inline> induced to make this appeal from having read with great regret, that when our troops were leaving England, and passing through the streets of Loudon, their injudicious friends pressed liquor upon them, and shoved bottles of spirits into their hands and pockets - a mode of &#34;speeding the parting,&#34; friend which resulted in some very distressing, discreditable scenes. I fervently hope there may be no such scenes to mar the brightness of the welcome home. </para>
      <para class="block">Those very clear and emphatic words from Lord Roberts deserve to be preserved, and that is the reason why I have quoted them. On active service be had seen the evil effects of the canteen, and that is the reason why he addressed to his fellow countrymen those brave and noble  words.  The name of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> White is well-known in our military history, and his opinions on this question deserve to be considered and respected.

Its ill effects were shown not only by moral deterioration but indirectly and in extreme cases. by physical decrepitude.  He could distinctly trace nearly all the crime in the British Army abroad to drinking to excess. </para>

      <para>When he was Commander-in-Chief in India he was anxious to bring home to the minds of officers and men how strong a deterrent influence abstinence from alcohol exercised in saving men from getting into trouble. He found many commanding officers and others inclined to belittle the efforts to introduce a higher standard of temperance into the army and even to oppose it. They threw doubts upon the statistics shown by temperance branches as cooked for the purpose. To impress these and others, he ordered returns to be furnished officially showing the percentage of offences committed by abstainers and nonabstainers, the result realizing what he had hoped to establish. </para>

        <para>Whilst in India he was  President  of the Army Temperance Association. The returns applied to a total of 69,488 men, of whom 20,833 were abstainers and 48,655 non-abstainers. The convictions by court martial in 1899 were 1,724, or 132 less than the previous year. Of these 97 were abstainers, and 1 ,627 non-abstainers. Summary punishment for insubordination in the whole British Army in India numbered only 3,812, as against 5,250 in 1898. Of these 3,812. only 514 were committed by abstainers, whilst the non-abstainers numbered 3,258. Some commanding officers objected to these statistics as classing those excellent soldiers who take liquor, but never exceed, with the majority, thus putting them in a sort of ethical pillory, but he thought this was attributing a non-existent and hypersensitiveness to those good fellows, our soldiers. </para>

        <para>When I was with the troops in South Africa, awaiting the sending out of reinforcements from England after the reverses at Isandula and  Rorke&#39;s  Drift, we were kept seven months without grog, and during that time not one man was sent up for punishment. But when we got to Dundee, where a famous buttle was fought during the recent war, the men were able to get liquor from the stores, and the first night after our entrance into the town there were thirty-seven in the guard-room for drunkenness. Thenceforth, until we marched into  Zululand again,  there were several confinements each day from the same cause. I determined then that if I had the chance to put an end to the canteen system on active service I would do so. </para>
      </quote>
      <para class="block">Those of us who know <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Page</inline> will agree that he is no fanatic upon the liquor question. He has known nearly all the phases of Army life, and is quite as strong as the other authorities I have quoted in regard to the abolition of the canteen. Now I will turn to America, and quote a few statements from authorities with regard to the influence of the canteen upon the Army. In a report of the United States Secretary for War for December, 1900, I find, summarizing the particulars, that thirty-five officers declared the canteen detrimental to military service, forty declared it to be prejudicial to discipline, twenty say that it has increased drunkenness, and thirty-six declare outright in favour of prohibition. I have here quite a number of statements made by distinguished officers in favour of the - course I am advocating. I need not quote them all, but I will mention a few instances. There are one or two striking pieces of testimony which I wish to emphasize, because I think j they ought to be considered in the course of this discussion. One officer says that in spite of the efforts to prevent excess, drunkenness is encouraged by the canteen. These opinions are from men who live among soldiers, and who know what the influence of the canteen is. They see its ill effects. Another officer says - </para>
      <quote>
        <para>It is too late to refuse a soldier more when he is beginning to show the effect of it. He is irritated by such refusal, and at many posts will simply walk a few hundred yards to some saloon where there are no restrictions..... I have not infrequently been forced to court martial soldiers for drunkenness, when 1 had every reason to believe they had become drunk at the canteen. </para>
      </quote>
      <para>I am now quoting from the appendix of the report of the Secretary of State for War of the United States. That testimony must, I think, bear weight. </para>
      <para>The canteen at a post is a temptation to many who would not take the trouble to go outside the&#34; post for a drink. This is especially the case with young men who have not formed the habit of drinking ; even men of temperate habits might of ten be prevented from getting drunk if intoxicants were not so conveniently placed within their reach. </para>
      <para class="block">We find the same testimony from outside. Although elaborate laws may be passed to suppress drunkenness, the question as to when a man is drunk, or half-drunk, or in any stage of intoxication, is extremely difficult to .settle. The result is that, wherever liquor is sold, no matter whether a person, who wants to buy it is clearly under the influence of drink or not, those in charge of the canteen will give to him the drink which enslaves and intoxicates. The same officer says - </para>
      <quote>
        <para>The plea that you can limit the amount of beer sold to a man in the canteens, is fallacious. The bar-tender who will refuse a man beer when he thinks he has had enough, will, I suspect, be hard to find. </para>

        <para>I don&#39;t think much of the beer canteen. The theory that the soldier needs a beer canteen to keep him from going to outside saloons for something stronger is all wrong. There is nothing in. it. On the contrary, a great many young soldiers who are not accustomed to drink, contract drinking habits at these canteens, and are ruined. There is no need whatever for intoxicating drinks at these canteens, and it will be n good thing for the army if they are abolished. </para>

        <para>Above all, there are many young men who enlist in the army to whom the very name of saloon is offensive. These young men have been taught not to drink by their parents, and if liquor were barred out of the post they would not be tempted ; but the canteen, distinguished as it is from the offensive saloon, is a constant temptation, and ifc is little wonder that many of them yield. In fact, among the hundreds of letters, which I have received from soldiers&#39; mothers, the main point of objection raised against the canteen is its alleged attractiveness which its advocates have so dwelt upon. Clothed in a pleasant guise, the mothers fear far more from this so-called Soldiers&#39; Club than they do from the open saloon. </para>

      <para class="block">As I said at the outset, I feel very strongly on &#39;this question. The presence of the canteen is, and has been, dangerous in eveiy other part of the world, as proved by the testimony I have submitted. In the course of our daily life we have all seen the evil effects of drink, and happy is the home which has escaped its influence. Very few of us can say that strong drink has not exercised its deadly . effects, in some form, on those who are near and dear. We all know good, men who have &#34;gone under&#34; in consequence of drink ; and even as I speak I can recall the faces of men . who have gone to their long account simply because of the allurements of one of the greatest vices of our race and country. Although my proposal may not be carried to-day I believe that, with the spread of education, and in view of the testimony we have on every band, the time will come when restriction, such as I now advocate, will be carried into effect in the Commonwealth. Feeling that the course I am taking is the wisest and best for the community, I venture to submit -this clause. </para>

          <para>- I wish to address myself to only one phase of the question, a phase, which, I think, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barrett</inline> has overlooked. We can all agree with a very . great deal of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barrett</inline> has so well said, and at the same time not be able to go so far as to support the proposed new clause. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barrett</inline> has given us a great number of deplorable instances of intemperance  in the army ; but I think that most, of the circumstances which he describes may be provided against by proper regulation. There is power under the Bill for the -establishment and conduct of canteens, *nd that power is sufficient to enable us to suppress to a very great extent the abuses to which he has referred. While the honorable senator&#39;s address was almost all devoted to the condemnation of intemperance in the army, the clause which he proposes provides for absolute prohibition. From information I have received from commanding officers, who recognise that intemperance is one of the greatest foes of discipline, I understand that canteens under proper regulations, where good, sound liquor is sold, not only do not promote intemperance, but prevent it to a great extent. When there is such a canteen, the soldier, after his walk about town, returns to barracks, has his nip, and goes to bed. Whereas, if he is a man who is disposed to take some drink, and there is no canteen; he is forced to the outside public-houses, where, free from restraint, he drinks bad liquor, and instead of returning to barracks at the proper time, and in a proper condition, arrives late, and soon finds himself in the guard-house. It may be that the soldier does not return to barracks at all. </para>

          <para>- The question which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barrett</inline> has to consider is whether we cannot, by regulation, prevent the abuses -and evils he has pointed out without going to the extent of saying that a soldier shall not be supplied with a glass of drink, if he so desires, in barracks. The passing of a clause of this kind cannot be expected to have the effect of instantaneously converting the whole of the forces to temperance principles. There would still be a great number of men who, though not intemperate, would desire liquor now and then, and would have it, and if they could not get it in barracks would get it elsewhere. For that reason I feel myself bound to oppose the amendment. </para>

            <para>-There is absolutelyno parallel between the two cases. We have to decide not whether there shall be &#34; beer or no beer,&#34; but whether the soldier shall be able to get his stimulants in barrack canteens, which are regulated and controlled, or whether he shall be obliged to go outside where no regulations can apply. As between the two, the proper institution is the canteen. I should be only too willing to discuss the broader question raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barrett,</inline> but that does not arise on the present occasion. I am not quite clear that we can make a man a good soldier by depriving him of his beer. After all, we have to take into consideration the characteristics of the race ; and I have just been reminded that one of the greatest soldiers the . world ever saw said that two of the best fighting men in the world were a half-tight Irishman and a half-starved Scotchman. </para>

I have the greatest respect for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barrett</inline> and his principles ; but in my opinion it is much better that any drinking establishment in the vicinity of a camp should be under military rule and management, than that publicans, under State laws, should be granted licenses enabling them to create scenes of drunkenness that would not otherwise occur. For that reason, if for no other, I shall have to oppose the proposed new clause. All who are acquainted with military matters know that there are what are termed &#34;wet &#34;and &#34;dry &#34; canteens. At the former, tinned meats and other commodities are sold, but the two are usually conducted together ; and it is much better that all such institutions should be under military rule than in the hands of publicans, who simply endeavour to make as much as they can out of men who are thus compelled to obtain their drink more or less surreptitiously. </para>

            <para>- It is absolutely impossible to exercise such control. In scores of instances in America it has been shown that the canteens are positively dangerous, and yet those canteens are all under military control and regulation. Whoever heard of a man being controlled in the matter of what he drinks? For very many years efforts have been made to give the State control of the liquor traffic ; hut does not the liquor traffic get the benefit in every Act? Do my honorable friends not know that a man who is trying to keep off the drink, and who has been absolutely sober for days or weeks, may, by the mere sight of a friend taking a glass in a canteen, be driven back to drunkenness ? From having one glass of beer in the canteen a man may go outside and resume his intemperate habits. If honorable senators have read works dealing with the cure of intemperance, they know that such instancescan be counted by the thousand. I undertake to say that of every thousand soldiersthere will be found scores whom one glass would drive to intemperance. It is idle to say that we can regulate the drink consumed in a canteen, or that it is much better for a soldier to get drink in barracks than outside. Drink consumed in a  canteen  under regulation and under the eye of officers may give a thirst for more. I hold in my hand an extract from the remarks of an American General of forty years&#39; experience. It is as follows : - </para>

        <para>The canteen stands as a constant invitation tothe total abstainer to drink, as a temptation tothe moderate drinker to drink more, and as a convenience to the drunkard to load up on beer when he has not the means to obtain anything stronger. </para>
        <para class="block">I defy <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> or any one else todeny one word of that statement. Honorable members are insisting on bringing our men into temptation, when we find Lord Roberts and other authorities making endeavours in exactly the opposite direction, and urging the army* to become teetotal. I am afraid that prohibition, although it is carried out in some of the States, is little more than a dream ; but there is no dream about keeping drink out of our camps and barracks. Seeing thatdrink is the great curse of the nation and of humanity, we prefer to have soldiers who are teetotallers. Let me quote a few statistics relating to the effect of army abstinence in India, which are given under the hand of Lord Roberts, with all his great experience. In 189S there were in India 18,663 members of the Army Temperance Association, and 48,S42 nonmembers; convictions by court-martial per 1,000 were 412 amongst members of the association, and 3638, or 8 times as many, amongst the non-members ; and summary punishments for insubordination per 1,000 were 39-70 amongst the members, and 92-32 amongst the non-members. In 1897 the admissions to the hospital per 1,000 were 209 members, and 302 non-members; and convictions by court-martial per 1,000 were 5-07 amongst members, and 34&#39;34 amongst non-members. Why cannot we in this matter follow the example of Lord Roberts, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> White, and Lord Kitchener? </para>

        <para>SenatorDOBSON.- But they have to deal with human nature and the cursed drink traffic, Are we going to start the Australian Army by refusing to drill our boys, or to have any compulsion whatever, and to further enact that we must have canteens controlled by paltry regulations on paper? General Daggett, the American General whom I have already quoted, also says - </para>
        <para>It -was no unusual thing to find a company - I commanded a company more than twenty years - on inspection, with a majority uf its members more or less under the influence of liquor, bub not so much as to subject them to punishment ; but they could not perform their duty as well as they could if they had not been drinking. </para>
        <para class="block">I believe that some old hands in the permanent force have become almost perpetual soakers. If we make no effort to remove the temptation from their way it will be a great blot on our military system. I regret that it is too late in the afternoon for honorable senators to fully express their opinions. I should be very glad to hear some opinions expressed on the other side, and to answer them. If we cannot have a debate on this question - if we . are of opinbn that men cannot be made sober by Act of Parliament,let us help to make them sober by keeping drink out of the barracks and camps. I am told by some honorable senators, for whom I have great respect, that it is absolutely necessary to have drink in the camps. It. is said that the men would notgoto theencampments at Easter for a week or ten days unless beer and whisky were carted out. I can hardly realize that it is the case. If we are to have camps of exercise, as I hope we shall, for our soldiers between the ages of seventeen and twenty-one, is it necessary to cart out hogsheads of beer ? Are we to believe that the young men would not go to the camps unless the beer were provided ? In that case we ought to provide for compulsory drill, and insist that there shall be no beer provided. If a man cannot train to serve his country and to defend his home without having drink at his elbow, he is not fit for military service. I do not believe the statements which are made to that effect. I believe that if a poll of the men between the ages of seventeen and twentyone or twenty-five and thirty-five were taken to-morrow, the great majority would say - &#34; Keep drink away from the canteen.&#34; Believing that it is absolutely impossible to regulate the canteen, I heartily support the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barrett.</inline></para>

We are asked to agree to the reconsideration of a number of clauses, and told that we must complete the consideration of the Bill by 4 o&#39;clock in order to get a holiday next week. We do not intend to be driven iri that way. We shall discuss these questions until half past 4 o&#39;clock if necessary. There is no reason why an important Bill of this character should be rushed through the Senate. Surely there has not been any undue discussion of its clauses. We desire to know the reason why only certain clauses are to be reconsidered. We wish to reconsider the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barrett</inline> relating to the canteen, and the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> relating to the cadet corps. </para>

The Bill ought to be considered properly in its final stages. The honorable and learned senator is taking up a hostile attitude towards the Senate. He wants to have a certain number of clauses reconsidered, and to exclude other clauses which others want to have reconsidered. He wishes the  Chairman  to put the motions for reconsideration separately, in order that he may oppose the reconsideration of those clauses which he does not want to have discussed again. I could understand his attitude if time had been wasted in discussion upon this Bill, but we have treated the Government with the greatest consideration and fairness. There has been no &#34;stone-walling,&#34; and the Bill has been got through very speedily. We used to complain about being driven by the VicePresident of the Executive Council, but if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Connor</inline> used whips upon us, the Minister for Defence is scourging us with scorpions. I am inclined to think that the Bill has been rushed through too quickly. I shall vote against the recommittal of any clause if the Minister opposes the reconsideration of clauses which others want to reconsider. </para>

            <para>- But a change of circumstances may necessitate an alteration in the arrangements. There is no necessity to rush this Bill through. I respectfully suggest to the Minister, notwithstanding the arrangement made, that under the altered circumstances, seeing that a number of honorable senators desire that certain clauses shall be reconsidered, he should not thrust this little arrangement in their faces. He should consider the temper of the Committee. I had not a word to say during the afternoon, because I wanted to see the arrangement which was made carried out, but as we have nearly reached the usual adjournment hour, and it is evident that there is no time to finish the Bill, the Minister might as well be reasonable. I should have liked to discuss the amendment with regard to canteen, but refrained from doing so so as to shorten the debate. There has been no waste of time, but the business has been expedited in the most commendable manner. </para>

They know very well that I was asked to agree to an adjournment over next week, and said there would be no objection to that if this Bill was passed by the end of the present -week. That was the agreement. But it must be seen that, if that arrangement is gone back upon and this Bill is blocked in its final stages, it will look very bad in the face of any attempt being made in the future amongst ourselves to get away for a day or two.

            <para>-  The other matters are in the nature of verbal alterations which have become necessary in consequence of amendments made, or to remedy little slips. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker</inline> desires to move an amendment with reference to the oath in the interpretation clause, to make it correspond with the schedule we have inserted. In some cases I propose to make amendments to cure obvious defects. I desire to reconsider clause 17 with regard to the way in which non-commissioned officers will be appointed. I think the Committee will agree that the clause I have drafted will carry out the views I have expressed during the debate. In clause 39 there is a verbal amendment required. The amendment in clause 51 is purely verbal. I propose to omit clause 55, because we have inserted another clause to take its place. I also desire to reconsider clause SO, because SenatorNeild wishes to make a little alteration. These amendments are in the nature of a clear up, such as is necessary after  the discussion of a long Bill in Committee. There is nothing of a contentious nature to be done except with regard to the clause affecting warrant officers ; and I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> will agree with me on that point. We had plenty of time to do what was required. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> desires to have rediscussed a matter that has already been decided. </para>

We have hurried through our work. In fact I have rather regretted that we have got through the Bill so quickly.- No time has been wasted. There are a few small matters left to be attended to, and I am certain that they can be dealt with in an afternoon. Are Ministers contemplating an early dissolution?

The present understanding was that we should adjourn over the week if the work was done. But the work does not happen to be done. There is no particular urgency over this Defence Bill. We are not threatened with invasion by a foreign power just now. The measure may as well stand over for ten days or a fortnight. </para>

            <para>- I am very sorry that honorable senators are in this frame of mind, because I shall have to look upon it as a breach of faith, which will make things very hard when efforts are made to come to an arrangement in the future. I say, knowing something of parliamentary procedure, that there was nothing to prevent us from finishing our work on this Bill this afternoon. In fact the time available was more than sufficient under ordinary circumstances. We have settled every contentious matter in the Bill, and all that it is necessary to do now is to make certain small amendments, mostly of a verbal character. Though wo may, perhaps, be able to finish our work upon the Bill in two or three hours, or it may be in a day, still it is very inconvenient to delay the measure. It would be very much better to push it through and return it to the other House. There will be an unsatisfactory feeling that we might just as well have finished it to-day, and kept faith. I shall always consider that the Senate has not on this occasion kept faith with the representative of the Government. </para>

              <para>- Our Standing Orders, provide that the question - &#34; That the Senate do now. adjourn &#34; may be debated, but the Standing Orders do not make any exception to the usual rule that the debate must be relevant to the subject-matter of the motion. I admit that this is an entirely new question - it has never arisen before, and it ought to be decided once and for all. I do not say that it must be decided now, but we shall have to determine whether or not on the motion - &#34;That the Senate do now adjourn,&#34; all manner of questions may be brought under discussion. The ordinary rule is that all debate must be relevant to the motion, and the motion - &#34; That the Senate do now adjourn &#34; refers only to the question of the time to which the Senate shall sit. We have no standing order which provides that the ordinary rule shall be departed from on the motion. Whether or not it was the intention of the Senate when they passed the standing order to provide that all manner of irrelevant matter should be discussed on such a motion I cannot say ; and in my opinion that is a point which ought to be decided. I think it is for the Senate itself to decide the matter, and I shall ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> not to continue the discussion at the present moment, but to leave for settlement at some future date the question of whether or not it is competent for. members to discuss irrelevant matters on themotion - &#34;ThattheSenate donow adjourn.&#34; I ask the honorable senator to &#39;take that course in order to meet the wishes of a number of honorable senators. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator HIGGS</inline>(Queensland). - I know that some honorable senators desire to leave by train, and have made their arrangements accordingly ; and I have no desire to place any obstacle in their way. I am quite willing that the matter should be postponed., because I feel quite certain that I am right in the view I take. I remember that a few days ago, on the question - &#34;That the Senate do now adjourn,&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould,</inline> I believe, and myself, discussed various matters. However, I submit to your ruling, sir, and shall keep my information for some other occasion. </para>
