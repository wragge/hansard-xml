In two of these instances, a delay of eight weeks occurred, a portion of which was attributed to the shipping strike. The manufacturer concerned claims that the arrearshave, however, since been overtaken. The remaining order has not yet been executed, and delivery is ten weeks in arrears, but it is expected that the initial delivery for this contract will be made almost immediately. </para>

The matter is a controversial one, but it appears that Japan can continue to hold its mandate provided it continues to fulfil the qualifications and obligations of a mandatory, and is prepared to co-operate in this connexion with the League of Nations. 2 and 3. The theory of mandates has been discussed at various times; but, though opinions have been given by individual delegates, no authoritative pronouncement appears to have  been made. It seems clear, however, that a mandatory docs not necessarily have to be a member of the League of Nations. For example, on the  26th  April, 1920, the United States of America was invited to accept a mandate for Armenia.
