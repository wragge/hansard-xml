                        <para>The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research is carrying out investigations with a view to the control of the grasshopper pest, but the work is at present only in its initial stages. It is understood that experiments in destroying the pest by dusting, but not by spraying, from aeroplanes have been successful in South Africa where the conditions are, however, different from those in Australia. If the Government Entomologist in Western Australia will get into touch with the chief of the council's division of economic entomology, the council will be glad to give all possible help and advice, and to co-operate in appropriate measures with a view to the control of the pest. </para>

                    <para>It is unnecessary to ask Parliament to appropriate the full sum of £3,107,339,  because  many of the amounts included in the proposed expenditure have already been appropriated in earlier sittings of the Parliament under special acts, such as those relating to farmers' debt adjustment, the Port Augusta to Port Pirie railway, unemployment relief works in the States, and grants to the States for mining and forestry. The only amount included ia the proposed loan expenditure which has not already been appropriated is a sum of £600,000 for postal works. This bill accordingly provides only for the appropriation of that amount. </para>
                    <para>As was explained in connexion with the proposals for new works expenditure from revenue, the total amount to be provided for post office, telegraphic, and telephonic works in the present year is £2,353,000. Of that sum, £1,750,000 is provided for in the new works votes from revenue, and £603,000 is included in the Loan Estimates. Of the £603,000, the sum of £3,000 was provided in an earlier appropriation. All the postal works will be of a reproductive character and are urgently necessary to meet the increasing demands of the public for better postal, telegraphic, and telephonic facilities. </para>

                        <para>It is anticipated that the suspension of the operations  of  the Committee of Public Accounts  will  result in the saving of approximately £3,000 per annum. That estimate is based  on  the actual expenditure of the committee during  a normal year. </para>

                    <para class="block">During the last four or five years of their existence the annual expenditure on those two committees rarely exceeded £3,000, and on no occasion did it exceed £5,000. I suggest to the Acting Leader of the Government that the time is now ripe for the reconstitution of these committees. In my opinion, the reports presented by those committees regarding the advisability of entering into proposed works were of much value to honorable senators. The public works programme for this year is estimated to cost £3,000,000; in any ordinary year it is rarely below £2,000,000. What is an expenditure of £5,000 to ensure efficient, control and investigation and consider the wisdom of spending £2,000,000 a year in comparison with the possible loss that might arise from unwise expenditure? Even in times of economic stress the expenditure involved in setting up these committees is justified; but the recent period of economic stress in Australia is definitely at an end. </para>

                            <para>- None whatsoever. The recommendations of departmental heads were accepted, and thus power was again concentrated in the hands of the Executive. I suggest that we could well reconstitute the system of inquiry and report by parliamentary committees, particularly by a works committee. The Works Committee in the past did extremely valuable work, particularly in connexion with the Hinders water supply, and saved the country many thousands of pounds. We should profit by the lessons of the past and reconstitute these committees. No great additional expenditure would be involved, and the reports would promote the more efficient working of the parliamentary machine, and the wise expenditure of public moneys. </para>

                            <para>- Until the suspension of the parliamentary committees, it was the practice for many years for individual works projects costing more than £25,000 to be referred to the Public Works Committee for inquiry and report. Having regard to the improved financial position of the Commonwealth, I think that the time has now arrived when that system of investigation should be restored. I am not in a position to oppose the expenditure for . which authority is sought under this measure, because the only details we have are those supplied by the department. In order to secure the best results a proper investigation into all public works should be made, and a full report submitted to Parliament. The amount of £600,000 mentioned in the bill probably includes some public works the estimated cost of which exceeds £25,000. Had a public works committee been in existence, works exceeding that cost would  have been investigated, and a report submitted to Parliament. I trust the time is not far distant when both the Public Works Committee and the Public Accounts Committee will be reconstituted. As a member of the Public Works Committee for some years, I am conversant with the close investigations made by it, and I can endorse all that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline> has said regarding the value of its work. I trust that the Government will decide to reconstitute the two committees mentioned. </para>

                        <para>. - Although I have not any direct knowledge of the work carried out by the Commonwealth Public Works Committee, I am conversant with the valuable service rendered to the Parliament of New South Wales by a similar committee in that State. The New South Wales committee has been abolished largely in response to the demand for economy, and because it was thought that certain members of Parliament were receiving additional remuneration for the service they rendered. The consequence is that in recent years many millions of pounds have been expended 'on public works on the advice of departmental officers. Such works should have been investigated by a parliamentary committee, and a report submitted to Parliament. The Commonwealth Parliament made a mistake in abolishing the Public Works Committee, because many of the large public works proposed to be undertaken should be scrutinized in order to see if economies cannot be effected. I trust that the Government will invite the Parliament to restore these very valuable adjuncts to Commonwealth administration. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> should realize that the superstructures of some of the buildings which he says should be built would now be visible had the projects been investigated by a public works committee. </para>

                        <para>.- Having been at different times a member of both the Public Works Committee and the Public Accounts Committee, [ feel that the Government would be well, advised if it reconstituted the two committees. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> suggested by ' interjection that the appointment of such committees indicates that Ministers cannot be trusted. In Queensland a parliamentary committee has investigated the construction of an extension of the railway to Camooweal, and has presented a report to Parliament. Such an investigation does not suggest that the Ministers in that State cannot be trusted. The inquiry was held in order to ascertain whether the railway was a reasonable proposition, and to insure that full particulars could be available to members of the Queensland Parliament. The Leader of the Opposition knows that all railway extensions in Queensland are investigated by a parliamentary committee. On one occasion the Commonwealth Public Works Committee investigated a water supply for the Naval Base at Flinders in Victoria. The departmental officers favoured a proposal involving the expenditure, of a very large sum of money,  but after investigation the Public Works Committee recommended an alternative gravitation scheme which reduced the cost, enabled adjoining town: to obtain a water supply at a reasonable cost, and Flinders Naval Base to obtain water free of cost. That recommendation involved a saving to the Commonwealth of over £66,000. The committee also investigated the construction of wooden ships by Kidman and Mayoh, and as a result of its recommendation the Commonwealth was saved £114,000. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> has said by interjection that savings up to £20,000 have been effected in respect of  aerodromes. Valuable work has also been performed by the Public Accounts Committee. The fact that these committees were in existence had a restraining influence upon departmental officers. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. Why have auditors in every concern? It is no reflection on the board of directors of a company that the shareholders appoint an auditor. Supervision of building construction by an architect is not a reflection on the contractor. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> would take the trouble to read the annual reports of the Public Accounts Committee and of the Public Works Committee, I do not doubt that he would be just enough to take the view that, oven if a few thousand pounds were expended on travelling allowances to the honorable members and senators who constituted the committees, the money was well spent, because of the great savings in public expenditure that were effected as the result of their investigations. I can speak freely on this matter, because in the event of the reconstitution of the committees I should not be an applicant for a position on either of them. These committees did a good job of work whilst they were in operation. They saved this country a lot of money, and the Government would be well advised to reconsider their reconstitution, perhaps not on so large a scale  as formerly, but in such a way as to represent all parties in both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament. </para>

                        <para>. - I am very glad that this matter has come before the Senate this afternoon. I mentioned it last year on the Appropriation Bill, and I take this opportunity to express my hope that before long the Public Works Committee will resume operations. Such a committee provides a valuable safeguard; that has been proved by experience in all States of the Commonwealth and also in the Commonwealth. I cannot speak with personal knowledge of what great' savings have been effected as the result of the committee's work in the Commonwealth sphere, hut I oan speak with authority of the savings that have resulted from the operations of the South Australian committee. That State, even during the depression, kept its Public Works Committee going, and that may bc one of the reasons why that State was the first to balance its budget. </para>

                        <para>. - I ask the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator A. J. McLachlan)</inline> the meaning of the expression, " Telephone exchange services " as used in this bill. Does it apply to telephones generally throughout the Commonwealth, or to any specific exchange, or the extension of telephone services? I have in mind an extension of telephone services which honorable senators representing Western Australia have urged upon the Government on several occasions. An extension of the telephone service from Ajana to Carnarvon is urgently required, because the people in those areas have no means of communication with the southern portion of the State, except by means of steamer services, the air route, or the telegraph system. In that respect Western Australia is different from Queensland, which enjoys all the blessings of civilization. 1 urge the Postmaster-General again to give consideration to the provision of telephone communication into the districts I have mentioned. </para>

This letter presses for an automatic telephone exchange for Rockhampton and asks that the Government give early consideration to the claims of this large and important city. The Rockhampton people do not talk about it very much hut the city is the capital of an area of about 217,000 square miles. I hope that it will grow a lot bigger. Automatic telephone exchanges are being installed in various parts of the Commonwealth and I hope that the Postmaster-General will be able to give to this matter the consideration that it deserves. </para>

                    <para>With others, I met a deputation of South Brisbane men, who are urging the need for a new post office in that suburb. The people there are not asking for an expensive or ornamental building; all they seek is a plain post office. There is a post office in Stanley-street, South Brisbane, hut it is not so good for business purposes as it used to be. Not nearly so much business is done there now as was done formerly and in other ways the site is hot suitable. The site proposed for the new building is centrally situated and was recently acquired by the Commonwealth Government for about £5,000. It is not a large area, but it is large enough for a small building. This site is near two railway stations, one the terminus of the KyogleSouth Brisbane railway, on which the main interstate railway business is conducted, and the other the Melbournestreet station, from which a branch line goes to the seaboard town, of Coolangatta and thence to Sydney. I have examined both the present site and the proposed new site, and I am satisfied that the latter is the better. I ask the Postmaster-General and the Government to proceed with the erection of the new post office as soon as possible. That this is a matter requiring urgent consideration is shown by the fact that the Government has actually bought the land and has thereby approved of the idea that the postal business in South Brisbane should be transferred from its present unsuitable location in 'Stanley-street to the very busy site near the railway stations. This site becomes more and more central, and therefore more and more suited for the requirements of South Brisbane. </para>
                    <para>As to the proposed reconstitution of the Public Works Committee, I disagree with the few comments voiced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings.</inline> As Leader of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> has on his mind more than the average private member and I think that his first impulse when this matter was raised was to express the Opposition attitude - "Beware of commissions, particularly when they are brought forward by our opponents when in power." I personally do not favour commissions which are appointed merely to shoulder the responsibilities of the Government. I am not levelling this charge against the present Government because 1 know that it is too noble to do such a thing, but governments generally have the habit, when faced with an irksome task, of transferring the responsibility to a commission which may wander around for two or three years before making a report. Not infrequently the appointment of commissions and committees provides for a government a convenient way out of inconvenient situations. I, therefore, think it probable that my leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> had this in his mind when he interjected this afternoon. For my part, I would welcome the re-constitution of the Public Works and Public Accounts Committees, which rendered useful service to the Commonwealth for many years prior to the onset of the depression, when the acts constituting them were suspended. My knowledge of the work done by parliamentary standing committees goes back about fifteen years, to the time when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gillies,</inline> then Premier of Queensland, appointed a standing committee on public works similar to that in New South Wales, with which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gillies</inline> was familiar, having come originally from that State. But my experience of their work is not limited to Queensland. For many years I followed my profession as a journalist in Victoria. On several occasions I was called upon to write summaries' of reports furnished by the "Victorian Railways Standing Committee, a body having functions similar to the Commonwealth Public Works and Public Accounts Committees, and I was impressed by the value of the services performed for the State by that body. Some critics of the proposal to re-constitute these parliamentary committees suggest that their chief purpose is to provide additional jobs and extra fees for members of Parliament. I can assure them that the extra emoluments paid are well earned by reason of the savings which the committees have effected. As evidence of the valuable information which members acquire in the course of their work on such committees, I may mention, without disclosing any party confidences, that I was impressed by the admirable address delivered this morning by the Leader of our. party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin),</inline> who displayed an expert knowledge of the financial relations of the Commonwealth and States - a knowledge which he acquired because of his close association with the Commonwealth Grants Commission. As honorable senators, may remember, he was entrusted with the responsibility of stating the claims of Western </para>
                    <para class="block">Australia before the commission a few years ago. The reconstitution of the Public "Works and Public Accounts Committees would mean that a number of members of both branches of the Parliament would serve on them and would acquire a more accurate knowledge of the works proposals and financial activities of the Government. This information would be at the disposal of the Parliament, and would facilitate the discussion of the various proposals submitted. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poll</inline> that on many occasions the Public Works Committee prevented the unnecessary expenditure of public money on works proposals, and I have no doubt that it was also an effective cheek upon any attempted jobbery. For these reasons I would cordially support a proposal to re-constitute these committees. There is no doubt that if the Government could see its way clear to do this, the work which the committees would do would increase the confidence of the people in proposals undertaken by the Government. </para>

McLachlan)</inline> with the single provision in the bill to appropriate £600,000 for telephone exchange services. Notwithstanding the Minister's observations I have not a clear understanding of the measure. I trust that, in his reply, he will give more precise information. I also suggest that some honorable senators who spoke this afternoon are somewhat behind in their advocacy of public works. I hoard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> V. MacDonald complain about lack of telephone facilities at Rockhampton; other honorable senators spoke about the needs of comparatively small towns in their States. Their grievances may be well grounded; but I remind them that Melbourne, the capital of Victoria, with over 1,000,000 people, has not yet the advantage of an automatic telephone exchange for the centre of the city, where a great proportion of the business is done. I hope that the Minister will be able to assure me that some proportion of the £600,000 to be appropriated under this bill will be set aside for improving the telephone facilities in the city of Melbourne. </para>

                        <para>.  - <inline font-style="italic">in reply</inline> - I give <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J</inline> . V. MacDonald an assurance that his observations concerning the re-constitution of the Public Works and Public Accounts Committees will be brought under the notice of the Prime Minister, and I have no doubt that they will have the attention which they deserve. But I remind the honorable gentleman that discussion of his proposal is outside the scope of the bill, which appropriates loan moneys for certain specific purposes. However, not one item in this bill would have been referred to the Public Works Committee had that body been in existence. As honorable senators will remember, only works costing £25,000 or over were referred to that committee. In my second-reading speech I mentioned thatprovision for telephone exchange services for the current year would absorb £1,502,850, and that, of this amount, it was proposed to appropriate £600,000 from loan. The balance of the expenditure will be from revenue. The item, " telephone exchange services " covers all new works expenditure associated with telephone exchanges, exchange equipment, cables, conduits and aerial wires for local exchange services, subscribers' instruments, private branch exchanges and public telephones. Under this heading it is not competent for honorable senators to discuss either post offices, telephone exchanges or buildings; but I may say, for the information of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> V. MacDonald, that plans are being drawn for the proposed building at Rockhampton. Provision for the post office at South Brisbane is not contained in this bill. It will be  dealt with elsewhere. I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allan</inline> MacDonald that this bill does not deal with trunk line services, broadcasting or buildings. Provision for such services will be contained in the works appropriation bill to come before the Senate shortly. It will interest <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> to know that the requirements of Melbourne have not been overlooked. I have before me, in broad outline, the expenditure proposals for that city. </para>

                            <para>. - In pursuance of my promise to give details of the expenditure proposed under the heading " Telephone Exchange Services ", I point out that the sum of £1,502,850 is provided under this heading for the current year. As the expenditure last year was £1,218,270, the proposal for 1936-37 represents an increase of £284,580. The item covers all new works expenditure associated with telephone exchange equipment, cable conduits, and aerial wires for local exchange services, subscribers' instruments, private branch exchanges, and public telephones. Owing to the rapid development whicb has taken place during the last two years, and the fact that during the depression years little additional plant was provided, the reserves in many localities are almost exhausted. Indeed, for some time past, the department has had to institute relief measures in order to avoid the refusal of applications. It is essential to proceed immediately with a number of works which are vital to the normal expansion of the service. During 1933-34 local calls totalled 396,684,056, whilst for the current years the number is estimated at 500,000,000. Compared with 1935-36, the increased revenue from local calls and rentals is estimated at over £300,000. After allowing for cancellations, the increase of the number of subscribers is expected to reach 32,500 this year; last year there were 30,945 additional subscribers, and in the previous year 30,975. Development has been greatly restricted by plant limitations, especially in some residential areas in metropolitan districts, where there is a steady demand for telephonic facilities. If the position in this respertcan be improved in the near future, it is anticipated that the progress will he at an evVn greater rate than has been estimated. Some of the principal works to be undertaken during the current year are new automatic exchanges at North Sydney, Petersham, Hurstville, Tamworth, Carramar, and Pendle Hill in New South Wales ; CityWest, Melbourne, </para>

In view of  the  industrial peace which now exists throughout the Commonwealth, due largely to the present Government's progressive policy, I should like to know if the baton is to be kept as a reminder of the more strenuous times in 1892. </para>

                        <para>. - I  congratulate the Government on the inclusion of the sum of £17,500 for the purchase of a vessel for the development  of  the fisheries industry. The provision of this vessel should greatly assist an industry which has been neglected for a  long  time. Notwithstanding that the waters off the Australian coast abound  in  fish, this country imports fish and  fish  products to the value of £1,500,000 a  year.  In my opinion, the men engaged  in  the fishing industry should be relieved of that portion of the petrol tax which  is  imposed for the development of roads in the Commonwealth. As most of the  fish  is transported over comparatively  short  distances it seems that the fishing industry derives little benefit from the petrol tax levied for the upkeep of main roads. I suggest that it would be possible  to  authorize retailers of petrol whose premises are situated on the waterfront to grant to approved fishermen a rebate of the tax on all petrol used in connexion with their operations. </para>

This industry is not being exploited in a manner worth while at the present time. In yesterday's issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> it is pointed out that at least £1,000,000 a year is expended in the importation from New Zealand, South Africa, Japan and other countries of canned fish of kinds which we already possess in our own waters. Though they contain greater numbers of fish than any other part of the waters surrounding the Australian coast, the far northern coastal waters of Queensland are not being adequately exploited. </para>

There can be no doubt that the development of the fishing industry in Australia will be a step in the direction of making this country more self contained. </para>

                            <para>- I am leading up to the . experiences in connexion with a similar vessel constructed for the Government of New South Wales. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> referred to the advantages of governmental control as opposed to control by private enterprise. I remind the honorable senator that some years ago during an inquiry held into the working of the New South Wales Public Service it was learned that the Government of New South Wales had constructed a very trim vessel, fitted with refrigerating machinery, to be used as a tender to the trawling fleet. It was discovered, however, that when the vessel was driven at high speed there was insufficient steam to keep the refrigerating machinery in action, and that if more power were applied to the refrigerating machinery loss of speed resulted. For this reason the vessel was considered unsuitable, its use was discontinued and for many years it was lying idle at Milson's Point wharf. It seems to me that the Government of New South Wales made a very serious mistake in connexion with that vessel though the matter was not ventilated to any extent. I hope that the Commonwealth Government will profit by that experience of the New South Wales Government. </para>

                        <para>. -  I take it that all the Government proposes to do is to carry out investigation and research into the fishing industry and not, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> suggested, to enter into commercial fishing. I should have thought that the experiences of the Governments of Queensland and New South Wales in the fishing industry would have been sufficient to convince <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> of the undesirability of Government participation in commercial fishing. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> desires that the industry should be developed by governmental enterprise,- it is, I think, a responsibility devolving upon the States and not upon the Commonwealth. I agree, as every other honorable senator will agree, that, as fish are plentiful on the coasts of Australia, every effort should be made to. develop the industry; but at the same time it is desirable that public taste must be considered and the people must have the choice of using fresh fish from our coastal waters or canned fish supplied by Canada, New Zealand, Great Britain and other countries, which are good customers of Australia; after all, such trade is only an exchange of goods between one country and another. I commend the Government for taking this action, but at the same time I do not say that we should restrict our people to the use of Australian fish exclusively. </para>

                        <para>. - I commend the Government for its decision to construct a research vessel to investigate the possibilities of the fisheries industry in Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Abbott</inline> has referred to the fact that an attempt was made by the Government of New South Wales to establish the fisheries industry in that State, and that  a  vessel was constructed to explore the coastal waters; but that attempt waa in the nature of an investigation of the possibilities of the successful commercial development of the industry. As the honorable senator has said, that attempt failed, and brought about something in the nature of a scandal. It is high time that the Commonwealth commenced  a  scientific investigation of the possibilities of exploiting the fisheries industry within the waters under its control. I think it was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> who said that while on shipboard one night on his recent voyage to the Far East he thought he saw in the distance a modern city lit with a myriad lights. He was informed by one of the ship's officers that what he saw were merely the lights of a large Japanese trawling fleet. He was astonished to find that each boat which was electrically lighted was operating in conjunction with  a  highly modernized aerial fleet used for locating the fishing grounds. That is sufficient to show that the Japanese, who eat more fish than flesh, and to whom the industry is most essential, have a highly developed industry. Australian waters contain some remarkable fish, and the fishing industry has not been developed as it should he. It is probable that the fish to be found in Australian waters are not of the same quality as those in cooler regions, such as in the North Atlantic, or off the coast of Great Britain, but they have  a  definite value, and should be utilized. </para>

                    <para class="block">We have been informed that Australian waters are teeming with pilchards, and that they are so numerous that they could be canned and also used as a fertilizer. An Australian named Abbott  waa  responsible for the introduction of the dehydrating process under which the nutritive qualities of fish are extracted and used in the production of  a  powder which is perhaps quite as beneficial as a food as is the fresh fish. With scientific aid this product is being commercialized, and is being sold even in the East, where fish is plentiful. </para>

A Sydney man named Russell has for the last ten years been directing attention to the wealth which the sea can produce in the form of food, oil and fertilizers. When we realize that such men as Abbott and Russell have been trying for years to get the authorities to realize the value of sea products it is pleasing to find that at last the Government proposes to do something to develop the Australian fishing industry. </para>

                            <para>- This Government; the only government which we have any chance of influencing, and the one to which I presume the honorable senator was addressing his derogatory remarks. It is true that Queensland governments have embarked upon State enterprises such as have been operated successfully by other governments including the Commonwealth Government. There are State enterprises operating in every State of the Commonwealth, and no government or private concern dares to interfere with them. Honorable senators who live in the past should be sufficiently alert politically to realize that control is rapidly being taken from private enterprise because it has fallen down on its job, and has brought ruin in its train. Because it has brought the world to the condition in which it is to-day governments have found it necessary to exercise a greater measure of control. During a state of national emergency governments do not dare to allow private enterprise to control national activities. They always intervene to ensure effective service, to protect humanity, and to prevent profiteering. I have already complimented the Government upon its decision to undertake the construction of a fisheries research vessel, and I am particularly pleased to have the Minister's assurance that it is to be built in Australia. I remind those hypercritical honorable senators who have referred to governmental activities in Queensland that everything in the nature of a government enterprise that has been undertaken in tbat State has been an undoubted success. A Queensland government which established retail fish shops also controlled a fish market, and supplies were made available to over 300,000 persons in the metropolitan area at prices much lower than those charged when private enterprise was in control. Eventually the fish market was placed in charge of a commission on which the fishermen, merchants and distributors were represented. The commission was not under the control of the Government, and as a result only those who were exploiting the public were satisfied. Within the last few months the suppliers who were so dissatisfied with the exploitation practised again requested the Government to come to their rescue. It has always been the practice for the Commonwealth Government to bear all the initial expenditure of establishing industries, and then to allow others to reap the benefit therefrom. Investigations are conducted by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, and other similar bodies, sometimes at great cost, and when an industry appears to be producing profitably the Government hands over all its experience to others, who are then allowed to exploit the public. I have spoken on this subject, because I believe that the Government can do the job more effectively than, private enterprise. No one suggests that the Postal Department or our railway systems should  be  controlled  by  private enterprise. </para>

                        <para>. -  I take this opportunity to bring before the Government the need for the erection of a laboratory in the north-west of Western Australia to investigate and advise upon the various diseases affecting the cattle in that portion of the Commonwealth. Last year I visited the Commonwealth laboratory near Townsville, and was permitted to inspect the results of investigations by the Commonwealth Council for Scientific and Industrial Research into the diseases of Queensland cattle. There are many diseases in that State which fortunately are not prevalent among the cattle in the north-west of Western Australia. Nevertheless, there exist in that portion of my own State several serious diseases, notably pleura. If anything is to come of the negotiations conducted by the Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> with the British Government with a view to increasing the Australian quota for the export of beef to Great Britain, the investigations of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research will have to be extended. We cannot possibly hope to fulfil a greater quota of export beef until the pests and diseases which exist in the north-west of Western Australia have been brought, under control. I. urge <inline font-weight="bold">Senator A.</inline> J. McLachlan, as Minister in charge of development, to look very favorably upon the request for a research laboratory in that. area, as 1 have made it as the result of collaboration with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. M.</inline> P. Durack and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Forrest, both of whom are largely interested in and have made a life study of the Western Australian cattle industry. Numerous admirable sites for a laboratory exist, and if one is erected ample opportunity for work will be presented to the investigating officers. </para>

                            <para>- No one debates the wisdom of applying science to indus try. In my opinion, that  is the  soundest economic policy that the Commonwealth can pursue. I was particularly interested to hear some months ago, through  the  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons),</inline> that a decision had been reached to extend  the  activities of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research to the realm  of  secondary industry. Hitherto, the activities of the council have been concentrated almost entirely on the problems  of  primary production, and its achieve  ments  in  that  field have been notable. How far  is  the interest of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in  the  problems of secondary industries  to  proceed ? Year by year this Parliament  is asked to vote  funds to the council to  enable  it  to  carry on its investigations. Such  work  should not be dependent on an  annual vote by  Parliament, because  the whole success of  successful experiment  depends upon the  investigators having sufficient  funds  assured to them to  enable them to carry  out a long-range policy. There are  in  existence to-day  vital  experiments  which  necessitate the formulation of  a  progressive schedule spread  over a long  period, sometimes extending  to  eight or ten years. Is  it not  logical then, to give to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research reasonable financial security? </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but there is  need  for something more than that. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> said  that  it was wrong for  a  Government department to conduct research and then allow  the  fruits thereof  to be  garnered  by  private enterprise. If  the  honorable senator follows that argument  out  to its logical conclusion he must oppose the existence of the Council  for Scientific and Industrial Research, for the results of all of its research are made available to private enterprise. There is need to investigate whether it is possible to bring those engaged in private enterprises that are assisted by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research into a contributory scheme. Why should it be wholly .the function of the Government to provide the funds for scientific and industrial research? It is a national work, and in that respect it bears some resemblance to a national insurance scheme, which would be based upon a system of compulsory contributions from the governments and the people who would benefit. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so. but this council is doing important work for private enterprise .and private enterprise should bc called upon to make some contribution towards it. My objection to the continuance of the present system of financing the council is that if a change of government resulted in a change of policy towards the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, many of the long-range investigations now in process might have to he discontinued because of lack of funds. We must guard against that contingency. </para>

                        <para>. - Before the matter of the fisheries research vessel becomes entangled in other subjects, I should state that the vessel is to he built in Australia. The need for scientific investigations of the fisheries of this country has been apparent for a long time. Conference after conference on this subject has been held .between representatives of the Commonwealth and the State governments. In 1928 we thought that agreement had been reached and that we were about to  embark  on a definite policy of research. But there has been an extraordinary neglect of this great wealth in the coastal waters of Australia, and it has become essential, in the interests of human, animal and plant life, that more of it be utilized. For instance, the quality and quantity of a large percentage of the animal stock of this country could be immediately improved by the feeding of fish meal. The methods which hitherto have been employed in the Australian fishing industry have been primitive and without guidance. The fishermen themselves eke out miserable existences and have had no means of being taught how to go about their avocation. For instance, if a large catch is made, there is no market for a big portion of it and the surplus is thrown into the sea, whereas, if proper control of the industry existed, the surplus fish could be usefully employed for making meal and oil. Fish is a luxury for the rich in this country, whereas in Britain, fish is a staple item in the diet of the poorer classes. We have only to realize what Japan, Canada, Russia, Sweden, Norway, Great Britain, and Germany are doing towards the development of the fishing industry, to realize the wealth and benefit that could be gained for the people of this country if similar .attention were given to ocean fisheries here. </para>

                    <para>I do not consider that the matter of the petrol tax paid by fishermen arises under the subject of new works. This bill does concern, however, the building of the fisheries research vessel which, as I have already intimated, will be built in Victoria. Before a contract could be let, safeguards had to be taken. I obtained from overseas plans of suitable vessels. The Government received offers of ships from Britain, but in its wisdom it decided that it would be better to build a vessel in Australia. Various engineers had to be consulted with regard to many difficulties that arose from time to .time. It is natural that difficulties would arise as the vessel is not of conventional design. It is to be a dual purpose vessel, operating both purse-seine or ring nets and Danish seine nets, and its equipment will include various aids to research as well as a refrigeration plant. Another point which caused the Government concern was the necessity to safeguard the lives of the crew and the scientists who would be on board the vessel. </para>
                    <para class="block">Some honorable senators may remember the tragic fate of the <inline font-style="italic">Endeavour.</inline> The new vessel will be only 82 feet long, but I cannot say off-hand what its tonnage will be. I have been subjected to a good deal of criticism for the delay in placing an order for the construction of the vessel, but I emphasize that the delay has been in the best interests of the industry. The Government wanted the job to be well done. One honorable senator referred to the fact that certain gentlemen are coming to this country from overseas for the conduct of research operations. There is nobody in Australia who has practical knowledge of the new methods employed in the exploitation of piscatorial wealth. There are in Sydney and Melbourne firms which are doing efficient work ; one man travelled abroad to obtain the very latest ideas about refrigeration. By the use of dry ice and quick freezing, fish is being sent into the distant interior of Australia. Every hospital in 'Victoria is supplied from Melbourne with fish almost as fresh as it is when it is taken from the sea. This very desirable state of affairs is duo to the use of dry ice under modern conditions of transport. These are the problems which are being dealt with. Professor Dakin is overseas on his own business, but the Government has availed itself of his services to examine various methods that are being adopted in other countries. " Good enough " should not be the motto of any Australian industry to-day. Out secondary and primary industries must be conducted on the most approved lines. We have invited applications, which, I understand, closed to-day, from Australians having the necessary seafaring experience to take charge of the fisheries investigation vessel. We are hoping to secure the services of a young man who will be sent to British Columbia and Newfoundland to acquire first-hand information of the methods being adopted there, and, if time permits, he will go further afield in order to obtain the widest possible knowledge of all phases of the work done by these vessels in. other countries. On the research side, we have secured the services of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Harold</inline> Thompson, of Newfoundland, whose ability and experience are vouched for by the highest authorities. Already we have had experience of the possibilities in connexion with the production of fish meal and artificial manures. The vessel proposed to be built will be used for educational purposes, and it is hoped that its work will give to private enterprise a more complete understanding of the habits of the fish in Australian waters, and also help fishermen and others to overcome the difficulties which they encounter in their business. In this way, we aim to develop the fishing industry until it becomes an important branch of Australian industrial activity. A statement is being prepared, at the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings),</inline> covering the whole field of operations over a somewhat lengthy period, lt will be my endeavour to make it as complete as possible in order that honorable senators may understand what is being done in this matter. </para>

                        MacDonald has urged the establishment of a research station in the north-west of Western Australia to carry out work similar to that being done by the research station near Townsville, in Queensland, his desire being, I understand, to further the investigation of contagious pleuro-pneumonia in cattle. The honorable gentleman knows, pTo- bably,  that the Townsville Research Station has been conducted in conjunction with the Queensland Government, and with the assistance of the Empire Marketing Board. I regret to state that the Marketing Board is not now functioning, owing to lack of financial support from the British Government; but we are hoping to come to an arrangement with the Queensland Government for the continuance of research at Townsville into tropical diseases, and the results will be available to the stock raisers in the northern State. The Townsville station has made investigations into pleuropneumonia, tick fever, and pegleg. The services of a Commonwealth officer well versed in animal health have been placed at the disposal of the Queensland Government, in order to carry on this useful work. Some aspects of animal health are dealt with at the McMaster Laboratory in Sydney, and we are now in cooperation with the Melbourne University, proposing the erection there of premises in which

                    <para>I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline> that, for the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research to function properly, it should be able to formulate a long-range policy of research. This was the original intention, but lack of money during recent years has interfered with it, and but for the urgency that has arisen in regard to another matter that transcends in importance even scientific research, I should have pressed strongly for a certain amount of the surplus of the last financial year. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. No government can fail to recognize the value of the work done by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. Contributions of approximately £70,000 a year from people who know the value of its work are tribute to its worth. Provision is being made for the expenditure of £20,000 on buildings to be erected in the grounds of the Melbourne University, where research will be carried out in co-operation with the university authorities. The arrangement is, T think, an excellent one. </para>

That is not the case. The national debt, Commonwealth and State, includes millions of pounds that have been lost in State enterprises. He points to the financial position of the post office and the railways as examples of successful Government enterprises. He should remember that the buoyant condition of post office revenue is dnc largely to the continuance of postage rates, that are probably the highest in the world, to the fact that it costs1s. 4d. to send a telegram of oven two words from an office in Victoria to an office in another State, and to the further fact thattelephone charges in Australia are higher than in most other countries. </para>

                            <para>- It appears to me, as a business man, that if two Ministers control the activities of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research a clash of authority is inevitable and the work must suffer. Undoubtedly the underlying purpose of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research is good, and its work ought to be good; but I cannot help remarking that while every one seems to take it for granted that the work done by the council is good, no one is able to say precisely what good thing it has done. </para>

                            <para>- I am seeking information, and I want to know if we are getting full value for the public money which is being expended in connexion with this governmental activity. I should like to see the results of its work clearly defined.  1 understand that hitherto its investigations have been confined to problems confronting our primary industries, and that, for the most part, that woTk has been completed. At all events there is a lull and now, so we are informed, the council is about to undertake the investigation of problems associated with secondary industries. At this stage, it is important to note, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline> says it is time that industry contributed towards the expenditure for scientific research. That surely is a remarkable position to take up when the investigation of the primary industries is ended, and those concerning secondary industries are just 'beginning. In its investigation of problems relating to secondary industries, the council is about to tackle an entirely different and, I suggest, a much bigger job. Its research into primary industries troubles wa3 restricted to two or three dozen different problems, common to Australia; its work for our secondary industries will be much more diversified, because of the greater divisions of industry and the numberless difficulties encountered in all of them. </para>

                    <para>If I may offer a suggestion I should say that its investigation of secondary production problems should be confined at the beginning to the establishment of new industries that are needed for the carrying on of existing industries. I have in mind particularly the manufacture of aluminium .and certain alloys that are necessary for the manufacture of motor and aircraft engines. I am afraid that a fair amount of suspicion will bo engendered amongst manufacturers if the Council for Scientific and ' Industrial Research attempts to interfere too much in the working of their businesses. Manufacturers guard their secrets pretty carefully, and would not care to have them become the common property of their competitors. From what I have said it will be apparent that the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research will require to use a fair amount of tact in its investigation of the problems of secondary industries in order to ensure the co-operation of manufacturers generally. Their attitude will probably be determined by the manner in which the work is carried out. I do not wish to depreciate the value of the work done by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, hut I have not seen set out in detail what it has done. Now that it is about to investigate the wider field of secondary industries, more provision is being made for buildings. I hope this does not mean that the entire organization is going to be duplicated. </para>

                        spoke as if the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research were about to embark on a policy of intrusion into secondary industries; but I remind him that, so far from regarding the activities of the council as an intrusion, the Associated Chambers of Manufactures, and the presidents of the Adelaide and Sydney Chambers welcome the proposed co-operation. The council has by no means completed its investigations into problems affecting primary production. For instance, the dairymen of Australia have given thousands of pounds for research into bovine mastitis. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research has rented a farm near Berwick, in Victoria, where its officers will carry out investigations into one of the most difficult problems confronting veterinary science. That work will continue for several years.

The wretched building now used by it in Melbourne is not at all suitable, and I am glad that better provision is being made. I do not agree that the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research has solved all the problems associated with primary production which it has attacked, and I do not expect that it will be free from the necessity to face new problems for a great number of years.

                    <para>I wish the Government's venture in assisting the fishing industry every success. I take it that the Government's purpose in purchasing a vessel is to test the possibilities of Australian waters as fishing grounds, and to encourage the investment of sufficient capital to establish a worth-while industry. A great deal has been said about the value of the fishing industry. Other countries have realized its value to the fullest extent, but so far we in Australia have not done so. Only recently I read in the press that Japan had sent an expedition to inquire into the fishing resources of waters situated outside the 3-mile limit of the coast of the United States of America and Canada. Much to the disgust of those engaged in fishing operations in those two countries, the Japanese officers in charge of the research vessel sent an invitation to the authorities in Canada and the United States of America to discuss the need for the imposition of a quantitative limit in respect of fish trawled outside the 3-mile limit of their respective coasts. I mention this to illustrate that the Japanese people realize to the fullest extent the desirableness of securing the  highest efficiency in the fishing industry in order to make possible the supply of fish at prices within the reach of the mass of the people. Recently legislation was passed through this Parliament to control whaling in territorial waters, and countries all over the world are more and more jealously guarding their natural fisheries and breeding grounds. Honorable senators would do well to pause before giving expression to their thoughts in regard to matters such as this without due consideration. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Arkins</inline> suggested that the countless numbers of small fish which abound in our coastal waters should be netted and used for the manufacture of fertilizer. These fish, however, provide the natural food for whales. If the honorable senator's suggestion were adopted, what would become of the whaling industry? The present state of affairs in connexion with the fishing industry in Australia is lamentable. While fish ought to be cheap, the high prices demanded for it place it out of the reach of nine out of every ten people. At present a large quantity of fish is destroyed in the southern portion of Australia in order to limit the quantity placed on the market, and prices are thus maintained at such a level that only the well-to-do can afford to pay them. Only recently I saw fish for sale in a window in Melbourne at 2s. 6d. per lb. If the fishing industry were properly organized and con-  trolled, and no restrictions were placed on the quantity made available in the Australian market, it should be possible to purchase it for a quarter of that price. I am glad to see that this provision  has been made in the bill, and feel sure that much benefit will result from it. </para>

                        <para>. - Will the Government give favorable consideration to affording greater encouragement to young men to take up the study of veterinary science? If there is one thing more than another which the primary producers of Australia need to-day it is the services of men skilled in veterinary science. I know that many veterinary officers are attached to the State Departments of Agriculture, but nevertheless greater encouragement should he given to young men to take up this profession. The demand for the services of qualified veterinary surgeons is always very great, and the National Parliament should do everything possible to foster the study of this science. Although the States have not neglected this branch of science, great difficulty is experienced, even by the State governments, in securing the services of veterinary officers to give advice in country districts. The Government might well consider the provision of a subsidy or the granting of scholarships as a means of encouraging more young men to enter the profession. I should like the Minister in his reply to say whether the Government has given any consideration to this matter, and, if not, how far the Government is prepared to promote this desirable objective. </para>

                        <para>. - I am sorry that I had not studied the fishing industry sufficiently to have realized that the utilization of sardines and pilchards would rob whales of their natural food. However, I am not greatly perturbed by the remarks which have been provoked by my statement, because in some of the waters of the world, though pilchards and sardines have been harvested for centuries, they are still present in large numbers. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> has asked why private enterprise should be given the benefit of the research carried out by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> has said that industrialists to-day are very jealous of the secrets of their particular industries. It is true, .however, that over the last 25 years a great change has been taking place, due, perhaps;, largely to the attitude adopted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Henry</inline> Ford, who has never kept a secret in his industry. Immediately <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ford</inline> discovered some revolutionary process in connexion with his vast activities the door was thrown open to all his competitors to witness its operation and, if they thought desirable, to adopt it. One of the aims of industrialists at the present time is to protect the worker from injury. Modern engineering establishments employ huge machines capable of crushing a worker or amputating his limbs, and frequently heavy weights are moved about which, if anything went wrong, would be likely to injure employees. Therefore, it has become increasingly necessary that adequate measures should be taken to protect the worker against accident. Recently, I had an opportunity to go through one of the most remarkable manufacturing plants in Australia - that controlled by Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. In several of the machines which I examined in the works of this firm, protection was automatically afforded to the operator with the movement of the machine. I said to the works manager that I thought it remarkable that I had never seen such a device before. He replied  that the use of that sort of mechanical protector was confined to Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, and that that firm had for many years been investigating devices designed for the protection of its employees, being guided in this policy largely by the necessity for introducing a degree of safety which would permit a man to concentrate on the particular job on which he was engaged. The safety of the operator, however, was regarded as the first principle. I asked him if the device was covered by patent rights; he replied that it was not the policy of the firm to cover such devices by patent rights, and that, as a matter of fact, the firm had offered the design to the Department of Labour and Industry of New South Wales, so that it could be utilized by any firm. He pointed out that Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited was not interested in any profits which might be derived from the sale of the device. That attitude, I might remark, is quite a new development in industry, and worthy of commendation. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research is doing much good work, though, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> has said, probably honorable senators are unaware of much that it is achieving. </para>

                        referred to the research work conducted into means for combating the blowfly pest. It is a remarkable fact that the most outstanding contribution made to the successful elimination of the blowfly pest has been made by a layman,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline>
                        H. W. Mules.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Sir</inline>
                    </para>
                    <para class="block">Frederick McMaster, who gave £20,000 to the University of Sydney for the establishment of a laboratory to conduct research into animal health, said that, although the means suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mules</inline> for the elimination of the blowfly pest were revolutionary, a statement upon which the experts agreed, he proposed to use them as a preventive measure in connexion with many thousands of his sheep. I refer to this merely to show that suggestions which have practical value are not always made by scientists. We should not be over-influenced by the academic mind. Though we should get from science all we can, we should not overlook the assistance which may como from the layman. It must be remembered that the layman usually arrives at his opinions after years of practical experience. Throughout the ages, however, there has always been conflict between the layman and the academic expert. I have already referred to what has been achieved by Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. One of the men most prominently associated with the success of that company is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisk. Mr. Fisk</inline> has taken out of the universities of Australia young men with scientific training, and has utilized them at his works; but, at the same time, he has placed alongside them men of practical experience. In other words, he has seen the need for leavening the scientific loaf. The academic man travels only the road which he knows. The layman traverses the same road but he is willing to explore a new path, and in that way he becomes a pioneer. A few weeks ago I read a book in the Parliamentary Library, entitled <inline font-style="italic">The Microbe Fighters,</inline> giving the lives of men who had spent the greater part of their lives in fighting diseases common to mankind. The hook shows that in every instance they are opposed by the scientific or academic mind. One has only to sec the moving picture or read the story of the life of Pasteur to realize the remarkable opposition shown to men who wish to explore a new trail. The steam locomotive invented by Stephenson was ridiculed by so-called experts, and his locomotive had been running on a short line at Kenilworth for ten years before engineers admitted that it would- actually  do what was claimed for it. That error has persisted, with the result that the centenary of the introduction of steam locomotives was celebrated a few years ago, 110 years after the day on which one was first used by its illustrious inventor. </para>

We should impress upon the scientists that in many matters the opinions of laymen should be considered most carefully. As learning becomes more general, laymen can give even greater assistance to scientists. </para>

The need for a vessel to engage in research work has been mentioned for some time, and it is pleas ing to find that the Government has now. decided to construct such  a  vessel. Japanese vessels have been found operating in Australian waters, but if Australian vessels encroached on Japanese waters international trouble would soon arise. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline> Hays is always interesting, but he is amusing when ha attempts to attack the policy of the Labour party, and particularly the alleged failure of Queensland State enterprises. 1 admit that some socialistic enterprises have failed, not only in Queensland, but also in Western Australia and Tasmania.

                            <para>- I do not think that there is direct competition between that company's line and the State service. The circumstances in Western Australia arc exceptional. Often private enterprise has failed where State enterprises have succeeded. Honorable senators who suggest that private enterprise is always a success should remember that thousands of farmers, business men, and others fail.' It is unreasonable to condemn State enterprises when, owing to exceptional circumstances, they are unsuccessful. I have known mcn with a good knowledge of farming conditions in Great Britain to come to Australia with £5,000 or £10,000, and lose their all. They have lined the pockets of agents and other land sharks and have then been compelled to go on the pay sheets of State enterprises such as our railways. When the State cattle stations in Queensland failed the conditions were so bad that the beef barons, who were on the verge of ruin, were compelled to go, cap in hand, to the Government. The Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> directed attention to the fact that these men had joined the long list of mendicants. The failure of State enterprises is sometimes due to the unfair competition of private enterprise, and to unsatisfactory management. A comparison between private enterprise and State undertakings shows that the latter are increasing in number. In the Federal Capital Territory hundreds of thousands of acres have been taken from the control of private enterprise and the land now belongs to the nation. In the foundations of the proposed permanent administrative block, the quantity of cement used by private enterprise was less than that stipulated in the specifications, and, in consequence, thousands of pounds have had to be expended to rectify this fault. A retired public servant informed me that the disclosures he could make were so startling that they should be ventilated in Parliament. He' was prepared to give me full information, but I did not wish to be associated with a scandal. Some have said that the construction of a vessel to engage in research work suggests that the Commonwealth Government proposes to embark upon a socialistic enterprise in which the Governments of Queensland and New South Wales are alleged to have failed, but that is not so. We import annually fish and fish products valued at £1,500,000. While the present Government is opposed, largely on principle, to such enterprises, it is to some extent proceeding to repair the omissions of private enterprise. One instance of this is the decision to build the fisheries research vessel and to show private companies bow to market fish on a large scale so that we no longer shall pay in tribute overseas more than £1,500,000 annually for certain fish requirements. For another instance I invite honorable senators to study the provisions in this hill covering the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. What is that institution if it is not a socialistic enterprise? It is a socialistic undertaking by the whole of the Commonwealth to repair the omissions of private enterprise. </para>

                    <para>In Brisbane a couple of months ago I met a man who had an invention to save sheep from the ravages of the blowfly. After having interviewed some members of the House of Representatives he approached me and wanted to know whether financial assistance could be afforded to him to put the invention on the market. I worked as a boy in minor capacities on sheep stations, and I also worked on a farm where a few hundred sheep were included in the stock. I assured the gentleman that I did not have £20 or £30 to put into a company for the marketing of the invention, but 1 told him that I could take him to a place where he could get expert assistance and advice. I took him to the Brisbane office of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. I bless the Government which founded this council, for it enabled that man to satisfy himself as to the commercial possibilities of his invention. Whilst on the subject of inventions, I must say that if it were not for the 100 persons who invent foolish things we would not have the one hundred and first person who invents something useful. It is a well known fact that more than 99 per cent, of all inventions are worthless. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research is a valuable organization, and it is expanding. It cannot be gainsaid, however, that it is a socialistic enterprise. I could cite a number of cases where the conservative element in the Parliaments of this country, acting under the impulse of public opinion, and spurred on in recent generations by the party whose leanings are naturally towards things which are socialistic, has profited by the realization that private enterprise has its limitations. Admittedly there have been failures of State enterprises, but are we going to wipo out democracy because there are such men as Hitler and Mussolini? Democracy has been on trial for thousands of years. </para>

                        <para>It may be of interest to note that the output of kiln seasoned native Victorian timber in 1930 was approximately 1,000,000 super feet, whereas it now stands at 50,000,000 super feet per annum. Such remarkable progress, made without any government assistance, is entirely the result of tariff protection. </para>

                    <para>I do not say that that increase has been entirely due to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. As a matter of fact the main reason for the increase was the tariff, but one of the factors in the increase has been the educational policy pursued by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in regard to the treatment of timbers and the establishment of kilns. </para>

                        <para>. - I direct attention to the item, £120,000 for expenditure under the River Murray Waters Act. I assume that this is part of the progressive development of the River Murray waters scheme, which embraces 26 locks and the Hume dam. No water conservation scheme in Australia is of such a high potential value as the Hume Reservoir. Every honorable senator who has seen it must have been impressed by the magnitude of the work. The original proposal was to impound 2,000,000 acre feet, but construction work ceased when the weir impounded 1,250,000 acre feet. Is it intended to raise the dam to a sufficient height to impound 2,000,000 acre feet within the next few years? The allocation of the River Murray waters is a vexed problem that has given rise to a good deal of controversy. The average citizen believes that there is sufficient water under the control of the River Murray Commission to meet the whole of the requirements of Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia; but I am informed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shaw.</inline> ex-Commissioner for State Rivers in Victoria, that actually the amount available is limited and is not sufficient to meet all the requirements of the users in the three States. Perhaps the Minister can throw some light on this matter, and I should like to know definitely if a fixed proportion of the available water is reserved for each riparian State, or if that State which displays the most initiative in the development of its irrigation proposals has allocated to it the largest quantity. This is a matter which has been causing a good deal of concern to a number of people on the New South Wales side of the Murray. </para>

                        has said the capacity of the Hume Reservoir is 1,250,00 acre feet, whereas the original proposal was for a dam impounding 2,000,000 acre feet. It is not the present intention to increase the capacity of the dam beyond the point at which construction ceased and the road was built across the top of the weir. The allocation of the available water is provided for in the river Murray agreement, and whilst difficult questions of law may arise - I trust they will not arise during my time - T am assured that the agreement ensures ample supplies for ail the States concerned.

                        (Tasmania) [S.8 |.  -  I notice that expenditure this year under the War Service Homes Act, to be paid to the credit of the War Service Homes Trusts Account, is £200.000. Last year the vote was £11.5,000. If I am in order I express the hope that, in this item, the Government is making provision to ameliorate the conditions of many occupants of war service homes, from whom recently there came an urgent request for relief by a revaluation of their properties. We all know that the majority of war service homes were erected at a time when all building costs were exceedingly high. Many places costing from £800 or £1,000 could to-day be built for much less. Therefore, it is unfair to penalize the occupants. In view of the difficult financial position of so many returned soldiers there should he a revaluation of their properties. They should not be expected to carry an undue burden of interest and repayment due to excessive building  CostS

                        (New South Wales) [8.12 J. - 1 should like some information about the proposed expenditure of £30,000 on the Australian War Memorial at Canberra. I do not criticize the amount set aside for that purpose; on the contrary 1 think that we should pay proper tribute to our worthy dead. But the item suggests to me that we ought to make provision for a memorial, not only to Australian soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice in the Great War, but also to other national heroes - such men, for instance, as the late
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline>
                        Kingsford Smith and the late C. T. P. Ulm. We should erect a memorial in which, from time to time, we could place tablets to the memory of distinguished leaders, who, in science, politics, or any other sphere of public activity, helped in the development of the nation and furthered the welfare of the people. It would be a good thing for Australia to have a Hall of Fame. The idea is not new; other countries have such places in which they perpetuate the memory of their 'great men; so it is only fitting that we should honour in some way distinguished Australians whose services have been of an outstanding character. At present, if this is desired, it means the erection of separate memorials to individual citizens; a Hall of Fame, in which we could place tablets to the memory of our distinguished citizens, is a much better idea. I believe that the Government proposes to erect a memorial to perpetuate the memory of

The Auckland memorial is a museum situated on a hill overlooking the city. On entering the museum a paved courtyard is crossed, and here every visitor is required to remove his hat and observe silence. He then enters a circular hall inside the museum, where the atmosphere gives rise to feelings of the deepest reverence. The whole place is most inspiring. On tablets around the circular hall are inscribed the names of the national heroes from New Zealand who made the supreme sacrifice in the Great War. Both within and without the memorial is beautiful. This afternoon I looked towards the Australian War Memorial from the window of the Senate clubroom, and I must confess that in its present condition the memorial is not an *° ornament to the city. It does not harmonize with its beautiful surroundings. I am happy to notice that £30,000 is to be provided this year for the memorial, and that the estimated further liability in respect of it is £146,000. The environment calls for a 'building architecturally beautiful. </para>

                        <para>. - The proposed vote of £30,000 includes £16,000 for the completion of the initial section of the building which was commenced about two years ago, the balance of £14,000 being required for other work, including the Hall of Memory. The completion of the work will involve an expenditure of approximately £160,000, to be spread over the years 1936-37, 1937-38, and 1938-39. I assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Abbott</inline> that the design for this memorial has had the most careful consideration . of various governments. An examination of the plans for the complete building, which may be seen in the Library, will reveal that it will be chaste in design, and worthy to he regarded as Australia's Westminster Abbey. The further work to be undertaken includes the facing of the whole building with granite or other stone. I ask honorable senators to forbear judgment of a building which in its present state does not express the aim of either the Government or the architects who designed it. Honorable senators will remember that the accepted design was the result of an architectural competition, and was agreed upon only after much thought. The complete memorial will include cloisters and memorial tablets and the development of the surrounding grounds. </para>

                        idea of a Hall of Fame is an excellent one.  His  suggestion is along the lines of what has been done  in England and some other countries. As time goes on, Australia will probably have a similar place. The building now under construction is, however, exclusively * a war memorial.

                        <para>. - If a discussion of such subjects as the erection of a Hall of Fame and the . perpetuation of the memory of certain distinguished airmen is to be permitted, a very wide field of discussion will be opened up. Instead of praising <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Kingsford Smith after his death, the Government would have done better had it treated him differently while he lived. Rather than expend money on the erection of a Hall of Fame, or in perpetuating the memory of certain persons, we should give to the common people decent homes and better living conditions, and so set up the best possible halls of fame. It is not right that persons not qualified to pass judgment should criticize the war memorial, seeing that it is only partially completed. Surely we can trust the Government to see that any memorials it erects are worthy of those whose memory they seek to perpetuate. In my opinion, it will be a sad day when individual members of this Parliament are allowed to set themselves up as authorities on subjects of which they know nothing. Competent architects have been engaged on the design for the war memorial, and if they have proved incapable, as has been suggested, it is useless for us, who are less qualified, to criticize their work. </para>

We are not asking for the erection of a Hall of Fame, but we are entitled to something at least better than the rabbit warren in which we are now expected to interview our constituents. We ask this, not so much for our own personal convenience, as to remove the general stigma which the present accommodation imposes on all federal members in the eyes of their constituents. </para>

I repeat that statement with all the energy and enthusiasm that I can command. I should like to know exactly what it costs to keep an imported Governor-General in his establishments in this country. The accommodation provided for him in Canberra is excellent indeed, though no more than his position warrants. I am delighted to see so much already provided for him here; but if. the Governor-General desires to leave Canberra, he should have no better conditions than other public men, who leave residences provided for them and seek accommodation elsewhere, f ask the Minister in his reilly to give honorable senators some idea of what is actually proposed in connexion with the two items  to  which I have referred. </para>

                        <para>. - I  greatly regret that no provision  has  been made in the list of new works  for the  construction of rock catchments in  the  north-eastern wheat belt  of  Western Australia. Last year, as the result  of a  disastrous drought, the wheat-farmers in that area were placed in a very difficult position; it was to inquire into their plight that the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thorby)</inline> visited Western Australia, and it was expected that water conservation work would be undertaken by  the  Commonwealth in con junction with the State Government. It is possible that the State Government may divert some of the moneys received from the petrol tax for the purpose of undertaking works of this kind, and I hoped that the Commonwealth Government might supplement that money by a grant for the purpose of constructing rock catchments in that area. There  are  no large rivers, such as the Murray, in the hinterland of Western Australia, but that country is blessed with thousands of acres of granite outcrops, around  which  cement walls can be placed, thus making natural reservoirs, and providing  the  cheapest form of water conservation in Australia. The country in that part of Western Australia is excellent in every respect; it is first class land, but  unfortunately,  is very porous, and does not lend itself to the successful construction of dams. </para>

                        <para>.- An amount of  £8,500 is pro  vided for " Erection of Memorial  at Canberra  to Hi3 late Majesty  King George  V."  A  footnote discloses  that the  total estimated cost of the proposed memorial is  £20,000.  Not long ago, the Leader  of  the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> brought this matter before  the  Senate, and said that the Government proposed to appoint a committee consisting of three or five gentlemen possessing artistic knowledge of the requirements for such a memorial. If I remember rightly, in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand,</inline> the right honorable senator said that, as  the  memorial was of national or Empire significance, it was desirable that designs should be submitted. At the time, I suggested that a competition should be arranged which would enable  artists  throughout Australia to submit  designs. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">I regarded it as a mistake for the Government to appoint such a committee, as its members might not consider the submissions of young artists who had not achieved fame. I hope the Minister will be able to inform us if the Government has made any change of plans in this respect which would permit the consideration of designs submitted by artists from all parts of Australia. I remind the Minister that artistic conceptions are continually changing, and that Australia is on the threshold of a remarkable artistic era. Young  artist3  should be encouraged, and they should be afforded every opportunity to submit, in competition with others, the artistic creations of their brains for perpetuation in a national memorial. </para>

The selection of those honored in most countries, particularly in Great Britain and Australia, seems to have been haphazard and unplanned. Those who know anything concerning the history of the Australian States know that men whose names ought to have been perpetuated have not had memorials erected to their memory. On the other hand names of persons who had no real claim." to recognition are. perpetuated. In these matters the Government should proceed slowly. It is a good policy not to consider the erection of a monument to any person until ten years after his death. </para>

                    <para>Sen a tor DUNCAN-HUGHES .-That period would probably make it much easier. Ten years would be sufficient for the purpose, otherwise men who pos sessed attractive personalities and supported popular proposals, but who otherwise had no claim in  a  deeper sense, would bo recognized. When their friends and contemporaries are asked whether they will subscribe to a memorial they usually agree. The late Lord Forrest was, I believe, the greatest man that has been associated with Western Australia, but when the erection of a memorial to him was suggested, there was the greatest difficulty in raising the few hundred pounds necessary to carry out the work. He was the man who placed Western Australia on the map. In England there are Westminster Abbey and the National Picture Gallery. Memorials are also scattered all over the continent. Many of the men whose names would find a place in a Hall of Fame might never have been to Canberra. They would be identified with particular States in which already their memory had been perpetuated. It is not sensible or desirable to erect memorials in a haphazard way. When the National Library in Canberra is completed we shall have an admirable collection of portraits of outstanding figures in Australian history, including explorers and sailors. Without any desire to minimize the value of what has been done, I again suggest that this is a matter in which the Government should proceed slowly, otherwise we shall find ourselves surrounded with pictures and memorials of men who, 25 years after their death will be completely forgotten. I am not disparaging <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy's</inline> suggestion that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Kingsford Smith's services should be recognized. That is totally different from his suggestion for a Hall of Fame. There is still much work of a more urgent character to be done in this young country. </para>

He should be permitted to become familiar with Australian conditions, and should not bo embarrassed by having to find accommodation in hotels.

                    <para>There is also an appropriation for the purpose of providing meteorological buildings concerning which the Minister should give us some information. Seeing that there are meteorological buildings and staffs in every State he should outline the general position in respect of meteorology. We have also a solar physics observatory quite independent of the other observatories. Can the Minister say whether there is any unnecessary overlapping? Inquiries into this expenditure might be made by the Public Accounts Committee if it were reconstituted as was suggested this afternoon. I do not think that any useful service can be rendered by having the Commonwealth and the States operating in the same field. </para>

                            <para>- The solar physics laboratory is on a different plane. Its functions are different from those of other observatories. On a previous occasion in reply to a query by me the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> said that buildings are required " for observing meteorological changes due to electrical discharges from the sun, and the state of the spots on the sun which indicated those discharges." At any rate, function of the solar observatory at Stromlo is quite distinct from the functions of the other six. Four years ago, conferences between the Commonwealth and the States had come to the point of practically determining that there should be only two meteorological observatories in Australia, one in the cast and one in the west. The Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> answered inquiries by me in November, 1932, by saying that the matter was still in the air. Is it still in the air or has it como down to ground? </para>

                            <para>- Canberra is now the national capital, and this is where we want the Governor-General to live. There should be only one personal link with the Crown, and he the Governor-General. The time is ripe when we should appoint as State Governors, if they be necessary, either native-born Australians or those who have cast in their lot with us. I think that the Australian sentiment is that the crimson ties could be represented by one gentleman from England, Scotland, Ireland or Wales. When the Governor of Queensland is touring, as he frequently is - indeed he is more often in the country districts than he is in Brisbane - he is not supplied with official residences wherever he goes. I have never heard it claimed that he should be, but if the Governor-General is to be given homes in the capital cities of Australia, there is no reason why the Governor of Queensland should not be given residences in Toowoomba, Rockhampton, and Townsville, as well as in Brisbane. This bill provides too much luxury even for  a  Governor-General and money could be spent on more important things than the provision of homes in the capital cities for that gentleman. We could abolish the Molonglo Settlement, which disfigures this city. As a matter of fact, we could provide for ourselves in this capital better than we do. No provision is made here for homes, or decent resting places, for members of Parliament. Indeed, we are sometimes refused accommodation. That was my lot when I came here to work before the session opened. I telephoned to two or three hotels, but they were either full or they did not want politicians. I found it difficult to get  a  place in which to live, and it seems that in order to assume ourselves of accommodation, we must book weeks, or even months, ahead. The fact is, the hotelkeepers of Canberra do not want politicians. If politicians had not the fear of public opinion, what I am now advocating would have been provided for 30 years ago. </para>

                    <para>On the question of the Australian War Memorial the first thing that I should place in a Hall of Memory would b« something like the tomb of the Unknown Soldier in other lands. I do not mean the common soldier only, but also the noncommissioned officers and junior officers who took their lives in their  hand3  and died in tens of thousands in the performance of service to the country. I have not seen that suggested. "Without any disrespect to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Kingsford Smith, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. C.</inline> T. P. Ulm and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hinkler,</inline> I submit that the proper place for their commemoration is some building associated with aviation. At the Sydney Cricket Ground, photographs of prominent cricketers and footballers are hung. Similarly in the halls of aviation should the. memories of distinguished aviators be perpetuated. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DuncanHughes</inline> has rightly said that there has been a lack of planning in the erection of public memorials. Some men who are really great have been missed, and others have been made wonderful to the eyes of men although historians have not- justified the honour. In Westminster Abbey this is especially noticeable. When in London I was surprised to find in front of the Houses of Parliament the statues of two men who, I consider, should not have been so perpetuated in memory. One statue was of Richard Coeur de Lion; no doubt he was a great soldier, hut his principal job was to neglect England, from which he was almost continuously absent. </para>

The existing offices are not fit for the purposes for which they are used. If one enters the federal members' rooms  in  Brisbane at the present time, he  is  forced to become almost a telephone clerk. I understand that the situation  is  worse  in  Adelaide, where only two rooms are provided for federal members. The vote for this year is £18,564, the balance of the original estimate of £111,000. It seems, therefore, that it will he some time before the work is finished, but I urge expedition because federal members in Queensland would welcome the new accommodation. </para>

The proposal to erect a building in Brisbane for the accommodation of the meteorological bureau has been under consideration for a number of years, but in view of the financial position no action has been taken. An alternative proposal to house the bureau in the Commonwealth office building which is now nearing completion, has been carefully examined, but has been found to be impracticable as it would involve the total abandonment of the site used for meteorological purposes for a considerable number of years in favour of one involving unknown and probably serious differences in the observations required to determine the current weather and climate of Brisbane. Moreover, it is desirable to have a block of grassed land with sufficient open space around the bureau to give satisfactory exposure for instruments recording temperatures, humidity, rainfall, solar radiation, &amp;c. The existing accommodation in Brisbane is unsatisfactory. Recently it was referred to by the Commonwealth Public Service Arbitrator, in the following terms : - </para>

                        <para>There is one comment I would like to make as a result of my visit to Brisbane and also to Adelaide. That is that the officers in charge of the meteorological bureau in both States are carrying on their work in very disadvantageous circumstances. The accommodation provided for the officers in both those States is obviously quite inadequate, and quite out of keeping with the importance of that particular class of work to the general community. There is urgent need for more commodious premises in both Adelaide and Brisbane. </para>

The estimate of £13,000 will cover the whole of the expenditure involved in connexion with the erection of the bureau, including the necessary engineering services on the existing site, which is a transferred property on "Wickham-terrace. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator must have misunderstood my colleague and leader. The Government, in inviting the selected sculptors to forward designs, set out for their guidance details to be observed in connexion with the designs and the completion of the sculpture and architectural work. The main feature of the memorial will be a statue or a group of statuary in bronze, the common subject to be a statue of King George V. in state robes and without headdress, standing on a pedestal with inlaid has-relief bronze panels on each face or as otherwise suggested by the sculptor. ' The has-relief panels will symbolize the association of the late King with the birth and the first 25 years of federation, the growth of Empire unity as a Commonwealth of Nations owing allegiance to one Sovereign, and, by means of panels or has-reliefs associated with the statuary, the main events of Australia's national life such as, for instance, the first Federal Convention, the King as Duke of York opening the first Federal Parliament, Australia's participation in the Great War, and the opening of the first Parliament in Canberra by the present Duke of York, will be commemorated. Granite is to be used for the main pedestal and fundamental of design, but  hardstone  may bc used for steps or other substructure or other architectural features. The superstructure will include the principal feature of the memorial, namely, a statue of King George V. with panels of a symbolic nature as previously mentioned, inlaid in the base of the pedestal or otherwise designed. The sculptor, in submitting his design, is required also to submit a typed statement giving the estimated  cost  of the full-sized design in plaster with duplicate, and also the estimated cost of casting in bronze by an approved foundry in England. The sculptor will also be required to indicate the time anticipated for the delivery of the complete bronze work at Canberra, will be responsible for the  proper  completion of the monument, and for the payment of all expenses incurred in its erection. He will also, bo required to insure his life. The date for the submission of the preliminary drawings will be the 1st December, 1936. The vote of £8,500 is to cover the payment, in advance, to the successful sculptor of one-third of the estimated cost of the whole work, and fees of £150 each to the other sculptor's submitting drawings. That is a brief outline of the negotiations to date. We shall have to wait until December before anything further is done in the matter. </para>

                        <para>. - I support the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> in regard to the work of the solar observatory at Canberra. I understand that its chief function is to trace the relation between Bun spots and weather conditions in Australia, and I should like to know if this is still the accepted theory of leading meteorologists. We are expending considerable sums of money in Australia on meteorological services. The provision in this bill is approximately £30,000, and I should like to know what steps are being taken to supply the missing link in the chain of meteorological stations, namely, the much.talkedof station in the Antarctic. There has been considerable expenditure by the British and Commonwealth Governments on expeditions to the Antarctic, and we have been told, from time to time, that the establishment of a meteorological station there would give valuable information concerning weather conditions in Australia. The rest of the world is linked up by stations which give information that is available immediately to all governments. The absence of a station in the Antarctic is a definite gap which should be filled, because of the general belief that conditions there affect or govern conditions in Australia, and reliable information from such a station might make possible long-range weather forecasting in the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>. - Recently I w,as informed that some new ideas with respect to the building of aerodromes, one of which originated in Australia, had been rejected by the Defence Department, notwithstanding that an engineer and an architect of Sydney, one with war experience, and the other a well known authority on modern building, had said that it was a reasonable proposal. There are complaints that the Defence Department is loath to accept new ideas submitted to it. The proposal which I have iu mind related to aerodromes. It, was of arch design and suitable for camouflage purposes, because it did not throw a shadow. I  ask  that the Defence Department be instructed to give careful consideration to all suggestions submitted to it. The Minister knows that the army tank, which proved so useful in the Great "War, was originally rejected as being of little value. I do not want to see a repetition of such mistakes. </para>

                        <para>. - Large sums of money are being spent in the development of aerodromes near the capital cities, whereas aerodromes in country districts are neglected. The essential feature of any aerodrome is that it should possess a ground surface on which aeroplanes can land in all weathers without fear of becoming bogged. I have in mind particularly the aerodrome at Winton, which is on the main air route between Brisbane and Darwin, and has been gazetted as a stopping place in the air mail contract. The Winton aerodrome is 126 miles from Longreach and approximately 200 miles from Cloncurry, but the boggy condition of the landing ground was such between the 28th May and the 11th June this year that it could not be used. Last month the air mail from Cloncurry was forced to return to that place, because of the unsatisfactory nature of the aerodrome at Winton. An officer of the department, who visited Winton some time ago, suggested that the local authorities should construct an all weather .road from the town to the aerodrome, a distance of about one and a half miles, and stated that it was useless having an all weather aerodrome without a similar type of road. This road has now been constructed by the council at a cost of £1,200. The people of Winton ask that gravel runways, which would not cost more than about £3,000, be constructed. </para>

I am aware that it may be argued that civil aviation is subsidiary to defence; but the same -argument could be used in favour of placing the mercantile marine under the Defence Department. The Government should give this matter its most earnest consideration, in view of the strong body of public opinion in- favour of transferring civil aviation from the control of the defence authorities to some other department such as the Department of Commerce. </para>

                        <para>.- I should like to know whether the item "machinery and plant for manufacture of 'munitions " refers to machinery actually used for the manufacture of munitions or to plant used for making lipstick holders and other articles in competition with private manufacturers. Some time ago it was said that the Government intended to co-operate with private 'manufacturers in plans for the making of munitions. The manufacturers do not want to make materials of war and hope that the day will never come when their factories will be turned into munition-making plants. They are, however, prepared to set aside a portion of their floor space and to train men in the making of these requisites, so that, almost at a moment's notice, munitions may be manufactured if required. The Australian Government seems to be strangely neglectful in this respect. We all know what happened in England during the Great War, and that it was not until Lloyd George organized the supply of munitions in 1915, that there was any regular supply of guns and materials to the armies at the front. Britain is organizing against a recurrence of such happenings, and Australia would do well to do likewise. Some time ago the Government appointed a gentleman to interview manufacturers in this connexion, but after about a fortnight he was suddenly withdrawn, and nothing has been heard of him for three or four months. I should like to know the reason. I know that in the munition factories there is a tremendous amount of jealousy. The factories turn out articles, which are not munitions of war, including a vast quantity of lipstick holders, axles and other things, in  competition with the manufacturers of Australia. That is not fair. </para>

                            <para>- I should like to know if this trade has been stopped. To my mind, it is rather remarkable that the potentialities of Australian factories for the production of munitions are being ignored, in view of the fact that the British Government is actively engaged in organizing the whole of the factories of the United Kingdom, so that, at a moraent'3 notice, they can he brought into full operation. _ The manufacturers of Australia do not want to turn out materials of war in times of peace, but at the same time they want to be able to play their part and turn their factories and the experience of their trained men to the service of their country during a period of emergency. </para>

                        <para>. -  I agree with the remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie.</inline> When we consider what is being done in Great Britain and tn other parts of the world, we fmd that Australia is lagging far behind. For instance, Czechoslovakia has tabulated the whole of its primary and secondary industries. If such a tabulation has not been carried out in Australia the authorities responsible should be ashamed of themselves. It is vital and essential that these facts should be known, and unless we follow the lead given by other countries in regard to this matter we are surely travelling the road to disaster. I compliment the Govern.ment for what it has done so far, but I urge upon it the desirableness of undertaking a complete tabulation of all industries which may be utilized in time of war. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> that manufacturers do not want to produce munitions for war purposes, but, at the same time, they realize that Australia is in a position of isolation, and that adequate supplies of munitions constitute a very necessary form of preparation. We cannot fight without munitions of war, and we cannot produce them expeditiously unless every skilled man who could be employed in their production is tabulated and ready to be pressed into service in emergency. If, unfortunately, Australia should ever be engaged in a war, it will undoubtedly come upon us like a bolt from the blue. There will be no warning. The peaceful security of Australia can only be assured by preparedness for war. Let us not leave this very necessary tabulation of the industrial resources of the nation to the very last. We should profit by the experience of England during the war, when it was found necessary to withdraw soldiers skilled in the manufacture of munitions from the fighting forces in France and put them to work in. the factories in England. Let us be prepared. The greatest preparation can he carried out in the factories and workshops in Australia. </para>

                        <para>.- I should like to take Senators Leckie and Arkins to the munitions establishments at Maribyrnong and Footscray to see what is being done there. I do not suppose either of them has ever been there, and I am sure that they do not know of the developments which have taken place in these factories. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> V. MacDonald, by way of interjection, said that the factories are not turning out gas masks. As a matter of fact, the facilities exist for gas masks to be turned out by thousands when required. As for lipsticks, they were manufactured in those factories during the depression period. The factories are now engaged in turning out 6-in. and 8-in. shells and all types of munitions required by a modern army. In regard to the statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Arkins,</inline> that no tabulation has been made of the various private factories throughout the Commonwealth, when I was the responsible officer at Victoria Barracks, Melbourne, a complete tabulation of all factories, showing what each was capable of producing was in course of preparation. All that the last  speaker  has said is bunkum. I invite honorable senators, when next in Melbourne, to go cut to the factories at Maribyrnong and Footscray, and see the plant there, the number of men employed, the amount of local raw material used, and the national work which is being done. </para>

                        J. McLACHLAN (South - The provision in this bill for the Department of Defence is not to be financed from loan, but from revenue. The sum of £1,952,008, deducted from the total estimated expenditure, represents approximately the balance at the 30th June, 1936, of an amount paid in previous years into the Defence Equipment Trust Account for defence equipment. In other words, that amount of money was ear-marked for defence purposes. It has now been brought into account as a deduction from the total provision for the Defence Department, and £1,117,772 represents the amount of the charge against revenue in the budget for this year.

Savings are also effected in track maintenance and the upkeep of rolling-stock. The estimate of £67,500 covers the supply of ballast under the existing contract from a quarry at the 634 miles post, the " running out " of the ballast, and the lifting of the road in connexion with the supplies under that contract. The opening up of a new quarry, with a view to reducing the running-out mileage, is also provided for.

Improvements to rolling stock, supply of a covered wagon to cope with the greater amount of traffic to Alice Springs as the result of increased mining activities at Tennant's Creek, and minor service to rolling stock will absorb £1,340.

                        <para>. - Under the heading of " National Broadcasting Service " provision is made for the appropriation of- £89,870. A few days ago I asked a question relating to the number and location of broadcasting stations in Queensland. The information supplied disclosed that there are sixteen stations, eleven of which are either on or near the coast; three are within a distance of roughly 200 miles of each other, and two are in the south-western and western portion of the State. I wish to know if an amount is to be appropriated for- building, preferably, a regional station to benefit listeners in the far west of Queensland, an area of roughly 400 miles by 400 miles? At present, owing to static interference, particularly in the summer time, the coastal stations are of little use to listeners in the area mentioned. The only station erected in Queensland within the last twelve months is a B class station at Longreach. Statistics show that the number of listeners in Queensland: is lower than in any other State. At the 30th June, 1936, there were approximately 236,000 homes in Queensland, and a population of 973,905, but only 83,230 licence-holders. The ratio of population to 100 radio licences is ,8.66 compared with New South Wales, 11.8; Victoria, 14.31; South Australia, 14.80; Western Australia, 11.16; and Tasmania, 10.5. The ratio for all Australia is 12.22. The small percentage of listeners in Queensland is to some extent due, I suggest, to defective reception. Many of the people living in the far west of. Queensland are entirely dependent on radio services for the latest market reports dealing with the disposal of their products, news of the day, and general entertainment. Many of them receive only one mail a week, and some only one a fortnight. I strongly suggest that they are entitled to a better service than they are getting at the present time.. If a regional station were erected in the centre of the district mentioned, the reception would be much better than it is to-day, and the number of licences would increase. Queensland, which has an area of 676,500 square miles, has sixteen stations; New South "Wales, with an area of 310,372 square miles, 29 stations; and Victoria, with an area of 87.884 square miles, 20 stations. The stations of New South "Wales and Victoria are interwoven between the two borders and listeners can obtain reception from either State. ' But "Western Queensland is flanked by South Australia and the Northern Territory, and no wireless station is situated near those borders. Consequently, listeners in that region are obliged to depend to a large extent upon reception from the coastal or South Australian stations. I suggest that not only for the benefit of the people resident in those distant parts, which is my principal objective in raising this matter, but also to promote the manufacture and distribution of radio, this position should be remedied. It seem3 extraordinary that the percentage of radio licences to population should be smaller in Queensland than in the other States of the Commonwealth. In my opinion the comparison shows definitely that the reception in those parts is most unsatisfactory. If it were improved, I am quite sure that the great majority of the people in far Western Queensland would be owners of radio sets. I therefore ask that funds be made available to the Postmaster-General's Department at an early date for. the purpose of erecting a regional station in the area referred to. " <inline font-weight="bold">Senator BADMAN</inline> (South Australia) [10.12]. - In connexion with the- provision of' £89,870 for- national broadcasting services, I ask the- Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator A. J. McLachlan)</inline> whether this is an additional amount allowed to thiAustralian Broadcasting Commission apart from approximately £500,000 which that body derives from listeners' licence fees; From each licence which is taken out in the Commonwealth, the commission receives 12s., and the total number of licences in force at the 30th July last was 842,000. In South Australia the number was 88,000. The cost of a licence for zone 1 is £1 ls. and for zone 2 15s. I might explain .for the information of honorable senators that zone 2 is constituted by listeners who are beyond a 250 miles radius of a regionalor an A class station. The Australian Broadcasting Commission receives 12s. from each listener's licence. The balances of 9s. in the case of fees derived from zone 1, and 3s: in the case of fees derived from zone 2' aTe paid into the revenues of the Postal Department. If honorable- senators make a simple arithmetical calculation on the basis of. each licence- fee- yielding 12s., they will discover that from the 842,000 licences in force, the Australian Broadcasting Commission has a revenue exceeding £500,000, In view of this large income I fail to understand why the Postmaster General's Department should provide an. additional £89,870' for building construction purposes  in order to assist the broadcasting services. In my opinion broadcast listeners in Australia- are not receiving a fair deal at the present time. My experience in South Australia and other States convinces me that not more than 10 per cent, of the licence-holders to-day tune into the A class stations, from which the Australian Broadcasting Commission derives such a substantial revenue. The cost of a listener's licence should bereduced.; the fees in other parts of the world are considerably less than they are in the Commonwealth. I regret that broadcasting is fast becoming a taxing machine; the Government should give listeners some relief from that tax. </para>

                        <para>- I have ex: plained that, but the Commission derive* about £505,000 from that source. Surelysuch a large sum of money is  sufficient  to enable it to carry out such constructional work as may be necessary, to engage celebrated oversea artists, and to  maintain a high standard of entertainment. The revenue enjoyed by the Commission is considerably in excess of what is necessary to provide the service that listeners are now receiving. I repeat that only approximately 10 per cent. of the holders of listeners' licences in Australia tune in regularly to the A class stations. </para>

Another reason why the licence-fees should be reduced is to be found in the rapid increase of the number of listeners; shortly it will reach the million mark.

For instance, technical services rendered to the Australian Broadcasting Commission have, under the act, to be provided by the Post Office. </para>

                            <para>- The provision of studios is the responsibility  of  the Australian Broadcasting Commission. I emphasize that the item under discussion refers to technicalengineering, services which are rendered by the department. The construction of studios for the broadcasting ofprogrammes is the obligation of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. The honorable senator has probably noticed in the last report and balance-sheet of the commission that, sums of money are being conserved for the purposes of? constructing up-to-date studiosat Perth, Hobart, Melbourne and Sydney. What proposals have Been formulated in regard' to the fair city of Adelaide, I have- not heard. I understand that the accommodation in Queens.land is quite satisfactory and according to reports there is no difficulty in this respect in Adelaide. At present the Australian Broadcasting Commission has representatives overseas inquiring into these matters which are most important-, not only to the commission itself, but also to those who listen to the entertainment" from A class stations. We have constructed a good" many A class stations in the year just ended. New regionat stations were installed at Grafton (New South Wales),. Sale (Victoria), andKelso (Tasmania). When honorable senators, inspect these stations and see the  class  of work that has Been done they will realize that it was no mean feat to complete the work last year. At one station a mast 620 feet high, surmounted by a plateau 60 feetin diameter, was erected. Imagine the difficulty  of  securely cabling that to the earth! The work has been done, and it has been done well. We hope to open another regional'  station at Townsville in Queensland. I wish to direct the attention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooper</inline> to the intention to install regional stations at Cumnock (New South Wales), and at Broken Hill. It has been decided after scientific examination of the conditions that the Broken Hill station will render good service to western Queensland. </para>

                            <para>- It doe3 not matter how many miles a station is from the persons who listen in. The quality of the reception depends on the conductivity of the earth and on the synchronization of the earth ray and the sky ray. On that point, reception at Canberra has been mentioned, and one honorable senator referred to the density of the A class stations of Victoria, New South Wales and Western Australia. In this city distance does not matter much. I understand that the 'reception in (Jan.berra of Station 7NT Launceston is excellent. </para>

The Broadcasting Commission has an annual revenue of about £500,000 but, for some extraordinary reason, it seems to get a little wild in the making of disbursements. In the last twelve months nine appointments have been made, and the salaries payable in respect of those appointments total more than £7,000. </para>

                        <para>. --The amount of £68,000 is required to cover the estimated expenditure during the present financial year on a certain programme of works. Services, in the nature of improvements to stock routes, water supplies, and "roads, other than roads in the townships of Darwin and Alice Springs, have been provided for under the votes for developmental services and assistance and development of the metalliferous mining industry. Revotes in respect of uncompleted works at the 30th June, 193C, totalled £17,470 in the northern section, including £8,000 for the dredging of the Darwin harbour, £7,098 for a bituminous road to the aerodrome at Darwin, and other small amounts, of which the largest is £1,136 for the Timber Creek police station.  In  the southern section, the revotes are all of small amounts, the largest being £1,736 for the Conistan police station. The new items  in  the northern section include the construction of Commonwealth offices at Darwin, £6,500; construction of new kitchen at Government House, Darwin, £600; erection of concrete wall, enclosing the Darwin gaol, £5,000 ; construction of a new office for the Administrator, £1,400; new aboriginal compound, £6,050; new police stations at Wave Hill, £2,800, Brooks Creek, £2,300, and Roper River, £2,800 ; electric light installations at Katherine, Tenn ant's Creek, and Pine Creek hospitals,. £1,350; reclamation and draining of swamp near the Darwin aerodrome, £1,800 ; and £26,649 towards the cost of the Darwin water supply. At Alice Springs, the new works include a gaol, £8,500; hospital, appurtenances and equipment, £26,000; and housing, £3,500. The total in respect of revotes and new services is £122,740, of which it is estimated that £54,740 will remain unexpended, leaving a balance of £68,000. It is very difficult to make an estimate in connexion with the Northern Territory because, during the wet season of the year, it is impossible to proceed with any works. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad to hear that. Instead of criticizing, 1 congratulate the Government. This is a belated move, but I am pleased to learn that at last the work is to be put in hand. When in Alice Springs a few weeks ago, I found that the hospital provision  is  entirely inadequate. <inline font-style="italic">The</inline> building is the hostel of the Australian Inland Mission, which  permitted it to be used for its present purpose. Its dimensions are small, there is no permanent doctor, and no adequate surgery. The present population of Alice Springs is something like 300 or 400 persons, compared with a previous population of 30 persons. The whole of the arrangements are sadly deficient. There is  a  doctor  in  Alice Springs, but he has no control over the hospital, which one can understand  is  not convenient from his view-point. One can also understand that the nurses are rot anxious to be under the control of  a  medical man who has no real authority over them. I could see at a glance, and my impressions were strengthened by what I heard, that the provision of adequate hospital arrangements is of very great importance to Alice Springs. I have reason for saying that the Australian Inland Mission is only too anxious for the Government to build a hospital <inline font-style="italic">so</inline> that the hostel may be devoted to the purpose for- which it was intended. The thanks of the community are due to the mission for having provided a stopgap during the years when the Government had not a hospital. The intention to erect one and thus fill  a  longfelt want will be a matter for gratification over a very wide area. </para>

I submit that it 'has done tolerably well, and it will endeavour to fulfil faithfully all its obligations. The Government should not be expected to build all the houses required for people who come to Canberra. </para>
