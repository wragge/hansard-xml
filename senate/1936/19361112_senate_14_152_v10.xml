                        <para>. - Although there are quite a number of points which I desire to raise in connexion with this bill, which I commend to the earnest consideration of honorable senators, my remarks on the measure will be brief. It is the considered opinion of the Opposition in this chamber that the bill does not go far enough, but the habit of the present Government is to tinker with problems; the more serious the problems, the more superficial the tinkering seems to be. A scientific survey should be made of the whole Constitution in order that the remedies proposed may be calculated to relieve entirely the difficulties which have arisen. It will be admitted by all honorable  senators  that the Opposition in this chamber has never failed to support every proposal brought before the Senate for the benefit of primary producers. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. We have always done so when we have known, that a measure of benefit would accrue to the primary producers. In such circumstances, we have always given our unqualified support although sometimes, as becomes an earnest Opposition, we have been somewhat critical, as we are entitled to be. We have always pointed out the incomplete, and therefore unsatisfactory, nature of most of the proposals submitted with the object of assisting primary producers. We cannot overcome the difficulties confronting primary production by mere piecemeal legislation. We are not dealing scientifically with problems when we leave those engaged in primary production in various forms in the position of having to come annually to this Parliament for some measure of relief. It is quite obvious to every one who takes au intelligent interest in Australian affairs that the Australian Constitution, which has not been altered to any extent during the last 35 years, cannot serve us adequately to-day, and that in that long period problems Have arisen which show the need foi" alteration in various directions. If there is one thing that the Opposition believes in more firmly than in another, it is that the Commonwealth Parliament, regardless of the political party in power, should be clothed with full legislative powers. For example, we believe that this Parliament should have full control over industrial matters. </para>

                            <para>- There can be only one meaning to "full", which is a short English word in the superlative degree. The Opposition believes that this Parliament should have all the legislative powers, and nobody else should have any. This Parliament should have full industrial, and also full tariff, powers. We do not believe that it should delegate its authority to commissions and boards, but that it should take on the job itself. It should have full power to say just what relief should be granted to primary producers, and there should be no limit to its constitutional capacity to decide what measures are necessary in order to put every form of primary production on a proper basis. We also contend that it should have full power in the matter of orderly marketing, and that it should be able with or without calling for the cooperation of the States, to legislate in respect, of commodity boards, and to give such bodies properly constituted power to do the job. We also believe that the Commonwealth Parliament should have full control over trade and commerce, aviation and broadcasting. Any honorable senator could occupy the full time he is permitted to speak on the second reading of this bill in showing how essential it is that the Commonwealth Parliament should be clothed with fill 1 legislative powers in various directions. Surely the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Brennan)</inline> realizes that oven this measure will not give the Commonwealth Parliament full power over orderly marketing, the. constitution of commodity boards, and other assistance to which primary producers are entitled. Having regard to the experiences gained in the last 35 years, and the fact that the Commonwealth's power in other directions may now be successfully challenged, ir, is a pity that the bill has been introduced in such a form as will give to the Government only partial powers. Since the measure was drafted a successful appeal has been made to the High Court. The Government knows as well as I do - and if it does not I am informing it - that this is only the beginning of a number of similar challenges to be made which will show that the Commonwealth has not the power which it and the States and the people believed it possessed. I am surprised that the Government has not introduced what might be regarded as a. reasonably satisfactory proposal to ask the people to take an intelligent view of the Constitution and give to this Parliament the power to go ahead avid do the job. </para>

                            <para>-- Yes, but I Think that is understandable. The  position  of the Government is as understandable as is that of the Opposition. We know that the decision in the <inline font-style="italic">JAmes</inline> case is responsible for this hill, and that that case followed ns a result of a quarrel between two sections of capitalists. One section of those interested in the dried fruits industry believes quite definitely in every fibre of its soul in unbridled competition and that the Government . should not interfere in any way with such things as commodity boards. That section believes in the motto, " Every man for himself and the devil take the hindmost". The other section believes that unbridled competition is not the soul of trade; it knows that it is the death of trade, but from bitter experience it is afraid to go the whole hog. That section which desires unbridled competition opposes proper control by legislative enactment because it stands for the middleman and the juggler of primary products for whom they are the mouthpiece and of whom we have a number of worthy representatives in this chamber. I hope that no one will misunderstand my earnestness in this matter, and think that I am opposing the bill ; I hope that it will be carried. We of the Opposition shall support the bill because we believe that it is at least a step in the right direction. </para>

I assure him that nothing is further from the truth; we are a perfectly happy family on this a? other questions, and Labour senators in this chamber have a free hand which enables us to do as we think fit and proper in regard to this measure. The Labour party in the House of Representatives has not opposed the bill. Those who do not support it - and I say that with all respect-  are merely allying themselves with that great army of predatory vested interests which has nothing in common with the producers and less in common with the consumers, if that is possible, and who contribute no worthy service to wealth p; eduction, primary or. secondary. Those who comprise that vast army are content simply to sit back and take advantage of. every one of the industries concerned, and boast that this bill is foreign to the  interests  of the Opposition. The Opposition stands for the elimination of all those thieving interests to which I have alluded. </para>

                            <para>- Of course we believe in interstate freetrade; but fellow worker James does not; -lie wants to have it both ways, on the swings as well as on the roundabouts. We of the Opposition support this bill because we believe, inadequate as it is, that there is such a thing as an Australian standard of living which, by comparison, is better than that of any other country in the world. We believe further that this country is wealthy enough to be able to afford to uphold that standard of living, whether by the erection of tariff walls, the granting of bounties and other forms of protection, or the introduction of orderly marketing schemes. It is wealthy enough also to be able to afford to fix a home consumption price for its primary products. There is only one blemish on this bill ; it does not go far enough. It does not propose that we should go to the electors and say "There is a weakness here, there and somewhere else. Give us power to alter that weakness and we will do the job as good Australians. We have the courage and ability to do it ". It is in respect of these things that we think the bill is lacking. The Opposition will support the bill, while at the same time protesting that it is not adequate to deal with the situation and that it will not give to the Commonwealth the power it really needs properly to control marketing. T know it is said that one of the merits of the bill is that it restores the <inline font-style="italic">statu* quo.</inline> That, at any rate, is something. In other words, it will give to the Commonwealth that power to act in  conjunction  with the States which we all believed it already possessed. We should take our courage in both hands and go to the electors and ask them to do their job as good Australians and  crothe  this Parliament with far greater powers than are sought in the bill now before the Senate. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. I desire to bring to the knowledge of the Senate the reasons why Labour members, having failed to secure an agreement amongst themselves on this matter, decided to treat it as a non-party question. I have here a number of speeches which have beet, made in the House of Representatives by members of the Labour party. If honorable senators bothered to read them they would .discover beyond any doubt that only one section of the Labour party is prepared to support this bill, which is intended to give to the primary producers of this country not only a reasonable standard of living but also the advantages of organized marketing. I think that, irrespective of political parties, we can agree . that this bill, proposing an alteration of the Constitution, is one of the most vital bills which has ever been submitted to this Senate. It is a tremendous issue which the people have to face. As members of the Country party see it, the question iE simply whether the people of Australia are prepared to extend to the producers in primary industries a reasonable standard of living and, in addition, the advantages of orderly marketing schemes. </para>

                            <para>- That is not as apparent as it should be. I do not want it to be thought that I am in favour of unification when I say that I am in sympathy with the desire of the Leader of the Opposition to secure for the Commonwealth an unchallenged right to full marketing powers. I am not in favour nf his proposed principle of application, and I disagree with his contention that the Commonwealth should implement those powers by Governmental control. I be-  lieve  in producer control of primary industries; but at the same time I know that if this alteration is car ried by the people, and l  tervently  hope it will be, it will only endow the Commonwealth Parliament  with  certain power which will not be sufficient to provide orderly and organized marketing in respect of certain commodities, notably wheat. That it will give to the Commonwealth power to legislate in respect of the dried fruits industry I do not deny. The same may be said about the butter industry, But I say definitely and emphatically that it will not give to the wheat industry what the wheat-growers desire - the right to form a compulsory pool - though it will give to the Commonwealth the right <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> establish a home-consumption price for wheat. I do not, however, propose to argue that matter; I merely desire to draw attention to the fact that this bill possesses a disadvantage inasmuch a3 if the proposed alteration is made the Commonwealth will not have power to  give  to the wheat industry the advantages of a compulsory pool. The Leader of the Opposition might very well say that the best way to get over that disadvantage is to move an amendment substituting for the alteration now proposed a proposal to give to the Commonwealth full powers to initiate marketing schemes. While admitting the attractiveness of such a proposal, let us analyse the reasons for which we are here as representatives of the people. We are here to endeavour to translate into legislation the practical objectives of every-day life. We are- not hero to bluff ourselves by a mere gesture ; we are here to give to the people definite results. The result we require in this case is to provide producers with a reasonable standard of living and an organized market. Therefore, it is our duty to ask ourselves, free from political prejudice, whether we shall, by an amendment of the Constitution, get the people to endow the Commonwealth with the right to initiate full marketing schemes. I say frankly that a proposal to endow the Commonwealth with full marketing powers would undoubtedly be defeated at the poll. </para>

                            <para>- I know it because of the limitations imposed by the Constitution itself. Certain requirement; must be met before the Constitution of the Commonwealth can be altered. First, a majority of the electors must favour the change. That, however, is not the real difficulty, because that majority can be secured by a massed vote in Victoria and New South Wales alone. But another requirement, and this is the <inline font-style="italic">one.</inline> which is at times queried by those anxious to alter the Constitution, is that the change must have the approval of the majority of the States. That means that four of the six States must approve of any alteration; and it is not at all likely that they will do so. I should have liked to support a proposal asking the people for full marketing powers to be given to the Commonwealth, in order that compulsory pools and organized marketing of primary production might be established; but I reluctantly realize that such a proposal would be impracticable at the present time. Again I stress the fact that, after all, we are here to get results, and we must, therefore, adopt the most practicable proposal. Does any honorable senator think that the people of Western Australia, who a bare feY months ago, indicated clearly a desire for secession from the federation, would consent to give greater powers to the Commonwealth? The people of Western Australia are jealous of their' State rights, and honorable senators representing thatState have not hesitated to express their reluctance to grant additional powers to the Commonwealth. Not one honorable senator representing Western Australia could guarantee an affirmative vote in his State on a proposal to endow the Commonwealth with  greater  powers in regard to marketing than it had before the decision of the High Court in 1921. The objection to granting further powers to the Commonwealth which exists in Western Australia is not exclusive to that State; it is evident also in South Australia and, I believe, in Tasmania as well. Let us now face the position squarely. If we attempt to force on the people of those States a change which they are not prepared to make, we shall destroy the marketing machinery that, we now possess, and the primary producers will l.io worse off th ali they are now. I sun  satisfied  to go as far as is practicable, ;;i!i.l fight every inch of the way to ensure reasonable standards for the producers. In 1921, the High Court decided that section 92 of the Constitution did not bind the Commonwealth, and on that decision was based the whole of the marketing legislation of Australia. The adverse finding of the Privy Council, however, has rendered that legislation invalid. We now ask the people to grant the power which we thought the Government possessed prior to the decision of the Privy Council. Would any person willingly endanger the growth and expansion of the dried fruits industry in this country or deprive the producers of dried fruits of a reasonable standard of living? </para>

                            <para>- Would any one willingly destroy the structure of marketing which has been built up over a number of years on the assumption that the Commonwealth possesses rights which now the Privy Council says it does not possess? If we believe in the right of producers to be granted reasonable standards, we must vote for the bill I confess that I am unable to understand the attitude of some members of the Labour party towards this subject. That party has repeatedly stated that it desires to help the primary producers of this country -in every way, and to ensure to them a reasonable standard of living. That statement has been reiterated to-day by the Leader of the Opposition who said that he was prepared t.o do everything possible to help them. That is an excellent attitude. But what is the  atitude  of some other honorable members of the Labour party? The honorable member for Cook in the House of Representatives <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Garden)</inline> has given utterance to remarks which show clearly that he, at least, is rendering only lip service when he says that the Labour party is prepared to help the primary producers. Unfortunately there does not appear to be any possibility of this issue being treated as of a non-party character. If honorable senators will recall the legislation which from time to time has come before them they will, remember that at no time has tha Labour party agreed to approach  it on a non-party basis. Has that party ever announced  that  it would help a government representing another political party to pass legislation designed to secure for primary producers a reasonable standard of living, or to provide for orderly marketing <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> Members of that party are afraid to admit that the legislative proposals of any other party contain any real merit. That is why, in a position such as that which now exists, they shelter under the "non-party" principle. </para>

The attitude of the Labour party to this subject is unfair. Although every policy speech delivered by successive leaders of that party has expressed a determination to ensure, a reasonable standard of living for all sections of the community, in practice that policy is given effect only in respect of those engaged in secondary industries. In regard to men on the land, who work, not 40 hours, but 60 or 70 hours a week, the Labour party makes an extaordinary  reversal of its attitude. </para>

A national policy requires that a reasonable standard of living for the people of Australia shall not be limited to one section of the people. To-day, those engaged in secondary industries have the right of access to the Arbitration Court, and to the wages and conditions prescribed by duly constituted tribunals. Consistency demands that that policy shall be extended to the primary producers, especially those engaged in export industries. </para>

                    <para class="block">Australia. The people engaged in primary production do not cease work at the sound of a whistle; they do not become members of trade unions which, by exerting political pressure, secure wages awards, and reasonable working conditions for their members, nor do they enjoy stated holidays each year. They practically take their chance. Let us face the facts. There are only three methods by which a fair home-consumption price, which I regard is the equivalent of a reasonable living wage, can be secured for Australian primary products. The first method that could be adopted to supplement the income of the producer is the use of direct taxation. We could say that it is necessary to redistribute the national income so that those who receive an income that is below a reasonable living wage - particularly the primary producers - will have their income supplemented from the proceeds of a special tax in order to raise it to that standard. Action of that nature has been suggested in certain quarters, but I maintain that that would be impossible because, apart from the impracticability of applying the scheme to any individual, in my opinion, direct taxation arouses a vicious class feeling which is  inimical  to the best interests of the country. We, therefore, must consider the second method, and it in turn has little to commend it. It is a proposal that has been debated often, in this Senate, namely, that we should give a reasonable amount of assistance to the primary producers by way of a direct subsidy through the medium of an excise tax; that is to say, that in order to give to those producers a reasonable home-consumption price, we should subsidize them in a manner similar to that employed when the flour tax was imposed in order to provide assistance for the wheat industry which, for some years during the period of low prices, has been subsidized to the extent of £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 a year. That method of assisting primary production has many advocates, but it has serious defects which outweigh the temporary advantage of direct financial grants. The greatest disadvantage is that it would not give to the producer any reasonable stability or security, because no subsidy can be given. to any industry by a government unless it has been approved by Parliament, and, what is more, that approval must be given every year. To subject primary industries to the necessity of obtaining annual subsidies would be to make them the plaything of politics and leave them at the mercy of the whims of politicians. It would be possible, for instance, if the scheme were adopted for the Leader of the Opposition to rise and say, "I shall vote that we give £6,000,000 to the dried fruits industry " or " that we increase the vote to the wheat industry by £4,000,000." Similarly, those hostile to certain industries could move for a decrease of the vote. </para>

                            <para>- To a certain extent, but the majority of the secondary industries receive reasonable assistance as the result of the operation of the tariff and are subjected to a special investigation before they receive this protection. What the producers do not want is to be absolutely dependent on the whims of Parliament. They want the' stability which organized marketing will bring to their industries; they ask for security. Can any honorable senator say that organized marketing would be possible under a subsidy system? An industry would be prosperous one day and in the " doldrums " the next. Once the foundation of orderly marketing is removed from an industry it is reduced to a condition of chaos. In the butter industry, for instance, what would happen if the Commonwealth Government ' were not able to restore the legislative powers which have been taken from it by the Privy Council? Chaos would reign, particularly after the expiration of the existing contracts which are at the present time more or less holding the industry together. Once those contracts expired, butter producers who had been selling in the overseas markets would try to sell on the home market, and the result would be that every pound of butter that they sold locally would displace another pound of butter produced by some other person. The result would be that  competion  on the local marketing would be intense and price? would fall so rapidly and steeply that the producers would soon be forced down to starvation levels. I repeat that the rural producers are asking not for subsidies, but for a sound  foundaton  upon which they can be assured of receiving reasonable returns for that portion of their output which is sold on the Australian market. </para>

                            <para>- The same objection applies to excise as to the subsidies. If an excise were placed on these products the net result would be that the Government would have to distribute the proceeds to the industries. Who would decide in what way the amount should be distributed? The honorable senator, for instance, might suggest that the butter industry should receive £4,000,000. </para>

                            <para>- No, I understand that; but there would be the same annual scramble for largesse under an excise scheme as there would be under the other proposals that I have mentioned. Moreover, an excise scheme, like a subsidy scheme, would not permit in any way the advantages of organized marketing. The problems of primary industries differ largely from those of secondary industries. A fundamental characteristic of secondary industries is that the very nature of their products enables organized marketing to be practised. If a market for a secondary product becomes glutted, the producer goes to the factory and issues orders either for a slowing down or a complete cessation of production, the basic principle being that goods are not produced unless they can be sold. How different is the position of primary industries! When a grazier turns his sheep out into the paddocks he cannot stop them from growing wool, and when a farmer plants his grain lie cannot stop the crops from growing, especially in the' Riverina where the rainfall is generally good. It will be seen, therefore, that conditions operate in the primary industries that are entirely different from those which operate in secondary industries. In my opinion, the only basis upon which we can assist primary production to attain stability through organized marketing is that which was agreed to in this Parliament in 1933 when the butter stabilization legislation creating the equalization scheme was passed. I further consider that only a scheme  such  as this would be agreed to by the people. If this legislation, which seeks to perpetuate the butter legislation is not approved by this Senate, or, if, in the event of its receiving the Senate's approval, it is rejected by the people when it is placed before them by way of a referendum- as a proposal for the alteration of the Constitution, drastic results will follow. An inescapable conclusion is that the returns to primary producers from the sale of products within Australia will be less than equal to the returns from sales overseas. In other words, the export prices will dictate the returns from local sales. The full significance of that statement is not generally recognized. Let us remember that the producer does not get the full price for the goods sold in the markets of the world. He "receives the export price less the cost of freight, insurance, and other charges incidental to the carriage of goods from one country to another. For instance, freight on dried fruits is approximately £15 a ton; therefore, if the dried fruits legislation is destroyed through the failure of this Senate or the people of Australia to agree to the Government's proposal, the producers of dried fruits will receive a return for the whole of their crop which will fall below the export parity by more than £15 a ton, and I venture to say that would mean the absolute ruination of every producer in the industry. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and all industries engaged in the export trade would be affected similarly. The butter producer to-day receives for choicest butter within Australia approximately ls. 3d. a lb. in Australian currency, which is equivalent to ls. sterling. Who would wish to reduce arbitrarily the local price of butter below that level? But it will be reduced to a lower level if this legislation be not approved, or if the people of the Commonwealth refuse their consent to the proposed alteration, because the export prices will dictate the local price. This will not be the price which is actually secured in London for the sale of Australian butter. It will be the London price, less freight, insurance, and other incidental charges, and, it should be noted, the existing freight on butter is £12 10s. a ton. </para>

                    </continue><para>Let us consider a further aspect of the fairness and equity of this proposal. Are  we prepared to allow our primary producers who are engaged in export industries to compete with nations in which the workers are amongst the lowest paid in the world ? Are we prepared to allow the standards of such nations to govern the standards of our producers? The majority of our dried fruits producers are competing with exporters, not in the United States of America, or in countries where the standard of living is high, but in Turkey and Greece. In Greece, in order to assist exporters to " dump " their products at low costs, the currency has been depreciated to a much greater extent than it has in Australia. Is that classed as reasonable competition? Nobody can fairly say that our producers of dried fruits should receive a price on the Australian . market lower than, that received by producers in Turkey. In some parts of Turkey the rate of wages is from ls. to ls. 6d. a day! Is it considered that our producers should be satisfied with such a return? The question we have to consider is  whether  the producers in these industries in Australia should receive a reasonable living wage, the equivalent of which is a fair price for that portion of their output which is sold on the Australian markets. The issue is clear. If the desire of honorable senators is to ruin many of our primary producers, they should reject this bill. If they -wish to destroy completely some of the most important primary industries in this country they should urge the people to vote " No " at the proposed referendum. To my mind, the issue is quite clear, and I cannot understand why any honorable senator should oppose this measure. Why should we go back to the days of disorganized marketing, when the producers were forced to accept less than world parity prices? Why should we attempt to reduce the producers' returns? Surely Australia has an unquestionable right to maintain its domestic economy. A principle recognized by all parties is that our secondary industries should be protected. If primary industries are to be thrown to the wolves, why should not the secondary industries share a similar fate? Why continue the. protection of the tariff? If the primary producers are to be denied a reasonable amount of protection, the only logical course to pursue will be to revert to the policy of freetrade for all sections of production in Australia. </para><para>A charge often levied against primary producers in Australia is that under the cover of marketing schemes considerable exploitation has occurred. It has been argued by certain interested persons who desire the proposed alteration of the Constitution to be defeated at the referendum that the tariff should afford sufficient protection to the primary industries. I point out that for eight years the dried fruits legislation has been in force, and that no exploitation of the people has resulted from it. The duty on dried fruits is 6d. per lb., but during the whole of that period of eight years the Australian price has been only Jd. per lb. greater than the export parity price. Is there any evidence of exploitation in these facts? The position with regard to butter is similar. The local price is ls. 3d. per lb., Australian currency. Who will say that exploitation has occurred in regard to this commodity? The experience of the past should be our guide in determining future policy. The primary-exporting industries are merely asking for a right which is clear and unchallengable. Whether the words employed in the bill provide adequately for the desired alteration of the Constitution may be open to question, and this possibly requires a decision by the High Court, but the intention is merely to revert to the position that was thought to obtain prior to the recent decision of the Privy Council. </para><interjection>

                        <para>. - It seems to me that the inescapable and logical conclusion to be reached, if we accept the statements of the last two speakers, is that the bill should not contain the proposed new provision, but should provide for the introduction of unification. The contention advanced by the Government is very difficult to understand. Section 92 of the Constitution merely provides that trade between States shall be absolutely free. In 1921, members of the High Court seemed to have great difficulty in understanding the meaning of the words " absolutely free." They declared that the section did not bind the Commonwealth. It was staggering to be told that the meaning of those words was not the same as we were taught to attach to them when we were at school. The Privy Council gave to the words an interpretation which everybody had thought to be the right one prior to the judgment of the High Court in 1921. If the High Court considers that " absolutely " means " partially," I should like to know what interpretation it will place upon " marketing." I have no doubt whatever that " marketing " would cover almost every activity in the Commonwealth. I desire to help the primary producers as much as I can, but let us do things with our eyes open, and not camouflage the position. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> said something about restoring the <inline font-style="italic">status quo.</inline> I point out, however, that the proposed new section would confer powers greatly exceeding those believed to have been enjoyed prior to the decision in the <inline font-style="italic">James</inline> case. As I understood the matter, , formerly, if any State Parliament desired to enact marketing legislation, it would arrange for the Commonwealth Parliament to pass supplementary legislation to enable the marketing scheme to be put into operation. But the amendment proposed in this bill far outsteps this position, and at the same time will practically nullify section 92. It states that section 92 shall not apply to marketing, although the Constitution provides that there shall be absolute freetrade between the States. We must not forget that we have been sent here for the purpose of protecting the rights of the States. Whilst we should do the best we can for the Commonwealth as a whole, the States look to us to safeguard their rights. If proposed new section 92a be accepted without any -amendment, section 92 will, to all intents and purposes, be deleted from the Constitution. It would be utterly futile to retain it. </para>

If we are going to do something to assist the primary producers we should not tell them these  tarradiddles.  Does the Minister mean to say that the people think that the measure relates only to primary production, when the term used is " marketing"? They believe that there is another and sinister motive behind the proposal. </para>

                            <para>- They have had many chances, and they have not said it. That was not the intention of the founders of federation, for, in the framing of the Constitution, the residuum of powers was deliberately left in the hands of the States. Ten referendums have been held in Australia in the last 30 years, and two and a half have resulted in an affirmative vote being cast. Of the two and a half to which I refer, one and a half related to proposals calculated to confer benefits on the States in the matter of State debts, and that ' is why the people voted in favour of the questions submitted. The other proposal endorsed by the people was one to determine the day of the year on which the term of office of senators should end. That matter could not be regarded as of prime importance; indeed one might even have a doubt as to whether that question was wisely decided. The fact remains that it is an extremely difficult matter to carry a proposal at a. referendum. I have had some experience in this matter. I can assure those honorable senators who have not been through such a fight that it it is, undoubtedly, an uphill contest, In  consequence of an agreement between a majority of both political parties 1 supported the affirmative side in the referendum taken in 1926. It was agreed, so to speak, between the two political parties that the proposals should go to the people but that relating to industry and commerce was defeated by 1,619,655 votes to 1,247,088 votes. There were small majorities in favour of the proposal, <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> New South Wales and Queensland, and adverse majorities up to about 2-^ to 1 in the four other States. In regard to essential sources the voting was: "For, 1,195,202; against, 1,597,793. The real point when a proposal is submitted to the people by means of a referendum is whether the agreement of the States has or has not been secured. In that instance the support of the States was not given, and neither of the questions put on that occasion was carried. One of the powers proposed to be conferred upon the Commonwealth - that of essential services - appeared to be necessary, but it was not granted. No one can suggest that there is agreement in regard to the proposal now before the Senate. I presume that every honorable senator has read the report of the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers held in Adelaide, and the complete failure of the attempt made to obtain an agreement in some form between the Commonwealth and the 'States. A little while ago the Leader of the Opposition said that those who opposed this proposal represented predatory vested interests ". I have the impression - I may be wrong - that the Government and the Premier of Western Australia are opposed to this proposed alteration. </para>

                            <para>- I admit quite freely that what the Government is doing is an endeavour to assist primary production. That, however, has not always been its attitude towards primary production, particularly in con nexion with its trade diversion policy, which cannot be said to assist Australian primary production. This measure is designed to assist certain sections of primary producers by extending the powers of the Commonwealth, instead of exercising the powers which it already possesses to deal with the difficulties which have arisen. The Government will find that the people in at least three of the States, and possibly more, will say that as it already has the necessary power it is useless asking for more extensive powers. The Leader of the Senate said that if this proposal is not adopted, it will mean the end of the settlements on the River Murray; but that statement does not coincide with a remark of the Attorney-General, who admitted quite frankly that the Government could assist the primary producers by other methods; but that such methods would not provide a system of orderly marketing. That is entirely different from destroying the prospects of those on the river Murray settlements. </para>

                            <para>- They are' not. I do not think that this bill is as important as some honorable senators suggest, because I am certain that the Government intends to assist the industries concerned. The Government has chosen this method, but as its proposals have not any chance of being adopted, it will eventually be compelled to utilize the powers which it now possesses. The three principal industrial! at present concerned are wheat-growing, dried fruits, and dairy produce. For years assistance has been given to wheat-growers without any alteration of the Constitution. Many persons in Australia had grave doubts as to whether marketing legislation such as has been passed was valid, and when the Wheat Products Bill was before the Senate last year I made my position very clear. On that occasion I said - </para>

                        <para>I do not propose to discuss the merits of the bill at all. The Minister who introduced the bill into Parliament explained that this scheme could not be put into operation until complementary legislation had been passed by the State parliaments. That has not yet been done. Therefore, this appears to me to be an attempt to coerce the States, either now or -later. <inline font-style="italic">A</inline> bill re-imposing a flour tax for an indefinite period has already been introduced into this </para>

                    <para class="block">Parliament, so that at present it is quite unnecessary for us to proceed with this measure. There is also the constitutionality of this matter to be considered, and, from that point of view, it will be better to wait until the question of the control of interstate trade is settled by a decision of the Privy Council, as that particularly affects clauses 8 and  1.1  of this bill. For those reasons I am opposed to the bill being passed at present, apart altogether from its merits or demerits. </para>
                    <para class="block">I felt certain that when the matter went to the Privy Council it would be found that section 92 does hind the Commonwealth just as much as it binds the States. Tn the past we have been able to assist the wheat-growing industry without an alteration of the Constitution. 1 do not wish to go into the whole history of the dried fruits industry, but it will be within the knowledge of honorable senators that two views have always been expressed in respect to the control of dried fruits. The number opposed to control has increased recently. in the nonirrigated areas in South Australia the numbers are practically equal, but in the irrigated areas the numbers are, perhaps, three or four to one in favour of control. There have always been two groups. So far as I can form an opinion, control of the industry has been most effectively carried out by honorable, sensible, and sympathetic men, who have in the main tried not to coerce their opponents, but to work with them. There has been more co-operation this year when there appeared to be doubt as to whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline> would win his case before the Privy Council. Those engaged in the dried fruits industry did not ask for this system; it was not their desire that it should be introduced. Their original suggestion was that there should be an excise duty, and that those who supported the quota system should have their proportion remitted to them. A later suggestion was for an excise duty and a bounty. In order to make the position perfectly clear I quote from the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Dried Fruits News</inline> of the 20,th August, 1926, in which is set out the result of the appeal in the <inline font-style="italic">James</inline> case.

                            has, on several occasions, stated that he would not be adverse to an excise plus export bounty scheme, and illogical as this is to his idea of cheaper fruit for Australia, it may be that such a method will have to be adopted in lieu of the present quota system.

I am not very conversant with the dairying industry, particularly from the viewpoint of my State, because South Australia lias never been associated with the Commonwealth dairy control system.

Honorable senators must consider that there are only two or three industries in difficulties. We must ask ourselves - are we prepared, and will the people of Australia be prepared, as suggested, to take the risk of handing over power to any Commonwealth Government, no matter how it is constituted, to control every industry, primary or secondary, merely on account of the relatively small number of people now concerned ? Until <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milieu</inline> spoke on this bill, one would have thought there was complete unanimity within Australia with regard to this matter, apart from the few "predatory vested interests " to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> referred, and some leaders of thought in Australia. Will the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Brennan)</inline> give me any idea as to whether the wool interests have expressed themselves as being in favour of this referendum ? </para>

                            <para>- If the Commonwealth obtains the power which is sought in this bill, the wool industry is liable to he controlled under it, and some of the wool-growers, at least, are aware of that. I say further that if there is any doubt on the subject, and the wool interests are asked their opinion in regard to it, they will he found not to be in favour of the extension of the Commonwealth's power. Large numbers of wheat-growers also are not in favour of it. With regard to the general question of control, I remember fighting when I was a member of the House of Representatives against government control of apples. Despite my opposition, however, the bill was carried by an overwhelming majority, and became law, but the apple-growers themselves turned down the scheme; they refused to be controlled. </para>

So far as I can form an opinion on this matter - I am speaking of my own State - there is a general apathy in regard to this proposed referendum. </para>

When that issue was before the people, in addition to canvassing my own electorate, I went into a Labour district whose representative was not allowed to speak in favour of the amendment.

                            <para>- That brings me to the whole subject of pools, particularly compulsory pools ; I am not a pooler. I think that in pools there is difficulty in detecting mistakes, which does not obtain in connexion with what some might term disorganized marketing. It is very difficult to follow the financial side of the operations of pools; all we know is that so much of a certain commodity is sold for so much, but we cannot check up on the various operations, and judge whether or not those in control of the pool have exercised good judgment. Moreover, there is almost invariably a tendency when pools are formed to attempt to dictate prices. Everybody knows that that has happened in the past in connexion with various pools that have been established; and some of the difficulties associated with the wheat industry in Australia during recent years have been due to the establishment of wheat pools in North America. In' Great Britain to-day there is increasing public opinion against the British attempts to bolster up the prices of primary products. I may be asked whether I think there should be any form of control. I have for years said that there is one form of control, one step essential if we are to sell our goods overseas, and that is that, such goods shall be passed as suitable for export abroad. After that, I  would  leave it to the growers to sell how, when, mid to whom, they desired. </para>

                            <para>- I should like to give the honorable senator an instance in connexion Avith the former honey pool in South Australia. Following the establishment of the pool, prices were raised, with the result that a considerable number of additional persons engaged in bee-farming, with consequent over-production. But contemporaneously there were fewer -buyers because of the rise of prices. People said : " We shall not buy honey; we shall buy jam." The result was that the honey producers received the double impact of high prices causing a reduction of the number of purchasers, and an increase of the number of producers because of the high prices. Eventually the pool went out oF existence. </para>

Nobody can predict exactly what will happen in regard to the proposal in this bill. I may say, however, that several years ago I predicted what would happen in later stages of this matter. Hitherto it has happened. I also prophesied that if a referendum were taken on it, a negative vote would be recorded unless the subject-matter were clearly restricted, and if this referendum is taken it may meet with no better success than earlier stages. </para>

But I fear pools, because I know that they can, and, in my opinion, will inevitably, be turned against the primary producers seeking them. The control which they seek in order to get a maximum price will be utilized to force on them a minimum price because they will be in a minority. </para>

                            <para>- Other people think so. It is said that there was a general belief that the Commonwealth had the power, but it is obvious to any one who reads the report of the federal convention that the framers of the Constitution had no such intention. Frequently in this chamber the Leader of the Opposition claims that what matters is not the letter of the law, but its intention. I disagree with him, for in dealing with laws, we must follow the letter. We can only guess the intention. However, the intention of the framers of the Constitution is clear. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin, Mr. Barton, Mr. Turner, Sir John</inline> Downer, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Isaac</inline> Isaacs spoke in favour of absolute freetrade. Of their intention in that respect there can be no doubt. They insisted that trade should be absolutely free. We have, therefore, not only the intention, but also the legal judgment of the Privy Council, which shows that that intention was expressed in legally sufficient and effective words. Any one who has any doubt about it has only to read sections 92 and 107 of the Constitution. Section 92 is known to every honorable senator, but the provisions of section 107 are not so well known. That section provides - 107. Every power of the Parliament of a colony which has become or becomes a State, shall, unless it is by this Constitution exclusively vested in the Parliament of . the Commonwealth or withdrawn from the Parliament of the State, continue as at the establishment of the Commonwealth, or as at the admission or establishment of this State as the case may be. </para>

                    <para class="block">In other words, powers not delegated to the Commonwealth are reserved absolutely to the States. This is the way that the man in the street, particularly in the smaller States, regards the situation; and that is what will be the main factor in this referendum. I do not say it for the purpose of disparaging any government, but the man in the street is of the opinion that there has been a reaching out by the Commonwealth for additional powers, insteadof attention to those powers, such as defence and external affairs, which were specifically delegated to it. He believesalso that there has been an intrusion into fieldsof taxation which was not intended in the days of the federalconvention. That intrusion may, or may not, have been justified, but the fact remains that it was not intended. There has been an intrusion also into matters of health, because of the power delegatedto the Commonwealth in regard to quarantine, and because of the power of the purse. In regard toroads also, the power of the purse has led the Commonwealth to intrude. The Commonwealth has also assumed powers in regard to wireless broadcasting and aviation. People are asking why no referendum has been held with regard to those subjects, failing agreement with and action by the States. I understand from the press that a referendum will be taken in regard to aviation. </para>

                    <para>SenatorDUNCAN-HUGHES.- There is anotherlotof powers which the Commonwealthhasassumed, but which have since been taken from it. The situation which has arisen bears out what some of us have been saying in this Parliament for some time, namely, that the Parliament has gone a long way beyond the powers which were allotted to it. Whether or not the Commonwealth should have those extra powers, the fact that it has exceeded its powers is made evident by the quashingby the High Court of regulations, and by decisions in some cases which upsetwhole systems of laws. The decision of the Privy Council show's clearly that the Commonwealth has assumed powers which, in fact, it does not possess; and, consequently, the man in the street asks why the Commonwealth has assumed them, and then, when it finds that it does not possess them, asks the people for such power. </para>
                    <para>SenatorGuthrie.-Every one thought that the Commonwealth possessed those powers. </para>

                            <para>- Is there any likelihood of its decision being upset ? Personally, I am in favour of the control of aviation and broadcasting by the Commonwealth, for noother authority could control them effectively. If it is obvious that certain powers should be vested in the Commonwealth, why not approach the people, by way either of a convention or a referendum, and ask for them? It would be better to do that before assuming such powers, than to act, only to find later that the Commonwelalth is legally incompetent to dowhat it has done. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know. Some day the people of Australia may agree to some form of unification voluntarily; but it will be only after they are convinced that it will provide a fair deal all round. They have not that confidence at present. In saying that, I am not saying that the present Government has not done move for the smaller States than any other Government has done. The fact remains, however, that dissatisfaction is still very evident in the smaller States. I should think that senators representing the three smaller States may fairly be expected to take a stand against the drive towards unification.I read in the newspapers recently that the Government is going ahead with its referendum proposal, having reached an understanding with a group of members of Parliament that, later, consideration will be given to the granting of fuller industrial powers to the Commonwealth. In other words, it is being allowed to bring in this referendum proposal as a return for something larger which it may give in the future. </para>

As I was saying, the suggestion that we should now seek to get an amendment accepted by the people, and later on have a wider referendum, does not appeal to me. I am not prepared to give a possible something for what I regard as an almost' certain nothing. That is my attitude. It is not for me to say what other course the Government should adopt. That is its responsibility. My concern is to say that I consider that this referendum will not be passed by the people, and that in my judgment the Government's best course is to act within its existing powers. lc has the power to act, and why does it not use it instead of asking for powers which, in my opinion, will not be granted?' </para>

                            <para>- Most certainly I do not. I invite the attention of honorable senators to an excellent speech made on this subject in the South Australian House of Assembly on the 29 th September by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. R.</inline> J. Rudall, who represents the Barossa electorate. He traversed, rather from the State point of view, the whole history of the legal actions associated with this matter right down to the present time, a task which he is eminently competent to do. Although he said that he desired to know the exact terms of the amendment before stating whether or not he would oppose it, his whole speech was a criticism of the proposal to deal with this matter by a referendum to secure more powers for the Commonwealth rather than by the exercise of the powers of excise and bounty which the Commonwealth already possesses. He dealt, for instance, with the intention of the founders of the Constitution, and went on - </para>

                        <para>The  point now arises as to whether there are any other unchallengeable powers in the Constitution by which the same end may be achieved. I address myself, therefore, to this question at issue and say most emphatically that the same object can be achieved by other means: that although one road to the desired objective has been declared closed another remains open, and no constitutional objection can bo raised to its use. Is there any one bold enough to assort that by the exercise of the  excise  and bounty powers contained in the Constitution the Commonwealth Parliament cannot achieve the same objective? If the end desired by the legislation is the maintenance of prices in Australia which would compensate for the unremunerative prices which may from time to time he received in the export market, than an excise duty, the  proceeds  of which will bc ultimately distributed in the form of a bounty, will meet the  same  objective. This was the remedy which, I understand,  was  asked by those concerned in the industries immediately affected. From thu practical aspect, therefore, it seems apparent that this remedy would be sufficient. From a constitutional point of view it cannot he attacked, and my authority for this is the speech of the Commonwealth Attorney-General himself. </para>

At present I am convinced that it is essential for the smaller States to stand firmly together, and if the people of the smaller States desire to resist, as I believe they should resist, the inroads of unification and the usurpation of their rights, then they must send to the Senate only men prepared to fight upon that ground, and who are prepared even to refuse the acceptance of any office that may weaken the unbroken front they should present. Unless  they  do this then the smaller States will continue to lose their attributes of sovereignty which are their rights and will increasingly  become  merely subordinate departments of a  Parliament  in which the predominating influence will be the larger cities of Australia. </para>

The honorable senator is suggesting that my action to-day is inconsistent with my attitude in 1926. The two issues are entirely different. So far as giving general powers to the Commonwealth is concerned, if, after ten years' experience in this Parliament, during which I have observed the raising of the tariff wall and the gradual financial drift of the smaller States, I say that I am not now prepared to give to the Commonwealth the extended powers which I was prepared to give then is inconsistent, I shall accept the odium for such inconsistency. </para>

I suggest that we ought to exercise our own fully-considered judgment on this matter.

                        But I take it that a Tasmanian senator should look at this matter as it affects the interests of his State. I have been for a considerable time a member of governments that have had to deal with appeals by primary producers for assistance to their industries. We have had more appeals for assistance from more sections of primary industry in Tasmania than from any other State in the Commonwealth. Those appeals nearly all arose from a set of circumstances due to disorganization in the industry, and in nearly every case where assistance was given it had to be accompanied by some stipulation that the industry would do something to help itself by some form of reorganization. In other words many of these appeals came to the Commonwealth because of the lack of organization in the industry and because of lack of the means of orderly marketing.

                        PEARCE. - The honorable senator is quite wrong. The suggestion is that the present proposal would interfere in some way with the trade and commerce power of  the  States, but the trade and commerce power of this Parliament is limited to trade and commerce " with other countries and among the States". That limitation  is  found in section 51 itself, and does  not  depend on section  92.  Therefore there can be no dread spectre behind the word " marketing ". Senators Millen  and  Duncan-Hughes pointed out the very obvious fact that the duty of the Senate is to safeguard State rights. I hope  that  they do not assume that only those honorable senators who oppose the bill  are  prepared to stand for the rights of the States. Some of us consider that by supporting the bill we shall also support State rights. What are State rights, and what is a State right  in  respect  of  the subject of marketing! Here, let  us  say, is  a  State that desires  to assist its  primary producers by means of orderly marketing. Whether we believe in  orderly  marketing or not, if we favour State rights we must believe in  the  right of a State to assist its primary producers by the means which it thinks fit;  but  the State finds that it cannot do that because the people of another State can, by reason of the freedom now declared by the Privy Council to be enjoyed under section  92,  defeat the object of legislation passed  to  assist producers. Thus the right of  that  State has been destroyed ; because  of the  judgment of the Privy Council it  has no  right to protect and assist  its  own primary producers.
                    </para>
                    <para>I shall not leave the matter there. I point out that this right at one time existed. Prior to federation, every colony had the right to assist and protect primary or any other industries within its own borders. Is it imagined that when the people of the colonies joined the federation they intended to destroy their rights? What was federation? It was merely a distribution of powers. Certain powers were to be exercised federally and certain others were to be exercised by the States. Nobody intended that  some  powers should disappear altogether and cease to be exercisable by either the Commonwealth or the States. Yet that is what has happened. Schemes for orderly marketing could have been carried  out  completely and absolutely by  any one  of the six colonics, prior to federation. They could have not only  devised  such schemes within their own borders, but they could also have prevented their destruction through intercolonial competition, and could have regulated marketing so as to cope with the competition of foreign trade. </para>

                            <para>- No.  They  did not give up any of the powers  they  enjoyed when they federated. They thought that they redistributed the powers in this way: As it was essential in connexion with federation that there should  be  interstate free trade, they thought that each colony gave up the power to interfere in that regard. But they believed that the power reposed somewhere, and  so  did the High Court. For years the court held the view that, whilst the words  of  section 92 bound each State, they did not bind the Commonwealth. The interpretation of the High Court was that the power reposed in the Commonwealth. Therefore the people  as  federal electors  and  the same people as State electors, enjoyed the same powers and not less power than they had before federation. Those who talk of State rights are not  the  champions of the States which they claim to be when they take up this attitude, but would deprive the people of a right they had before federation. </para>

                        <para>It seems an extraordinary position that there should continue to exist a gap in the legislative powers of the people of Australia. That, to me, is the main issue which must be decided by the Commonwealth and the States . . . Obviously, however, in bringing about federation and the establishment of a Commonwealth Parliament the people intended to amplify and extend their legislative powers. They had no desire to stultify their rights of self-govern ment. Consequently, the power to regulate trade and commerce between the States should reside somewhere. Under a federal system the only authority that can operate it effectively is the federal authority ... I remember a few years ago a fierce and bitter controversy as to who should control grading for export. The matter was submitted to me by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rodgers,</inline> then Minister for Trade and Commerce. I asked myself: Is it desirable to have uniform grades and standards for export in respect of dairy and other produce? Obviously that question had to be answered in the affirmative. The question then arose: How is this uniform control to bo exercised? Obviously only the Commonwealth could exercise it because it had authority in all the States. As a result we have the Commonwealth exercising authority in regard to uniform grades and quality for export. I venture to say that those who opposed it a few years ago would not desire now to go back to the old system of each State fixing its own standard, with resultant confusion in regard to quality and grades on our markets . . . </para>
                        <para>The right thing to do is to take legislative powers and exercise them for and on behalf of the people of Australia. The gap in the Constitution is one that must be bridged at the earliest possible moment, otherwise the people will be stultified in the exercise of authority which they must have to give a fair and decent deal to all sections of the community . . . </para>
                        <para>I am prepared to recommend to my Government that an amendment of the Constitution should take place to bridge the gap. </para>

                        <para>The other suggestion put forward can he regarded as a temporary measure. The securing of an amendment of the Constitution is a long and tortuous proceeding, so I suggest that in the meantime the bounty and excise powers should be operated to bridge the gap temporarily. However, the exercise of t 110 se power, and their implementation by the Commonwealth authority may create a fresh problem. Often a Statute is found valid, but regulations under it are <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> It is a complicated matter to control marketing throughout Australia of all the products sold within Australia and exported, and, therefore, it will be difficult so to devise a system of bounty and excise as to achieve the objective and keep within the Constitution. It may be held that any operation of the bounty and excise provisions aimed at defeating the provisions of section 02 will be invalid. Great care must be exercised in drafting and giving effect to such provisions. The orderly marketing of primary products is an essential part of our legislative system. It is immaterial what may have been in the minds of the people who agreed to the Constitution 36 years ago. </para>

                    <para class="block">At that time the proposed alteration of the Constitution as now- drafted had not been framed. Under the bill the power cannot be exercised unless the States first legislate in regard to marketing schemes. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> said that the Commonwealth Parliament had ample power to deal with this matter, but what power, I ask, has the Commonwealth without an alteration of the Constitution ? It is the power to impose excise and pay the proceeds of excise by means of bounties. Yet excise and bounties do not deal at all with orderly marketing, which is the very thing that has saved the dairying and dried fruits industries. 1. know a good deal concerning the history of the dried fruits industry, because I was the Minister controlling the Development and Migration Commission which conducted an inquiry into the conditions in the industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MassyGreene</inline> will remember that extraordinary action was taken before that inquiry was held to save this industry from utter ruin. </para>

                            <para>- Large sums of money had to be expended, not merely because of unpayable prices - subsequently prices did not improve - but also to enable the industry to get on a business footing. At that time, there was complete disorganization in the industry, a lack of marketing methods, and a low standard of efficiency. I invite honorable senators to peruse the report of the Development and Migration Commission on one of the most valuable investigations conducted by that body. The report revealed a shocking state of inefficiency and lack of organization in the industry. The drying sheds were more or less hopelessly inefficient, there was no standard of quality, cut-throat competition prevailed, and, generally speaking, the industry was dying on its feet. </para>

                        PEARCE.Exactly. The commission recommended not doles of money, but that the industry should be organized and proper business methods introduced. In consequence of the commission's recommendations, a number of the drying plants were amalgamated and made efficient, and, to-day, the whole industry is on an efficient commercial basis. Arrangements were made for the control of marketing in Australia and overseas, and a Dried Fruits Export Control Board was appointed. But all our efforts could have been defeated by men like James had it not been that, in the matter of orderly marketing, each State, in cooperation with the Commonwealth, gave legislative effect to the commission's recommendations in order to prevent pirates from -going over the borders and  destroying the effect of the legislation in States which had asked for control.

I applied the term " pirates " to those operating under conditions contrary to those laid down by the States. These men came in to reap the harvest which they did not help to provide. How could a system of orderly marketing be conducted under excise duties and the payment of bounties? An excise scheme does not touch that essential point at all. Such a system could not regulate the trade between the States which is essential in an orderly marketing scheme. One State provides standards and quotas, but the producers in another State can by disregarding the regulations destroy the effectiveness of the scheme. </para>

                        I cannot imagine the honorable senator supporting an excise duty on dairy produce, dried fruits and wheat. Consider the complications that would arise in federal finance if millions of pounds were being poured into the Federal Treasury in the form of excise, and millions being paid out by way of bounties. Another objection to the suggestion is that there would be no per manency in such a scheme. There is no guarantee that such a scheme would extend beyond a year or beyond the life of one parliament. Political parties would be bargaining and competing against each other. I ask

                        PEARCE. - I do. I am confident that when the people understand the proposal they will say that it ought to be agreed to. When I read the statements made from time to time concerning the proposal to-be submitted to the people by means of a referendum, I am convinced that many persons, including some who are members of this Parliament, do not really know what is intended. Some have an entirely wrong conception of what is proposed. Those engaged in industry should have some guarantee of permanency; they should not be in doubt from year to year as to what their actual position is to be. Our secondary industries are guaranteed some degree of permanent protection in that Customs duties are not altered until they are inquired into and reported upon by the Tariff Board. Why should not the primary producers have some better guarantee than an excise duty and the payment of a bounty which could be altered from year to year? The impermanency of such a policy is one of the fundamental objections to dealing with the subject in that manner.

                        suggested that industries not wishing to be controlled may be brought under this scheme, but I point out that there has never been an instance under Commonwealth or State legislation where an industry has been compelled to come under a marketing scheme. A poll has always been an essential part of the legislation.

                            <para>- Perhaps I misunderstood the honorable senator. Commonwealth legislation is ineffective unless complementary legislation has been passed by the States; the States must initiate the legislation. Commonwealth legislation would have no effect unless complementary legislation had been passed by the States. The State legislation deals only with one phase of marketing, the internal regulation of the industry. </para>

That is all that this proposal  involves. I hope that, if honorable senators feel , they cannot vote for this bill, they will give better reasons than we have heard so far. The reasons given for the opposition to the bill appear to me to be due to an entire misapprehension of. what the proposed alteration of the Constitution means, and the relations of the Commonwealth and the States in regard thereto. </para>

                        <para>. - I agree with honorable senators who referred to this hill as being one of the most important we could discuss. Naturally, having that view with regard <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> it, I have taken much interest in the speeches delivered on this bill, and also' in the causes that are responsible for its introduction. May I say at the outset -that I know as well as most honorable - senators the .difficulties that have' surrounded the establishment of the dried fruits industry of Australia on a  sound  basis. I .shall be the last man <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> do ' anything to' jeopardize an industry -which is so useful to Australia, and which has proved to be the foundation of the best example of closer settlement I have seen in Australia. I well remember when I first visited the Murray irrigation settlements and saw for the first time the difficulties confronting the growers there. No one was more pleased than I when the industry was brought under proper and effective control in the interests of not only those engaged in it, almost all of whom are returned soldiers, but also the people generally. I have appreciated the success which has Attended the operations of the .dried fruits industry ever since the organization which now controls it was made so effective by legislation. I appreciate to the full what has been done for the butter and dairying industries of Australia. If I <inline font-style="italic">r.ra</inline> compelled to criticize this bill, I hope honorable senators will be' gracious enough to recognize that I do so with the very best of intentions, and wi.th no desire to injure any industry ; my only desire is to prevent injury being done to industries in future. I listened very carefully to the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings,</inline> who opened his address on the bill to-day by saying that, with the progress of time, it becomes essential that the Constitution be reviewed and, perhaps, altered. That may .be so; but there are essential and important parts of the Constitution that cannot be so lightly regarded. That part of the Constitution' which 1 have in mind is section 92, which, definitely states that trade between the States must be absolutely free. .The insertion of that section in. the draft (Constitution, I believe, was one of the main reasons why the State which I help to represent in* this Senate accepted by a large majority the proposal for federation. Tasmanians, occupying an isolated position in Australia, feel very keenly the disability that in any law, no- matter how carefully it be drafted, there may eventually be found loopholes through which very grave injustices may be inflicted, on them. Consequently, anything 1 say to-day must be regarded as the earnest convictions of a representative who is determined to do everything in his power to conserve the interests of the State which he represents. </para>

                            <para>- No; but if State rights are not' conserved we cannot have a prosperous Australia. We cannot have prosperity over the whole of the Commonwealth when we have decadent States. The States' must be protected according to their needs, and provision for that purpose was wisely made in the Commonwealth Constitution. I want it to be understood that, although I am a representative of the State of Tasmania, I am as loyal an Australian as any' honorable  senator in this chamber. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy,</inline> who, from his point of view, delivered a very able speech to-day, said that in this hill an attempt is made to secure a continuation of decent conditions for the. growers. That is quite true. I have every desire to see decent conditions enjoyed  in primary industries. I have no desire to see the men engaged in them forced to accept a standard of living lower than I claim -.for myself. I have as much sympathy with the dried fruits growers as with other sections of the community, and I maintain that they should enjoy the same conditions as are enjoyed by those engaged' in other successful businesses or industries. I point out, however, that the main .reason for the introduction of legislation of this charac-  ter is the fact that this marvellous country is capable of producing enormous quantities of foodstuffs and other commodities far beyond the absorption capacity of its small population. That is at the bottom of the whole trouble. If we exploited our resources to the full we would be able to produce commodities sufficient to meet the needs not only of everybody in Australia, but also people in other countries. That is the reason why it is necessary for us to have some provision by which the people engaged in primary industries may get a reasonable return for their labour. In respect of our exportable surplus which amounts to 50 per cent., if not more of our whole production, we have to accept world's parity. It is essential that something be done to organize our exporting industries, otherwise they will languish. If 2,000,000 or 3,000,000 people could be induced to come to Australia there would be no need to introduce legislation such as that now before the Senate. </para>

The bill should be limited to those goods in respect of which we produce more than we can consume. I desire to include in clause 2 certain words which, to a great extent, would overcome any opposition I have heard to-day to the measure. Everybody understood some time ago that the Federal Parliament had power to do certain things which it had been doing for many years, but this power was contested by a certain individual, and when the case was taken to the Privy Council that tribunal decided that the Commonwealth had not the power. The Commonwealth is justified in taking steps to endeavour to have restored to it the power which it was thought by everybody to possess under the Constitution. My concern is that we should not give to this Government or any other government any additional powers. Clause 2 of the bill reads - </para>

A number of electors in Tasmania have approached me on this subject, and have said that, if convinced that there will be no possible extension of the power which the Government thought it had before the decision of the Privy Council, they will accept this legislation. They, however, want the position set out clearly in the bill. </para>

In the Parliamentary Library I was told that the printing of the report of the conference was being undertaken by the Government Printer of South Australia, and that, although the draft had been forwarded to him, it had not been completed and returned. I was, therefore, forced back on what I was informed by the Library officials was the fullest account available, namely, the report in the <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> of the 28th August, 1936, which stated <inline font-style="italic">inter alia -</inline></para>

                            in his remarks throughout the day, was unyielding in his attitude that the Commonwealth already possessed ample power., through the medium of excise duties and export bounties, adequately to protect the interests of primary producers. In this he was vigorously supported by the Premiers of Tasmania and Western Australia, who said that it would bc time enough to discuss giving the Commonwealth extra powers if its present powers were chown by experience to be inadequate.

The jealousy and hostility we're such that a person crossing from one colony to another felt that hd was in a foreign country. </para>

There are  some honorable senators who declare that the founders of federation intended that there should be freetrade for all time between the States, and that that is the intention expressed by section 92, but it is just as reasonable to submit that they meant what I take to be the meaning of the opening words of section 51, namely, that the Commonwealth should have power to regulate interstate trade. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly ; I thank the honorable senator. The attitude adopted by some honorable senators and others is almost heartbreaking. When walking down a Sydney street recently, 1 was engaged in argument on the subject of the alteration of the Constitution by a gentleman who used very much the same words as have been used in the Senate this afternoon. In effect, he said that the founders of federation meant trade among the States to be free for all time. * Good heavens, man ! " I replied, " did they say that you had to live 35 years ago? Life can never be static; conditions must change. You are living in 1936, not 1901, and the founders of our Constitution gave us the right to alter it in accordance with the requirements and interests of the nation." In a lecture to the Senate this afternoon, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> claimed that the solution of the problems which had given rise to this measure lay in a great increase of the population of this country. 'He forgot, however, to rem,nd us that when the debate on dried fruits took place in this chamber in . the early part of last year, the fact was disclosed that during the depression in California many hundreds of men were driven off their farms, because they were dependent entirely upon the dried fruits industry, which had collapsed. It was also disclosed that, of all the countries producing dried fruits, including California. Smyrna, and Greece, Australia was the only one in which the producers were at least able to obtain a return of production costs on the sales of their commodity. That was entirely due to the existence of the marketing legislation. </para>

                            <para>- The Australian marketing control legislation is a monument to those who devised it. It had  the  result in the depression years of ensuring to the Australian producers at any  rate  a return covering the costs of production, while producers in other countries  were  being driven off their farms. In Greece, a revolution occurred, I believe, as  the  result of the collapse of the dried fruits industry, whilst in Smyrna conditions became so bad that the Government  of  Turkey had to step in and buy up  the  crops on the off-chance of being able  to  effect sales in the future. The condition of affairs which existed  in Smyrna was  due to price cutting by persons who,  as  James did in South Australia,  took  advantage of marketing opportunities,  to  the detriment of all others engaged in  the  industry. Some honorable senators would allow that condition  of  affairs  to  remain so that there would be  a  prize for the worst quality of human nature - selfishness. Such callous disregard  of  the interests of others is contrary  to the  Australian virtues of fair play  and comradeship  - that readiness  of  men  to share  with their mates, which made the  worker  and the capitalist unite  in 1914 to offer  their all to the country.  These qualities  have built up the great character of  this  Australian nation, but they are  now  threatened, because pertain  people wish  to allow an individual  to  destroy  the local  market by seizing  the  plums  which are  offering from time  to  time. I believe  that  in order that the dried fruits industry of this country  shall not be  forced to occupy the position  into which  the dried fruits industry  of Smyrna was  forced, the marketing legislation in relation to dried fruits and other commodities is well worth retaining </para>

                    <para>The Leader of the  Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator</inline> Collings) has very strenuously,  and  I am glad to say, forcibly  and,  I believe, sincerely, advocated the acceptance  of  this measure. I could wish for  the same  sound Australian point of view  to be  taken by other sections of the Australian Labour movement. I cannot forget  that  in every industry the worker is protected by some kind or other of industrial award. The rural industries themselves might not give to the workers in  them  the same standard of wages and  con-  ditions  as operate outside, but the workers on Uie railways,  which  carry the primary products from the farm to the city, are protected by the industrial courts, and in almost every other direction the same conditions apply. Within the cities and towns the wages and working conditions of the factory employees are prescribed, and if this Parliament refuses the measure of protection to the primary producers that this bill proposes to afford mein, it will be acting very unfairly. I put this question to my Tasmanian friends who are opposed to this measure : if the industries concerned in this proposal go to the wall from what source will the smaller States, which claim grants from the Commonwealth, obtain assistance? It is not at all improper to remind them that, as the other States stand up for Tasmania in the matter of Commonwealth assistance, Tasmania should equally stand behind the great primary-producing industries of the other States, whether Tasmania itself be affected or not. It has been urged that the principal duty of honorable senators is to represent the views of the States which send them here. I contend that our first duty here is to be broadminded Australians. </para>

I appeal earnestly to honorable senators not to forget the fact, which I repeat without wishing unduly to impress it on  my  manufacturing friends, that the success of Australia depends on the prosperity of the primary industries. We should never shut our eyes to that fact. The Senate will be taking a great risk if it denies to the primary producers the protection which the Government's proposal, if endorsed by the people, will give to them. I think that those who devised  the  Commonwealth marketing scheme are indeed to be congratulated, and my vote certainly will be cast in favour of the bill. </para>

                            <para>- The objection which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> raised to the proposed alteration of the Constitution, was ably disposed of by the Leader of the Senate. During the latter's remarks I interjected that the fears of the graziers that the proposed power might be used by some future government in a way detrimental to the glaziers, was unfounded, because, by this bill, the graziers would not be put in a worse position  than that in which they are to-day. For years, governments have had the power seriously to interfere with the business of the graziers by taking control of their exports. It is wrong to suppose that future Commonwealth Governments will be a set of lunatics who will try to cut the graziers' throats. During the regime of the Scullin Government an embargo was placed on the exportation of sheepskins, and that meant a loss which, at that time, the graziers could ill afford. Members of the Country party have often been charged with endeavouring to raise the issue of city versus country. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline> and I visited several country towns some time ago, we found a tendency among people to whom the primary producers might reasonably look for friendly support, to oppose the proposed alteration of the Constitution on the ground that that would be the safer course to adopt. It was surprising to discover that attitude, because the people who live in towns and cities are fully protected through the tariff and wages awards. If the primary producers were left high and dry, and had to appeal to the Government annually for help in the form of bounties, they would never know exactly where they stood. If they were deprived of the benefits to which they considered themselves entitled prior to the recent decision of the Privy Council, such a feeling of bitterness would be engendered as would result in an attack upon the standards of living of the manufacturers and the workers. All classes other than the primary producers are now protected. Surely the primary producers are entitled to similar consideration. </para>

                        <para>.- I consider that each member of the Senate should make a definitestatement of his attitude to the proposal contained in this bill. In my opinion no attempt is being made to introduce new legislation. Power is to be sought to validate legislation which wasbelieved to have been passed in accordance, with the Constitution, but which the Privy Council has ruled to be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> I noticed with interest that Senatop Hardy regretted that the scope, of the measure was not sufficiently wide to enable a compulsory wheat pool to be established.I am glad that it does not so provide. I was particularly pleased to hear his assertion, because, in South Australia, many primary producers are inclined to regard this bill with disfavour, as they think that it might lead to a compulsory pool. The honorable senator said that the provision is not wide enough to cover a compulsory pool. </para>

                    </para>
                    <para>The exact scope of the proposal in the bill isa matter for legal opinion,but I am satisfied that its ambit is not too wide. I do not imagine that anybody would doubt the value of organizedmarketing, and of the legislation passed in Australia to bring it about. The f ruitgrowersin the irrigation areas along the River Murray and the Murrumbidgee, prior to the introduction of organized marketing of their products, were living below the breadline, but the legislation gave them a chance to feed and clothe their children decently and to take their place in the community as useful citizens. It also enabled them to repay loans raised for the purchase of their holdings. In South Australia it was thought that any fruit-grower not complying with the marketing legislation was liable to have his fruit confiscated. In the case of <inline font-style="italic">James</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Cowan,</inline> the Privy Council decided against South Australia. This case, and also the peanut case in Queensland furnished convincing proof that there was a loop-hole in the law. As was pointed out to-day by the Leader of the Senate, the Commonwealth Government was asked to introduce fresh legislation to overcome the difficulty. Unfortunately, the primary producers in some of the States have repudiated their obligation, and have gone almostas far  as  to say that they were not the instigators of the marketing legislation.  I  challenge them to show that if they did not instgate it, they did not make, any protest against, it when it was passed. </para>
                    <para>The worst that opponents of the present proposal can do is to suggest that unreasonable prices have been imposed upon the consumers in Australia by reason of the marketing legislation ; but, during the last six or seven years, the consumers have not been exploited at all on this account, and there is no reason to fear that they will be. Protection, up to 6d. per lb. was granted in respect of dried fruits, but never during the operation of the dried fruits export control legislation has that protection been utilized to the extentof more than 2d. per lb. If the people of Australia had to import sultanas from overseas, they would have to pay £84 a ton for them, yet local supplies are placed on the market at £56 a ton. If there was no danger yesterday, how can there be any particu-  lar  danger to-day? </para>
                    <para>A good deal of the discussion on this measure has been somewhat wide of the mark. An old political trick, when a proposalis unpopular is to submit an amendment and to speak only upon that. This course was adopted early in thediscussion of the present bill in the other branch of the legislature, and consequentlymuch extraneous matter was introduced, such as a 40-hour week, the problem of unemployment, and even the subject of the abolitionof State parliaments. I  am  glad that the Government decided to restrict the proposal to be submitted to the people at the referendum to one simple issue. Since the inception of federation there have been seven or eight referenda, and, according to SenatorDuncan-Hughes, two and a half have been successful. I do not know how the honorable senator obtains the one-half, because I understand that only two proposals, each of which was submitted separately to the people by means  of a referendum, have been successful, one being in connexion with the Senate elections and the other providing for the adoption of the Financial Agreement. According to the speeches of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings),</inline> the members of the Labour party have always supported the interests of primary producers. In this instance the members of that party suggested that, when this proposal is submitted to the people, they should also be asked to grant more comprehensive industrial powers to the Commonwealth. Had that been agreed to by the Government, both proposals would have had the whole-hearted support of the Labour party, and possibly both would have been carried. It must be admitted that, if both proposals were adopted, those whom the Labour party represent would have received much greater benefits than the primary producers. I do not regard the members of the Labour party as the friends of the primary producers; we cannot overlook numerous incidents which have occurred in the industrial arena. For instance, the waterside workers always decide that the most opportune time to strike is when the primary producers have their wool or their wheat on the wharves awaiting shipment. The shearers strike for better wages and conditions when the sheep are in the shed awaiting shearing, and consequently far removed from their ordinary sources of food and water supplies. </para>

                            <para>- I realize that times have changed. For some years ample, labour has been available; but, when conditions in the woolindustry are buoyant, they may again revert to their old tactics of holding up shearing operations, and so seriously affect the returns of wool-growers. Slaughtermen at the abattoirs strike when the producers' fat lambs are awaiting treatment, and the loss of a few pounds on each lamb means a good deal to the owners. </para>

                            <para>- It has been suggested to-day that an alternative to the Government's proposal would be the imposition of an excise duty and the payment of a bounty. It has been said that, as the imposition of Customs duties affords protection to those engaged in secondary industries, the payment of a bounty provided by an excise duty should afford adequate protection to thosee engaged in primary production. We should remember, however; that 90 per cent. of those engaged in our secondary industries carry on their operations under mass production, generally at places where raw material can be obtained readily, and where they have an easy and payable outlet for their finished products. Moreover, their industrial conditions are fixed by arbitration courts and wages boards. Many secondary industries are controlled by companies, which have not a body to be kicked or a soul to be damned. On the contrary, those engaged in primary production are scattered throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth, they have to pay excessive freights, and work so long as daylight lasts. Fully  90 per cent, of the labour is provided by the producers or the members of their families. They 'have to pay Commonwealth and State taxes, district council rates and water rates, and, in common with every other citizen, many indirect taxes. If they have a surplus they have to pay income taxes, 'and if they happen to become bankrupt they cannot reconstruct as do public companies. Only bankrupts who are granted a first class certificate of insolvency have the opportunity to start in business again. A system of bounty based on excise duties would involve excessive governmental control.

                            <para>- Many who are now conversant with the Government's proposal are willing to support it. Under the excise and bounty system an army of excise officers would be required to police it. Careful inspection would have to be made and records kept of the stocks in wheat stores, packing sheds and dairying establishments. Moreover, such a system would lead to various fluctuations and would also result in political parties bargaining for votes. Many of these features were stressed by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> but he did not mention that there was a grave doubt of any benefits being conferred upon those entitled to them. It is possible that under a bounty system all the advantage would be derived by middlemen. We should compare the conditions of those engaged-- in primary production with the benefits enjoyed by those in certain industries sheltered by customs protection which serves as a subsidy to company promoters. That might occur in the industries involved in this instance under an excise and bounty system. This measure affects 'directly 210,000 primary producers, the bulk of whose products is exported. When we remember that 96 per cent, of our overseas funds is provided by primary producers it will readily be understood that primary production is of great importance to Australia. Although 210,000 persons ase directly engaged in primary production, their wives ' and the members  of  their families probably bring the number up  to  750,000 persons. In the past governments have assisted primary producers, but I trust that this legislation will  be  passed so that they will not require the governmental assistance which they have been compelled to seek in recent years. I  do  not believe that the decision in the <inline font-style="italic">James</inline> case will result in trade and commerce being strangled by a system of socialism  or  that it is a triumph of right over might. The traders in Australia, who are just as astute as are those in other countries, do not spend their money on law-suits for the good  of  the country; their object is  to  increase their income. It is the duty of every government  to  protect every section of the community from being so poor and hard pressed that it becomes the victim of exploiters. We legislate  to  prohibit the employment of children under a certain age, and  to  protect employees from exploitation by employers. Surely the primary producers are entitled  to  some measure of protection.

"I could claim a lot more," <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline> said, " but I do not want <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> be vindictive. It ia possible that the Commonwealth will meet the claim without going to court.: but, should it decline to do so, th« matter will bo referred to the High Court ". </para>
            <para class="block">
                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline>
                says that he intends to claim £25,000 for what he alleges to be expenses or damages. Does he suggest that it cost him- that amount to fight the case before the Privy Council, or is that the amount that he alleges that he has lost by being prevented from trading in dried fruit in the way he desired! If he claims to have lost that amount in trading, I should like to know how it is made up. A few years ago he collected approximately £11,000, and it would appear that appeals to the Privy Council have been more remunerative to him than  fruit-growing. Honorable senators will recall the time when it was almost impossible to sell primary products at payable prices. In fact,conditions were once so bad that producers were compelled to accept almost any price.

The best fat lambs would not bring more than 3s.6d. each. Because I do not wish such prices to prevail again, I intend to support the bill. </para>
