Hecame to us with a record oflong and distinguished service to the Empire in general, and we were looking forward to a continuance of that service, with respect to New South Wales in particular.  His  service in the Navy over a very lengthy period earned for him great renown, and he achieved the distinction of commanding the Royal Navy on the China and African stations. Later,he was appointed High Commissioner for the United Kingdom in South Africa. He was the representative of. the Admiralty on the League of Nations Permanent Advisory Commission and, immediately prior to his recent appointment, was Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Newfoundland.

                    <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - It is with profound regret that I inform honorable senators of the death of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom in Canberra, on Friday last, the 6th November. Born in Toowoomba 69 years ago, he received his early education in that town. Passing on to the University of Melbourne, he crowned his brilliant scholastic career by attaining the degrees of Master of Arts and Master of Laws. Later he was admitted to the Bar. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>His association with this Parliament began in 1901 when, on the death of his revered father, the late W. H. Groom, he was elected as member for Darling Downs. He represented that constituency, with one intermission, for a period of 33 years. During much of that <inline font-style="italic">time,</inline> he was a Minister of State; his service as a Commonwealth Minister was somewhat striking for the diversity of the portfolios he held at one time or another. He was, in turn, Minister for Home Affairs, Attorney-General, Minister for External Affairs, Minister for Trade and Customs, Honorary Minister, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Works and Railways, and Minister for Health. He was Attorney-General and Minister for Trade and Customs on two separate occasions. In 1924, he was the senior delegate from the Commonwealth to the Assembly of the League of Nations, and was chairrnain of the First Committee of the Fifth Assembly.. Earlier in that year, he was honoured by  His  Majesty by being appointed as a Knight Commander of the Most Distinguished </para>
                <para>Order of Saint Michael and Saint George. In 1926, he was chosen as  Speaker  of the House of Representatives. He retained that position until the general elections in September, 1929. During his occupancy of the Speakership, he worthily upheld the traditions of that high office. As  chairman  of the Bankruptcy Legislation Committee from 1932 to 1936, he gave of his best in the praiseworthy task of endeavouring to improve an important branch of the statute law. </para>
                <para>I have so far referred to his record of public service as a member of this Parliament and a member of successive Cabinets. In other ways also, his record of service is equally notable. His abiding interest in, and appreciation of, spiritual things is shown by his life-long devotion to the ideals and practices of the church of which he was such a faithful member. His services to literature and cultural movements in general will be acknowledged by those whose privilege and pleasure it was to be more intimately associated with him in his moments of leisure. He was a man splendidly equipped by nature, endowed with a fine intellect, actuated by the highest ideals of service, and unsparing in his efforts for the betterment of his country. A great figure has passed from Australian public life, and many will mourn his passing. Thoughts of his widow and daughter come into our minds at this time. We grieve with them and offer our sympathy to console them in some measure in their great sorrow. I move - </para>

                <para class="block">Littleton Groom from the time he entered the public life of my own State. I also knew his father, and can testify to the splendid service of father and son to Queensland and Australia generally. If it cun he said of any man that he was a cultured gentleman, and that he had a well-balanced nature, that he earned the profound respect of every one with whom he came in contact, that can be truly said of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom. A man of wide education, a lover of literature and of all that is best and most beautiful in life, he was incapable of coarseness of either thought or expression. As a  speaker  he was much sought after. I heard him speak on numerous occasions, on widely different subjects and always with advantage to myself. He ennobled and dignified the simple and the abstrusealike. He will be long remembered by all who love Canberra for his wonderful work in connexion with this splendid National Capital. Before a spade was turned, or a brick laid in, the building of this city, he visualized the Canberra that now is, and what it will yet be. He saw it as Australia's contribution to our national consciousness. He loved its beauty and dignity as few others have done, and in this connexion, as in others, he has left us a legacy worth cherishing. All our hearts go out in deepest sympathy to Lady Groom, whose loss is tragic and irreparable. </para>

                    <para>- I second the motion. I knew the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Riordan</inline> before he entered the Queensland State Parliament, and have had the opportunity to watch his career both there and in the wider sphere of this National Parliament. I have just concluded a tour of North-western Queensland, which included 5 a considerable portion of the vast area which my friend and comrade represented in this Parliament, and I do not think I have ever previously realized so keenly how occasionally there comes out of the welter of public life and service a character which earns, not  only the esteem of the people -whom he served, but their love and affection also. That does not in any way over-colour the picture. Everywhere I went, amongst' his political friends and those opposed to him, I found genuine sorrow because of the loss of a friend. Born and bred in the Queensland bush, accustomed to a life of toil and hard knocks, "Darby" Riordan had that rugged personality, that kindness to all in need, and that faithfulness in the discharge of his duty to his electorate and his electors which endeared him closely to all who knew him, and made him a prominent figure in the public life of, not only Queensland, but all Australia. I tender to his sorrowing widow and daughters, and <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> all other members of his family, the sincere sympathy of myself and my colleagues of the Opposition. </para>

The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Webster</inline> first entered Parliament iu July, 1901, when he was elected to represent the Division of Moree in the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales. At the general election of 1903, he was elected as member for Gwydir in the House of Representatives, and retained that seat until the general election of 1919. During the years 1908 to 1910, the late gentleman was a member of the Royal Commission on Postal Services. In October, 1915, he was appointed Postmaster-General in the Hughes Ministry, and held that portfolio until February, 1920. He was a man of strong personal character, unsparing in his efforts on behalf of the cause he represented, a staunch and true friend, and a colleague in whom one could place implicit trust. I greatly regret his passing, and it is fitting that we should convey to his widow and family a resolution of sympathy. I move - </para>

I understand  that  the High Court has ruled that  allthe  powers which we thought the Commonwealth had in this matter are not, in fact, possessed by it. I am anxious to know whether the Government proposes to  add  a proposal for increased powers in  that  direction to the other matter proposed to be referred to the people by referendum. </para>
