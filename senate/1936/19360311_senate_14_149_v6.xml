          <para>That the Senate records its profound regret at the death of the Eight Honorable Lord Forster, P.O., G.C.M.G., a former Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia, and expresses its deep sympathy with Lady Forster and family in their bereavement. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>It is with deep regret that I have formally to announce to honorable senators the death of Lord Forster in London on the 15th January last. Lord Forster held the office of Governor-General of the Commonwealth from 1920 to 1925. Prior to his appointment as Governor-General he had given many years of his life to the service of the public. Entering the British House of Commons at the age of 26, he continued as a member of that House for approximately 27 years and eventually, in 1915, was appointed to the important office of Financial Secretary to the &#34;War Office, which post he held until 1919. </para>
        <para>The welfare of wounded and returned soldiers claimed his sympathetic interest, and his support, in association with Lady Forster, of charitable and philanthropic movements during his stay in Australia, will long be remembered by those who benefited from this interest. </para>
        <para>The memory of his unfailing courtesy, his kindly bearing, and the ability and dignity which characterized the performance of the duties of his high office will long remain with those who, like myself, were privileged to come in contact with, him. Nor will his interests in many forms of sport readily be forgotten. </para>
        <para>I may mention that when the news of Lord Forster&#39;s death was received in Australia, the following message was sent to Lady Forster by  His Excellency  the then Governor-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Isaac Isaacs)</inline> - lt is with the most profound regret that the people of Australia has received the news of the death of Lord Forster. Australiana will recall -with gratitude the outstanding ability of your late husband during his term of office as Governor-General. The wide measure of popularity and esteem in which ho was held followed naturally from the kindliness and courtesy which were characteristic of him. On behalf of the Government and people of the Commonwealth of Australia, my wife and myself, I offer to you and your family our heartfelt sympathy. </para>
        <para class="block">On behalf of honorable senators I desire to express to Lady Forster and her daughters our profound sympathy in their great loss. </para>

          <para>. - On behalf of the Country party, I support the motion. The Empire and the Commonwealth have sustained a great loss through the passing of our esteemed ex-Governor-General, Lord Forster. Upon his appointment, Australians generally recognized that in him we had not only a distinguished statesman, but also a great sportsman. It is interesting to recall that he was a member of the English elevenwhich, met the Australian cricketers in their tour of 1893. While he was in Australia he made our interests his interests, and our people were his people. We mightwell sum up his character by repeating the words which he uttered on his introduction to us. On that occasion he remarked - </para>
