                            <para>The Prime Minister did express the views to which the honorable senator refers, but the sentence which he quotes if divorced from the context of the Prime Minister's speech conveys an entirely wrong impression of the Prime Minister's views. These remarks were preceded by the following: "The Commonwealth Government had no scheme in mind for the indiscriminate dumping of migrants into Australia " . . . " The Government wish to examine the position to see what could be done without lowering the standards which had been built up". </para>

                            <para>See reply to 1. I can give the honorable senator an assurance that Parliament will be consulted before any scheme for the resumption of migration is entered into. The present view of the Government, after examining the position from every angle, is that it would be premature to embark upon any scheme of migration until there is some further substantial abatement of unemployment within Australia. In any case, as settlement, except within the territories controlled by the Commonwealth, is a matter for the State governments, schemes of migration will not be entered into without the co-operation of the States. </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para>The purpose of the bill is to provide for refunds of flour tax paid by bakers, storekeepers, and other persons, who are not flour-millers, on flour held in stock as at the date of the termination of the tax, namely, the 24th February, 1936. </para>
                    <para>The bill contains provisions which were originally enacted for a similar purpose, but were repealed in December, 1935, when the law was amended to provide for the continuance of the flour tax after the 6th January, 1936, the original terminating date of the tax. </para>
                    <para>The reason for the repeal of the refund provisions was that it was contemplated at the time that the flour tax would continue until the inauguration of the plan for securing a home-consumption price of wheat. The refunding of tax on flour accumulated at a point of time marking both the termination of the flour tax and the commencement of the wheat plan would have resulted in the freeing of such flour, not only from the flour tax, but also from the burden of the increased price, under the plan, of wheat sold for home consumption. This would have led to a serious dislocation of the wheat and flour markets as the time of transition approached, and also to serious competitive anomalies in the marketing of wheat products after the inauguration of the plan. </para>
                    <para>By dissociating the termination of the flour tax from the inauguration of the wheat plan, these considerations have now lost all significance, and it becomes necessary to restore the original character of the tax as a levy on flour consumed in Australia during the period of its operation, that is, from the 7th January, 1935, to the 24th February, 1936. To do this it is essential to provide for refunds in respect of tax-paid stocks of flour held on the 24th February, 1936; otherwise, the tax would amount to a levy on flour consumed after that date to the extent of the tax paid on stocks so held. </para>
                    <para>Honorable senators will realize, also, that failure to provide for the refund of tax paid on stocks held on the 24th February, 1936, would impose serious competitive burdens on bakers holding considerable stocks of flour on that date, as such bakers, until they had exhausted those stocks, would be forced to sell bread made from tax-paid flour in competition with bread made from tax-free flour by bakers having little or no accumulation of flour at the termination of the tax. </para>
                    <para>In addition to restoring the repealed refund provisions, the bill contains other more or less related provisions. In the first place, paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of clause 2 is designed to prevent a miller's refunds in respect of bad debts exceeding the tax passed on by him to his purchasers. Again, there are other provisions so drawn as to prevent the making of two refunds in respect of the same flour, namely, a refund to a baker who held flour in stock on the 24th February, 1936, and a refund to a miller who had written off the sale price of the flour to that baker as a bad debt. It is also desired to obviate, as far as possible, the necessity to hold up refunds until the miller is fully paid for flour purchased from him by persons who held it in stock on. the 24th February, 1936. This is made possible by providing for millers to give undertakings not to claim refunds for bad debts, and, in other cases, for refunds to. be proportionate to the amounts paid off the miller's account for the flour. The necessary legislative provision is made in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> of new sub-section 8 of section 24. </para>
                    <para>The final matter in the bill to which I wish to refer is contained in paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">el</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">e</inline> of clause 2. These paragraphs provide for an amount due as a refund to any person to be set off against any amount owing by that person for tax or penalty under either the Flour Tax Assessment Act 1933-1934, or the Flour Tax Assessment Act 1934-1936, or under any Sales Tax Assessment Act. </para>
                    <para>In conclusion, I desire to inform honorable senators that it is estimated that the refunds provided for by the bill will amount to £100,000. </para>

                    <para class="block">The proviso which it is proposed to omit by this amendment imposes a general condition that the tax to be refunded shall not exceed that part of the tax included in the purchase price of the flour held at the cessation of the tax. The object of this condition was to meet the position in Tasmania, where provision was made by the Government of that State for a rebate of £21s. a ton on all flour consumed in Tasmania. At that time the conditions under which self-raising flour was marketed had not been brought under notice. Manufacturers of self-raising flour fix the price of their product according to the price of flour, the minimum adjustment that can be made being1/2d. per 2-1 b. packet. As the tax on a 2-lb. packet is an amount which comes out to four places of decimals of1d. - . 6048d. to be exact - it was not possible for them to increase their prices by the precise amount of the tax. Different manufacturers of self-raising flour had passed on varying amounts of tax to purchasers of their products and these amounts varied even with the size of the container in which that flour was marketed. </para>
                    <para>Stockholders have not furnished with their claims for refunds information as to the brands of self-raising flour held  by them or the nature of the containers in which that flour was held, and it is not practicable at this stage to obtain this information. In the absence of such information, it is not possible for . the Commissioner of Taxation to compute the amount of tax refundable as being passed on to the stockholder. This amendment authorizes refund to be made of the full tax paid on the flour used in the manufacture of self-raising flour, without inquiring whether the full amount of that tax has, in fact, been passed on to the stockholder. It is pointed out that the full tax of £2 12s. 6d. a ton has been paid to the Commonwealth on all flour used in the manufacture of self-raising flour, and that the amount involved in granting a full refund instead of a partial one is negligible. </para>

                    <para>The schedule to the bill which is now before the Senate covers the tariff proposals introduced into the House of Representatives on the 28 th November, 1935, together with the proposals of the 20th March and the 1st April, 1936. Incorporated in the proposals of the 28th. November, 1935, were the schedules introduced on the 6th December, 1934,- and the28th March, 1935. A memorandum which has been circulated to honorable senators gives a comparison between the proposed rates of duty under each item and the rates imposed by the 1933 tariffs.' As the new duties have been in operation for some considerable time, honorable senators will have been able to judge their effect. The economic effect of the tariff on the community is so great that it is fitting that the Senate should give the closest consideration to the proposed alterations of the schedule. </para>

                    <para class="block">The Ottawa agreement, entered into in 1932, dovetails with the policy enunciated in 1931. To this policy have been added two new features, namely, provision for treaty-making, which was endorsed at the last election, and the adjustment of protective duties to exchange. These new features are not contrary to, but are parallel with, the policy enunciated in 1931. </para>
                    <para>In 1931-32, when the Lyons Government came into office, the number of persons employed in factories in Australia  was 337,000. This number rose steadily until, for the quarter ended December, 1935, it reached 459,000- the highest factory employment figure in the history of Australia. Concurrently, the percentages of unemployment among members of trade unions has consistently declined from 30.0 per cent, in May, 1932, to 13.4 per cent, in February, 1936. </para>
                    <para>The value of output from Australian factories - that is, the selling price at the factory of all products manufactured during the year - increased from £282,000,000 in 1931-32 to £360,000,000 in 1934-35. The value added by factory treatment was £111,000,000 in' 1931-32 and rose to £140,000,000 in 1934-35. Other indices, such as value of new buildings, savings bank deposits, share values and company reports, all tell the same story of greatly increased prosperity. While it would be idle to claim that the Government's tariff policy has been the sole cause of this return to prosperity, I do claim that it has been no mean factor. A continuation of the previous Government's policy of prohibitive duties would, doubtless, have benefited a number of Australian manufacturers, but at a price to the consumer. </para>
                    <para>A comparison of our exports to United Kingdom in 1928-29, and in 1934-35 shows that chilled and frozen meat has risen in value from £3,500,000 to £6,700,000; butter from £6,400,000 to £8,900,000-, eggs from £200,000 to £1,100,000; and wine from £400,000 to £700,000. Reciprocity in trading is a truism, and we could not hope to export at the greatly increased levels unless we fixed our import duties at a level which would permit of reasonable competition by goods from the United Kingdom. </para>
                    <para>Much has been heard_recently of a great increase of imports, and apprehension has been expressed regarding the trade balance. I am happy, therefore, to -be able to say that the preliminary figures regarding overseas trade for the period 1st July, 1935, to 18th April, 1936, show a favorable balance of trade amounting to £21,650,000 sterling, which, I am sure, honorable senators will agree is very satisfactory. It should be remembered that only about 14 per cent, of the total imports represents goods competitive with Australian products; the balance, consisting mainly of capital goods, raw materials, tools of trade, motor chassis, and oils, provides employment for our Australian workmen. </para>
                    <para>As I previously mentioned, the Government's tariff policy provides, <inline font-style="italic">inter alia,</inline> for tariff making, after public inquiry, through the Tariff Board, and not by arbitrary ministerial action. This system of tariff-making has proved an unqualified success, and manufacturers and importers alike give testimony to the skill and impartiality of the Tariff Board. Not one Australian industry, other than a few industries which were clearly uneconomic, has been prejudicially affected by the recommendations of the board. It has acted as a public watchdog, ensuring that manufacturers, while receiving sufficient protection to enable them to secure a liberal return on capital invested, are prevented from charging excessive prices to the public. The result has been to reduce the cost to dependent industry, and likewise the cost of living generally, and to stimulate the volume of trade and, consequently, of employment. Criticism has been made recently that the Tariff Board, while requiring full information regarding factory costs and profits from local manufacturers, has not asked for similar information from overseas manufacturers. In this regard I may say that, wherever such information is necessary to arrive at a decision, the board obtains it through the customs overseas representatives, or by other means. It should be remembered, however, that the measure of protection which is required by an Australian industry depends, not upon the cost or domestic selling, price of the overseas article, or the percentage of profit obtained, but upon the export price which determines the landed cost of the competitive article. Further, the board's recommendations are not based solely upon the information published in the report, but are largely founded on information regarding both local and imported goods, which the board has to treat as confidential. </para>
                    <para>In the House of Representatives, on the 17th June, 1930, the Right Honorable J. H. Scullin, then Prime Minister, made the following statement: - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>It is no doubt equitable that a trader should be able to obtain a reasonable profit on the sale of goods, hut what the Government has to guard against is that manufacturers are not taking undue advantage of the protection afforded by the tariff by charging unnecessarily high prices, acting in restraint of trade to the detriment of the public, or acting in a manner which results in unnecessarily high prices being charged to the consumer for his goods. Under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">[h)</inline> of sub-section 1 of section 15 of the Tariff Board Act, these questions can be investigated by the Tariff Board, and if it bo found that an Australian industry is taking undue advantage of the tariff in any of the manners set forth, the Government can then consider what action should bc taken against the particular industry. With the limited powers the Commonwealth has in regard to internal trading, it would appear that the only manner whereby salutary action could be taken against the offenders would be by removal of the protection afforded by the' tariff. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>I admire that expression of opinion, and heartily endorse it. The Senate, in the course of the debate, will be asked to deal with one item in regard to which the Tariff Board has advised that the industry is monopolistic in character, and has brought, the charge of undue profit-taking. Where the board has recommended reductions of duty which may possibly be regarded by some as drastic, 1 would emphasize that it is the wish of the board and of the government, not to cause increased imports, but to force the price of the locally-produced article down to a reasonable level. </para>
                    <para>A new feature of the present schedule is the provision of rates of duty based on the present Australia-London exchange, with a corrective for use as such exchange moves towards parity. In ite investigations, the Tariff Board has ascertained the protection necessary under existing conditions, and has also estimated in each case the protective value of exchange, which varies according to the proportion of imported or exchange-affected material utilized in making the local article. It will be appreciated that this method of dealing with exchange is much more exact and satisfactory than the former method of basing rates of duty on par exchange, and allowing a deduction of one-fourth of the duty or one-eighth of the value for duty, whichever is the less, as an offset to the protective effect of exchange. The new method extends the exchange adjustment, as a rule, to the British preferential, intermediate and general tariffs with the necessary adjustments consequential upon the Ottawa agreement to maintain the formula margins of preference, whereas the old method was applied to the British preferential tariff only. </para>
                    <para>Another new feature of the schedule is the intermediate tariff. It has been re-introduced to provide a convenient avenue for expressing the level of duties which the Government proposes should form the basis for trade treaties. The rates proposed under the protective items of the intermediate tariff express, in every case, a protective level for Australian industry, as well as preserving the margins of preference required under the Ottawa agreement. </para>
                    <para>As a general rule, the rates of duty appearing in the general tariff column of the schedule represent a level midway between the Tariff Board's (a) findings for present conditions and its (4) findings for normal exchange conditions. This practice enables the Government to offer countries with which a trade treaty is contemplated a more favorable rate under the intermediate tariff. </para>
                    <para>In the case of certain items, where the bulk of the imports is from a country with which Australia has a greatly adverse trade balance, the Government has deemed it advisable not to make any reduction under the general tariff, but to retain the 1933 tariff rates. </para>
                    <para>The Government believes its tariff policy to be of the utmost benefit to the community in general, and I trust that the Senate as a body will support this policy. </para>

He referred to the fact that the number of employees in factories in Australia in 1931-32 was 337,000, and with obvious pride he stated that at the end of 1934-35 the total had increased to 459,000. <inline font-style="italic">~No</inline> semblance of fairness was displayed in making that comparison, because 1931-32 was a depression year.

                            <para>- In order to overcome some of the traffic problems in the capital cities of the Commonwealth, the system of one-way traffic was introduced and now it is unavoidable. I venture to say that before we escape fromour difficulties we shall have to investigate some avenues of one-way trade. The Minister read with a great deal of satisfaction, which was heartily endorsed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy,</inline> and with which the Opposition agrees, a statement made by the Right Honorable J. H. Scullin during his term as Prime Minister, to the effect that manufacturers must not be allowed to profiteer behind the tariff wall. But the Scullin Government was displaced amid paeans of rejoicing on the part of the m embers of the present Ministry and their supporters ; and if profiteering and exploitation of the public have been practised behind the protection afforded by the tariff, surely I have the right to ask what action the present Government has taken to prevent it. The Tariff Board, for example, has given a knock to the cement industry, because it considers that the price of cement has been excessive. We shall have an opportunity to deal with that matter during the discussion on the various items; but if this profiteering does exist, why has the Government delegated its responsibilities in this matter to the Tariff Board ? Why does it not state definitely that profiteering by a highly protected industry in Australia is a crime ? </para>

I assure him that the Labour party will range itself side by side with the Government if it develops the courage to take a stand against predatory interests which have been bleeding the country white. I do not propose to detain the Senate at this stage. The Opposition will fight stage by stage every duty which it considers inflicts an injustice upon an Australian manufacturer, regardless of whether the injustice is done by a manufacturer of the United Kingdom or a foreign manufacturer. </para>

                    <para>In conclusion, I draw the attention of honorable senators, and particularly the Postmaster-General, to the remarkable and deplorable state of affairs that arises whenever adiscussion on the tariff takes place in the Senate. The Australian manufacturer is invariably put in the prisoner's dock; he is always on the defensive; and definite, deliberate and destructiveblows are delivered not against some, foreign industry but against the Australian manufacturer and to the detriment of the Australian workers and the public. As a member of this national Parliament, I register my emphatic protest, and shall continue to do so on appropriate occasions, against the practice of continually putting the manufacturers of Australia on the defensive when dealing with the fiscal policy of this country. </para>

                            <para>- I paid close attention to the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition and in my opinion two paramount facts emerge from his speech: first, that the honorable senator is the most ardent disciple of economic nationalism in the Commonwealth; and secondly, that there is a tremendously wide gulf separating the fiscal policy of the Labour party from the fiscal policies of other honorable senators. Before I deal with these facts, I point out that at least one of my prophecies has proved to be correct. Some time ago I prophesied that when the fiscal policy of the Govern- ' ment would be debated, the Leader of the Opposition would not hesitate to attack the Country party and indict it on the ground that it was a free-trade party satisfied to allow foreign manufacturers to overthrow Australian industries. I affirm that the Country party is a good protectionist party; that its fiscal policy is as sound and as beneficial to Australia as that of any other political group in the Commonwealth. But there is a tremendous difference between the interpretations that can be placed on the word " good ". Likewise there is a tremendous difference between the various interpretations of what constitutes adequate protection. I emphasize that the Country party stands for the reasonable protection of all classes of industry throughout the Commonwealth, irrespective of whether they be primary or secondary. </para>

                            <para>- I realized that it would not take long to make the Leader of the Opposition wriggle in his seat. While his speech was most interesting, I consider that it possessed one serious defect: it was based on neither logic nor fact. In an endeavour to bring conviction to the minds of honorable senators, the Leader of the Opposition did not worry about several important considerations which I shall proceed to elaborate. Dealing with the difference that exists between the fiscal policy of the Labour party and the fiscal policies of other honorable senators, it seems to me that, whereas others believe fervently that a recovery of international trade will play a large part in the economic recovery of the Commonwealth, the Labour party bases its theories on economic rehabilitation solely on a policy of isolation. I submit that the one dominant characteristic of the Labour party's political platform is isolation. </para>

                            <para>- We found it also in regard to foreign affairs generally. In fact, the creed of isolation is apparent in every item of the Labour party's policy. I shall cite, presently, certain passages from speeches delivered by the Leader of the Opposition in our tariff debate in 1933, which will brand him as one of the most prominent and determined isolationists in the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>I desire to reaffirm, on behalf of the Country party, its belief that a recovery in international trade is essential to general world economic health. In these days of embargoes, quotas, and uneconomic production - an aspect on which I shall touch presently - it is only right and fitting that a nation like Australia should at least, by the removal of international barriers, give a lead to other nations. For that reason I welcome the schedule contained in ,this bill, for I consider that it can be interpreted as a downward revision of the tariff. It is, in fact, Australia's contribution to international recovery, and should be approved by all who believe that international recovery is essential to the restoration of the economic health of the world. That Australia is responsible for only a comparatively small proportion of world trade and production is no reason why this country should not have the courage to set an example. We must not confine our considerations to international trade alone. We must also consider its repercussions; for the implications that follow from such trade carry us right on to considerations df war. I venture to say that no greater incentive to war is to be found in the world to-day than the trade barriers which the nations have so painstakingly built. The Labour party talks of international brotherhood, but does its best to destroy such a principle by preventing international trade. </para>

There can be no possibility of misinterpreting the Labour party's fiscal policy. The object of the Labour party is, undoubtedly, to make Australia self-contained, and, through an isolation policy, to develop a kind of modern Utopia, from which our people may watch the world go by. </para>

                        Stewart, who has only recently been commended by the Labour party for his advocacy of a 40-hour week, dealt with the. policy of isolation, and its effect on the United States of America in particular, in the report on unemployment which he presented to the Commonwealth Government not long ago.

                        <para>The international nature of this problem is amply demonstrated by the experience of the United States of America, the greatest exponent of the isolationist policy among the nations. Notwithstanding her tremendous home market and seemingly well-balanced industrial and agrarian productivity, America to-day has a greater industrial problem than any other major country, with 11,000,000 of unemployed, equivalent to 20 per cent, of wage earners. If a nation so anxious to stand alone as America, and seemingly so well equipped to do so, can do no better than this, it ought to bt; accepted as conclusive proof that the remedy lies in multilateral, rather than unilateral action. </para>

                    <para class="block">I ask the members of the Labour party to consider whether their present fiscal views will not lead us along the same track as that which the people of the United States of America have followed. I have another opinion to bring under the notice of honorable senators which shows that a complete change of front has been shown by the Government of the United States of America since the HawleySmoot tariff of 1930 was implemented in that country - a tariff, I remind honorable senators, which was very similar to the Scullin tariff of 1932. ' The Honorable Cordell Hull, Secretary of State of the Government of the United States of America, speaking at a world trade dinner on the 1st November, 1934, said - 1,1.- appalling repercussions of the 1030 Tariff Act upon our own domestic prosperity brings home the lesson that in this day and agc the tariff is no longer a purely domestic issue. We learned that a prohibitive protective tariff is a gun that recoils upon ourselves. Thu time was when we could fix the tariff to suit ourselves without serious injury to our exports, then consisting largely of raw materials of which we were the chief source of supply. That day is gone. We now face vigorous world competition in both our agricultural and our industrial products. Slammum the door shut against foreign products, we have found the door shut against our own products. Other countries were forced to raise their tariffs as a means of protection in retaliation for our own exclusive attitude. At last, with most countries frantically building barriers of tariffs, quotas, import licences, and exchange restrictions against their neighbours, international trade has been choked down to a fraction of what it was. </para>

                        <para>With a cessation of our foreign lending, we have found that we cannot continue to export without importing goods. The blocked balances which our exporters are now facing in various parts of the world are the conclusive proof that exports cannot continue indefinitely without an expansion of interest. Foreign countries do not have the purchasing power with which to pay for our goods. They cannot borrow indefinitely. They cannot send us any appreciable additional quantity of gold. We have reached the end of the road. The frail stage of our play-acting has collapsed, and our dream world dissolved. </para>

                    <para>This statement, following upon America's experience of an isolationist policy, should indeed be a lesson to the Labour party of Australia. So much for the operation of such a policy in foreign countries. I shall now submit a statement on this matter made by the Tariff Board in its report in 1933. This is an Australian body which deals with affairs as they exist locally, and, judging by its report, it sees the dangers of trying to make Australia self-contained. It says - </para>

                            <para>- Only last night the Leader of the Opposition said that the people of Australia were divided into two sections, namely, those who do the work, and those who " do " the workers, and he obviously assumed the role of one who does the work. But, if he had his way, and a high fiscal wall were erected around this continent, he would be doing the greatest possible disservice to the Australian workers, because a high tariff immediately causes a rise of prices, and in turn this rise decreases the purchasing power of the workers. I can submit many instances showing that in countries which have established a prohibitive tariff, particularly the United States of America, the consequent rise of prices has been exceptionally high. In support of this contention I shall now quote from the report on unemployment made to the Commonwealth Government by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Stewart, in which he deals with agricultural protection and its consequent price disparity in Europe, and I want the Leader of theOpposition to consider these facts carefully. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Stewart said - </para>

This drastic revision of tariff policy has been forced by the realization that high profits for the manufacturer do not mean higher wages for the worker.

Personally, I can never understand why the Labour party should claim that Australia should be self-contained, for, in my opinion, that objective is neither logical nor sensible. Even a cursory survey of the economic structure of the Commonwealth will show that it would be impossible to dispense with Australia's export trade. The re-adjustment that would be necessary for Australia to become self-contained could not be made without 'appalling results to the nation. </para>

Therefore, any re-adjustment along the lines which I have suggested would have to deal with practically half of our total primary production. When we reflect that approximately two-thirds of Australia's total production is represented by primary products, any re-adjustment along the lines mentioned, even if spread over a period of years, would be impossible. When the Leader of the Opposition advocates a limitation of exports, does he realize that 36.76 per cent, of Australia's total agricultural production is exported? </para>

                            <para>- I come now to the subject of imports. In the House of Representatives, as well as on public platforms throughout the country, the statement is frequently made that the flood of imports is becoming so serious that Australia will not be able to meet its overseas obligations. As the Minister has already pointed out, the position is improving day by day. That improvement, which is a credit to the Government, is an indication of a revival of Australia's export industries. Australia's favorable commodity trade balance for the period July, 1935, to February, 1936, was £9,931,000 compared with £4,575,000 for the same period of the previous year. The total balance on the 18th of April was £21,650,000 expressed in sterling in favour of Australia as the Minister has already stated. In other words, there was a surplus of exports over imports valued at £9,266,000 in 1934-35, and at £16,054,000 in the following year. But one cannot place too much reliance on the balance-of-trade figures. That the Government cannot pay too much attention to the balance of trade payments is clearly illustrated by the experience of two countries which recently endeavoured to enter into a bilateral trade agreement. When they got together and submitted figures, each was astonished to find that it had a favorable balance with the other. The figures submitted to the Senate to-day do not take into account a. number of invisible items, as for instance, tourist expenditure overseas, repatriation of money overseas, and capital invested in this country by overseas interests. Therefore, whenever I discuss the subject of imports and exports, I never take too seriously the figures relating to ordinary commodity balances, because it is impossible to get them on an accurate basis. </para>

                            <para>- I greatly deplore the tendency on the part of leading men in this country, and also members of the Senate, to discuss trade matters on a bilateral basis. It is just as wrong to do that as it would be for one retailer to refuse to buy from a wholesaler because he sold goods to another retailer. The guiding principle that we should adopt in our trade policy is that of multi-lateral trade agreements. It is most entrancing for a negotiator to set down the estimated trade of his country with that of another country in order to arrive at the balance of trade in somewhat the same way as Noah counted the animals as they entered the Ark, two by two; but if the system of bi-lateral agreements is carried to its logical conclusion, it means that every country would have an exact trade balance with every other country with which it dealt. In that event, international money would not be required, because barter would take its place. Such a position would be both fantastic and ridiculous. The making of multilateral trade agreements and the adoption of . their principles are worthy of the serious consideration of the Senate. Only yesterday an attack was made on an eastern country with which Australia has a favorable trade balance. Are we to argue with that country that its adverse trade balance with Australia is purely illusory, and then take up an entirely different attitude so far as the United States of America is concerned because with that country we have  an adverse trade balance? We cannot make flesh of one and fish of the other. I admit frankly that there are certain instances in which we can depart from that principle, and apply, as this Government has done, what is known as the most favoured nation treatment, and I would recommend that this basis be adopted as far as the United States of America is concerned. The United States of America, of course, is one of the most wonderful examples of a nation, one moment asking for multilateral agreements, and the next negotiating on a bi-lateral basis. I submit again, that whatever we do, Ave should not try to regiment our trade on a bi-lateral basis. We should look at the whole principle of international trade. </para>

                            <para>- Let us check this statement about "frightful and horrible " imports of which the chief instigators are Japan and Great Britain. In 1934-35 our imports from Japan, expressed in sterling, amounted to £4,624,000, but we sold to that country goods worth £12,095,000, making a profit of £7,471,000. Does the honorable senator not call that profitable trade? Does he claim for one moment that that trade should be eliminated? He believes that it should be all one-way traffic! Let us also consider the " frightful and horrible " imports from Great Britain. In 1.934-35 imports from Great Britain were valued at £30,78S,000 and we sold to Great Britain goods to the value of £63,569,000, making a profit of £32,781,000. These are economic facts not taken into consideration by the Leader of the Opposition because he is pledged to a self-contained Australia. He and his party are pledged to producing only enough exports to service our overseas debt. He believes in one-way trade. </para>

                    <para>What is really the matter with the Leader of the Opposition? In actual fact it is not the fiscal condition of which lie is complaining. His complaint is against the fact that over the last three years this Government has been successful in bringing to Australia a great degree of returned prosperity. I was particularly interested when I listened, in another place, to the debates on this question of prosperity. I could produce for the consideration of the Senate to-day many figures, such as company returns, share indices and unemployment statistics, showing that prosperity is returning to Australia, but those figures are well known to us all. If, however, the Government requires any facts supporting the contention that the downward revision of the tariff has been beneficial to Australia, they can be found in the additional factory hands in employment at present. The Minister in charge of the bill has already said that factory hands numbered 336,65S in 1931-32 ; 370,727 in 1932-33 and 504,909 in 1933-34. To-day they stand at 459,000. </para>

                            <para>- One very ingenious supporter of the Labour party in another place said that the recent increased factory employment was due solely to the increase of population. That statement has been made, and is being made by supporters of the Labour party; but it is easy to disprove. The excess of births over deaths in this country in 1931-32 was 61,449. Even the most optimistic person could not say that that excess could affect factory employment. The only additions to  the population that could affect factory employment would be the excess of arrivals over departures, but in the year under discussion there was no excess - the departures exceeded the arrivals by 10,094. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; but it is at the school-leaving age, and not when they become adults, that persons enter industry, and moreover deaths of persons between the ages of 20 and 60 in this country in 1934 numbered 18,935. It is only reasonable to assume that their departure for another world made some provision for other persons to succeed them in industry. Let us recognize the facts. Prosperity came to the country because the present Government put forward a wise fiscal policy, which suited both sections of production, secondary and primary. If honorable senators want to know why more factory hands are employed, they should look at the statistics of factories, for therein lies the true story of increased factory employment. The total factories in 1931-32 were 21,657, whereas in 1933-34 they were 23,297. </para>

                    <para>I want briefly to deal with the statement made so often in the Senate that the population engaged in primary pursuits is decreasing, and that the industrial population is increasing tremendously. Those who make those statements do so in the hope that the conclusion will be drawn from figures such as were submitted yesterday by the Leader of the Opposition, that the destiny of Australia lies in secondary, and not primary, industry. The <inline font-style="italic">Production Bulletin</inline> from which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> took his figures, does not take into account seasonal labour, whereas the census does so. I venture to say that the men who pass on from station to station, and the farm hands who go from one property to another are important factors, which are not taken into consideration in the <inline font-style="italic">Production Bulletin.</inline> Moreover, proprietary interests and proprietors are not recorded in that publication. The census figures are, therefore, more reliable than those contained in the <inline font-style="italic">Production Bulletin..</inline> If we refer to the census figures of 1933, it will be found that the swing of the population from primary industries, and the increase of the number employed in secondary industries is not nearly so great, as issuggested by the figures submitted yesterday by the Leader of the Opposition. In 1911, the percentage of the total population engaged in primary production was 13.1, and in 1921 it had decreased to 10.6, but from 1921 to 1933 the drop was only to 9.6, or only 1 per cent, in the 12-year period. According to. the Leader of the Opposition, the industrial figures show a tremendous swing, but between 1921 and 1933, when there was considerable expansion in the industrial arena, according to the census figures which are more reliable than those contained in the <inline font-style="italic">Production Bulletin,</inline> the percentage of the total population engaged in industrial undertakings in 1921 was 8.2 and in 1933 it was 7.7. While I do not deny that there has been a swing towards the secondary industries, which I do not decry, the swing has not been so great or as significant as the Leader of the Opposition suggests. </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Let us analyse the position briefly in order to determine the accuracy of that statement. In 1932-33, when the Ottawa agreement was adopted, Australia sold to the United Kingdom 47.66 per cent, of the whole of its exports, and in 1934-35, the figures for which are the latest at my disposal, the percentage had increased to 52.11, showing that under the preferential provisions of the agreement the primary producers of Australia have been able to increase their sales to Great Britain. Is it still to be contended that the primary producers of this country have received no benefit from the Ottawa agreement? I could also mention numerous examples showing where higher prices have been obtained as the result of the operation of thatagreement. It is well to realize the importance of the British market, because, as I have said on previous occasions, we cannot afford to do anything that will weaken our preference in that market. In order to show to the Senate the importance of that market, I quote the following extract from the <inline font-style="italic">Economic Trade Conditions in Australia</inline> of July, 1935 - </para>

                        <para>The United Kingdom is still by far the largest single purchaser of Australian products, her share in 1933-34 amounting to 51.7 per cent, of the total or more than four and a half times as much as Australia's next best customer - Japan.

The members of the Country party have always advocated the imposition of reasonable duties to protect Australia's secondary industries. We have always said that Australian secondary industries are closely related to the local market for primary products, and we recognize that the local market consumes more than one-half of our primary products. The definition of a reasonable duty is closely related to the Ottawa agreement, because article 10 provides that there must be " full opportunity of reasonable competition". The Tariff Board, in its report for 1933, interpreted that article in these terms - </para>

We, therefore, believe that it is the duty of all Australians to endorse the principles which have been laid down by the Tariff Board and which are contained in the hill now before the Senate. </para>

                    <para>The Labour party is not a party of isolation. It is not- so stupid as to approve any action that will impede international trade. It does, however, believe that no fiscal action should be taken to undermine any Australian industry. Labour has always fought strenuously for the protection of Australian primary and secondary industries. Since this Government has been in power it has reduced the duties on over 1,000 tariff items, and in attempting to meet its obligations under the Ottawa agreement it has encouraged the importation into this country of goods which clash with Australian products. This is in direct opposition to Labour's policy to protect the Australian market for Australian producers. We contend that it is foolish to encourage competition in basic materials and basic industries. The best way to improve international relationships is to raise the standard of living in all countries, and thus promote world trade. </para>

                            <para>- We of the Opposition approach this matter with no vested interests to serve. The majority of those who have risen from the ranks of Labour have no investments in manufactures, breweries, or pastoral properties, and, generally speaking, represent a large section of the community which does not derive any portion of its income from profits. Therefore, we are without bias. The tariff should be dealt with from a national viewpoint. Private manufacturing interests and the interests of those who are engaged in primary production should be subordinate to the national welfare. That, those who have large vested interests of any kind should desire to foster governmental action that will bring to their coffers greater returns than they have hitherto enjoyed, is quite understandable. A private person cannot be condemned for assisting to effectuate that, to him, desirable state of affairs. On the Government side of the Senate are men who not only have big interests, but also represent big interests. Consequently, their efforts towards the implementing of a tariff policy designed to promote national interests, must be somewhat vitiated. That is not a derogatory remark, but merely the statement of a fact which cannot be gainsaid. Any class or section of the community which advocates a particular tariff policy because it will improve its balance-sheet, will naturally support a party which will achieve that particular object. Our aim is, not to give an impetus to one particular industry so that it may improve its financial position, but to advance the interests of Australia as a nation in relation to the economic position of the world. When the time arrives for the Labour party to implement its tariff policy, it will have to take full cognizance of what is happening in the world. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy,</inline> and other honorable senators, would ignore that factor. They prefer to hark back to the good old days; they would put back the hands of the clock. But the economic system operates inexorably, and no government in any part of the world can stay the march of time. We recognize that fact, others do not; therein lies the difference between the Labour party and the tory party, which at present is charged with the administration of the affairs of this country. I admit that governments can assist in some measure the development of a country. A wise government keeps abreast of evolutionary development, and so shapes its policy as to give impetus to it. The members of the party to which I belong have been charged with having continually bolstered up or assisted the manufacturing industries. One section of the community regards the manufacturers as industrial vampires who suck the lifeblood of the community. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> holds that view. On the other hand, some manufacturers imagine that they are industrial innocents who are being slaughtered to make a freetrade holiday. These and many other views are held by members of this chamber. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> expresses the view of the real Country party, while that of the official conservative Country party is sponsored by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy,</inline> who espouses his cause without real regard for the truth. There is also the policy of the Government as enunciated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator A.</inline> J. McLachlan. A Jew other honorahle senators have personal policies. This multiplicity of policies may be a good thing, because in the multitude of counsellors there is wisdom, and among them may be found some common denominator or some principle which embraces the greatest measure of truth. </para>

                    <para class="block">When the Minister was making his second-reading speech this morning, he quoted something which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin</inline> had said on this subject. I asked the Minister, by way of interjection, whether this section of the Tariff Board Act had ever been put into operation, but he ignored my interjection as he was quite entitled to do. My point is that if punitive action is taken against manufacturers in accordance with the provisions of the relevant section of the Tariff Board Act, such action might very well be regarded as a contravention of section 55 of the Constitution, upon which a decision was. given by the High Court in, I think, 1908, in the Harvester case. Section 55 contains the following: - </para>

                    <para class="block">If the High Court was right in 1908 in holding that the New Protection involved the bringing in of foreign matter, it would be equally right, I think, in condemning any government action under section 15 of the Tariff Board Act for the punishment of manufacturers who exploit the public. </para>
                    <para>The Labour party holds no special brief for manufacturers; we regard these matters from a national view-point, but 1 remind honorable senators that on several occasions the Tariff Board has made direct accusations against certain manufacturers to the effect that they have, under cover of the tariff, exploited the public. Only recently such a case was cited in this Parliament, and no doubt we shall hear more' of it. When such accusations are made, it is surely only just that the accused persons should be given an opportunity to defend themselves. As things stand now, the Tariff Board seems to be prosecutor, judge, jury and executioner all rolled into one. </para>
                    <para>I am not convinced that a.11 the facts are being placed before the Tariff Board in regard to English manufacturers who seek to obtain a footing in the Australian market. The Australian manufacturers arc continuously subjected to attacks from certain sections, and the impression is sought to be created that they are, in fact, an economic menace, operating contrary to the best interests of the community. Their competitors in Great Britain, however, are free from such attacks ; they are not brought before the Tariff Board and forced to make a full disclosure of their manufacturing costs, distribution charges, &amp;c. Certain general information regarding British goods and manufacturers is submitted to the board, but we know very well that complete information is never forthcoming. For instance, it is well known that certain commodities suitable for ballasting ships coming to Australia receive the benefit of very favorable freight rates, but that fact is not placed before the board, although it gives to the British manufacturer an important advantage over his Australian competitors. The board calls for invoice prices, freight charges, &amp;c.. in respect of imported goods, and from those figures arrives at its deductions, but the figures do not tell the whole story. Yet, in the terms of the Ottawa agreement, the protection afforded Australian manufacturers is based upon information of that kind, inadequate though it may be. </para>
                    <para>The Labour party is not opposed to the importation of commodities, but it is opposed to permitting the importation of such commodities as can be produced abundantly and cheaply in Australia. It must be borne in  mind  that there are hundreds of commodities not produced in this country, and which can with advantage be imported, but it is stupid and foolish to think that we are going to improve the general economic condition of Australia or of the world by entering into a battle for markets in respect of basic commodities. When certain basic commodities can be produced in Australia, the market here should be conserved for them, and there should be no question of admitting such commodities from abroad. Primary and secondary industries have been established in Australia at great cost, and we have had to fight to make it possible for them to succeed. There should be no question of outside  competi-  tion. We should do everything possible to conserve our primary and secondary industries and so to arrange markets for our export products that the imports,, which we must take in exchange, will raise rather than lower the standard of living. The policy of this and many other governments in the past has brought, about a relative  reduction of the standard of living in Australia, whereas, the policy of the Labour party is to use international trade for the general improvement of the standard of living. </para>
                    <para>I have frequently been charged with-, labouring the subject of  self-sufficiency. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline> enlarged upon this subject, and like a good many others condemned the Labour party because itbelieves in self-sufficiency and self reliance as a means of world peace; lie"even went so far as to say that such apolicy is the cause of war - a mostridiculous statement. As a matter of fact, I think it can be proved conclusively that the old-fashioned form of international trade, in which there was a constant fight for markets for commodities-, that can be produced in abundance, has be?n one of the chief causes of war. Yet,, we heard the " Cromwell of theRiverina ", the gentleman who has seen the light, saying that if we can only foster international trade, if we- can only  put more butter, more wheat.. and more- wool on the markets of the world, international problems will be solved. Any man who uses his brains must see that a policy of self-reliance and of self sufficiency, of letting the world generally know frankly and freely that we stand on our own resources, and will not be dependent on reciprocity and bi-lateral agreements, will do more for the preservation of world peace than all the recent efforts in Europe of the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Henry Gullett)</inline> to sell an extra hundredweight of meat here, and an extra pound of butter there. The nations of the world will then respect Australia just as we respect European countries, the United States of America and Japan when they say that as they can produce certain commodities, they have no desire to import them. When we have reached that stage in our internal development, we can approach other countries with a view to the exchange of surplus commodities. The world is rapid reaching the stage where the standard of living can be raised, and international trade can be placed upon a far better basis than that of a struggle to sell goods which can be produced in super abundance. War, in the main, is the direct result of the constant conflict which is going on between the various countries to sell commodities which each can produce in abundance. Only yesterday, we listened in this chamber to a discussion on wool. Honorable senators know the difficulties presented to the wheat industry because Canada and other countries besides Australia can produce wheat in such large quantities. We know also of the struggle which is constantly going on between Australia and Argentina because the latter country is flooding the market of Britain with its surplus products, and producing in abundance meat which comes into direct competition with Australian meat. </para>

                        <para>The parties to the left of die-hard conservatism are united in a vague conviction that some sort of world state is a desirable goal. Liberal and Socialist politicians reiterate the dogma that economic nationalism means a general lowering of the standard of life. Since we are largely dependent on other countries, this means that in time of crisis imperialism can always reap the benefit of a situation in which sentimental internationalism offers us the alternatives of war and starvation. Both beliefs rest on a ubiquitous, tacit, and all the more dangerous because never explicit, creed that increased material resources placed at our disposal by advancing scientific knowledge make nations more interdependent. It is only necessary to state it in explicit terms to expose its utter falsity. Our mediaeval wool industry had to import incinerated charcoal from the forests of Eastern Europe as a source of potash. The sixteenth century gunpowder industry relied on the manure dumps of India for nitrates. The entire textile production of the world till the middle of last century depended on natural plant dyes. We can now produce all the alkali we wantby electrolysis of brine ... In short, the most significant advances in the application of science to social life during the past two centuries has helped us to find universal substitutes for the endowments which nature distributes in localised areas. </para>

                    <para class="block">The increased application of science to industry has caused developments in Australia similar to those taking place in other parts of the world. We cannot shoot or imprison the scientists, nor can we prevent the dissemination of their ideas. Yet the modern troglodytes say, " Let us put back the clock-, and return to the old days of international trade." According to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy,</inline> some magic result may be expected from shipping our primary products 10,000 miles or more overseas, and bringing them back to Australia in the form of manufactured goods ; but we have to deal with the facts as we find them. Australia produces large quantities of raw materials, and it has sufficient man-power and intelligence to use them to the best advantage. It is the height of folly to send raw materials overseas, seeing that by manufacturing them in Australia we could develop local industries, which would employ our people in producing the goods they need. We on the Opposition side will continue to denounce the utter absurdity of destroying our own industries merely because a certain section prefers to export our raw materials and import manufactured goods.

                        <para>Economic nationalism may be described as a policy with a domestic emphasis. It postulates that the employment of labour and the development of resources are of more importance to a country than the profits of foreign traders. Moreover, many people hold the view that the pursuance of a policy of economic nationalism will eventually make for peace between nations. In this they are supported by the redoubtable <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> M. Keynes, who urges the view that it will " minimize rather than maximize entanglements between nations." For that matter, most modern economists readily agree that frectrade  is not the harmless dove of peace that it is claimed by some to be. Actually, freetrade is but another name for maximum international competition and strife. As such it is wholly antipathetic to the maintenance of peace between nations. </para>
                        <para>Moreover, it must be recognized that the growth of the general idea of national self reliance or economic nationalism is the inevitable corollary of modern technical, agricultural and industrial education, and of scientific research in general. This economic development was therefore inevitable in any case, even had there been no war blockades, submarines, food shortages, and food rationing experiences to hasten it. The lamenting of the inevitable is never a profitable occupation; such, however, occupies a considerable proportion- of the time spent in fiscal controversy. The explorer, Dampier, commenting two centuries ago on some of the natives he saw in the north-west of Australia, described them as " the most  miserablest  people in the world." To-&lt;lay it is not difficult to find a number of Australians who, when contemplating our protective tariff, would place themselves in precisely the same category. </para>

                        Page is evidently a realist to the extent that he would deal with individual items, and decide whether or not we should enter into trade agreements with regard to them. In my opinion, that policy should be applied to individual items which cannot be produced in Australia. The transitional stage through which we are passing should compel us to be frank with the Old Country and with foreign countries. We should adopt the definite stand that we are determined to preserve Australian industries, but that we are prepared to purchase any commodities which are not manufactured in Australia from Great Britain in preference to any other country. The Opposition maintains that that policy is right ; Australia should trade with its own kith and kin before buying from a foreigner. I urge honorable senators to be realists; instead of taking action which would be detrimental to the existence of Australian industries, we should negotiate in regard to individual lines of merchandise and produce, with a view to admitting only those goods which, as
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline>
                        Page has stated, cannot be manufactured in the Commonwealth. If honorable senators decide upon a course which will destroy an Australian industry, we shall warn the Australian people of what is being done; but if the item concerned is not produced in Australia, every member of the community will welcome its importation from Great Britain, and in exchange for it we shall be pleased to sell our primary products. That attitude does not warrant the stupid accusation by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline>
                        that members of the Labour party are isolationists. We would be utterly devoid of common sense if we closed outdoors against all importations regardless of their nature or derivation. By all means, let us rely upon international trade to improve our standard of living. The Labour party advocates the preservation of Australian industries, and we shall not tolerate interference from any oversea manufacturer, whether British or foreign. It also considers that Parliament should be supreme; that it should not delegate its responsibilities to the Tariff Board or permit itself to be bound by any agreement whether signed in Ottawa or Timbuctoo. In my opinion, the view that the improvement of trade in recent months justifies the policy of the Government, the signing of the Ottawa agreement, and the recommendations of the Tariff Board, is utterly fallacious. Practically every country reports an improvement of trade; the majority of them have either actually or almost balanced their budgets. Great Britain has recorded substantial improvements, and other countries report that the depression is passing. But latterly a pessimistic note has been struck, many of the leaders in economics stating that the tempo of improvement has been too rapid and that a tightening up of the money market must take place. Honorable senators will realize what that means. The Lyons Government was criticized in the House of Representatives because it did not know what the Commonwealth Bank was doing in regard to the issue of treasury-bills, and because it professed not to know that the interest rate was being increased in order to reduce the purchasing power of the community, and so lessen the volume of imports and safeguard, the London funds. The Prime Minister
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline>
                        contended that there was nothing wrong with the trade balance, but seven days previously, he had informed the National Club in Sydney that he was worried about the trade balance and the depletion of London funds.

Although an improvement of trade has recently -taken place, Britain cannot be flooded indefinitely with primary products.

                            - The iron and steel industry, which, in all producing countries, is regarded as a reliable barometer in general industrial conditions. The Australian production in 1935 was  668,000  tons over the previous year. This is 79 per cent, of the entire Australian consumption. The number of employees increased from 13,243 in November, 1934. to 14,710 in November, 1935.  Large  extensions have been arranged for. A plant is to be added to manufacture the Australian requirements in tin-plates ( treated iron), last year's importations of which were 58,82(5 tons. Another plant capable of producing the entire requirements in pipes and tubes (of which the yearly importation has  averaged  60,000 tons), came into production dunnar the year. An additional mill to cope with the increasing demand for sheets was laid down. Sheets for

                            bodies will be included in the production. It is calculated that in two years' time 90 per cent, of the  tin-plates.  pipes, tubes, and sheets used in Australia will be locally produced. Australia will then be in a position. in case of emergency and for all practical purposes, to be practically independent of the world as far as iron and steel products are concerned.

I understand that the Government proposes to adopt a definite attitude in connexion with one item of the schedule, and to make it a vital issue. It has already been decided that a certain basic industry, which has factories in practically every State in the Commonwealth, including Tasmania and Western Australia, is to be attacked.

                        <para>.- In listening to the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">'Senator Brown,</inline> I wondered whether he intended to support or oppose the measure now before the Senate. He endeavoured to discredit the present Government for the action it has taken in reducing customs duties, and to justify the unnecessarily high duties imposed by the Scullin Government, of which he was a supporter. I welcome the introduction of the bill, because it represents the first sane attempt to place the tariff on a businesslike basis. For some time Australia has suffered as the result of the action of the Scullin Government which in 1929 illegally and contrary, not only to the letter but also to the spirit of the law, imposed on many items rates of duty which were absolutely indefensible. The honorable senator and those associated with him endorsed the illegal action of that Government taken in defiance of the Tariff Board Act, which is one of the most important measures on the statute-book. Its action in that respect has had a serious effect upon certain small companies relying upon industries which were able to operate only under a prohibitive tariff. I have waited for some time for this anomaly to be removed, and I congratulate the Government upon the schedule which has now been introduced. It will probably be necessary to criticize the duties imposed upon certain commodities, but the measure is a serious attempt to restore sanity in fiscal matters. Many of the rates imposed in 1929 as British preferential duties were so high that it was impossible for any British manufacturer to export profitably to Australia. I am glad that an effort has now been made to remove this anomaly and that the Government realizes the fact that it owes a duty to the Australian people. Moreover, it should set an example to others by observing the laws of this country. I refer honorable senators opposite to section 15 of the Tariff Board Act, which reads: - </para>

                            <para>- I presume not, because any prior law must take second place to the ' Tariff Board Act. This is distinctly laid down in that act, and no law has been passed since its enactment to give the Minister power to act as he did during the regime of the Scullin Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> sought to convey the impression that the Tariff Board dictates the fiscal policy of the Commonwealth. The board does nothing of the kind; it simply carries out instructions contained in the Tariff Board Act. It is composed of a body of men, who are selected very carefully, and it is empowered to make inquiries, and, where it sees fit, to call evidence on certain matters. But it has no power at all to carry into effect its own recommendations. The board is simply charged with the responsibility of  making recommendations to the Minister, and the Minister must bring such matters before the Parliament for endorsement or otherwise. Therefore the suggestion that the board dictates the fiscal policy of the Commonwealth is groundless. </para>

                            <para>- Neither of those articles gives any instruction to the Tariff Board. They merely provide that duties shall not be increased above the level recommended by the Tariff Board. There is no instruction to the Tariff Board contained in the Ottawa agreement. The Ottawa Conference had no control over the Australian Tariff Board; therefore the articles of the agreement apply on to the governments. We have heard a good deal to-day concerning the desirability of refraining from exporting any of our primary products. </para>

                            <para>- I am fully aware of the honorable senator's meaning when he objects to the importation of any goods that could be manufactured in Australia, but whichever way he explains himself it should be patent to him and to everybody that the prosperity of this country depends on our finding good markets for our exportable products, and, further, that when we find such markets, we must, of necessity, buy from those countries which buy from us. The adoption by the white race of the policy advocated by the honorable senator - and I am not now referring to Australia - has brought about  some extraordinary condition of affairs in world trade. In the sixties of last century, the American Government decided to compel Japan to open its ports to the world, and backed by its powerful fleet it accomplished that aim. Because of that action, however, Japan for its own protection, was compelled to intensify its industrial production. It realized that if it were going to buy commodities from other countries, it must itself turn out commodities in order to be able to trade reciprocally. Thus to-day we find that Japan is a great manufacturing country and, of necessity, is seeking outside markets. I claim, therefore, that the white peoples of the world have themselves to blame for the present Japanese competition in trade. Honorable senators should bear that fact in mind. Originally the Japanese did not desire to trade with the rest of the world; they wanted to live unto themselves, but the white peoples of the world compelled them to open their ports with the result that they were forced to take up industry more intensively. They had not previously contemplated such action. </para>

                    <para>Frequently I have endeavoured to show that the tariff which has operated in Australia for the last few years has not been framed in the best interests of the Commonwealth. One section of the community - the consumers - was not taken into consideration until quite recently. I can visualize the possibility that a reduction of tariff duties may bring about such a lowering of the cost of living as will more than compensate for any prospective loss of employment. To-day many people in Australia live in comparative comfort, because of reduced costs of goods which, they must have to enjoy reasonable comfort. The cheapening of the cost of living must prove of general benefit to the community, and I am confident that with a. continual increase of efficiency on the part of our manufacturers, we can reasonably anticipate that commodities will be produced in Australia at a gradually diminishing cost. Thus there has been no necessity for the exceptionally high tariff that has prevailed for many years. This tariff has engendered in many countries antagonism to Australia. Many of the duties are absolutely unnecessary and considerably higher than the mere encouragement of industry in Australia would justify. That fact is realized  in  other countries. Consequently the action of this Government in reducing tariff duties diminishes that ill-feeling which has been engendered abroad by the imposition of the high duties of recent years. I am hopeful that as the result of the passing of this schedule we shall secure a larger measure of trade with other countries. This must of necessity tend to ensure the prosperity and wellbeing of our people as a whole. </para>

                        <para>[3.25]. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - Yesterday, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> asked for a statement on the international situation. The Department of External Affairs will, in response to several requests, issue periodically summaries covering items of current interest in international affairs. The first of these summaries was issued on the 15th April, and I trust that they will prove of interest and value to honorable senators. If there is any subject which individual senators would like to have reviewed, or on which they desire additional information, I shall be pleased to receive any suggestions whereby the value of the summaries to honorable senators may be increased. </para>

                    <para>Interest is still centred mainly in the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, and the Rhineland situation. It is evident from the report of the Committee of Thirteen presented to the Council of the League of Nations on the 20th April that negotiations to bring about, by conciliation, a cessation of hostilities in the ItaloAbyssinian dispute, have failed. The position is that on the 15th April, the  President  of the Committee of Thirteen, M. Madariaga, was informed by the Italian representative, Baron Aloisi, that the Italian Government insisted upon direct negotiations between Italy and Abyssinia, which were not to take place at Geneva. Italy would not allow a representative of the </para>
                    <para class="block">League to be present, but would  report  progress from time to time to the Committee of Thirteen. Italy was not propared to disclose its peace terms to any member of the League, but only to Abyssinia. Finally, Italy was not prepared to cease hostilities during the negotiations. The  President  then saw the Abyssinian representative, who stated that the Italian conditions made negotiations quite impossible. He informed the  President  that the Committee of Thirteen should declan that Italy had declined to negotiate within the framework of the League, and in the spirit of the covenant, in order that the application of all the provisions of the covenant might no longer be postponed. </para>
                    <para>On the 17th April, the  President  reported the position to the Committee of Thirteen, and the Committee agreed that the phase of conciliation initiated by the appeal to the two parties to the dispute on the 3rd March had come to an end. On the 18th April, the Committee adopted the President's report, which .disclosed the impossibility of conducting negotiations within the spirit of the covenant, owing to the fact that Italy declined, to negotiate with Abyssinia through the agency of the League, and that Abyssinia declined to take any action without the League. The Committee reached no verdict as to the allegations relating to the use of poison gas by the Italians, and to Abyssinian atrocities, butdecided to send to the belligerents copies of the jurists' report as to those matters. </para>
                    <para>The report of the Committee of Thirteen was submitted to the Council on the 20th April, and all members, with the exception of Italy, voted for the resolution adopting the Committee's report. The Council also noted the circumstances in which the present attempt at conciliation had failed, and expressed regret at the continuance of the war. It appealed to Italy to settle the dispute within the framework and in the spirit of tha League, and re-affirmed that both parties to the dispute were bound by the Gas Protocol of 1925. No allusion was made to the imposition of further sanctions, but existing sanctions will remain in force. In the circumstances, this course of action is probably inevitable. An abandonment of sanctions at this stage would strike a fatal blow at the whole principle of collective action. The Council has now adjourned until the 11th May. </para>
                    <para>Economic and financial sanctions were imposed against Italy in November of last year by fifty-two nations, which have been involved in considerable financial loss owing to their determination to uphold the principle of collective security against an aggressor State. There is no doubt that sanctions have had a serious effect upon the economic and financial situation of Italy; but they have not proved sufficiently drastic, or rapid enough in their operation, to prevent substantial military success on the part of the Italian armies, which are now within striking distance of Addis Ababa. The Abyssinian forces, which are entirely unequipped to contend against modern weapons of warfare, appear, at the moment, to have reached a stage of demoralization, and this must, to a great extent, be attributable to the use of poison gas by the Italians. Many military experts have hitherto considered that it would be impossible for Italy to achieve a decisive military result in the first season of the campaign; but it now seems that the main Abyssinian armies are at the point of collapse. </para>
                    <para>We are now faced with the position that the machinery which has been set in motion by the League to uphold the principle of collective security has, in the present instance, proved insufficient to prevent an aggressor from continuing to pursue his object, and the situation has been rendered more difficult owing to the fact that the United States of America, Germany and Japan are not members of the League. A decisive effect cannot be achieved by the imposition of sanctions unless they are universally applied. It is possible that had an oil sanction been imposed at an early stage, it would have had a decisive effect; but this is at least doubtful in view of the rapid military success of Italy. </para>
                    <para>Great Britain and the Commonwealth of Australia have, to the full extent of their obligations, adhered to the principle of collective security within the framework and in the spirit of the Covenant of the League. That such adherence was, and is, a reality is shown by the general support of British and Australian opinion. </para>
                    <para>One of the most significant aspects of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute was the determined rejection of the Hoare-Laval proposals by the people of Great Britain, showing the extent to which an enlightened public opinion can, in a democracy to-day, influence the conduct of foreign affairs. The people indicated in no uncertain manner that sooner than  reward  an aggressor with any of the fruits of his aggression - for that appeared to them to be the effect of the proposals - or jeopardize the existence of the League and the principle of collective security they were prepared to accept the risks attendant on preventive action. </para>
                    <para>The attitude of other saactionist powers, and their degree of support of fresh proposals, are obviously determined by the effect of the League policy on vital national interests, and by their political and economic relationship to Italy. It  can,  however, be said that all are loyally  co-operating  in the enforcement of sanctions which have been imposed, despite the fact that some have, as a consequence, incurred considerable loss. </para>
                    <para>It would appear that the whole system which has been established to maintain collective security demands reexamination. The Commonwealth Government agrees with the views expressed at the meeting of the council on the 20th April by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Eden,</inline> and by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> the  President  of the Council, and feels that weaknesses and defects of the existing machinery should be completely surveyed in the light of the present dispute and of the general world situa  tion.

                        <para>Lot mo state without equivocation that the British Government maintains its confidence in the League as the best instrument <inline font-style="italic">at</inline> present available to mankind for the preservation of international peace. It is this conviction, and this conviction alone, which has been, and remains, the motive for all its actions in the present dispute. The British Government is prepared to act in accordance with that policy, now and in the future, so long as other nations do and no longer - to the extent that other nations do and no further. If as a consequence of the final outcome, of this dispute, the authority of the League is so shaken that its future utility as to. the best instrument for the preservation of international peace is placed in doubt, then we shall, each of us, have to consider the policy which in that situation it will be our duty to pursue. </para>

                        <para>It  may be that in the' future <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> ideal, despite all our efforts, may prove impossible of accomplishment, but meanwhile our duty is to persist in the task we have undertaken in attempting to enforce for the first time the provisions of the Covenant.  In  so doing <inline font-style="italic">we</inline> must face the weaknesses, difficulties and dangers that this first effort has shown to exist in the machinery provided in the Covenant.  In  face of the experience of the last six months, it is clear that the whole system we have established for collective security, the maintenance of peace and the rule of law  in  international affairs must be re-examined.  I  believe that the public opinion of the world is now insistent that that re-examination should take place and that the stage be set for its being done. To allow nations to be lulled into a false belief in security, where in fact none exists, and to he led  to  rely on assistance which will not be forthcoming is not a contribution but a menace to the peace of the world. </para>

                    <para>As regards theRhineland dispute, I have little to add to the. review which was given to honorable senators in the current notes of the External Affairs Department of the 15th April, arid to the subsequent, press reports. It can bo said, however, that there is a considerable decrease of tension, and that a certain amount, of the original uneasiness as to the outcome of the occupation of thedemilitarized zone has been allayed. TheFrench and German governments- have submitted proposals upon which they are seeking to base a definite solution of all points of difference between them. On the 9th April the Locarno powers entrusted Great Britain with a mission of conciliation to Germany, for the purpose of elucidating a number of points in the German memorandum, and the consequent discussions will afford ample opportunity for the re-examination of the entire system of collective security.It is a hopeful sign that all parties are agreed that a peaceful solution should be sought by negotiation, and that is, in large part, attributable to the habit of frequent international conference and discussion which has been fostered and developed during the postwar period. </para>

The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J</inline> owett was elected to the House of Representatives seventeen years ago, and remained a member until his electorate was abolished. He and I were for a time the only members of the Country party in this Parliament. He always took a great interest in political and economic matters, and actually addressed meetings on those subjects until about a week before he died. He probably was better known in pastoral and wool circles than any other man in Australia. He was a pioneer of the pastoral industry, and controlled and developed immense properties throughout Australia, many of them in remote districts. My sympathy is extended to his family and others who mourn his death. </para>
