The late senator was for some time a member of the Legislative Council of Western Australia. In 1925 he was elected to the Senate as representative of Western Australia, and was re-elected in 1931. He was a Temporary  Chairman  of Committees for about four years, and was also a member of several select committees of this chamber. The deceased gentleman was personally endeared to us all. </para>

                        <para>- His was a kindly nature, with many lovable qualities. We were all aware that, during the later years of his life he suffered a great deal from the illness to which, finally, he succumbed, and we all appreciated highly the spirit in which, while afflicted with failing health, he  faithfully carried out his duties as a member of this chamber. I know of no occasion when he offended or hurt the feelings of his fellow senators, although he was .a man who held political views strongly and expressed them fearlessly. He had a high sense of public duty, but always was prepared to concede to the opinions of others that sincerity which he claimed for his own.  His  shrewd common sense combined with a vast store of humour made him a delightful companion and a kindly friend. Those of us who were associated with him feel his death very much indeed; we shall miss his genial personality. I am sure I voice the opinion of every honorable senator when I say that we extend to his wife and family our sincere sympathy in their bereavement. Whilst the death of every man who renders useful public service is a distinct loss to the community, the loss sustained by the widow and children is infinitely greater. I move - </para>

Although on many occasions I crossed political swords with our departed friend, I always admired his kindly and tolerant attitude, and was particularly impressed by the way in which he stuck to his work here long after it was obvious to all of us that he needed respite from those labours.

For a number of years <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carroll</inline> was the unofficial leader of the Country party in the Senate, in which capacity he proved to be a wise counsellor to those who served under him.  His  tact, diplomacy and general understanding helped his colleagues out of many difficult situations. The honorable senator&#39;s personality was so distinguished by kindness and courtesy that his passing is regretted by not only the people of Western Australia, but also his many friends throughout the Commonwealth. </para>

It was my privilege to be associated with the late honorable senator for over 25 years, in the Country party movement of Western Australia, and in the Parliament of that State as well as in this Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carroll,</inline> who was for some yean general secretary of the Primary Producers Association of Western Australia, served for a period in the Legislative Council of that State, and subsequently for nearly ten years he was a member of the National Parliament. Always a loyal friend and colleague, he possessed a delightful sense of humour; and although in later years he was in frail health, he remained to the end a faithful and consistent worker for Western Australia, and, indeed, for the Commonwealth, especially on behalf of the men and women on the land. My deepest sympathy goes out to his widow and family in their irreparable bereavement. </para>

                        <para>- Before submitting the motion to the Senate I wish to identify myself with the remarks of previous speakers in relation to the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator William</inline> Carroll. It was my great privilege to be acquainted with him for many years, from the time when he occupied a humble station in the western State, until, by slow degrees, his fellow citizens, recognizing his many qualities and advancing him from one position to another, finally chose him as their representative in this chamber. As has already been mentioned, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carroll</inline> suffered severely in health during the closing years of his life; but at all times he exhibited great courage, sticking to his post through thick and thin, although -it would have been better for his health and personal comfort had he taken a rest, and left to others the duties which he continued to perform on behalf of those whom he represented in this chamber. Putting aside personal considerations the late honorable senator spent himself in the public interest, thus setting a noble example to others. It has been truly said that one must live with a person to know him thoroughly. Of our late colleague I can truthfully say that the better I knew him, the more I loved him. A keen student and faithful interpreter of matters of public interest, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carroll</inline> was also a loyal comrade and good friend. Although we in this chamber feel a sense of loss at the passing of a friend and colleague, his death will&#39; be felt most by his devoted wife. We can only hope that, as time passes, the severity of the blow will be softened, and that she will find comfort in the knowledge that he whom we all mourn to-day left behind him a record of duty faithfully and courageously performed. </para>

                    <para>&#91;3.17&#93;. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - I regret to inform honorable senators that a former member of the Senate, the Honorable <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Albert</inline> Gould, died in Sydney on the 27 th July last, at the advanced age of 89. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Albert</inline> had a very lengthy parliamentary career, which commenced in 1882, when he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales. He was a member of that chamber for sixteen years, and during that period was Minister for Justice on two occasions. It is interesting to recall that ho was associated with the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes in his government. In April, 1899, the late honorable senator was appointed a member of the Legislative Council of New South Wales, of which he remained a member until June, 1901. In that year he entered the Senate as a senator for the State of New South Wales, and was re-elected to that position at three subsequent general elections. He did not seek reelection in 1917. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Albert</inline> Gould attained the important office of  President  of the Senate in February, 1907,  a  position which he held until July, 1910. In 1908,  His  Majesty recognized his public services by creating him a Knight Bachelor. It was my great privilege to know <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Albert</inline> well during our long association together in this chamber, ana I keenly regret the passing of such  a  worthy gentleman. He was known to us as , the possessor of unusual intellectual gifts, which he freely used in the performance of his public duties. His occupancy of the Presidency of the Senate was distinguished by the capable manner in which he performed the duties of that high office. He set a worthy standard for men in public life to follow, and I am sure that the recollection of his many admirable qualities of mind and heart will long be cherished by all who were fortunate enough to enjoy the privilege of his acquaintance. Our very sincere sympathy goes out to the members of his family in the great loss they have sustained. I move - </para>

The deceased gentleman occupied the position which I now hold, when I made my first appearance in the Senate as a political fledgling. During his occupancy of the high office of  President  of the Senate the late honorable gentleman set a high standard that will be difficult to equal. He made has first appearance in the Commonwealth Parliament as a distinguished parliamentarian of long experience under that great political chief and veteran statesman of Empire reputation, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes. He was possessed of rare qualifications for parliamentary service, and, working in conjunction with other eminent men who graced this Parliament at the inception of federation, raised the tone of the debates and the methods of conducting the business of this chamber to a very high level. The confidence reposed in him by his fellows over a long period testified to the rare qualities which he inherently possessed, and it is to be hoped that his career will serve as a pattern and stimulus to rising generations. By emulating the fine example which he set, they will help to preserve the high standard of parliamentary institutions, and so do much for the welfare and progress of this country. </para>

This gap in the constitutional powers of the Parliaments can be filled only by popular vote at a referendum. Therefore, the Government has decided, after an exhaustive examination of all the possibilities, to seek an amendment of the Constitution.

While not pretending that the Government can justly claim credit for all the improvement of which the budget is a convincing demonstration, because many factors which affect the prosperity of a community are quite beyond the control of governments, he claimed, on behalf of the Ministry, that its policy has had a very great influence in bringing about the desirable results reflected in his financial statement. </para>
                    <para>In 1935-36, revenue amounted to &#163;82,203,341 and expenditure to &#163;78,635,621, the excess of receipts over expenditure being &#163;3,568,000. The principal increases of revenue were - </para>

                    </para>
                    <para>In the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department, the revenue exceeded the estimate by &#163;165,000, while the expenditure was &#163;22,000 below the estimate, a net improvement of &#163;187,000. </para>
                    <para>Increases of expenditure over the estimate were, apart from small variations, as  follows :- Federal aic! roads, &#163;279,000 - which was offset by increased revenue from the petrol tax - and relief to primary producers, &#163;1,275,000. </para>
                    <para>Of the total expenditure of &#163;78,635,000, major services of an inescapable nature absorbed &#163;55,237,000, the gross cost of administration of business undertakings and territories was &#163;16,311,000, wheat relief and like payments to primary producers cost &#163;2,450,000, and all other federal expenditure, including administration of all ordinary departments, cost of Parliament, &#38;c, amounted to &#163;4,637,000. </para>
                    <para>Conversions of Commonwealth loans in London since October, 1932, now amount to &#163;198,513,000, and the average rate on the loans dealt with has decreased from &#163;5 Os. lid. per cent, to an average of &#163;3 10s. 2d. per cent. The conversions of London indebtedness carried out with such success by the High Commissioner, during the last four years have resulted in a saving in respect of interest and exchange of approximately &#163;4,000,000 per annum, of which &#163;850,000 accrues to the Commonwealth and &#163;3,150,000 to the States. </para>
                    <para>Since the national debt conversion in July, 1931, eight new loans have been floated in Australia amounting to &#163;S3,546,000, of which &#163;9,429,000 was for the Commonwealth and &#163;74,117,000 for the States. On the average of the last four financial years, the Commonwealth has not claimed the 20 per cent, of loan moneys to which it is entitled under the Financial Agreement. The average taken has been 11.3 per cent. The policy of the Commonwealth has been to keep its loan requirements to a minimum in order to allow State governments as free access as is possible to the loan market. </para>
                    <para>For the year 1936-37, the Government once more presents a balanced budget. </para>
                    <para>From the time that it became apparent there would be a substantial excess of receipts over expenditure in the Commonwealth accounts for 1935-36, the Government has not been without requests and advice from various sections of the public on the subject of its future financial policy. The Government has given consideration to all the proposals, and has endeavoured to do what it considered would be the most likely to benefit Australia as a whole. </para>
                    <para>Notwithstanding the increased sum of &#163;1,336,000 required from revenue for the development of defence and the growing cost of old-age pensions, the budget provides for remission of taxes to the amount of &#163;5,275,000 in a full year and for other new expenditure proposals costing &#163;1,220,000 in a full year. In the present year these revenue remissions will cost &#163;3,868,000 while the expenditure proposals, including defence, will cost &#163;2,311,000. The total cost of the revenue remissions and expenditure proposals in the present budget is &#163;6,179,000. </para>
                    <para>It is proposed to reduce sales tax from 5 per cent, to 4 per cent., involving a  loss of &#163;2,000,000 per annum, while further exemptions to an annual value of &#163;1,000,000 will be provided for. </para>
                    <para>Certain remissions of primage duty are proposed, amounting to &#163;128,000 in. the current year. </para>
                    <para>In regard to income taxation the Government proposes to abolish the special property tax of 5 per cent. In 1930-31 the rate of this special tax wai 10 per cent. In 1933-34 it was reduced to 6 per cent, and last year to 5 per cent. The cost of abolishing this special tax will be &#163;1,300,000 for a full year. In addition, the Government proposes to reduce the rates of normal income tax on individuals by 10 per cent, in respect of both income from personal exertion and income from property. This will cost &#163;435,000 for a full year. </para>

                    </para>
                    <para>The total amount to be paid this year will be &#163;320,000 less than the amount paid last year, although it will still be in excess of the 1934-35 grant. The Government proposes to seek parliamentary approval for these grants. </para>
                    <para>The present federal aid roads agreement between the Commonwealth and the States, which will expire on the 31st December next, will be renewed for six months, and proposals will be submitted to Parliament for new agreements with the States to cover a further period of ten years from the 1st July, 1937. It is proposed that these new agreements shall provide, on existing terms and conditions, for payment to the States of 3d. a gallon on petrol imported and 2d. a gallon on excise petrol, that is, an increase of &#163;d. a gallon in each case over the present rates. In addition, a further $d. a gallon of customs .and excise duties will be made available for the sama period for the purposes of roads, works, or forestry. </para>
                    <para>At the 30th June, 1936, there were 287,235 invalid and old-age pensions in force, an increase of 13,257 during the twelve months. The total expenditure in 1935-36 amounted to approximately &#163;12,800,000, which is the highest amount expended in any one year since the inception of the scheme in 1909. It is proposed to increase the present maximum rate of 18s. a week to 19s. a week, at an estimated annual cost of &#163;760,000. The estimated total expenditure for the present financial year on invalid and old-age pensions is &#163;13,980,000. </para>
                    <para>In regard to maternity allowances, it is intended to liberalize the law by providing for payment of an allowance of &#163;4 10s. for the first child and &#163;5 in every case in which there is any previous surviving issue under the age of fourteen years. The present scale is &#163;4 for tha first child to those with an income not exceeding &#163;208 per annum, the payments increasing according to the number of surviving children under fourteen years of age, up to a maximum payment of &#163;5. The Government proposes to increase tha amount of allowable income from &#163;208 to &#163;221 in cases where there is no previous surviving issue, and to allow a corresponding increase throughout the existing income scale with a maximum income of &#163;312 per annum. </para>
                    <para>The Government has decided to increase the rate of service pensions for certain classes of ex-members of the Australian Imperial Force by ls. a week, to increase by ls. 6d. a week the pensions to children of incapacitated soldiers and to make several other minor concessions to remove anomalies in the existing legislation. The estimated annual cost of these additional concessions is &#163;162,000. </para>
                    <para>In 1931, the salaries of Commonwealth employees were subjected, by the Financial Emergency Act, to reductions, as  part of the plan for the rehabilitation of Government finances. In view of the general improvement of Commonwealth finances, it is now proposed completely to restore the salaries of all Commonwealth employees to the normal rates. &#34;Where the salaries of. employees are, under ordinary legislation, subject to automatic adjustment in accordance with cost of living variations, such adjustments will continue to operate. The present cost of living reductions, as compared with the 1930 standard, total approximately &#163;1,300,000 per annum, and will, as stated, continue to operate. The cost of this restoration in respect of the Public Service and other Commonwealth employees will be &#163;97,000 for  a  full year, and &#163;74,000 for the current year. </para>
                    <para>In respect of allowances to members of Parliament and salaries of Ministers,  a  partial restoration will be made, equal to 10 per cent, of the normal rate. The reductions then operating will be - </para>

                    <para>The trend of recent international events has emphasized the importance of national defence, and the Commonwealth has no alternative, in the present state of the world, but to review our defences and provide necessary safeguards. The defence vote this year will be the highest in the history of the Commonwealth; but it is essential constantly to bear in mind that the burden entailed by preparedness is small in comparison with the human and monetary cost of war. The Government is making provision in this financial year, not only for the amount required for the final stage of the three-year programme, but also for &#163;1,480,000 for the commencement of a new programme. </para>

                        <para>It is extremely inadvisable to suggest, even by way of a question, that Australia has any potential enemies in the Pacific. We trust that all the nations of the Pacific are now, and will continue to be, our friends. If the honorable senator wishes to seek the opinion of the Government regarding .the advisability or otherwise of prohibiting the export of iron ore, or of scrap iron, I suggest that he frame a question without naming any particular country as the destination of the materials. If the question be asked in its present form the Government will refuse to say that Japan or any other country is Australia&#39;s potential enemy.
