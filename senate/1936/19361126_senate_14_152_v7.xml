                        <para>.- I understand that there is need for this bill to be passed this week and therefore I shall not delay its passage by discussing it at length. I cannot, however, allow the opportunity to pass without referring to a matter which has been brought under my notice recently. I refer to the appointment of Trade Commissioners in the East, and the value of the Eastern market. Honorable senators are aware that for some years Australia has exported large quantities of butter, mostly in tins, to the Netherlands East Indies. Indeed, of that country&#39;s total imports of butter in 1932, tinned butter from Australia represented over 96 per cent. Under the Ottawa agreement, Great Britain placed a duty on butter entering the United Kingdom from foreign countries. That was done largely in the interests of Australian producers of butter. Previously, Holland had sent large quantities of butter to Great Britain, but the imposition of that duty meant additional charges amounting to 9s. 6d. per cwt. Naturally, the butter producers of Holland sought another market, and found it in the Netherlands East Indies. The result is that, notwithstanding that Australia has recently appointed a Trade Commissioner to the East, who lives in Java, the export of Australian butter to that country has gradually declined. Whereas in 1932 Australian butter represented 96.7 per cent. of the total butter imported into Java, the quantity in the next year fell to 91.4 per cent.; in 1934 it was 83.6 per cent.; and in 1935 it fell to 82.3 per cent. For the first six months of the present year, Australian butter represented only 77.2 per cent., of the imports of butter into Java. The progressive decline of this trade has alarmed the Australian packers of butter, whose trade with Java had taken over a generation to build. They approached the Government in August or September of this year, and were promised sympathetic consideration and assistance in maintaining a market in the East. That market is undoubtedly of great value to Australia. They also approached the Butter Equalization Committee, only to be informed that the committee was not concerned with the market in the East, so long as Australian butter found a ready market in England. Notwithstanding the promise of the Government, so far as the exporters of butter are aware, no steps have been taken to help to retain the market in the Netherlands East Indies. Tinpercentage of Australian butter to the total imports of butter into Java dropped  to 56.S per cent, in August and September of this year. That is to say, there has been a drop from 96.7 per cent, in 1932, to 56.S per cent, in August and September of this year. I am credibly informed that, unless some assistance te given to Australian packers of butter, the trade in this commodity -with the Netherlands East Indies will cease by February or March of next year. </para>

                            <para>- There has been no increased consumption of butter there during the last three years. The loss of this trade will deprive Australian dairyproducers of a second market, and confine them practically to the English market. I ask the Government to consider this matter sympathetically. It is useless to appoint a Trade Commissioner to Java, in the hope of increasing Australia&#39;s trade with Eastern countries, if he is not to be given every assistance. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Critchley</inline> must view the situation with alarm, seeing that, almost immediately following his appointment, Australia&#39;s trade m butter with Java began to fall. I hope that the Government will examine the matter in its entirety in order to see what can be done to restore to the Australian producer. some of the trade which they formerly enjoyed. Honorable senators are aware that the balance of trade with the Netherlands East Indies is unfavorable to Australia; we import a good deal more from those countries than we sell to them, and with the cutting off of the butter trade, valued at &#163;500,000, our trade position with those countries will become bad indeed. This matter is so important, of such far-reaching consequence, and evidences such short-sighted policy on the part of the butter producers, that I thought it desirable that it should be brought to the notice of the Senate and the Government, so that some steps might be taken to rectify the position. </para>

                                MacDonald certainly has not an Australian sentiment, otherwise he would not have made that remark. We- know that standing armies are the greatest curse that democracies have to face. They create a military caste which would be found ready to execute the will of some man of the butcher type of mind.

                            <para>- In past centuries the army in Great Britain has been admitted to be a curse; it was used during &#39;Cromwell&#39;s day to keep the people in subjection. The present time is not very different from the day of CromwellI advise honorable senators to read history and ascertain what  a  standing army really means. Under that system one-tenth of the population can rule the entire nation. That has been done many times in the past. In making this proposal, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> is a long way behind the times. I was in London in 1911, when a big strike of railway men occurred ; 40,000 trained soldiers were drafted to London by the Government to suppress the strike. That experience confirmed my reading of the evil of standing armies, and I do not think that such a system would be entertained in this country. Take, for instance, the cost of maintaining such a standing army. I suppose <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> would say that now that we have returned to normal times we ought to pay to each of those men a basic wage of about &#163;4 a week. On that basis the total annual cost would be approximately &#163;10,000,000. To our honorable friends opposite cost, even in defence matters, is of paramount importance; with them it  is a matter of money all the time. During the Great War they objected to the introduction of universal service on that account. When it came to implementing Andrew Fisher&#39;s promise of the &#34;last man and the last shilling&#34;, they were prepared to send the last man, but protested against taking the last shilling from their wealthy friends. With them money is the first and last consideration all the time. </para>

                            <para>- Investments in the war debt arc owned by somebody; they are certainly not owned by the workers. Quite a number of people are drawing large sums of money in interest on money loaned to the Government to carry on the war. I would be very glad if the Minister could inform me that every person who lent money during the war in Australia made a present of it to the nation from patriotic motives; but they did not do so; they treated the war as an ordinary business, and have derived huge profits from their investments and business undertakings. Now, when we are asked to suggest means of improving the voluntary system of enlistment, the matter of money is again raised. I do not find any large body of employers throughout Australia to-day saying: &#34;If we get as many young men as we need, we on our part are prepared to pay them while they are undergoing training.&#34; </para>

                        V. MacONALD.Employers generally are not willing to spend money to prepare young men to defend their country; they are quite prepared for them to undergo their military training on Saturday afternoons. It is strange that they do not also expect them to train on Sundays. The only way in which we can attract young men to military service is to provide that such training shall be undertaken in the employers&#39; time.

                            <para>- During the war I was prepared to support conscription of men if wealth also wereconscripted, but the wealth owners of this country would not agree to that. Their sole idea was to get the men, and save their own money. Recently an honorable senator expressed surprise and even alarm because 30,000 persons attended a cricket match in Sydney on Saturday last. I happened to be a spectator at that match, and, I think if it were possible to conduct an inquiry it would be found that an overwhelming majority of those present were ex-cricketers who naturally found considerable enjoyment in watching the game. I do not think that it can be denied that cricket, football, and similar games provide a healthy form of recreation for those who participate in them, and that they also provide an enjoyable form of relaxation for the spectators, many of whom have passed the age at which they can engage in active recreation. Moreover the players receive beneficial training and exercise which would be an advantage to them should the nation require their services. The honorable senator said that the younger spectators at such matches would he better employed in drilling; but surely he does not suggest that they should he denied some pleasure. I would favour a system of universal service if there were similar compulsion in the matter of providing money to meet the enormous expenses incurred. </para>

Large numbers of recruits would be available if they could&#39; be assured that in the event of war their services would be utilized to protect their country instead of safeguarding the interests of the wealthy class. Universal training has not been reintroduced because until recently the ruling classes in this country have been under the impression that another international conflict is unlikely. Compulsory military training which was abolished some years ago lias not been reintroduced. </para>

Now, when there are rumoursof another world war, we hear murmurings of the necessity for introducing universal military training, and of establishing a standing army. Some honorable senators expect the young men of this country to give up all forms of recreation in order to engage in military training so that they may be equipped to resist an aggressor. </para>

                            <para>- They were not likely to do so when they were deprived of their freedom on Saturday afternoons. Universal military training would be acceptable to the majority of the Australian people, if, at the same time, provision were made for  compulsory  contributions to be made to Consolidated Revenue by the wealthy section of this community. The members of the Labour party will always look with distrust upon any system of compulsory training. </para>

                    <para>During the debate on the Constitution Alteration (Aviation) Bill reference was made to the desirableness of employing aeroplanes more extensively for transport purposes and to the possibility of our railways becoming obsolete. Inevitably with the march of time old methods must be discarded, and improved systems, particularly in respect of transport, will be adopted. I do not think, however, that there is any likelihood of any transport system being able to provide the service our railways are now rendering so effectively. In many respects we are lagging behind other countries. Had I my way I should take away the right to make bequests. I read quite recently of a man in Melbourne who bequeathed &#163;1,000,000 to his two daughters. If after death duties on the estate had been paid, the residue were distributed among the people from whom it had been taken by various devices under the capitalistic system, this country would be in a much sounder position economically than it is at the present time. </para>
                    <para>Aviation should be encouraged in Australia; it figures largely in the defence of this vast continent. In the <inline font-style="italic">event of</inline> an attack by an enemy, we do not want to be in the same position as the unfortunate Abyssinians, who had no aeroplanes for their protection. At the same time, we should not let the subject of aviation depress us, or allow the sellers of petrol and of passenger aeroplanes to force their systems upon us with the assertion that railways as a means of transport are antiquated and defunct. For one thing, we must not overlook the fact that many thousands of men are employed in the railways at the present time; if they were displaced by a wide extension of aviation and motor services, the effect on this country would be very serious. Apart from the position of the men engaged in the railways, we must also consider the fact that hundreds of millions of pounds have been invested in this system of transport. During the course of this debate, I was surprised at the airy fashion in which certain honorable senators supporting the Government referred to the railways. The Labour party has often been termed by its opponents the repudiation party - the party that would repudiate debts to the British investors who had sunk considerable sums of money in Australian railway systems. If the vendors of aeroplanes and petrol be permitted to ride roughshod over every other means of transport in Australia, what would become of the railways? And how would the interest on the borrowed money or the principal itself be paid to the British investors ? </para>

Upon noticing the title of this book, I suggested to the honorable senator that human stupidity was so extensive that the author did not dare to tackle the subject as a whole, but that in a modest way peculiar to authors, he styled it &#34; An introduction &#34;, thus allowing the reader to understand that, perhaps, 100 volumes would be necessary to give a satisfactory conspectus of the outstanding mistakes made in history from the time of Moses down to the present day. </para>

                            <para>-I am endeavouring to reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Marwick.</inline> Among the instances of human stupidity which were included in this <inline font-style="italic">Introduction to the History of Human Stupidity</inline> was actually the construction of varying railway gauges in this country. They are certainly a monument to the stupidity of vested interests - for which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Marwick</inline> stands - in the pa3t and of the governments which allow this uneconomic system to continue. I regret that certain honorable senators show a lacie of appreciation of the serious results which may follow the displacement of thousands of railway employees by the indiscriminate introduction of aviation and motor services. We must proceed with considerable caution in this connexion, because of our heavy indebtedness to British investors. The Labour party does not stand for repudiation; the interest upon that debt must be paid annually. But, if unrestricted motor and aerial competition with the railways be permitted, it will not be possible for Australia to continue to meet those payments. I shall support the Constitution Alteration (Aviation) Bill 1936, but the power which will thereby be given to the Commonwealth should be exercised sparingly and wisely. A scheme for the coordination of various methods of transport must be devised in order to prevent motor and aerial transport from picking the eyes out of the goods traffic and leaving the railways to do the heavy and unprofitable traction. </para>

                            <para>- In many respects the honorable senator is correct in his assertion about science, progress, and new ideas. If it had not been for the fact that some &#34; cranks &#34; had formed new ideas on some subjects, our civilization would not have advanced to its present stage. Nevertheless, for every new idea that has been successfully put into practice, there have been 100 others which caused considerable trouble and expense, and were unqualified failures. Because an idea happens to be new, it will not necessarily be a success. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Arkins</inline> will subscribe to that view; he is sufficiently well-read to realize that a generalization cannot be made out of the fact that, because a few new ideas have succeeded, al&#93; <inline font-style="italic">new</inline> ideas must necessarily succeed. I hope that, when the aviation proposal is carried at the referendum, the Australian railway systems will receive consideration in connexion with the competition which they will encounter from aerial and motor transport, and that the three principal forms of transport will be co-ordinated. </para>

                    <para>The final result of the transaction was that the sellers of those vehicles obtained a substantial part of the purchase price, and also the ears themselves. The houses and furniture of the purchasers were heavily encumbered. During the depression, many men who were comparatively well off bought motor cars, but, being unable to afford to purchase the petrol and oil with which to operate them, had to place their cars out of commission and return to the humble horse-drawn vehicle in order to travel 10 miles or so to town. We should not be misled by the frequent statement by . people who are specially interested in the sale of motor vehicles, passenger aeroplanes and imported petrol that we should not attempt to prevent progress. </para>

                    <para>Reference was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> to the need for discovering flow oil in Australia, and producing oil from shale find coal. The  members of the Opposition have received a number of letters from Queensland in the last few years urging us to do everything possible to assist in the production of oil from coal. I do not say that it is impossible to find flow oil in Australia, but the investigations carried out up to the present time have been unsuccessful. It is significant  that foreign oil interests have done their best to prevent its discovery here. There is no limit to the lengths to which big capitalists will go to prevent interference with their business. On a profit of 5 per cent, they will allow the  law  to take its course; if they are making a profit of 10 per cent., a man who  Stands  in their way  is  not safe: but, where a 20 per cent, profit is concerned they will start a war ! I understand that the important experiment carried out at Billingham-on-Tees in England has been successful in the production of oil from coal. Yet, when we ask members of the Government what they intend to do to encourage similar activities in Australia, we do not get an encouraging reply. In Queensland, large coal seams have been located. It has been admitted for many years that on Blair Athol field alone 440,000,000 tons of coal lies unused. </para>

We should not be satisfied with the opinion of any individual regarding a matter of such tremendous importance to the nation as the production of oil. The Government should watch every attempt to produce motor spirit in this country, and it should take quick action to deal with any attempt to thwart development. Australia pays &#163;10,000,000 pe&#39;r annum as tribute to the oil companies of other countries. This could be avoided if we produced the oil we require by utilizing our natural resources. Just as the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> makes a periodical statement on international affairs, a member of the Government should inform us every three or six months by official bulletin of the latest developments in regard to oil production. </para>

                        <para>. - I am pleased to see you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> back in the Chair. One of the minor reasons why I am glad that you have recovered your normal health is that for a fortnight or so I, as  Deputy President,  have had to wear a muzzle, and it  is  quite a relief to be able to take it off  this  afternoon. Year after year, in season and out of season - if it be possible to speak out of season on a matter of such grave national importance - I have dealt with the subject of defence, and the policy being pursued for the time being by the present Government. I have before me volume No. 122 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> which contains the debates that took place in this Parliament from the 20th November to the 13th December, 1929. It is one of the most interesting volumes of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> that I have ever read. On perusing it, I was amazed at the adoption by the Government of the policy which it is now <inline font-style="italic">following. The</inline> volume contains the views expressed at a time when, in my opinion, a grave injury was done to Australia. The opinions are emphatically and wholeheartedly in favour of the policy of universal training which, up to that time, had been adopted since 1910. Honorable senators may there read the opinions of the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator A. J. McLachlan),</inline> the exAttorney.General, now <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Latham, Chief Justice of the High Court, the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White),</inline> the Minister directing negotiations for Trade Treaties <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Henry Gullett),</inline> the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Archdale Parkhill),</inline> the Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page),</inline> and the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson).</inline> All agreed that the only sane, sufficient and efficient, system of military training for the Commonwealth was that which was suspended by the Scullin Administration in November 1929. Beading that, I was astonished that this country is still committed - for the time being only, I hope - to the invariably costly and inefficient system of voluntary training. </para>

                    <para>I desire the Government to understand that I am indulging in friendly and, I trust, constructive criticism. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poll</inline> spoke of a standing army. I have said on many occasions that the establishment of a standing army of professional soldiers would be repugnant to most democrats, although the United States of America, which is a democratic country, has a standing army, the National Guard consisting of 200,000 men. If the Government declines to lift the suspension of part 12 of the Defence Act, it would be of disciplinary value to have a certain number of regular troops  in  Australia. I do not advocate an entire professional army, but we might have some regular troops in each military district. To-day, the militia has no standard to which it can aspire. &#34;We might well have a brigade of infantry and one or two brigades of field artillery consisting of regular soldiers who would set a standard for the  militia.  Should trouble come, I have no doubt that the manhood of Australia will flock into camp as they did in the years that have passed. In that way Australia will have a cadre of instructors who would train the raw recruits. I do not suggest that we should have a regular army; but it would pay us to do as I have suggested - that is, if we have not the courage and the vision to go back to the scheme laid down by that great soldier and administrator, Lord Kitchener, 26 years ago. </para>

He spoke of our army being organized in seven divisions, and said that it would require about 200,000 combatant troops in war. He went on to speak of a skeleton army of 35,000 men, which would be expanded in war to seven divisions. It was a most stupid statement, because it is impossible to do those things in war. The only time when men can be trained for war is in peace. All peace training is war training, unless it is to be a waste of national funds. War training must take place in peace. A recent statement by the Minister, which I read in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> about a fortnight ago is rather illuminating.

                    <para class="block">That sounds all right, but my honorable and gallant friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand,</inline> put on the notice-paper a question in which he asked the strength of the militia on the 30th September last, and the numbers of enlistments and discharges during thu quarter ended September. He received a reply, in the form of a letter from the Minister for Defence, dated the 22nd October, in which he was informed that the strength of the militia on the 30th September was 29,066 all ranks; that enlistments for the quarter numbered 5,512; and discharges, 2,691. That means a net gain of 2,821 during an intensive recruiting campaign extending over three months. Statements made by the Minister recently are, in the main, fatuous, but I do not say that they are not truthful. They are, however, not the whole truth. The statement that it is proposed to stop recruiting is ridiculous, because, of the men now in the militia, about 8,000 are due to go out next year, their time having expired. I do not know the position throughout Australia as a whole, but I do know the position in regard to my old unit, which I commanded for nine years. It is very grave. Numbers of the men, having served their three years, do not propose to rejoin. There is continual need for new recruits to make up the wastage that is (going on all the time. That is one of the difficulties. Men are not coming in regularly, whereas under the old system they came in at a certain period, and went out after a certain period of training. That made possible orderly training and the best use of the men, but such training cannot be given under the present arrangement. </para>
                    <para>Time after time, in this chamber and elsewhere, it has been said that Australia is such a vast country, and has so few inhabitants, that it would be utterly impossible for Australians to defend it. I was pleased to read recently a speech by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin,</inline> the Leader of the Labour party in the House of Representatives, which heartened me considerably. The honorable gentleman said that the only people who could defend Australia were the Australian people themselves. Some of us have known that all along. In my opinion, it is a fallacy to say that Australia cannot defend  itself. It can be done. In this respect, I desire to refer to the example set by Switzerland. The Swiss people started their fight for democracy in the fifteenth century, when they strove to throw off the yoke of Austria. Having succeeded, they started what was the first real democracy. </para>

                            <para>- No. I recommend to honorable senators a study of the <inline font-style="italic">Armaments Tear-Booh</inline> for 1935, issued by the League of Nations. It deals with the form of defence, the army, the armaments, and, indeed, the defence system generally of every country. A soldier finds the references to the Swiss system interesting reading. I desire to compare what is done in Switzerland with what we are doing in Australia. The present population of Switzerland is approximately 4,125,000, compared with 6,766,445 in Australia. Switzerland is a small country surrounded by potential enemies. On the north there is Germany, with a frontier of 367 kilometres. </para>

                            <para>- On the west it has France, with a frontier of 573 kilometres; to the south is Italy, with a frontier 740 kilometres long; and to the east is Austria, with a frontier of 164 kilometres. Another neighbour is  Leichenstein,  with a frontier of about 39 kilometres. Although a small country, Switzerland has 5,321 kilometres of railway. The Swiss army is a citizen militia, and is under federal control. Every year recruits numbering about 25,000 are called upon to render military service. During their first year they remain with the colours for from 60 to 102 days. There are no permanent or regular forces with the colours, although there is a corps of 300 permanent instructors. Having completed their first year&#39;s training with the colours, the first-year men retain their equipment and arras until the period of their liability for military service has passed. Each year about 150,000 men who have rendered their first year&#39;s service come up for repetition training courses lasting for from twelve to seventeen days. As I have said, the Swiss system provides for a federal army, which is under the control of the federal authorities, not -the Cantons. There is a federal council, which is the supreme head of the military administration, and acts through the military department, of which the chief is a federal councillor. In. peace time the military department assumes command of the army, but as soon as a levy of troops is ordered or arranged, the Federal Assembly appoints a Commander in Chief of the army. The first line of defence consists of men between the ages of 20 and 32 years; the second line, or  Landwehr,  consists of men between the ages of 33 and 40; the third line is the  Landsturm,  containing men from 41 .to 48 years of age. Every male citizen in Switzerland is liable for military service. That service is of a personal nature ; it is military service in the strict sense of the term. A man who is not fit for military service has to pay -an exemption fee - a military tax. Citizens are liable for military service from the beginning of the year in which they reach the age of 20 until the end of the year in which they reach the age of 48. Men &#34;who do not render personal service must pay the military tax until the end of the year in which they reach the age of 40. There is a special law dealing with that tax, and exemptions are so difficult to obtain that they are almost negligible. The Swiss system includes the gymnastic training of schoolboys; but, at that stage, the responsibility rests with the Cantons, not with the federal authorities. </para>

Participation in regular courses organized by rifle clubs is also a military duty which has to be performed by privates, lance-corporals, non-commissioned officers, and subaltern officers, who are armed with rifles or carbines. Compulsory courses are carried out each year. Men who fail to complete the regulation course organized by rifle clubs are called up for special musketry duty lasting three days, without pay.

                            <para>- The Confederation. The Swiss army is not expensive and is truly democratic. No man can obtain a commission in it unless he has undergone his second year of training; upon completion of the repetition course a trainee becomes eligible to sit for examination to obtain a commission. In Switzerland all commissions come out of the army; a man who may be a clerk in a big warehouse may be colonel of his battalion, and his boss may be a private under him. Switzerland was prepared for whatever might happen during the Great War. There is not the slightest doubt that the French general staff would have liked to have gone through Swiss territory to turn the left flank of the German <inline font-style="italic">ann j,</inline> and, likewise, the German army would have liked to have invaded Swiss territory in order to turn the right flank of the French army. What happened when the Great War broke and Europe was in a ferment? This little nation mobilized within 24 hours; it did not declare war, but it called up an army of some 400,000 citizens who manned the frontiers, and during the long years of the struggle in Europe Switzerland was left severely alone. The reason for that was that every power, no matter how great, knew perfectly well that if an attempt were made to violate Swiss territory or interfere with the freedom of the Swiss people a nation of trained and skilled soldiers would be in arms immediately, who with cold and ruthless skill could make any invasion of their territory a most hazardous venture indeed. For 100 years or more the little Swiss nation has been left alone. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and its efficiency is amazing. I was interested to read in the <inline font-style="italic">Army and Navy J ournal</inline> and in the <inline font-style="italic">Army Quarterly</inline> the .account of a British staff officer who had been in Switzerland to attend its army manoeuvres. The Swiss army consists of what might be called soldier citizens. The Swiss people are proud of it and are keen to serve their country; if a citizen is not physically fit he is more or less in disgrace in his village, and has to pay his exemption fee. The study of the Swiss army is a most amazing one. I am pleased to see on the Estimates that the training vote this year has been increased by &#163;40,000 over the amount provided last year. The extra amount is needed badly, but is still inadequate. I want to compare the Swiss effort with what we are doing in Australia. A study of British military history brings home to one what an un-warlike people we are; we are not, and never have been, a military nation; we are always ready to muddle through somehow. We have never been prepared. I read recently a very interesting book, written by a great man, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Fortescue, who, for many years was in charge of the archives of the British army.

                        <para>British military history is one long story of unreadiness and of  makeshifts,  the natural fruit of unreadiness. Makeshifts are never efficient, and always costly, which is perhaps. the reason why wc delight in them. For we are a purse-proud people, and when n&#39;t are confronted with warnings from prudent and sensible men, men who have studied history and pondered over the lessons that it teaches, we delight to jingle money in our pockets and say that a little expenditure will set everything right. But money will not purchase time or redeem lost opportunities. </para>

                    <para class="block">I am never impressed when somebody tells me that we are going to spend &#163;1,000,000 or &#163;2,000,000 more this year on preparations for defence; I know that money alone will not save us. There are two paths to preparedness. One is that o&#163; militarism on the continental pattern, which is repugnant to free men, because it means the establishment; of a large standing army in which each man would be compelled to serve his allotted term of years; it means being driven, the breaking down of democracy, and the subtracting of hundreds&#39; of thousands of productive human units from the sum total of the nation&#39;s productivity. The other path, and the one I want to see this country tread, is the path of education - the training and proper development of our boys while they are at school, so that no long period of military training will be necessary when they are grown to make potential soldiers of them. That path can be trod by this nation without upsetting our democratic principles. Physical training of the boys in the schools, followed at maturity by a short period of universal military training, has made the citizens of the Swiss Republic the best soldiers, man for man, on earth. That system has not made Switzerland any the less democratic ; it has not made a militarist nation of that country. On the contrary, it has made it more truly democratic. A system of voluntary military training might have sufficed years ago, but it is not practicable to-day; not only because a sufficient number will not volunteer, but also because of the utter impossibility of training hundreds of thousands of raw recruits when the enemy is almost at our gates. I am afraid that the average Australian is too much inclined to place his personal comfort and convenience, the gratification of his appetites, and the pursuit of material wealth, above the spirit of self-sacrifice that must animate a nation if it is to survive. I am afraid that that poison of indifference has sunk deep, and I suggest that the antidote is universal military training. We must have the men, at least 200,000 of them trained in the use of arms, and officers to command them. I believe that now is the time .to arrest the growth of the cancer with which pacifism has infected our social and political institutions. Those who would never volunteer to undergo national military training must be compelled to do so. Australia, of which we boast so much, and of which we are so proud, must exercise its inherent right &#39;to take such measures as it deems needful for the protection of its own life.  Universial  military service is the only safe and equitable basis of national defence. It cannot be universal unless it is compulsory. The volunteer system is a failure most times, and a dangerous expedient always. I suggest that the more the Swiss system is studied, the more is it seen to be applicable to the Commonwealth of Australia. There is no injustice or favoritism in it. It creates the greatest possible defence against emergency with the least possible expense of time, money and service. Lastly, it utilizes to the full the manhood strength of the nation without unduly interfering with the peaceful pursuits of the people as a whole. I myself believe, and I know it to be true, that it energizes and builds up the physique and sturdiness of its- men without making them professional soldiers. </para>
                    <para>Let me now deal with the arm-chair critic, from whom we hear such a lot. He will say that the next war will be a mechanical one, and that the man will not count. I myself have taken part in two wars, and served for four years in the last one. There has never been a greater fallacy in the world &#39;than that the man does not count. The man has always counted, and he always will. General Homer Lea, in his wonderful book, <inline font-style="italic">The Valor of Ignorance,</inline> says - </para>

                        <para>Warfare, either ancient or modern, has never b.een nor will ever bo mechanical. There is no such possibility as the combat of instruments. It is the&#39; soldier that brings about victory or defeat. The knowledge of commanders and the involuntary comprehension and obedience to orders is what determines the issue of battles. As the instruments of war-faro become more intricate, the discipline, and <inline font-style="italic">esprit de corps</inline> must be increased accordingly. </para>

                    <para class="block">That is quite true; but it can be done only by persistent and patient training in time of peace. If left until the outbreak of war it is too late. -We could not then get cool, calm, collected men who would be masters of their weapons, and who would have confidence in themselves. To send trained men into battle is war. To send untrained men into battle is murder, and a Minister who is responsible for sending untrained men to war deserves to be hanged as high as Hainan. All this ill-informed matter - a lot of it is press propaganda - in regard to defence, the pleadings of the present Minister &#34; that young men should be inspired to serve &#34;, and that their employers should encourage them to do so, is mere flatulence and will not get us anywhere. I was in command of a battalion in Tasmania for nine years, and I know what the employers will do. Every year we had trouble, some of the greatest offenders being those in control of governmental or semi governmental institutions. It was always a . tough job to arrange with the Commonwealth Bank, the Taxation Department, and similar governmental departments to release members of their staffs to undergo training. I was informed from time to time that work could not be carried on efficiently if even an office boy went into camp. I remember the manager of one big business concern in Tasmania ringing me up and saying that his business would be disorganized if a youth whom he employed went into camp at Mona Vale for eight days. I asked what the youth was receiving, and was informed that he was getting 30s. a week. I suggested that the youth&#39;s wages should be increased to &#163;15 a week, that the manager should go into camp, and that the youth should take his place and run the business. It is useless pleading with some employers to release their employees to undergo military training. I know that there are quite a number of exceptions, but military training should be compulsory.- It is a pity that a former Government suspended part XII of the Defence Act, because in that part provision is made for the imposition of penalties upon employers who deter young men from carrying out their obligations under the Defence Act. These pleadings that &#34; young men should be inspired to serve &#34;, such as the Minister for Defence puts over the air and publishes in the press, are useless. The remedy is in our hands. The proven remedy for unpreparedness is compulsory national service. I appeal to the Government to tell the nation the truth; that without it an adequate and efficient army is an impossibility. If the people learn the truth they will cheerfully support a system of compulsory service, particularly when they realize the imperative necessity for it. </para>

I do not propose to deal at length with the subject of defence, which has already been discussed fully by some honorable senators, but I trust that the Government will give favorable consideration to the request I have made that Lewis and Bren machine guns be made available to the members of rifle clubs. This request, which has been supported by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll, Senator Arkins</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein,</inline> is so reasonable that I cannot understand why it should be refused. For over twelve months, the members of rifle clubs have been asking for an opportunity to become acquainted with the handling of these guns, and quite a number of deputations have waited upon the Minister in support of the request. At present there are 49,000 members of rifle clubs throughout Australia, all of whom are potential defenders of this country, and despite the fact that a tremendous amount is being appropriated for defence purposes, the Minister for Defence has declined their request. I trust that the Minister will allow at least some of the men to receive instructions in the use of these guns, and  in that way enable them to render a very useful service to Australia. </para>

                        who dealt very extensively with the position of graziers, quoted some interesting figures concerning the Australian wool industry. I fully realize that this country depends largely upon the proceeds of our wool exports, and that the old saying that &#34;Australia is riding on the sheep&#39;s back &#34; is as true to-day as it was when the expression was first used. Conditions in the pastoral areas of Western Australia are as bad, as in the pastoral areas of Queensland, if, indeed, they are not worse. Graziers have lost 50 per cent, of their stock and even if reasonable seasons returned it would take them five or six years before their holdings reached their normal carrying capacity. I hope that, if any assistance is to be given to this industry, the claims of the pastoralists in Western Australia will not be overlooked.

                    <para>I congratulate the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research upon the excellent research work it is carrying out. The council should endeavour to check the rapid encroachment of salt upon valuable agricultural lands. Within the last two years, hundreds of thousands of acres of good agricultural land in Western Australia have been severely affected in this way. In Russia a grass, <inline font-style="italic">Agropyson elongatum,</inline> grows profusely on saline soils, and I have read in several journals that it also makes a reasonably good fodder plant. To my knowledge, several persons have individually written to various departments in Russia in an endeavour to obtain seeds or runners of it; hut up to date their requests have not been successful. I, therefore, ask the Government to make an effort to obtain specimens of the grass for purposes of experimentation in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. The soil drift and erosion which have taken place in many parts of Australia must receive the earnest attention of the Government. Different plans should be introduced in an endeavour to combat it. Much of the erosion has been due solely to the fact that the settler has overstocked . his country, and drastic measures will have to be taken in the near future in order to arrest this drift. During the last couple of years I have seen serious evidences of it in South Australia. </para>

                    <para>The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> referred to the measures that are being taken to discover oil in Papua and New Guinea. An attempt is being made to make it appear that the Government, by pandering to outside capitalistic interests, has caused exclusion of bona fide Australians who desire to prospect for oil in the territories. As briefly  as  possible, I shall tell to honorable senators the story of the search for oil in Papua and New Guinea. In the first place Papua and New Guinea have always been open to any bona fide prospector. But they did not go there. A previous Commonwealth Government then invited the Anglo-Persian Oil Company - the British Government being a shareholder in the company, and the </para>
                    <para class="block">Commonwealth being a partner with the company in Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited - to undertake in the territories boring operations for oil. On that enterprise a sum of &#163;300,000 was expended; oil was discovered but not in commercial quantities. Ordinances were passed to encourage people to undertake the search for oil, and all these poor . bona fide Australians who were anxious to find oil - who, we were told, were waiting with their swags on their back ready to proceed with the work, but were only blocked by the nefarious companies at the last minute - had years in which to make at attempt to do so. All the concern of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> for the prospector was unnecessary. But the Government is anxious to find oil in New Guinea, Papua or Australia itself. Representations were made to the Government - not by American interests, I assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings,</inline> but by a genuine Australian company. If the honorable senator has any doubts on that score I invite him to consult the share register in order to obtain the list of shareholders in the company. </para>

                        PEARCE.Oil Search Limited is a genuine Australian company. This is the nefarious company which suggested to the Government that an amendment of the ordinance was necessary in order to encourage bona fide companies to search for oil.  The  company contended that if its geologists, when wandering around the territories, found some indications of oil, they would at once be surrounded by a number of .parasitic companies, who would take up areas in the vicinity and wait while the company itself carried on the prospecting operations. Oil Search Limited, therefore, asked to be protected from such a possibility, by being given permits to cover the preliminary prospecting. Legislation for that purpose was passed; Oil Search Limited is the company which requested it. I assure the Leader of the Opposition and the honorable member for Fremantle
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline>
                        in the House of Representatives that that is how the legislation originated. The legislation having come into force, Oil Search Limited and Oriomo Oil
                    </para>
                    <para class="block">Limited, another Australian company, and two other concerns made application for permits. The Government passed a law for both territories that no company could obtain a permit unless two-thirds of its shareholders were British. Two companies were formed - one I believe is allied to the Shell group and the other to the Vacuum group - but I emphasize that their shareholders are two-thirds British. These companies exclude no investor. They have taken up areas, of which nobody was in possession; in fact, nobody had tried to obtain possession of them. These two companies as well as Oil Search Limited and Oriomo Oil Limited have been granted permits to search for a period of twelve months. In the case of the companies promoted by the Shell and Vacuum groups, there is an obligation to spend &#163;15,000 in the first six months and a similar sum in the second half of the year in the search for oil. The permit can be cancelled by the Administrator of New Guinea or the Lieutenant-Governor of Papua, as the case may be, if he has reason to believe that the companies concerned are not genuinely carrying out their work of prospecting. These enterprises hold permits for twelve months under those conditions. That is the monopoly - a good word to be used on the soap box - which we are told by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> has been granted to these companies. Similar permits have been granted to Oil Search Limited and Oriomo Oil Limited except that the amount of money which they are obliged to spend is considerably less than the obligation imposed on the other companies. The reason for this is that Oil Search Limited has already spent a considerable sum of mon /. After the companies have carried oat their preliminary prospecting and decided where they will settle down for drilling purposes, they will be compelled to relinquish the greater part of the area for which they hold permits. That is the substance of the arrangement which has been made with these so-called great monopolies. </para>

                        criticized the &#34;War Pensions Entitlement Tribunal. The honorable senator&#39;s indictment against this body was that over a period so many cases had been heard and so many appeals had been rejected. Presumably, the honorable senator does not contend that because a man makes an appeal to the tribunal it must necessarily be granted. The very fact that the applicant has made an appeal shows that his case should be inquired into by some authority.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline>
                        appeared to believe, and the conclusion he drew from the large number of rejections, was that one of the reasons for the rejections was the presence of two lawyers on the Entitlement Tribunal. In his judgment, the tribunal should not include two lawyers. The inference was that if two lawyers had not sat on the tribunal the rejections would have been fewer. It is interesting to note that in the period to which the honorable senator alluded only one lawyer sat on the Entitlement Tribunal. At the present time there are two lawyers on this tribunal.

                            <para>- I could give a most interesting address on that aspect. One senator quoted a statement by  Colonel Mullen,  of Tasmania, that universal military training had reduced larrikinism. Perhaps it would be relevant to the subject if I were to say that after universal military training had been in operation for two years, the Commonwealth Government of the day - I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> that it was a Labour Government - requested the governments of the States to obtain reports from the superintendents of every police district throughout Australia as to the effect of universal military training on the behaviour of young men generally. I emphasize that such reports uniformly stated that the introduction of universal military training had had a beneficial effect on the morals and behaviour of the young men. No superintendent was more outspoken in this regard, or made a more definite report on the subject, than the superintendent of the Newcastle district, New South Wales. He stated that before the introduction of universal military training larrikinism had been so bad in some districts of Newcastle that a decent woman could rarely walk down the streets without hearing filthy language from the gangs of young men hanging about the streets. He proceeded to say that larrikinism has entirely disappeared from the streets and that the improved conduct of the youth of the district exceeded all expectations. </para>

                    <para>The Minister for Defence has supplied the following statement in reply to the observations that have been made during this debate: - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The present peace strength of the militia of 35,000 is regarded as the minimum number required to enable the existing army organization to be maintained, so that commanders, staffs, leaders, and a nucleus of specialists may bo trained. Should a definite threat of aggression against this country ever become a serious probability, it would bc necessary, immediately, to increase the peace strength of the militia to a figure that would bc a very much higher proportion of the mobilization requirements. </para>
                        <para>Trained leaders and men alone do not produce an efficient army. War materials, equipment and ammunition in large quantities are essential, and the production of these material requirements is a more lengthy and costly proceeding than the training of personnel. It is, therefore, necessary to strike a balance between the requirements of trained personnel and war material, having in view the financial and international situation. The Government, in pursuing its present policy, considers that it is making the best solution of the problem. </para>
                        <para>The Government and the Military Board are taking measures that it is anticipated will considerably increase the effective length of service of individual militiamen. </para>
                        <para>The suggestion that the physical development of the youths of this country, should be undertaken, is very commendable, but this would entail considerable expenditure in training staff and facilities, and unless it were carried out under some form of universal and compulsory training, would probably be very limited in its scope. Again, it becomes a question of priority of expenditure between personnel and war material. </para>
                        <para>In view of the present total amount allocated for rifle club reserves, it is considered that the allowance of ls. Od. per efficient for members of militia rifle clubs is adequate for the purpose. Should it be possible to allocate extra money for rifle club purposes in the future, consideration will be given to the increase of efficiency allowances, in common with other items of expenditure under the vote which have similarly been curtailed. </para>
                        <para>With the &#163;18,000 provided by the Government to increase the scale of free ammunition, an additional 50 rounds of Mark VII. has been provided for each efficient member of rifle clubs. This brings the total free issues up to 150 rounds per efficient member from the 1st July, 1936. <inline font-style="italic">No</inline> part of the f 18,000 is being absorbed by free issues of Mark VI. ammunition - in fact, the free issue of Mark VI. was reduced from 100 rounds to 50 rounds per efficient member when the extra 50 rounds of Mark VII. was authorized. The Mark VI. ammunition on issue to clubs is not of pre-war make. It was actually manufactured in 1917. Results of periodical tests carried out by qualified officers of the department show that this ammunition is still fully serviceable, i.e., it is very safe to  fire,  and accurate. Only fully serviceable ammunition is issued to clubs. </para>

Our destroyers of the &#34; W &#34; class are more modern than those of the &#34; S &#34; class, and when vessels become as obsolete as are the &#34; S &#34; class destroyers it is a costly business to keep them in commission. The repair bill mounts up as the age of a warship increases. The sloops that are to be built are intended to be used in times of peace for the training of naval reserves, for which purpose they are specially adapted. The old destroyers would not be useful for patrol purposes. They would be unsuitable for use in a tropical climate, apart from being costly to maintain. </para>

                        dealt with trade with the Netherlands East Indies, and pointed out that a falling off had occurred in the quantity of Australian butter sold in the Dutch East Indies in proportion to Dutch butter. From figures I have obtained, it appears that Dutch butter may be displacing butter from Canada or the United .States of America.

                        V. MacDonald trotted out some of the old platform stuff about war profiteers. He said that those who subscribed to the war loans had done very well. I remind him, however, that the war profiteer did not have a particularly good time in Australia. A severe war profits tax was imposed during the Great War, and it operated after the war in respect of profits made during the war. It was one of the most severe taxes ever imposed in Australia.
                    </para>
                    <para class="block">I can speak from personal experience, as Minister for Defence, about the prices paid for uniforms and equipment supplied to the troops. Little profiteering could have occurred in that regard, as strong measures were taken to prevent it. I remind honorable senators of what was done at that time, because loose statements are sometimes accepted as the truth. The Commonwealth Government had a woollen factory of its own, and we knew the. prices at which flannels and khaki could be produced. We paid to private contractors prices based on the cost of production in our own factory. We also had a uniform factory, and we gave to those who made up the garments prices based on the cost at which these goods could be made in the Commonwealth clothing factory. No profiteering occurred in regard to uniforms, similar precautions were taken in connexion with the supplies of harness and other equipment used by the Australian Light-horse. The prices paid for these goods was based on the cost of production at the Commonwealth saddlery factory. I have accounted for the prices of a considerable proportion of the defence equipment. </para>
                    <para>It is said that capitalists in Australia made a good deal of profit by subscribing to the war loans. By referring to page 3.7 of the eighteenth report of the Commissioner of Taxation, honorable senators will find that the total number of income taxpayers in Australia in 1934-35 was 220,240. Under Commonwealth law, every person with a taxable income of over &#163;250 pays tax. Is every such person a bloated capitalist? If so, there are 220,240 of them in the Commonwealth. The No. 14 <inline font-style="italic">Year-Booh</inline> states at page 696 that, during the war, &#163;213,490,810 was subscribed to war loans by no fewer than 742,747 persons. Were they all bloated capitalists? There were three times as many of them as there were income taxpayers throughout. Australia. There must have been either half a million &#34; bloated capitalists &#34; who were dodging the federal income tax, or half a million more subscribers to the war loans than there were income taxpayers. </para>
                    <para>The population of Australia in 1918, at the close of the war, was about 5,000,000, of whom slightly over 2,000,000 were adults. As the subscribers to the war loans numbered about 750j&#39;000, one in every three of the total adult population subscribed to those loans: Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> V.

                            <para>- There is a practical difficulty in the way of supplying machine-guns to rifle clubs. A machine-gun is not an article that can be left lying about. When I was Minister for Defence there were times, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand</inline> knows, when in certain districts we had to take the breach blocks out of machine-guns and put them in a safe place. It is necessary to have a permanent personnel to keep machine-guns under lock and key. That is why we cannot make a universal distribution of these weapons. In localities where the members of rifle clubs are within convenient distance of centres where these weapons are housed, it may be possible for them to be trained in their use. </para>

                        with adequate data on the various matters which arise from time to time. Australia has a responsibility to the Mandates Commission in respect of New Guinea and other mandated territories, and must furnish a report on them to the commission each year. Adequate representation is necessary if Australia&#39;s case is to be properly presented by the High Commissioner when he attends to give an account of this country&#39;s stewardship. There are, in addition, the diplomatic and service connexions with the British Government. The purchase of the huge quantities of defence and postal material in Europe, and the correspondence in connexion with the many international treaties to which Australia is a party, cause a great deal of work, with all of which Australia House is actively associated. When we think of the manifold responsibilities that Australia has undertaken as a nation we cannot say that too much money is expended in the upkeep of Australia House, or that the allowance to the man who represents Australia in London, and has to maintain at the heart of the Empire a position commensurate with the dignity of the Commonwealth, is excessive.

                    <para class="block">In respect of the last phrase &#34; No one is able to say precisely what good thing it has done &#34;, I desire to submit what I hope is an adequate reply. I wish to refer, first, to the achievements of the council in connexion with the dried fruits industry. The processing methods employed in the early years did not produce the tight coloured sultana favoured by the British consumer. Accordingly, the council&#39;s research station at Merbein set itself to evolve a process suited to Australian conditions, which would give a high-class product, acceptable to overseas consumers. The attempt was successful. In 1930, of a total pack of Y&#39;3,000 tons, 40,000 tons was processed by the method evolved at Merbein, and realized in Britain &#163;5 a ton more than was obtained for fruit processed by the methods formerly employed. That represented a gain to the industry of &#163;200,000 in one year alone. Surely that achievement should answer the honorable senator. The &#34; mixed dip &#34; evolved at Merbein is now generally adopted throughout the Murray settlements. An increased yield may be regarded as bringing additional wealth to an industry. The yield of dried fruits to the acre in the irrigation areas of Australia has been doubled since the war, largely as a result of research into cultural methods by officers of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. </para>
                    <para>In the citrus industry also, the investigations of the council&#39;scitriculturalresearch station at Griffith, in the Murr.umbidgee irrigation area, have resulted in a marked increase of the yield of citrus fruits. Such progress has been made that it is hoped that the council will soon be able to define the exact condition of storage during transport whichisrequired for different kinds of fruit. Without such knowledge, the export of oranges must continue to be haphazard, inefficient, and subject to serious losses from wastage; but with it, not only can the present crop be marketed to the greatest advantage of the growers as a whole, hut also it is possible that considerably increased production may be justified, because of the existence of an established export market. Throughout the citrus areas there is a general recognition of the good work of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. It is not too much to say that its investigations in respect of citrus fruits are among the most important of its activities. </para>
                    <para>In connexion with the transport of chilled beef from Australia to the United Kingdom, also, the council has a good record to its credit. Research into food storage and preservation has already produced results of great economic value; and if full commercial advantage be taken of them, the benefits to Australia are likely to be still greater. This work is of particular value to a country which is so situated geographically that it is just possible for many of its perishable products to reach the most important markets. A healthy and profitable export trade in such products must be based on exact scientific knowledge of the conditions necessary for their preservation and transport. Australia&#39;s new and growing export trade in chilled beef - a trade which may prove to be the salvation of the cattle industry in Northern Australia, since frozen beef is becoming increasingly difficult to sell in Great Britain - has been developed solely as a result of discoveries made by the council&#39;s investigators. They have defined the precautions which must be taken in handling and dressing the beef, and the conditions that must be observed during storage and transport, if the beef is not to suffer deterioration during the period required for export to Britain. </para>
                    <para>The Council for .Scientific and Industrial Research has also achievements to its credit in connexion with the apple industry. The disorder known as &#34; bitter pit &#34; has in the past caused a loss to Australia&#39;s export apple trade estimated at &#163;100,000 a year, but the council, in co-operation with the Department of Agriculture of Western Australia, discovered the cause of the disorder, and it is now possible to reduce losses from this source to negligible proportions. </para>
                    <para>These are all definite achievements in the field of research ; they are the credits that we must place opposite the debits represented by the money voted for research by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, and the credits exceed the debits. I have referred to the assistance given to the export apple trade. I now point out that research has shown that, by means of gas storage, certain varieties of peaches can be maintained in good condition long enough to enable them to be exported to Britain. Although, as yet, there are no practical results from this discovery, it is likely that, in the course of the next few years, Australia will have an export trade in peaches. </para>
                    <para>Australia has no export trade in bananas, the total crop being consumed locally, but the fruit has to be transported over long distances, and, in addition, it must be ripened by artificial methods. Research by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research has shown the way to improved transport on the railways, and has led to the erection of specially constructed commercial ripening chambers in most of the big  cities.  The net result has been a marked improvement of the condition of the bananas marketed in the south. These points are all to the credit of the work of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, and are a practical answer to certain statements which have &#39;been made in the Senate. </para>
                    <para class="block">One of the main obstacles to the development of a successful and flourishing tobacco industry in Australia has been the prevalence of blue mould, a disease which causes great havoc in the seed beds. Only recently has an effective method of protecting seedlings from the disease been discovered. The research officers of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research have shown that by using specially constructed frames, and a proportion of benzol vapour in the atmosphere, any quantity of healthy seedlings may be obtained for transplantation. Apart from the financial losses which it has caused <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the growers, blue mould has seriously held up experiments in cultural methods designed to improve the quality of the crop. </para>
                    <para>Finally, I wish to deal with the achievements of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in connexion with the pastoral industry. That industry suffers enormous losses as a result of diseases of various kinds. The magnitude of these losses is indicated by the fact that the Cattle Tick Commission estimated that redwater fever had cost the State of Queensland about &#163;7,000,000. Incidentally, the council&#39;s work has dona a good deal to improve the technique of immunizing cattle against the tick-borne fevers of the northern cattle belt. One ailment of sheep, occurring chiefly in the eastern States, a  braxy-like  disease now known as black disease, was estimated to cause an annual loss of &#163;1,000,000 to graziers. The causative organism was determined, and an effective vaccine prepared, which gave to  innoculated  animals a high degree of resistance to the disease ; the use of this vaccine, combined with measures of liver-fluke eradication, resulted in the satisfactory control of the disease. The prevalence of so-called coast disease has seriously handicapped the pastoral development of a belt of high rainfall country some 2,000 square miles in area, mostly in South Australia, but extending into the adjoining States. Research has shown that the disorder is associated with a deficiency of the element cobalt, and that the administration of small doses of cobalt salts will cure even advanced cases of coast disease. It appears likely, therefore, that as a result of this work of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research considerable areas will now be made available for more profitable grazing. Parasitic diseases of sheep are studied at the McMaster </para>
                    <para class="block">Laboratory at Sydney. Internal parasites are most prevalent in the higher rainfall areas. The losses they cause, though known to be serious, have not been estimated; but the discontinuance of sheep breeding in parts of northern New South Wales and southern Queensland has been largely the result of the prevalence of one of these parasites, the so-called nodule worm. Methods of treatment and control, some naturally more efficacious than others, or, at any rate, more easily adopted in station practice, have been evolved for practically every species of parasite of economic importance. I could speak at much greater length on the activities of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, because the results of its investigations are so contrary to the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie.</inline></para>
                    <para>Before I resume my seat I should like again to stress the desirableness of improving the methods of financing the work of this very valuable body. It is essential that adequate provision be made to permit the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research to adopt a long range policy. If long-range experiments are to be undertaken it is necessary that there should be stability of finance; such experiments are not possible under the present method of making annual grants to finance the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. In its report for 1934-35 the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research stressed the fact that it would be placed in a much sounder position, and the general efficiency of its operations would be increased, if there were some definite policy for continuity in its financial arrangements. This could be effected either by the payment into the trust account from time to time of sums, each sufficient for a period of years, or by a declaration by the Government of a decision to provide fixed annual sums over a period of years. At first sight, the latter might appear to be a departure from conventional practice. However, -within the last year or two, the Government has set aside fixed annual sums for five years for certain special investigations, for example, those in connexion with gold-mining, fisheries, tobacco and citrus preservation, and it needs but a logical extension to the whole of the council&#39;s work of the&#39; principle thus adopted, to give to the council a satisfactory degree of financial continuity which is denied it by the present method of annual appropriation. I particularly want to impress the importance of that upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie.</inline> I have repeatedly brought it up for the consideration of the Senate. In view of the tremendous value to all industries in Australia of the work of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, we should adopt the recommendations contained in its annual report for 1934-35, and provide stability of finance. At the same time I again urge that we should seriously consider some scheme under which the industries benefiting by the research work carried out by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research would contribute towards its upkeep. After all, if an industry is to benefit from research work undertaken by the council, why should it not contribute towards the cost of such research? It cannot expect to get everything for nothing. Though provision has been made in the Estimates for the carrying on of the council&#39;s work, I urge that some scheme be worked out under which industries assisted by the council should contribute some portion of the funds necessary to carry it on. </para>

                        <para>. - I agree entirely with all the remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline> regarding the value of the work done by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, and I agree also that anything the Government can see its way to do to put the finances of that institution on a definite and permanent basis should be done. I do not think that we should adopt a cheese-paring, policy in connexion with any institutions which, it can be shown, are rendering useful service to the Commonwealth. When, however, the Leader of the Government goes into ecstasies over the wonderful work which the High Commissioner has done with regard to the saving of interest, I am bound to step into the fight and suggest that the picture is over-painted. As a matter of fact, Australia is getting a very raw deal in respect of interest paid on money borrowed overseas. Going back five years in the history of the Commonwealth, I remind honorable senators, and the Minister in charge of the Senate particularly, that, during the 1931 election campaign, according to a report in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of the 5th May, 1931, the Prime Minister assured the people that financial circles in London were literally eager to help Australia over its difficulties. He said that he- had received assurances on that point. He also said that once the people of Great Britain knew that Australia meant to honour its obligations they would come to its aid in the matter of interest reductions. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons,</inline> the way was paved and the road made easy in 1931 for the High Commissioner to bring about the conversion of existing loans at reduced rates of interest. The &#34; eagerness &#34; of British financial circles to come to Australia&#39;s aid in the matter of interest reductions can be judged by the slow manner in which conversions at lower rates of interest have been made, and the large amount still outstanding at high rates of interest. It cannot be denied that Australia has been the Cinderella in this regard; it has always had to. pay higher interest rates than foreign countries and the other dominions. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page recently stated that Argentina paid a lower rate of interest than Australia. The Leader of the Senate does not need to go beyond his own Cabinet colleagues for evidence that the High Commissioner is not the brilliant success that he alleges him to be in the matter of securing interest reductions for Australia. The Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties, speaking in the House of Representatives some years ago, said: - </para>

                    <para class="block">Yet honorable senators opposite never tire of offering their meed of praise to the High Commissioner. The Premier of South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Butler,</inline> a year ago said that he was surprised at the increased rate of interest at which the last loan was floated in England ; he was certain that money could be procured at much cheaper rates. What was the High Commissioner doing? Why did he not assure that Australia secured money at the cheap rates at which it was loaned to other countries? Yet the Leader of the Government is continually asserting that the High Commissioner is the last word in financial brilliance. An interview with &#34; an eminent authority on Australian affairs in London &#34;, published by the London <inline font-style="italic">Financial Times</inline> in 1932, reports him as having said &#34;Money at present is superabundant and cheap &#34;. Yet after&#39; five years of activity by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> the loans bearing interest at over 3^ per cent, are as follows: - &#163;2,876,000, 3| per cent.; &#163;13,100,000, 4 per cent.; &#163;11,999,000, 4J per cent.; &#163;126,747,000, 5 per cent.; and &#163;17,870,000, <inline font-style="italic">5i</inline> per cent., making a total of &#163;189,592,000. If those loans were converted at 3&#163; per cent., the saving of interest would be approximately &#163;2,521,000 per annum, plus exchange &#163;630,000, or &#163;3,151,000. If all the unconverted loans bearing interest at the rate of over 3 per cent., were converted to 3 per cent., the saving of interest would be &#163;3,645,000, plus exchange &#163;911,000, or &#163;4,556,000 per annum. In such circumstances it is idle for the Leader of the Senate to pour out such foolish flattery concerning the High Commissioner. Considering that the High Commissioner&#39;s office costs the nation &#163;1,000 a week, we have a right to demand that he does his job, and that he saves the taxpayers of Australia the &#163;4,500,000 I have mentioned. If the Government were doing its job in the interests of the taxpayers it would instruct him to get to work to effect further conversions. Why should we be paying over 3 per cent, on such loans when other countries are not paying that rate?&#34; Great Britain is able to obtain all the money it requires at a much lower rate than that which Australia is paying. I do not propose to elaborate the subject further, because I know that it is essential that the passage of the bill be expedited. </para>

                        by some of his admirers in this chamber, the fact remains that the financial difficulties of later government&#39;s were due to the heavy borrowing and lavish expenditure of the Bruce-Page Administration. As to

I agree with the Leader of the Opposition, that Australia is regarded by many financiers as a good milch cow, and has been milked very energetically by certain investors in the Old &#39;Country, who make a continual drain on the Commonwealth to the extent of millions of pounds a year. </para>

                            <para>- That was due entirely to the activities of a &#34;stinking fish &#34; party which sent its representatives to Great Britain to decry the State in which they made their money. They told the British financiers not to loan money to the Queensland Government, merely because it was endeavouring to check the activities of the land sharks in that State. When money could not be raised in Great Britain, the Queensland Government had to go to the United States of America and pay a much higher rate than would otherwise have been paid. These exploiters do not care a damn what happens so long as they benefit. </para>

That was the position which the Scullin Government had to face. There are many matters which I could discuss at this juncture, but I suppose that I would be prevented by the Chair from doing so. I intend to submit a proposal, but I suppose that I am the only one who will regard it as reasonable. I am like the lunatic who said that he liked talking to himself because he was sure to agree with what was said. </para>

                            <para>- Then perhaps the unemployed man is not an animal and does not need nutrition. I turn, therefore, to Item 14&#39; &#34; Unforeseen and Urgent Investigations &#34;. It is urgent that a scientific investigation be conducted into the affairs of this nation, in order that the problem of unemployment which has beset us for so many years and defied all the efforts of the parliamentary intelligentsia, may be solved. Science should be given an opportunity to succeed where the combined governments of Australia have failed. In making this suggestion I do not jest; I am in deadly earnest. The sum of &#163;2,000 allotted for &#34;Unforeseen and Urgent Investigations &#34; is inadequate for the purpose. The vote should be greater in order to make possible a scientific investigation such as I have suggested. We know why the inquiry into hours of labour and their effect on unemployment promised by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> was rejected. It was proposed to ask seventeen or twenty persons, taken from various walks of life, to investigate this problem; but the economic antagonisms and conflicting interests at work would have vitiated and prolonged such an inquiry, and made a satisfactory recommendation impossible. The experts of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, however, would not be likely to be influenced in any way by party, financial or commercial interests, or industrial entrepreneurs; they would approach the problem as scientific men in the service of the community. If my suggestion were adopted it would be for the good of Australia, despite the doubts of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and other honorable senators. </para>

                        <para>. - While some other honorable senators were speaking, I made some strong remarks, by interjection, about the High Commissioner for Australia, in London <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. S. M. Bruce).</inline> In view of the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline> took up one of my expressions I do not desire honorable senators to think that I made those comments without having evidence to support them. I have met <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> on only one occasion and that was in a social way at a railway station in the north of New South Wales. I am not actuated by malice against that gentleman. He has an excellent Scottish name and there are many features about him that I like. For example, he is interested in cricket, and so am I.  </para>

                            <para>- I do not approve of the work done by the present High Commissioner, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Marwick</inline> deserves commendation for his criticism of the administration of Australia House. I visited Australia House when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook was in charge of it. As the total amount expended is large, the administration should be carefully reviewed. When Australia House was built the idea was that the Agent-General of each State should be accommodated there; hut when I was in London the Agent-General for SouthAustralia had an office somewhere in Old London, the Queensland office was in The Strand, the Agent-General for Victoria was located near Australia House, and the Agent-General for another State had quarters in Victoria-street, Westminster. Evidently the movement to bring all the State Agents-General together has failed. It seems to me that the large expenditure incurred annually in connexion with Australia House is not justified. Members of this committee should be able to discuss the work of the High Commissioner as well as that of any other public servant. The present occupant of . the position, unlike his predecessors, has been in a position similar to that of a Minister, rather than that of the head of an office. The present High Commissioner has conducted unsuccessful propaganda at various times in regard to the marketing of Australian products, and he has visited this country for that purpose. A public servant should not be permitted to direct a political campaign, as was done by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> a couple of years ago, which is not to the best advantage of the people of Australia. </para>

                        <para>.- I am pleased to notice that an increased vote is provided to enable the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research to carry on its most important work. That body is to be commended for the high standard of its service to the community. I thank the scientists for the results they have already obtained in assisting the primary producers to combat animal and plant diseases and in encouraging the improvement of pastures. The Wool Board has been appointed, I am pleased to know, as the result of the wool-growers imposing a levy upon themselves which will bring in about &#163;70,000 a year. Of this amount the board intends to allocate a substantial proportion to scientific research. I hope that the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research will not be handicapped in its work in the future, as it has been in the past, by a shortage of funds. In my opinion the scientists are not adequately remunerated. Those who are keenly devoted to scientific research in the interests of the nation should be well paid for their services. They have already done much to increase the productivity of the soil by experiments in regard to wheat culture and the application of superphosphate to pastures.

Conflicting statements have been made in regard to this establishment. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> McLaren, who recently returned to Australia, refuted some of the assertions, but other statements have been published recently by gentlemen who have visited the Old Counry within the last few months, and their comments regarding business dealings which they have had at Australia House are not complimentary to it. &#34;When this building was completed, we were informed that it was located on an excellent site in one&#39; of the most prominent parts of London, and that it would attract attention for all time, as well as prove a valuable asset to the Commonwealth. When I was in London eight years ago I saw nothing to justify the recent criticism, but much may have happened since that time. I have heard that two rooms on the ground floor, which are passed by many people daily, had large &#34; To let &#34; signs prominently displayed in the windows. Such signs are not a good advertisement for the Commonwealth, and tend to detract from the importance of the office. That building was erected in the belief that it would be a permanent advertisement for Australia, and of advantage in developing the Commonwealth. I hope that the Minister will be able to allay the fear that we are not getting value for the money expended on Australia House. </para>

                        <para>.- I am -grateful to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline> for the information which he has given to the committee about the operations of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. From the honorable senator&#39;s remarks, one might imagine that I had attacked that body. Far from attacking it, I was merely seeking information regarding its activities. I referred to the work of the council in assisting secondary industries, and am grateful to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline> for informing me of some of its achievements in connexion with primary products. The honorable senator&#39;s remarks would have carried more weight had they not so obviously arisen from either conversations with officers of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research or a study of reports issued by that body. I realize that the council is doing good work; but I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline> claimed too much for it. It is possible that, by attempting to &#34; paint the lily &#34;, an impression altogether opposite to that desired may be given. I am glad that the good work performed by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research is receiving recognition. </para>

                        <para>. - I visited London this year, and while there I was impressed with the comparative &#34; deadness &#34; in the vicinity of Australia House. The building is isolated on an island in the Strand. Most of the traffic passes along the other side of the Strand. The design of the building is altogether unsuitable for offices; too much space is taken up by long passages. It is not a place where people go, and consequently three State governments have removed their agencies from the building. Tasmania, also, would have done so had it been able to terminate its lease, for it could have obtained more suitable accommodation elsewhere in a far better position at half the rental charged for offices in Australia House. When I was in London, the Commonwealth officials at Australia House rendered to me very little assistance. If I desired information regarding Commonwealth affairs, I obtained it from the State Agents-General and their officers, who were most courteous at all times, whereas the Commonwealth officers either professed to be too busy, or promised information which they did not supply. Three years ago, when I was in London previously, my experience was similar. Despite what <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> McLaren says, Australia could Be much better served for the money expended on Australia House. </para>

For years there has been criticism of the service rendered to Australia by Commonwealth officials at Australia House, and in view of what has been said here to-night, the Government is in duty bound to obtain a full and complete report on this matter. Other countries, such as Denmark and Argentina, have &#39;Chambers of &#39;Commerce or other agencies in most of the ^principal centres of population in the Old Country and, in consequence, the sale of goods from those countries is bound to increase. I hope that the Government will take steps to see that better service is obtained for the money expended on Australia House. </para>

                        <para>. - One can only speak on a subject like this as one&#39;s experience dictates, but since there has been so much criticism of Australia House, I desire to say that, although I have not been in England for six years, I was there for some considerable time on the occasion of my last visit. Immediately after I arrived in London, I paid a formal call at the offices of the High Commissioner for Australia, and of the Agent-General for South Australia. Throughout the whole of the time that I was in England I received great consideration from the Commonwealth officers .at Australia House, whereas the only result of my visit to the South Australia Agency was that some firms who supplied suitable attire for Eastern countries, sent me a memorandum informing me that at their emporium I could obtain my requirements. I found the officials at Australia House most anxious to be helpful; and they were in fact helpful. If they were not so successful as they might have been, the reason probably was that a number of officials had resigned, either voluntarily or compulsorily, during the regime of a Labour Government in Australia. I suggest that cutting down expenditure on Australia House is not the way to get better service in the future. </para>

There has, however, been a considerable amount of criticism by both members of Parliament and business people generally in regard to the situation of Australia House as the centre of Australian affairs in London. Apparently no prescience was shown by those who decided the location of the building. I understand that the main business quarter of London has largely grown away from Australia House in recent years, and it is now left practically isolated on an island in the Strand ; because of that, for all practical purposes the building, as the centre of the official business of the Commonwealth, is obsolete. This bill contains an amount of &#163;7,250 for municipal rates and taxes in respect of Australia House. That seems a very large sum to provide for that purpose, and it appears to  me  that it would perhaps be more profitable to relinquish the present building and acquire another in a more suitable quarter. </para>

                            <para>- Nevertheless, &#163;7,250 seems to me to be a large sum to pay for rates and taxes, even in London. If it is decided to sell the building and acquire other premises, I hope that more foresight will be exercised by those responsible for their selection than that which has been shown previously in regard to this matter. </para>

                            <para>- When I visited London, Australia House was practically new; but I understand that it has since been criticized from an architectural point of view. Even then it seemed rather gloomy. If a new building were constructed in a more suitable locality the offices of the State Agents-General would probably be located in it, and it would become the centre of the political and financial activities of Australia abroad. </para>

The cotton industry has been well established in Queensland, and every endeavour should be made to extend it. If the machine is successful, its use in Australia would go a long way to further the prosperity of the cotton industry. </para>

I ask the Minister to give very special consideration to  the  need for ensuring that the new service will not be inferior to that provided at present. Having in mind the increasing importance of the territory, improved mail facilities should be made available. New Guinea has reached a state of development which justifies an improved mail service, but at all events it would be a retrograde step if there were anything in the new contract that might reduce the existing standard of the service. </para>

                        <para>. - Provision of &#163;15,000 has been made this year for research into the apple and pear industry. I am sure we all welcome that, but I should like to know what is the intention of the Government with regard to the expenditure of this money. Tasmanian orchardists, during the last year or two, have suffered extreme hardships, and any research undertaken by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research into the ravages of insect or other pests or diseases would be very helpful to the growers throughout Australia. The amount provided, however, seems rather large for that purpose, and, apparently it will, in addition, permit the council to undertake a considerable amount of research and investigation. I hope that the results will be satisfactory, and that the growers will receive corresponding benefits; otherwise, it would be better to provide the money directly for the relief of growers who have experienced such a disastrous season. </para>

It also provides a means for the State departments to do urgent demonstration work over a period of one year. In consultation with the States a programme of work was drawn up and has been commenced. The administration of the full grant is in the hands of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research.

                            <para>- A preliminary investigation would not cost more than &#163;50, and I know of no way in which money could be better expended. I believe that the inquiry in the United States of America is probably the best ever undertaken by any government in the history of the world, and that is saying a lotAustralia will have to undertake such a survey because of the problems that arefacing the people of every country. The American committee is ascertaining remarkable facts regarding the present and prospective productivity of the nation, what is actually consumed by its people, and what the consumption should be to enable the community to be thoroughly healthy. All this information is of the utmost importance in the world to-day. Representatives of the council could inquire into and report upon the work of the American committee and determine whether it would not be advantageous to conduct an investigation into the potential productive capacity of Australia. The American authorities are apparently making a determined attempt to solve some of the problems now confronting the nations of the world; amongst them must be the major subject of unemployment. If, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> suggested, we should have a definite defence plan, surely it is not unreasonable to ask the Government to ascertain whether an inquiry into the potential productive capacity of this country should not be made for the  purpose of laying down a definite plan of development. Only by so doing can our economic power be used to the full for the benefit of the people of this land. </para>

                        <para>&#91;8.46&#93;. - Several honorable senators having inquired as to what is being done in connexion with the reorganization of the Department of External Affairs, I may state that during the past financial year the status of the department has been altered. Though it has had a separate existence since 1921, it wa3 until November, 1935, attached to the Prime Minister&#39;s Department, the secretary of which also bore the title of Secretary of the Department of External Affairs. The officer directly in charge of External Affairs was an assistant secretary. During recent years the increased status of the dominions has had the effect of bringing Australia as a separate entity into direct relationship with many foreign countries. For the past three years Australia has, in addition, been a member of the Council of the League of Nations. It must, accordingly? ^ many matters which are of direct concern to it, act independently of Great Britain, and is at present a party to nearly 800 treaties with foreign countries and to 130 multi-lateral conventions. Australia is frequently called upon to negotiate and conclude agreements direct with foreign countries. The Commonwealth Government has constantly to make independent decisions in. the sphere of foreign affairs, and in the last two years the fact has become increasingly evident that, if Australia is to co-operate efficiently with other nations in the international sphere, and is to be enabled satisfactorily to safeguard its interests in, and relations with, foreign countries effective machinery must be in existence for the purpose. Australia, too, has developed so many direct and close contacts with foreign countries that it is highly desirable that these should not be lost, but rather maintained and strengthened. The first step forward with regard to external affairs was the separation of the department from the Prime Minister&#39;s Department, and the creation of the office of full secretary instead of assistant secretary. The reorganization of the department was then proceeded with. It was divided into two sections, <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> the Political Section, and <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> the International Co-operation Section. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The Political Section deals with questions of foreign policy, inter-Empire relations, the collection, collation, and dissemination of information concerning other countries, and prepares summaries for the information of Ministers and Parliament. This section is. also responsible for the compilation and issue of a fortnightly publication in which international matters of interest to Australia are discussed. This publication, known as <inline font-style="italic">Current Notes,</inline> was originally intended for the use of members of Parliament only, but so many requests have been received from schools, universities, newspapers, business houses, trades unions, and societies of various kinds, all over the Commonwealth, that its circulation, has risen rapidly since it started in April, and has now reached just under 900. At first it was wholly set up in the department, *but its increasing circulation made this impossible, and it is now issued by the Government Printer. </para>
                    <para>A branch of the Political Section is inLondon, where the Officer-in-Charge acts as a liaison between the department and the Foreign and Dominions Offices, and is in close co-operation with the High Commissioner. </para>
                    <para>The International  Co-operation  .Section deals with the League of Nations, the International Labour Office, the Permanent Court of International Justice, treaties and other international agreements, consular representation in Australia, constitutional questions relating to external affairs, and Australia&#39;s interest in the New Hebrides and the Antarctic. </para>
                    <para>A new activity which is absorbing the close attention of both sections is the compilation of a departmental annual report, which will appear for the first time early in the new year. In this publication it is proposed&#39; to include a survey of international affairs in the year 1936 with particular reference to Australian activities, together with a full account of the part played by Australia in all branches of the work of the League of Nations. A brief review of the re-organization of the department will be included, together with a chapter from the London office, and a short report from the Commonwealth&#39;s officer in the New Hebrides. There will be a section contributed by the Department of Commerce on the Australian Trade Commissioner Service, and one written by the Department of Trade and Customs on the general principles underlying the policy of trade treaties. Lists of treaties and conventions during 1936, to which Australia is a party, a list of international conferences held during the year and Australia&#39;s representation at them, and a list of consuls in Australia will also be included. </para>
                    <para>It has also been necessary to make adequate provision for a system of registration, in view of the rapid increase of departmental records. With the extension of the Political Division the information index system, especially, has increased in volume and importance. </para>
                    <para>As an illustration of the increase of the work of the department, the following figures of the despatches from the London office on current foreign affairs may be cited : - </para>
                    <para class="block">
                        <graphic href="152332193611264_33_4.jpg" />
                    </para>
                    <para>It should also be noted that the department is the channel of communication with the Australian Trade Commissioners abroad for all matters other than those concerning trade and commerce. </para>
                    <para>At present the only Australian representation abroad of a diplomatic character is in London, but the Government is considering the extension of this form of representation in those regions in which Australia is especially interested. </para>
                    <para>The Government feels that the utmost value to Australia would be obtained by the extension_ of the system of liaison officers of the External Affairs Depart - ment by attachment of such officers to British Embassies. The Australian system of liaison works extremely well, and the Commonwealth Government is thereby kept fully informed of the foreign despatches, view3, and ideas of the Foreign and Dominions Offices in the realms of international and Imperial affairs. In this respect, Australia is at least as well served as the other dominions are by their system of appointment of Ministers, and at far less cost. </para>
                    <para>The maintenance of the closest and most friendly relationships in the Pacific region must continue to be one of our basic policies, and in this respect Australia, during the last few years, has made material contributions. </para>
                    <para>It is felt that the appointment of officers to centres of particular importance to Australia would give continuity to this policy, facilitate the provision by the Commonwealth Government of trained and experienced officers in international affairs, and lay the foundation for any future representation of a higher status which the Government of the day may deem necessary. No definite decision on this subject, however, has yet been reached by the Government, but provision for the contingency has been made on the Estimates. </para>

                        <para>. - I appreciate the value of the publication entitled <inline font-style="italic">Current Notes,</inline> which honorable senators receive fortnightly, and I have no hesitation in saying that of the numerous governmental documents and publications we receive from time to time it is the most informative. It contains much valuable information and enables members of Parliament to debate subjects of public importance more intelligently than would be possible had they to rely upon a more or less haphazard research. I have watched the growth of this publication, and I suggest to the Minister controlling the department that an effort should be made to increase its circulation. In a crisis it is most essential that there should be a well-informed bloc thoroughly acquainted with the points at issue. Owing to the expense involved, the Government cannot make the publication available free of cost to every one desiring it, but under a contributory system copies could be supplied to many who do not now receive them. The Commonwealth <inline font-style="italic">Tear-Book</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Production and Finance Bulletins</inline> can be purchased, and there does not appear to be any reason why this valuable publication should not be on sale. I have submitted a large number of names of persons anxious to receive copies regularly ; but I know that there must be some limitation in this respect. As the booklet must play a definite and important part in our national life, I ask the Minister to consider seriously the adoption of a system under which those who wish to obtain copies may do so on payment of a charge or subscription. Owing to the value of its contents the circulation has increased. The subjects dealt with are so well prepared that they can readily be understood. I was very interested to hear the remarks made by the Minister concerning the reorganization of the department. I firmly believe that Australia must take an even greater interest in international affairs, and be well informed concerning what is being done in other parts of the world. I was interested to read statistics concerning the cost of similar departments in the Irish Free State, Canada and South Africa, where the conditions are somewhat similar to those in Australia. The salaries of the head-quarters staff in the countries mentioned are - Irish Free State, &#163;13,642; Canada, &#163;26,050; South Africa, &#163;17,252 ; and Australia - I recognize that the department here is still in its infancy - &#163;4,782. The total expenditure of similar departments in the countries mentioned last year were - Irish Free State, &#163;94,406 ; Canada, &#163;2o5,000- </para>

                            <para>- I was about to say that it- covers the duties of other than those directly associated with the department. In South Africa, the total expenditure was &#163;106,456, and in Australia it is only &#163;10,096. I do not complain because the cost, of the Commonwealth Department is low in comparison with the countries I have mentioned, because I know that the department in Canberra has only recently been re-organized, but sooner or later it will assume the importance of other major departments, and its work will be even more extensive in the years to come. It is rendering a very valuable service as a liaison between the Commonwealth and other nations, and its development should be encouraged. </para>

I recollect an important speech delivered by the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> last year on this subject, and I appreciate the evidence of the improvement which has already taken place in the Department of External Affairs. Praise for the <inline font-style="italic">Current Notes</inline> on international affairs has been conveyed to me from several quarters in South Australia. I should like the Leader of the Senate to give us an assurance that this department will not he stinted of funds ; because it is the earnest desire of all honorable senators that its work, which will be more important in the future than it has been in the past, shall be continued and extended. On important occasions such as the approaching coronation it would be fitting that senior officers of the Department of External Affairs should be considered for a trip to London in order to obtain desirable experience in the British Foreign Office. If the Minister will give me that assurance, I shall not elaborate upon this point. I congratulate him and the department on its excellent work. </para>

I also commend the leading officials of the department for the tact, ability and diplomacy which they have exhibited. I take this opportunity.to congratulate the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> for the diplomatic manner in which he has managed the department, especially in view of the fact that Europe recently passed through a crisis in which Australia was directly concerned. In my opinion, he has shown  himself a diplomat. Apparently the right honorable gentleman in framing his policy, has been advised by Australians, and I hope that this department will continue to be administered by Australians, and that our diplomatic service will be of advantage to us. I would again, like to refer to the fact that the department has been administered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> who has revealed in his parliamentary life that he is not only a diplomat, but also an Empire parliamentarian. Some day he may be called a statesman. </para>

                        <para>.- I direct attention to the vote of &#163;8,150 for the forestry branch. From the small number of students that have been despatched by the various States&#39; to the Australian Forestry School, Canberra, it is apparent that all is not well with the administration of that institution. A few weeks ago the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> referred to the small enrolment at the school, and during the last few weeks I have taken the opportunity to investigate to the best of my ability the reason for this lack of numbers. So far as the data at the school itself, the Library and the specimens there are concerned, the institution is probably the equal of any in this part of the world. It has certainly the best collection in Australia at the present time; but as the result of my inquiries I am satisfied that the reason why the school is not functioning as it should is because there is not that co-operation between the Inspector-General of Forests and the heads of the State Forestry Departments that there should be. </para>

                            <para>- That reason is largely responsible for the fact that so few students are being sent from at least two of the States to which we look to supply the greatest number. As was pointed out by the Leader of the Opposition, the Queensland Forestry Department proposes to send its students to the school. The tension which exists between the head of the department in Canberra and the Forestry Departments of at least two of the States does not obtain in respect of Queensland. Even if it did, the Forestry Department of that State is sufficiently big enough to recognize the value of the Australian Forestry School. The statements that I am making will call for some investigation by the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson).</inline> If more tact had been exercised by the Inspector-General  of Forestry, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lane-Poole,</inline> in some of his transactions with the heads of the State Forestry Departments, the decline of the numbers of students from at least two of the States, and the suggestion that those States will start Forestry Schools of their own, would not have occurred. These facts should be investigated, because the Australian Forestry School is worthwhile. It has a fine building, and a comprehensive collection, and is admirably situated for forestry work; therefore, there is no reason why it should not be the success that the Government intended it should be at its inception when the office of Inspector-General of Forests was created. I do not speak lightly in this regard. There has not been that cohesion and cooperation between the principal of the Australian Forestry School and the State Departments that there might have been and to my way of thinking, that is largely responsible for the fact that the school  i9  not functioning satisfactorily. </para>

I compliment the school on the excellent work that it is doing; but I do not suggest that it could not be improved. However I have no desire to pose as an expert on forestry matters. Quite recently <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> V. Galbraith,  Chairman  of the Forests Commission of Victoria, paid a visit to Queensland in order to confer with forestry officials of that State on the utilization of hardwoods. He said that during the five depression years more than 25,000 men had been employed in Victorian forests, and the Government was convinced that every penny spent in that way was highly reproductive and helped to develop the State forest asset. The Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> of the 8th October last, published the following comment on evidence given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Galbraith</inline> before the Public Works Committee: - </para>

                        <para>The increased intensity and frequency of flooding in the Latrobe River was due, he said, to the absence of a rational scheme of land utilization. From the summit of the southern boundary of the Latrobe catchment to the lofty slopes of the northern limit the pro tecting forest which maintained nature&#39;s balance had been ruthlessly swept from mountain slopes by axe and fire. The destructive forces of erosion were unleashed, and fertile soils were carried away for ever. </para>

                        <para>Regarding the forestry school, I have to advise that this department has always supported the Commonwealth school since its inception, and more students from Queensland have completed the full course than from any other State. At present there are four cadets undergoing the training course preliminary to proceeding to Canberra. Two should be ready to commence at the forestry school in 1938 and two in 1939, but if the continuation of the school depended upon an increased entry in 1937, I would be prepared to send the first two early next year and postpone the usual year of held experience. It would be preferable, of course, for the cadets to undergo this year of field training before proceeding to the school, and I trust it will not bo necessary to sacrifice this year of valuable experience in order to ensure the continuation of the school. </para>

                        <para>.- I endorse the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings.</inline> The Forestry School at Canberra is a valuable establishment, and with the cooperation of the State authorities it could be made much more useful to the Commonwealth than it is at the present time. I hope that the other States will follow the example set by Queensland. It would be a calamity to Australia if this branch had to be closed. We have gone to a good deal of expense in equipping and furnishing the school. Perhaps other States have failed to realize that it would be in their best interest to supply the number of cadets required.&#39; Some time ago there was a danger of the branch having to be closed, but I am glad to know that that danger has now passed. It seems to me that the Government is satisfied that the branch will have a new lease of life. I notice that &#163;4,280, as against &#163;3,034 last year, is proposed to be expended in the current year on salaries and allowances, whilst for office requisites and equipment, stationery and printing &#163;1,520 is to be voted, although only &#163;383 was expended in this direction last year. I hope the Minister will be able to tell the committee that sufficient students will be forthcoming to warrant the increased expenditure. </para>

                        PEARCE (Westtern Australia - Minister for External Affairs) &#91;9.21&#93;.- When the Estimates were drawn up, it was anticipated that the Australian Forestry School would have to be closed; but it was decided to increase the scope of the activities of the Forestry Bureau, and extra salaries were provided for,, because of the extension of this portion of its activities. Since that time some indication has been given that it may not be necessary to close the Forestry  School, and negotiations are still proceeding in the hope that it may be possible to continue it. Personally, I think that it would be a calamity to Australia if the school were closed. If there be any individual who is standing in the way of its success, the interests of forestry are greater than those of any individual. Of course the Government does not desire to place the blame on the wrong shoulders and does not want anybody to suffer who is not to blame for any friction that has arisen.

                            <para>- But the State Forestry Commissions are responsible for the results obtained from afforestation in their own States. The New South Wales Forestry &#39;Commission has to get results, and must take whatever action it considers advisable to preserve the forests and ensure a reasonable timber supply for that State. To do that the commission has to Secure a suitable staff and train it in its own way. I submit that it cannot hand over this valuable right to a school which may train the students under a different system. In my own opinion, and I am supported by authorities, the Canberra school has not given, and cannot give, to the New South Wales commission the service it requires in order to secure the desired results. It has been said that the friendly opposition by New South Wales to the Canberra Forestry School arises from the conviction that a State staff-training arrangement will lend itself to an economic mobilization of the State&#39;s education and forestry re sources for the purpose of producing forestry practitioners trained to a higher degree of usefulness in forestry than can an expensive concentration at an academic centre remote from forests, universities, and forest services. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kessel,</inline> who plays a prominent part in forestry work in Western Australia, visited New South Wales, he was inclined to support that State in its desire to train its own staff in its own way. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but only for the purpose of carrying out certain functions. The New South Wales authorities are hoping to introduce a cadet system such as has already been established in Queensland. It would provide for a six-years&#39; course. There would be two years of university courses in tha fundamental subjects closely allied to the course for a degree in agricultural science; and two years of special field training under the aegis of the department itself. That is most important, because the cadet must be taught the routine of the department which he is to serve. </para>

                    <para>The third requirement of the course is two years&#39; specialization in pure forestry. In this realm the Forestry School at Canberra can serve a definite purpose. The States should be entrusted with the major part of the training, leaving the Canberra school to specialize in pure forestry. The scheme also provides for overseas post-graduate courses for outstanding students. Even if New South Wales were to allow its students to proceed to Canberra, it would be 1940 or 1941 before any of them could be sent there. In the circumstances, it is not reasonable to expect New South Wales to send its students to the national school. </para>
                    <para>There is no antagonism between the forestry authorities in the States and those at the Commonwealth Forestry School, but there is a difference of opinion as to which method will secure the most practical results. I can understand the attitude of a man who has been appointed as State Conservator of Forests. He is responsible for the work of his department, and, if that work is not done thoroughly, the blame will fall on him. </para>
                    <para class="block">An elementary right of an administrator is that of choosing and training his own staff. He cannot be held responsible if forced to accept persons trained elsewhere. I hope that there will be cooperation between the Commonwealth and the States in regard to forestry ; but I believe that that co-operation must be limited practically to post-graduate courses, or, at least, to advanced courses in pure forestry. </para>

                        <para>.- The sum of &#163;148,870 is set down for &#34; Salaries and allowances as per schedule, page 1S9 &#34;. The schedule includes a sum of &#163;17,500 for &#34; Payment to Department of Trade and Customs for services of officers under Immigration and Passport Acts &#34;. I rose earlier to ask a question dealing with the methods employed to exclude undesirable immigrants from the Commonwealth. I agree that the Commonwealth should have the right to exclude from its territory persons who are considered undesirable; but it would appear that the present method of applying a dictation test to such persons is unsatisfactory, and should, be superseded by a better method. I should like to know whether a person who has passed a test in, say, the French language, may be forced to undergo a further examination in another language. </para>

                        <para>. - The sum of &#163;4S,&#39;200 is provided for the Meteorological Branch of the Department of the Interior. That is an increase of &#163;9,787 over the expenditure for 1935-36. The results are most disappointing, in that &#39; very seldom are rains, floods or storms correctly fore cast. I am amazed that forecasts to-day are not more reliable than they were ten or twenty years ago, when information upon which to base them was obtained by telegram from only a comparatively few centres, whereas now, with broadcasting stations throughout the country, and also in adjacent countries, reliable data, covering a much wider area than formerly, is easily obtainable. It is also possible to obtain very valuable meteorological information from ships travelling to and from Australia. In a primary-producing country like Australia, reliable meteorological information is of immense importance. I do not object to the expenditure of money on the Meteorological Branch - indeed, if reliable forecasts could be assured, I should be agreeable to double the vote - but the forecasts are so unreliable that the  expenditure is hardly  justified. </para>

                        PEARCE (Western Australia - Minister for External Affairs) &#91;9.40&#93;.  -  The increased vote over the expenditure last year is .due mainly to the creation of six new positions, resulting from an extension of meteorological services in connexion with civil aviaton. As honorable senators are aware, meteorological reports are of great assistance to aviators, and, with the expansion of air services, the functions of this department must be extended.

                    <para>As regards the accuracy of the reports, I sympathize with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie;</inline> but I suppose that, after all, meteorologists are only human. In this connexion, I am reminded of an incident which occurred a good many years ago, and in which no present officer of the branch was concerned. One of my daughters contemplated going to a picnic with the daughter of the meteorologist in the State in which we were then living. The day before the picnic- she asked her friend what she thought the weather would be like, and was informed that it would- be all right. My daughter then said, &#34;You ought to know, because your father is the State Meteorologist&#34;. She received the astonishing answer, &#34; I do not go by what father says, but by mother&#39;s corns &#34;. Apparently even the members of a meteorologist&#39;s family do not always regard the official -forecasts as infallible. Apart, however, from the issuing of  weather forecasts, the officers of the branch have other services to perform, included in which is the issue of flood warnings, which are of great value. to the Community. </para>

                        <para>. - Under division 42, the sum of &#163;50,100 is set down for the rent of buildings. Recently, I asked a question relating to the total amount of rent paid by the Commonwealth for the occupancy of buildings. I specifically excluded aerodromes and sites for aerodromes. In reply, I was informed that a total of &#163;83,417 was paid by the Commonwealth Government to landlords for the right to occupy buildings in the several States. I also asked how much of the total rentals represented money paid to State governments, and was informed that the States were paid &#163;10,446. It is clear, therefore, that the Commonwealth pays to private landlords in the States about &#163;70,000 a year as rent. That sum is sufficient to warrant the Commonwealth considering the wisdom of erecting its own buildings in the States. </para>

                        <para>.- For the maintenance of establishments for the Governor-General the sum of &#163;14,800 is set down, that being an increase of &#163;3,000 over the vote for last year. Of the amount set down for this year, &#163;1,500 is for caretakers&#39; and miscellaneous expenditure - an increase of &#163;350 over the &#163;1,150 provided for 1935-36, and a total of &#163;4,900 is provided for the maintenance of house and grounds, or &#163;1,500 more than the vote last year. I understand that during the year a residence. for the Governor-General has been provided in Sydney, and there have been reports that the Government- intends to provide another residence in Melbourne. I hope that the reports are not correct, and that Parliament will not be asked to vote another large sum next year for that purpose. The Estimates also provide for an expenditure of &#163;5,277, being the &#34; amount payable to the State Government of Victoria for lease of the building in Melbourne previously occupied by His Excellency the Governor-General &#34;. I should like to know for how many years we have to continue the payment of this large amount, which, I take it, is in the nature of compensation for the cancellation of the lease. I am sure Parliament would not agree to the renting of another house in Melbourne for the use of His Excellency the Governor-General. </para>

                        as to why rentals this year exceed the provision made last year by &#163;3,222, I inform him that it is mainly as a result of the transfer of the Pensions Branch of the Treasury from Victoria Barracks, Melbourne, to rented premises. This transfer was necessitated by the extension of defence activities. The bulk of the rentals is for office accommodation, the occupancy of which is, in most cases, of a temporary character, and in respect of which the Government would not be justified in erecting new buildings. There are many hundreds of such offices scattered throughout the Commonwealth.

The total amount of compensation is &#163;42,S65, and payment at the rate of &#163;5,277 per annum will be made until the agreement expires on the 31st December, 1938. The reason why the other items exceed the expenditure provided last year is that it has been found necessary to make provision for the maintenance and upkeep of Admiralty House, which is being reconditioned for occupancy by the Governor-General.

                            <para>- Some months ago I asked whether it was intended to provide the Governor-General with establishments in parts of Australia other than the Federal &#39;Capital Territory. The answer was that there was no intention to do anything of the kind. I have frequently complained of the fact that when we seek information in this chamber by way of questions we cannot get it, and we have to try to piece it together from press reports which more often than not turn out to be substantially correct. In the issue of the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> of the 7th November, I find the following paragraph : - </para>

This establishment was good enough for the finest gentleman who has ever occupied the position of Governor-General in this country, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Isaac</inline> Isaacs, and his good wife; as it was good enough for them it should be quite good enough for the present occupant of the office. I want to know exactly what it has cost to recondition Admiralty House, but I cannot obtain that information. I know that it cost considerably more than &#163;5,000. </para>

It is up to the Minister to let us know what the Governor-General is costing this country.

I know the Governor-General has to travel about the country ; the next thing we shall hear is that the Government is building or acquiring another residence in Queensland. </para>

                            brought up the question of rentals paid for office accommodation for Commonwealth departments, and asked whether it would not be more desirable for the Commonwealth to erect buildings for its own use. Many such offices are leased from State governments and local authorities at very low rentals, and apart from the convenience of. such an arrangement, a considerable saving of money results.

                    <para>It is disappointing to learn that the expectations of the Government, when it established a Commonwealth forestry bureau in Canberra have not been realized. It was understood at the time that the Government was anxious to do something of a national character; but in view of what has transpired it would appear that it was wrongly advised. The Government established a forestry school in Canberra where it was thought that students would be trained and eventually take up forestry work in the States. At the outset I opposed the establishment of a bureau in Canberra because it meant duplicating work which could be more efficiently carried out by the State authorities. I also protested against the officer in charge of operations at the bureau being designated Inspector-General of Forests, because I did not think that the work upon which he is engaged justified such a title. The major portion of forestry work must necessarily be carried out by the States, and the only effective way in which the Commonwealth can assist is by providing officers to conduct scientific investigations on behalf of the States. </para>

                            <para>- I realize that, but the department in Canberra has not developed to the extent anticipated. I do not know who is actually responsible for the erection of such a costly establishment, but as the forestry work done in Canberra is not appreciated, the Government will now have to decide how the buildings and equipment can be profitably employed. Perhaps a further attempt should be made to get the State Governments to utilize the facilities available in Canberra. I trust that when the Estimates for the next financial year are under consideration the Minister will be able to submit a more encouraging  statement. </para>

I have complained that a specialist who was not an officer of the department was brought in to decide whether or not a pilot was qualified. In my opinion, there is no necessity to obtain the services of an expert who is not a departmental official, unless he is completely beyond departmental interferences. </para>

                        PEARCE (Western Australia - Minister for External Affairs) &#91;10.19&#93;.  -  This is a very important matter. If an invader were to attack Australia, which God forbid, the fighting would not be confined to armies and navies. The whole of the resources of the country would need to be utilized, and factories which are now producing peace-time requirements would have to be converted in order to produce military, naval or air force supplies. Therefore, it is desirable that, in time of peace, we should take stock of the equipment and capacity of factories, which could be used for this purpose in the event of an invader attacking Australia. The &#34;Principal Supply Officers Committee&#34; has been organized to make that survey. At present it is taking an inventory of motor cars, motor lorries, manufacturing establishments, &#38;c, plans for the organization of &#34;which in time of war will be worked out subsequently by other committees.

In view of the fact that in the interim they have become registered, it is anticipated that the full amount will be expended this year.

                        <para>.- I notice that a sum of &#163;350 has been allotted for the purpose of assisting the boy scout movement. A sum of &#163;100 was  voted  for this particular movement last year, and I desire to know why it was not expended. If memory serves  me  correctly, a keen debate took place  in  this chamber  on  the merits  of  the boy scout movement, and an attempt was made  to  increase the grant from &#163;100  to  &#163;300  or  &#163;400. I ask you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> whether  or  not I am  in  order  in  discussing assistance for the boy scout movement? May I deal with all the relevant aspects and the reason why the grant should  be  increased? </para>

                        <para>It is true that the New South Wales Branch of the Boy Scout Association has abstained from soliciting aid from either the State or the Federal Government so far as is possible, because it was felt that in the state of financial stringency through which Australia has been passing every institution, no matter how wide its sphere, or benevolent its intentions, should endeavour to be self-supporting. My association, however, has experienced considerable embarrassment at times awing to the great demand for the extension of its activities, which could not be given effect to because of the need for additional money. In these circumstances, I am positive that I voice the feeling of the executive council of the movement in this State when I say that we would not only gladly welcome, but warmly appreciate arid profitably utilize, any grant which the Commonwealth Government could make available. </para>

                        <para>&#91;10.25&#93;.  -  It has been the practice of the Commonwealth Government for some years past to assist the boy scout movement in the various States by lending to it tents and other equipment for use at annual camps. This provision of &#163;100 is required to cover the cost to the Defence Department of the issue, maintenance, repairs and cleaning of the equipment made available to the boy scouts during the year. It is not fair that the Defence Department should be charged with that money ; for that reason the money is placed on the Miscellaneous vote for the purpose of recouping the department. No claims for assistance were made by boy scouts during the past financial year, but in 1934-35 a jamboree was held at Frankston, Victoria, which absorbed the full grant of &#163;350 for that year. Honorable senators from South Australia will be interested to learn that provision is made in these Estimates to enable similar assistance to be rendered in connexion with the South Australian jamboree to be held shortly as part of the Centenary Celebrations. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline> will realize, therefore, that the requests made to the Government by the boy scout movement have been met. </para>

                        GEORGE PEARCE  (Western Australia - Minister for External Affairs) &#91;10.28&#93;. - Many years ago a scheme was instituted under which destitute Australians abroad may, in certain circumstances, obtain advances for the purposes of relief and repatriation. The primary object of the vote is to enable the recipients to return to their homeland; but such relief is extended only in cases of destitution. The conditions under which assistance has been afforded in the past have been as follows: - (a) Belief was granted to applicants who were nativeborn Australians; (b) Only persons &#34;who were destitute were afforded relief, a distinction being drawn between persons whose condition was due to unavoidable misfortune and those whose position was due to their own foolish conduct; (c) Applicants for relief were required to submit the names of relations and friends in Australia who might be in a position to meet the expense of repatriation, and before any expenditure was authorized these persons were approached by the Commonwealth authorities in, Australia with a view to providing the amount required; (d) All the expenditure involved by the Commonwealth, i.e., maintenance, passage money, advances, cost of cablegrams, &#38;c, was authorized subject to the condition that it was to be repaid, and written guarantees were obtained from interested parties with the object of securing reimbursement. These conditions were somewhat rigid, and latterly it has been the policy of the Government to grant relief in cases where women and children of Australian birth are concerned. For this reason greater provision under this item is sought in the appropriation for the present financial year.

                        <para>.- The sum of &#163;1,000 is proposed to be voted under the item &#34; Historical memorials of representative men &#34;. I suppose this refers to the painted portraits of distinguished Parliamentarians whichfrom <inline font-style="italic">time to</inline> time are placed in the King&#39;s Hall. The principle laid down in the early days, and which has been adhered to since that time, is that persons holding particular offices should have their portraits painted, and that these should be kept as historical memorials. This is an excellent idea. Those whose portraits have been painted are the various Governors-General, the Prime Ministers, the Presidents of the Senate and the Speakers of the House of Representatives. </para>

                            <para>- It would be possible for everybody, including members of this Parliament, to live in hovels, but it is desirable to make distinctions in these matters. Members of Parliament do not do their work in the poorest and least pretentious surroundings, and those who have guided the destinies of this country should be remembered in the manner chosen. We have, near the King&#39;s Hall, an admirable painting of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith, first Chief Justice of the High Court, but otherwise the paintings have been confined to the officials whom I have mentioned. I have heard that it is not intended in the future that so many of these paintings should be made. It was suggested some months ago that portraits of Presidents of the Senate would not be painted. If there is any justification for that statement I make a strong protest. </para>

                        <para>&#91;10.41&#93;. - After lengthy negotiations, Tasmanian Steamers Proprietary Limited undertook to provide a new vessel for the Tasmania service to replace the older vessels which did not meet with present-day requirements. On the 13th March, 1935, the <inline font-style="italic">Taroona</inline> was placed in service, and the older vessels <inline font-style="italic">Loongana</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Oonah</inline> were disposed of. The terms of the agreement entered into between the Postmaster-General and the company were printed as a parliamentary paper, dated the 13th March, 1935. The cost of the <inline font-style="italic">Taroona,</inline> as delivered in Melbourne, was &#163;313,680 4s. 3d., and under the terms of clause 39 <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of the agreement, which provides that &#34; for every &#163;100 or part thereof by which the total net cost  . . of the new mail ship . . . exceeds . &#39; . . the sum of &#163;292,000, the subsidy shall be increased . ... by an amount of &#163;12 per annum &#34;, the subsidy was adjusted to the final rate of &#163;22,604 per annum. Clause 38 provides for the payment of a subsidy at the rate of &#163;50,000 per annum, subject to variation as described above, but of this amount &#163;30,000 represents the service rendered to the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department in respect of carriage of mails, whilst the excess amount is the subsidy paid by the Commonwealth to secure better and speedier service between Melbourne and Tasmania.

                        PEARCE (Western Australia - Minister for External Affairs) &#91;10.43&#93;. - Pursuant to the policy of the Government in respect of the development&#39; of Northern Australia by means of chartered companies, a proposal made by lessees in the Barkly Tableland-McArthur River area was investigated during the financial year 1934-35. Briefly, the proposal was to amalgamate existing land leases in the Barkly Tableland area under the control of a co-operative company, which, with the development of a port at Vanderlin Island, having suitable communication with grazing areas of the tableland, would be able to engage in the chillea beef trade. The investigation revealed&#34; that the proposal did not possess the economic attractions claimed for it, and for this reason the Commonwealth Government declined to lend the financial support required by the proposed cooperative company. The sub-committee of Cabinet dealing with this matter gave consideration during last year to several minor projects connected with the Northern Territory, the investigation of which did not involve expenditure. The provision for 1936-37 is intended to cover the cost of the investigation of other similar proposals which may he made during the course of the year.

                        <para>.- The sum of &#163;3,350 is set down under division 104, item 9, for &#34;Remission of income tax, sales tax and estate duties under special circumstances&#34;. I should like to know what special circumstances justify remissions of sales tax. I have in mind an unsuccessful application for the remission of sales tax on the machinery used by a gentleman who established a fish canning industry in the north-west of Western Australia at Shark Bay. I should like to know who is more deserving of a remission of sales tax than a man who establishes fish canning works in our unpopulated north.  His  application to the Treasurer which was refused, read as follows :  - </para>

Tax.  paid to the  department may be repaid to the taxpayer either when it has been incorrectly collected under the law, or when, although correctly collected, the Government decides to repay it to the taxpayer because of special circumstances. In the first instance, the repayment is made  from  refunds of revenue, and, in the second instance, it is made under the item referred to by the honorable senator. In the circumstances covered by that item, the tax is legally payable, but the Government decides that the special circumstances are such that it need not be paid. Those are the principles upon which remissions are made. </para>

                        <para>&#91;10.56&#93;.  -  There are two reasons for the reduction. In the first place, the income tax  law has been  simplified,  and  it is believed that there will be fewer claims for refunds. Secondly, there have been many exemptions under the sales tax law, and many of the contentious matters which arose previously are not likely to arise in the future. Consequently a smaller sum is considered sufficient this year. </para>

                        <para>. -  Provision was made in the Appropriation Bill last year for remissions of taxes amounting to &#163;10,000 ; this year the vote for that purpose has been reduced to &#163;3,350. I protest against the reduction because it seems to me that had we voted this year the same amount as last year the Government would be able to adopt a much more generous policy in regard to remissions of sales tax generally; it could deal more generously with applications for remissions by industries that should be encouraged, including fish-canning and other branches of the fisheries industry, established in those parts of our coasts where fish are most prolific, such as Shark Bay, Western Australia, our northern sea ports, and the Great Barrier Reef. How can we expect the Government to be liberal in granting remissions of sales tax if the vote is cut down by two-thirds ? In letters  addressed  to me the Treasurer has expressed sympathy with applications for remissions of the tax, particularly in regard to an application received from Shark Bay, but he has refused relief. When the Government is sympathetic towards the establishment of new industries in remote parts of the Commonwealth we should vote it sufficient money with which to give practical expression to that sympathy. </para>

The association is governed by an honorary board composed of

                        PEARCE (Western Australia - Minister for External Affairs) &#91;11.19&#93;. - This amount covers grants to the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute in Melbourne for the carrying out of research work in virus diseases, as a new field of bacteriology which has recently been developed by progress in research. Diseases have hitherto been classified as parasitic or bacteriological; but quite recently it has been shown that as well as bacteria certain ultra-microscopic viruses are an important cause of virus diseases. All this is new work, and in order that the serum laboratories might be able to keep abreast of the work by the preparation of the necessary vaccines and sera, a joint arrangement has been made by which the serum laboratories and the Walter and Eliza Hal&#93; Institute work in co-operation on different phases of this problem. Funds for this purpose amount to &#163;3,100. The sum of &#163;3,000 i= allocated for the extension of research in tropical diseases, especially in northern Australia and New Guinea. Provisions of &#163;2,000 for research work in connexion with maternal mortality, &#163;5,000 to cover the expenses of the nutrition inquiry, and &#163;5,000 for the work of the proposed national health and medical research council, have been made. The amount of &#163;32j000 provided for maternal and infant welfare is for subsidies for extended work for the benefit of crippled children and for the campaign against maternal mortality.

                        <para>&#91;11.27&#93;.- During 1933 approval was granted to waive the imposition of rates on pastoralists, and this vote now bears the whole of the expenditure in connexion with the destruction of dingoes. Payment is made at the rate of 7s. 6d. a scalp. The annual expenditure during the last financial year was &#163;1,864, and as it is difficult to forecast the expenditure under this item, provision has been made on the same basis as the vote for last year, namely, &#163;2,400. </para>

                        <para>.- The sum of &#163;4,100 is being appropriated to meet the operating expenses of the patrol vessel. What action is being taken by the Government to patrol the pearling grounds, some of which are outside the three-mile limit, where a good deal of poaching by foreigners has occurred? Pearlers in the vicinity of Darwin and Broome are keenly interested in this matter, and it is considered that additional patrol boats should be provided. </para>

                        GEORGE PEARCE  (Western Australia - Minister for External Affairs) &#91;11.29&#93;.- The Commonwealth patrol vessel operating in northern waters is used for, among other things, the purpose mentioned by the honorable senator. It is not proposed, during this financial year, to provide a. patrol boat for Broome. Certain duties devolve upon the governments of Western Australia and Queensland, as territorial waters are under the control of the State authorities. In such waters, the Commonwealth has no police powers; it is doubtful what powers it possesses outside territorial waters; it is arguable whether it has any. Most of the fishing grounds are within the three-mile limit, and the States have rigidly insisted that they should exercise authority in such waters. There is a good deal of misapprehension concerning the powers of the Commonwealth in this respect.
