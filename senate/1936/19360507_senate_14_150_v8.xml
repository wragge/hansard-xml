                            <para>At the 1st May, 1930, there were 340 appeals listed for hearing by the Entitlement Appeal Tribunal in the States in which it will actually conduct sittings during the period from the 1st May, 1936, to the12th June, 1930, and 245 other appeals are ready to be listed in the various States to which the tribunal will subsequently proceed, while 93 appeals are waiting registration by the commission. This makes inall a total of678 appeals already listed or waiting listing or registration. The tribunal can hear 50 cases a week. It will, therefore, dispose of the 340 cases actually listed within the period from the 1st May, 1936, to the 12th June, 1936, and the remaining 338 cases in less than seven weeks from that date. The tribunal can hear 700 cases in fourteen weeks. This means that the average waiting period for each appeal is less than three months. Seven hundred cases are necessary to keep one tribunal constantly functioning. When the additional tribunal was appointed, there was an accumulation of 1,302 cases&#39;. This was beyond the capacity of one tribunal. The accumulation having been disposed of, the position is now well within the capacity of the existing tribunal. </para>

                        <para>. - I am astonished to find that cement-making machines are subject to the high duties of, British 35 per cent., and general and intermediate tariffs 55 per cent., especially when I reflect that yesterday the committee agreed to duties of British free, and general and intermediate tariffs 15 per cent., in respect of many different classes of machinery under item 174, including machines required for the making of macaroni! If the committee desires to protect secondary industries in this way, it should afford protection to those industries which have to meet the fiercest competition from abroad, and are of most value to this country. Should the Senate agree to request the House of Representatives to reduce the duties on cement, it should allow Australian manufacturers of cement to obtain their machinery requirements as cheaply as possible, particularly under the British preferential tariff. I therefore move - </para>

The alterations in this item were made in consequence of the board&#39;s report, dated the 31st May, 1935, on page 3, on which it dealt with aerial cableways and aerial ropeways. It came to the conclusion that those articles should be segregated and consequently the item was divided into 176 (d) (1) and 176 (d) (2), and mechanical cars, and parts thereof for use on aerial ropeways were taken out of the item. That is the only alteration made in respect of this item as compared with the 1933 schedule. </para>

                    <quote>
                        <para>The various types of machinery included under the item may be divided into two main groups, the one comprising types in common demand such as road-making machines and the smaller stone-crushing machines and the other comprising types for which there is only an occasional demand consisting for the most part of more or less permanent equipment, such as ash handling plant, cement-making machines and large crushers. While Australian manufacturers have for many years been constructing machinery coming within both of the groups mentioned they have naturally been more successful as regards the types in greater demand. As a matter of fact, very few of the more commonly-used machines were being imported under the former rates of duty. A typical comparison given in evidence showed the landed cost of arock crusher - size of jaws 16 inches by9&#189; inches - to be &#163;479 inclusive of the increased duty, against the local manufacturers price of &#163;330. These figures indicate that Australian manufacturers could successfully compete under duties much lower than those operating at the date of the inquiry. It is significant also that some of the leading manufacturers of such machines did not tender evidence in support of the duties. </para>

                        <para>. - In connexion with sub-item l, which covers sugar refining machinery, I point out that the old duties were British 45 per cent., and general 55 per cent., subject to exchange adjustments. The duties now proposed are, British 25 per cent., intermediate42&#189; per cent., and general 53¾ per cent. What is the reason for these reductions? Australian manufacturers are able to supply this class of machinery; as a matter of fact, during the last three years they made sugarrefining machinery valued at &#163;261,000. Seeing  that the sugar industry is already heavily protected, and in view of the report appearing in yesterday&#39;s press that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company made a profit of nearly &#163;500,000 during the last six months, it seems only right that this company, which derives much of its income from Australian sources, should, in return, be- prepared to place its orders for machinery with Australian firms. </para>

                        J. McLACHLAN (South Australia - Postmaster-General) &#91;3.27 J . - The Tariff Board&#39;s inquiry into the duty on sugar machinery originated in a request made by machinery manufacturers in the United Kingdom for a reduction of duties, in order that they might have &#34;full opportunity of reasonable competition on the basis of article 10 of the Ottawa agreement.&#34; The inquiry covered all the equipment for sugar mills and refineries, which, if imported under the 1933 tariff, would be classifiable under item 176 f 1 machines and machinery n.e.i., and item 208 a manufactures of metals n.e.i. Evidence submitted to the board indicated that machinery valued at &#163;261,000 had been locally supplied by leading manufacturers during the previous three years, and that its production waa an important section of the general engineering industry. Moreover, as Australian engineering firms have .successfully produced sugar machinery under varying trade conditions and obtained a large proportion of the business offering, their efficiency, service, and method of production cannot be seriously challenged. The board considered that the rates now proposed should have the effect of keeping local prices at a reasonable level, and at the same time, permitting the importation of such equipment as cannot be commercially produced in Australia. The general tariff rate is slightly higher than that recommended by the board, a margin for treaty negotiation purposes having been provided.

It is a matter upon which the Opposition is qualified in a special way to speak, because all three of us represent Queensland, which is the principal sugar producing State. Supplementing the remarks just made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie,</inline> in respect of Australian-made machinery, I point out that the sugar mill at Tully, Queensland, is the best equipped and most efficient mill in the southern hemisphere, and, I believe, that it compares more than favorably with any sugar mill in any part of the world. All the machinery in that mill was manufactured by Walkers Limited, of Maryborough. </para>

                    <para class="block">That being so, it seems that their only crime is that they are making a success of their job. We wish to know why the Colonial Sugar Refining Company purchases only 84 per cent. of its machinery in Australia, when all it requires can be manufactured efficiently in this country. Our fiscal policy is framed with the object of developing Australian industries, and all the mechanical plant used in the production and refining of sugar should be manufactured locally. It cannot be said that the sugar industry is not conducted efficiently, that it is incapable of supplying the whole of our requirements, or that it is making excessive profits, but it can be shown, as the Minister has indicated, that the machinery used in the industry can be produced in Australia at prices which compare more than favorably with those prevailing elsewhere. I am conversant with the efficient manner in which the works of Walkers Limited, of Maryborough, are conducted. I know the city and its people. I know many of the men engaged in the industry, and I realize how they will be affected if, in consequence of importations, Walkers Limited have to reduce the number of hands employed.

In order to assist the Australian dairying industry, the home price of butter is higher than world&#39;s parity; but the Opposition does not contend that that price should be reduced. It desires that the dairymen shall receive a fair price for their product; our manufacturers of machinery also should enjoy the same consideration. With the competition which occurs between the various firms in the Commonwealth, the Labour party considers that a fair price is maintained for machinery of this class. </para>

                            <para>- The Colonial Sugar Refining Company admittedlyhas made large profits; but this Government or any other government, if it exercised its powers, could relieve that firm of a portion of those profits. But because the Colonial Sugar Refining Company has made huge profits, why should the tariff be reduced in order to permit the entry of sugar-refining machinery from Great Britain? The contention that because a refining company is making allegedly excessive profits we must attack the manufacture of sugar-refining machinery - an industry which has been built up by industrial pioneers - is, in my opinion, puerile. Reference has been made to the volume of business transacted by British manufacturers of this class of machinery. From remarks that have been uttered, one would conclude that they do not export large quantities to Australia and that, therefore, they should be given a reasonable opportunity to increase their sales in the Commonwealth, although it would be to the detriment of Australian industry. I quote the following extract  from the Tariff Board&#39;s report of the 17th December, 1934 : - </para>

                    </para>
                    <para class="block">!From that information, I conclude that the manufacturers of the United Kingdom are enjoying a particularly busy time and that they are competing successfully on the Australian market. The Government should heed the protest of the Opposition; instead of blindly following the recommendations of the Tariff Board on almost every occasion, it should recognize the wisdom of adequately safeguarding Australian industries. The Labour party contends that the Australian people pay a reasonable price for their sugar. The industry has been organized thoroughly and efficiently from base to apex, and the agreement between the Government and the sugar interests for the sale of sugar within the Commonwealth at a satisfactory price has been renewed for a further period of five years. </para>

The only protest made has emanated from a few dowagers who constitute the Housewives&#39; Association - a few individuals who are probably paid to carry on propaganda against the sugar industry. In my opinion, they have no considerable following. </para>

                            <para>- I realize that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company takes its profits from the pockets of the workers. On a previous occasion the Opposition showed what percentage of the company&#39;s profits -was made in Australia and what percentage in other parts of the world. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> interjected that, during the last six months, this company has made a profit of &#163;500,000. If&#39; that is so, why should the honorable senator, and the Government, make an effort to obtain from the United Kingdom cheaper machinery for the use of the company? </para>

                            <para>- I pointed out that Great Britain enjoys a large business in the sale of machinery of this class. In order to survive, the British manufacturers do not need to launch an attack upon Australian industry. Some honorable senators have conveyed the impression that the industry in Great Britain &#34; is going to the dogs &#34; ; therefore Australia must extend some assistance to it. The Leader of the Opposition pointed out the admirable work that has been done in the production of this machinery in the Commonwealth. Some splendidly equipped mills are operating in Queensland. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Goldsmith,</inline> general manager and director of Walkers Limited, Maryborough, stated before the Tariff Board - </para>

                            <para>- The fact that no machinery has been imported does not destroy my argument. Australian manufacturers have protested against any reduction of the duty. Obviously, if the British manufacturers are unable to compete under the lowered duties, it will be competent for them to make a further application. Then if the principle upon which the Government is acting is sound, the request will be referred to the Tariff Board, which must take cognizance of evidence furnished by the British manufacturers, and might recommend a further reduction of the duties. </para>

                            <para>- I said nothing of the sort. The honorable gentleman has no right to assert that I am misleading the committee.  His  trouble is that he and his Queensland Labour friends are getting what they have been looking for as regards the relationship of British preference to Queensland sugar and our obligations under the Ottawa agreement. They cannot have it both ways. They cannot, on behalf of Walkers Limited, object to the lower tariff rates on sugar machinery, and, at the same time, expect preference for Queensland sugar in the British market. &#34;Under the agreement with South Africa, they now have a market in Britain, which, in other circumstances, would probably be closed against them. It was only natural that British manufacturers of sugar machinery should expect something from us in return for concessions which Britain is giving to our sugar producers in its market. We have made a bargain with Great Britain, and have certain obligations, which, in the interests of Australian sugar-growers, should be honoured. </para>

                            <para>- Evidently the honorable senator is smarting under logic from which he cannot escape. When he claims increased protection for Walkers Limited, of Maryborough - a firm which has not itself complained of the duties - he knows that he is imperilling an industry upon which a large portion of the people of Queensland depend. </para>

                            <para>- We should not deal lightly with a subject of such importance. The Tariff Board&#39;s report has been framed in the light of the Ottawa agreement. The board recommended certain duties on the basis of the existing exchange. That may be, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> stated, only a small part of our obligations; but it serves to illustrate what I am tempted to describe as the utter lack of morality of those who say that the Government should not give effect to the findings of the board, but who support the Premier of Queensland in his attempts to maintain preference in Britain for Queensland sugar. </para>

Maryborough is not so large a town that it can lightly see the number of employees of one of its manufacturing establishments drop from 800 to 200. Walkers Limited, like many other firms in Australia, first commenced the manufacture of machinery in Ballarat in 1864. Their Queensland factory was established in 18C8. Those who gave evidence before the Tariff Board in support of the then existing duties of British 45 per cent. and general 65 per cent., were - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> C. Myhill, secretary of the Metal Trades Employers Association, Sydney; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> S.

Kelly &#38; Lewis Proprietary Limited ; Robison Brothers &#38; Company Proprietary Limited, Steel Company of Australia Proprietary Limited, and Thompson&#39;s Engineering and Pipe Company Limited. That list of companies which favoured the existing duties is evidence that a number of Australian manufacturers receive some advantage from the Australian sugar industry. A reduction of duty in relation to one industry may vitally affect a number of other industries. </para>

                            <para>- The invention of such a machine might hit Australian manufacturers very hard. A good deal would depend on the patent rights. The honorable senator&#39;s question might also be adapted to the wheatfarming industry. In the event of another country developing a cereal far superior to wheat, rice or corn, would <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline> advocate the discontinuance of wheat-growing in Australia? Walkers Limited are not the only company in Queensland manufacturing machinery for refining sugar, because at Bundaberg there is an establishment which makes this class of machinery. On one occasion, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Goldsmith,</inline> of Walkers Limited, told me that were it not for the manufacture of sugar-mill machinery, the firm would probably have had to close its doors. The manufacture of Diesel engines assisted it tokeep going. I admit that we must keep in mind that the Ottawa agreement calls for reasonable competition, but, on the facts before me, the position is so serious that were Walkers Limited again to get into the position in which they were in 1930, a reduction of the duties on the class of machinery covered by this item would practically wipe them out of existence. We on this side do not say that every reduction of duty is wrong; but, in this instance, the evidence is clear that a reduction would endanger a valuable Australian industry. I rose particularly to inform the committee that the Minister was wrong in saying that there was no opposition to a reduction of the duties. The Minister is generally fair in the presentation of his case, but, in this instance, he, unintentionally, misled the committee. I trust that the committee will not take any action which might injure Australian manufacturers of machinery used in the processing of sugar. </para>

                        <para>. - From the tearfully tragic cry of the Minister one would gather that it is necessary to have bilateral trade agreements, not only between countries, but also between industries. He suggested that, if we sell sugar to Britain,we must buy sugar-refining machinery from that country. Such an argument is false and futile and, tested by sound principles of international trade, is utterly stupid. The Minister endeavoured to put the Labour party in a false position. Eight from the beginning, we opposed the Ottawa agreement, because we did not believe it would prove of any real service to Australia. Admittedly, in respect of it, those controlling industry to-day are placed in an invidious position. But we do not want the Government to make further mistakes which will react on the general body of workmen, whether or not they are employed in the industries concerned. One-way trade is advocated only by people with one-track minds. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator apparently admits that he, as well as the Minister, has a one-track mind. The Labour party realizes that Britain gives Australian sugar a preferential share of its market, but we say that Great Britain can be compensated by supplying to us millions of pounds&#39; worth of .articles of a type not manufactured in Australia. This is the difference between our view on this matter, and the view of those mental  troglydytes  who contend that we must import certain commodities which are being, or can be, produced in Australia. We do not want to prejudice international trade; but we say that industries which have been established in. Australia must be protected. We require certain goods from Great Britain and other parts of the Empire, but we should encourage only importations of those classes of goods which are not produced in the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- In a White Paper published about a year ago, and also through its emissary, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Malcolm</inline> MacDonald. who visited Australia recently, Britain has given us clearly to understand that it intends to place its primary industries on a sound footing. Every effort has been made by the British Minister for Agriculture <inline font-weight="bold">(Major Elliott)</inline> to improve the position of those industries. <inline font-weight="bold">Major Elliott,</inline> who I consider to be one of the most advanced thinkers among modern politicians, sees clearly the trend of events and he has moulded his policy along lines which will  give an impetus to British primary industries. He, for one, is desirous of raising international trade to a higher level. But honorable senators with whom the Ottawa agreement is an obsession, and who have only one-track minds on trade matters, are constantly endeavouring to find a solution of our international trade problem by dividing our home market for basic goods, which are produced in superabundance. They reveal a false conception of the position. The Opposition constantly tries to impress upon honorable senators that a solution is not to be found merely by sharing the Australian home market for machinery, butter, meat, or any other commodity which we are able to produce, with producers overseas. The problem goes deeper than that; international trade must be raised to a higher level iri order that we may  be enabled to dispose of our exportable commodities in Britain and, in return, purchase from the Motherland goods of a class not manufactured in this country. This is a fair and plain statement of the Labour party&#39;s policy on this matter. </para>

It is a policy supported by thinking people who desire to march gradually along the road of evolution to better times, and to a higher system of economy. But honorable senators opposite are stuck in an intellectual morass; for them progress is impossible. </para>

I suggest that except for the speeches of two or three senators, the debates would be very poor indeed.

The Minister reproved the Opposition for lacking in honour; he alleges that we are prepared to break an agreement while, at the same time, expecting the other party to honour it. Nothing is further from the minds of members of the Opposition. Dishonour, if any, will be incurred through the actions of the Government. We refuse to make overtures to the manufacturers of sugar refining machinery in the United Kingdom, because if we did so we would be selling them a gold brick; we do not propose to do anything so immoral. These reductions will, or will not, facilitate the entry of this class of machinery into Australia. In the former event we shall, according to the Government&#39;s arguments, be keeping faith under the Ottawa agreement with the manufacturers of the United Kingdom; but if, as the Minister says, these reductions will not facilitate the entry of this machinery into Australia, we shall merely be giving lip service to the Ottawa agreement, and deceiving overseas manufacturers. I believe that the Government realizes that the Ottawa agreement will have to be revised. The Opposition refuses to admit that the Government, either legally, or iri any other way, is bound to follow slavishly the findings of the Tariff Board. This item provides an opportunity to reveal that a reasonable number of honorable senators realize the necessity for encouraging efficient Australian industries. Two firms which have proved that they are efficient, are Walkers Limited, Maryborough, and another in Bundaberg. Each of these towns has a population of  11,000.  In Maryborough, the two chief industries are engineering and timber. If the engineering works, through lack of orders, are forced to sack  400  men, the effect on the town as a whole will be disastrous. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J.</inline> V. MacDonald pointed out that the general manager of this company recently toured the world to discover additional articles in the production of which the company&#39;s plant could be operated to greater capacity. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister is fairly well-known in Queensland. I invite him during the recess to tour the sugar districts in that State in company with me, and I predict that if he declares that this Government intends to adopt a policy which will injure the sugar industry, he will find it prudent to place a safe distance between himself . and the infuriated populace. The Tariff Board&#39;s report states that the firms engaged in the manufacture of machinery used in the sugar industry are unusually proficient, and- that up to the present they have supplied over  80  per&#39; cent, of its requirements. Under reduced duties .. machinery manufactured in the United Kingdom, and other countries will be able to enter into competition with that made in Australia. It was not my intention to move a request on this item ; but I am so incensed at the tactics adopted to defeat our modest suggestion, that these duties should be reconsidered, that I have moved a request, which,  I  trust, will have the support of a majority of the committee. </para>

                        <para>.- &#39;The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator A. J. McLachlan)</inline> said that over 80 per cent, of the machinery used in the production and refining of sugar is manufactured in Australia ; but can he .give the value of mechanical plant, which has to be imported owing to the existence of patent rights, and the value of that manufactured in Australia under licence from patentees in other parts of the world? During the last 25 years the methods adopted in producing and refining sugar have been revolutionized by inventors, who, naturally, have to protect their interests. &#34;If the holders of patent rights do not grant local manufacturers a licence to manufacture, the machinery has to be imported from the countries in which the patentee is operating. I believe that a good deal of the locallymade machinery used in the sugar industry is manufactured under licence. One member of the Opposition said that it would be unwise to reduce the price of sugar ; but, if the producers are receiving a fair return, why should not the price be reduced to enable the consumers to obtain some benefit? </para>

                        V. MacDONALD.Because centres such as Maryborough and Bundaberg, which are vitally concerned in this matter, are located in Queensland, honorable senators representing -other States are apt to think that this matter is relatively insignificant. Although I represent Queensland I take a deep interest in the tariff as affecting the industrial welfare of all States; it matters not to me whether an industry is situated in Warrnambool, Port Pirie, or Bunbury. Honorable senators should not confine their interests to industries in the particular centres with which they are familiar; they should adopt an Australia-wide outlook. Apparently the existing duty was deemed to be quite ample in 1933, when it was framed under the Ottawa agreement. If the initial protests of British manufac turers against the tariff are successful, we may expect every month to receive requests from them for the downward revision of duties, on the pretence that we are not observing the spirit of Ottawa. In connexion with the manufacture of machinery required in the sugar industry, a representative of the British manufacturers went so far as to say that the number of years which Walkers Limited have been established should safeguard their industry from possible ill-effects from the overseas competition. I have previously pointed out that five years ago this enterprise was on the point of going out of existence. The number of employees had been reduced to a mere 200 and the general manager was obliged to travel extensively abroad to obtain some new commodity to manufacture in order to keep that once great concern alive. I hope that the request moved by the Leader of the Opposition
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline>
                        will be carried. The Minister asked what Queensland would do if the British preference to Australian sugar were reduced ; I might retort : &#34; How would the Commonwealth itself regard such an occurrence?&#34; The sale of the surplus production of Australian sugar in Great Britain increases the London funds, with which we meet out overseas commitments, by an average amount of &#163;2,000,000 a year. In view of the facts I have given, particularly in regard to the general Australian interest in the sugar industry, honorable senators should shed their prejudices. The representatives of other States should realize that the Australian manufacturers of machinery of this class are vitally concerned, and any action taken which is detrimental to Bundaberg and Maryborough will have repercussions among manufacturers in Sydney and Melbourne.

                        <para>. - As the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> has submitted a request to increase the duty on machinery required for the refining of sugar, I desire to define my attitude on this point. In the early stages of the discussion of the schedule he said that it was not the intention of the Opposition to move for increased duties, when it considered that it had no prospects of success. The present request can be cited as an entire contradiction of the honorable senator&#39;s statement because, as the division will show, it has no prospects of success. It is not my intention to support the request. Evidence submitted to the Tariff Board cannot always be interpreted as a protest. Members of the Labour party have quoted the evidence given by Australian manufacturers in regard to this item and have contended that it represented a protest against a reduction of duties. I consider that that is not a natural or inevitable conclusion. Have the Australian manufacturers protested against the recommendation of the Tariff Board ? </para>

                            <para>- I am glad of that ; but the action advocated by the Leader of the Opposition will prove disadvantageous to the sugar-cane industry because the prohibitive tariff which he proposes must necessarily increase the cost of production. If a prohibitive tariff is imposed certain machinery, which may be an improvement upon that now in operation in Australia, will be debarred from entering this country. Does the honorable senator suggest for one moment that if an improved machine is made in England, the Australian sugar-growing industry should be denied the advantage of it unless they pay excessive duties on it? If these machines are subjected to high duties new machines must represent a higher capital value than the machines previously in use. Therefore, the cost of production of sugar must consequently be increased. In my opinion, by submitting this request the honorable senator is not acting in the best interests of the sugar industry. In my opinion he is doing it the greatest conceivable disservice. The actual cost of sugar refining will be increased and the logicalconclusion is that, if the honorable senator is going to allow a margin of profit to the producers, the selling price must be raised. In that event the United Kingdom will, of necessity, be asked to grant a greater degree of preference to Australian sugar. If the honorable senator is sincerely desirous of assisting the sugar-growers, he should endeavour to reduce the refining costs to the lowest possible level. To ensure this he should consent to the manufacturers of machinery meeting a reasonable amount of external competition, particularly in capital good&#39;s. The Government does not ask the committee to agree to duties which will enable British machinery to compete on an unreasonable or preferential basis. For those reasons I shall vote against the request. </para>

                        <para>.- Sub-item (n) fixes the rates on air compressors of the reciprocating and rotary types, and introduces two new principles, one very vicious and one rather foolish. I realize that the Postmaster-General is, in this matter, a political Shylock; that is to say, he has been instructed to press for the bond and nothing but the bond. Nevertheless, I hope to persuade the honorable gentleman to meet my objections to this sub-item. In the 1933 tariff air compressors were  dutiable at 33&#163; per cent. British, and 65 per cent, general. The duties have now been reduced to 20 per cent. British, and_40&#163; per cent, general, with an intermediate tariff of 37&#163; per cent. The reduction is substantial. Moreover, the sub-item now is divided into portable compressors and other types, whereas in the 1933 tariff all types were included in one sub-item. I&#39; do not know why this has been done. As it does not seem to serve any definite purpose, I hope the Minister will request the House of Representatives to make a slight alteration. On principle I take the strongest objection to the little &#34; fish &#34; being left to local manufacturers, while the big  fish &#34; are secured by outside competitors. In the 1933 tariff the duty was on compressors of a capacity of 2,320 cubic feet per minute. The capacity has now been reduced to 1,750 cubic feet, and the duty is progressively lowered on the heavier types of machines until at a capacity of 2,250 cubic feet the British compressor is admitted free. What is the reason for this . progressive reduction according to the size of the machines? Australian manufacturers have made large and small compressors for many years with complete satisfaction to their users. </para>

If the figures &#34; 1,750 &#34; were altered to &#34; 2,250 &#34;, no damage would be done to the Government&#39;s schedule and relief would be given to Australian manufacturers. I am not asking that the duty should be returned to the 1933 standard, although I consider that the reduction is very drastic. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that is the explanation. The increase may have been due to a revival of industry generally. I have no personal knowledge of the manufacture of these machines, but the figures suggest that machines of this type are coming more largely into use in Australia, and the interests of local makers should be considered. I hope that the Minister will accept my suggestion and submit a request <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the House of Representatives to make the alteration. </para>

                        <para>. - In 1929-30, the total imports of compressors were valued at &#163;116,953. In that year imports from the United States of America reached &#163;91,301, and from the United Kingdom &#163;21,992. In 1930-31 they were &#163;24,138; in 1931-32, &#163;2,694; in 1932-33, &#163;5,750. ; in 1933-34, &#163;9,131; and last year &#163;37,494. The figures for the six months of the present financial year are &#163;35,960. Admissions under departmental by-law have been negligible. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The rates of duty are based on the recommendations of the Tariff Board, but the recommended general tariff rate has been increased by 6^ per cent, in the case of the portable compressors, and by 8f per cent, for other compressors of a capacity not exceeding 1,750 cubic feet, to provide for treaty negotiation. Increased rates are provided when Australian currency is at par with sterling. </para>
                    <para>This sub-item covers compressors of the reciprocating and  rotary types, of which the board estimated the present annual consumption at approximately &#163;80,000, of which 85 per cent, is supplied from local sources. Compressors up to 500 cubic feet are regularly manufactured locally, and carried in stock, and manufacturers are prepared to produce compressors of greater capacity. The demand is small for compressors above the range of 1,500 cubic feet, and the board considers that those of a capacity of 2,250 cubic feet and over should be admissible free British, and 15 per cent, general. Relative costs both for wages and material show a trend more favorable to the Australian manufacturer than prior to the depression. He  is, therefore, in a better competitive position with a duty of 25 per cent. and the present rate of exchange than he was when 45 per cent. was operating with exchange at par. The board considers, however, that this improved position is justified, and should enable the local manufacturer to extend his range of production. </para>
                    <para>The protective effect of the gradually reducing duty must be stressed. Over the range of compressors having a capacity exceeding 1,750 and up to 2,250 cubic feet, the duties are proportionately decreased down to the minimum duty on the compressor of a capacity of 2,250 cubic feet and over. Air compressors are largely used in mining, an industry giving employment and meriting the fullest consideration. Portable compressors consist of a self-contained assembly of compressor, prime mover and auxiliary equipment mounted on a wheeled chassis, the prime mover being a high speed petrol or fuel oil engine. </para>
                    <para>In connexion with the local manufacture of portable air compressors in which the engine is directly coupled to the plant, by-law admission under item 404 is allowed in respect of petrol engines, and crude oil engines up to and including 100 horse-power. The board considered that, as the engines are not manufactured in Australia, lower duties over the whole equipment are required, and recommended that the duty in the case of such portable compressors be 5 per cent. lower than on other types of compressors. A further amendment to the item was made on the 27th March last. The words &#34; including air blowers &#34; have now been included in the item. Air blowers and air compressors are machines of a similar type, being practically the same in mechanical construction. The principal difference is in the pressure at which these machines deliver air, the compressor delivering at a high pressure, and the blower delivering at a low pressure. The effect of the amendment is to ensure that air compressors and air blowers of the reciprocating and rotary types will be treated similarly for tariff purposes. The amendment has the concurrence of the Tariff Board. </para>

                    <quote>
                        <para>In documents submitted confidentially the representative of the local manufacturers of by far the greatest number of compressors during the past ten years showed that they regularly manufacture and carry in stock compressors of various types up to a capacity of 500 cubic feet. They also have a range of what may be called &#34; standard &#34; machines to a much higher capacity in which the turnover is too small to warrant the carrying of stocks, but for which they possess complete designs, patterns and other essentials of manufacture. . In addition, they are prepared to quote for other compressors to purchasers&#39; specifications up to the limit of 2,500 cubic feet capacity. The evidence indicated that the number of compressors required in the range above 1,500 cubic feet is very small. </para>
                        <para>A few compressors above this limit are at times required by large undertakings such as the largest mining companies. It is clear that no good purpose is served by the imposition of a duty on the largest compressors, and the board considers that the position will be adequately met by providing that compressors of a capacity of 2,250 cubic feet and over be admitted free of duty under the British Preferential Tariff, with a gradual increase of duty on smaller compressors up to the full rate at a capacity of 1,750 cubic feet. </para>
                        <para>The board is satisfied that the duties recommended will adequately protect the &#34; stock &#34; range of compressors which covers much the greatest part of the business and also will permit reasonable opportunities of expansion in the &#34; standard &#34; range. </para>
                        <para>Outside these ranges, in most cases even the higher rates of duty requested by the local manufacturers would not prove effective, but would simply increase the cost of the compressor to the user without any compensating benefit to local industry. </para>

                        <para>.- The information supplied to the committee by the Minister does not get us any further forward. The drastic reduction of duties proposed by the Government will, if agreed to, force local engineering firms to cease the manufacture  of air compressors with a capacity of more than 1,750 cubic feet a minute, notwithstanding that the Tariff Board admits that such machines have been made in Australia, and that local manufacturers have all the patterns necessary  for  making them. It would appear, from the Tariff Board&#39;sreport, that Australian manufacturers are failing in their duty, because they do not keep in stock numbers of machines of big capacity, each valued at many thousands of pounds. Can any one reasonably expect a manufacturer  to  keep in stock air compressors with a capacity of 2,250 cubic feet a minute, awaiting orders which might never arrive? I assume that the reduction of the duty has been recommended in order that overseas firms may have a reasonable chance  to  compete with local manufacturers and, therefore, it is clear that the lower duties would not only shut Australian manufacturers out of the market for machines of large capacity, hut would also subject them to greater competition in respect of the smaller machines, which represent a considerable proportion of the output of Australian factories. I have no objection to the entry under by-law of air compressors which cannot be manufactured in Australia, but I submit that local engineering firms which are capable of making the machines are entitled to consideration. As the application of lower duties to air compressors of a larger capacity than was previously specified would ruin some local manufacturers, I appeal to the Government notto persist in its drastic proposal.I know something about these machines, because I use them in my  own  business. I know, also, that the Castlemaine factory has spent thousands of pounds in equipping itself with the patterns necessary for the making of  air  compressors. Those pa  Herns  will be useless if the reduced duties are agreed to. I feel confident that the Government does not realize the gravity of its action, and I again appeal to the Minister either to agree to my proposal, or to postpone the item for further consideration. </para>
