        <para>Members of the Opposition strongly resent, after having been recalled to Canberra, being asked to remain here until the Government, is prepared to tell the Parliament what n government somewhere else in the world has done, and then to ask it to say " ditto ". I hope that I am speaking not for the Opposition alone, but also for other honorable senators who have some regard for the dignity due to the elected representatives of the people, when I say that I object to being treated in this way. While we are waiting about, with no definite purpose in view, all kinds of things are happening. I wish now to emphasize what I said yesterday in regard to the objection of the Opposition to any attempt being made on the other side of the world to force  His  Majesty off the throne. The Opposition is of the opinion that no further- adjournment of this Parliament should take place until it has been placed in possession of all the facts relating  to the position which has arisen. </para>
        <para>The <inline font-weight="bold">PRESIDENT (Senator the Hon. P, J. lynch).</inline> - The honorable senator is not entitled to refer to what has not taken place elsewhere; he must confine himself to the motion before the Senate. </para>

            <para>- I shall confine my remarks to the position as it exists here in Australia, because, in the view of the Opposition, that is the thing that really matters to this Parliament. It is our duty to decide the attitude of the Senate to the position which has arisen. Australia is no longer a colony, subject to control by Great Britain, but a nation with full rights, including the right of direct access to the King; for it must be remembered that His Majesty is King of Australia as well as King of Great Britain. I repeat that no further adjournment of the Parliament should be contemplated until it has been placed in possession of all the facts. All kinds of rumours are afloat, and all kinds of manoeuvres are taking place. Negotiations are proceeding. The Parliaments of the British dominions, as well as the Parliament of the United Kingdom, should be placed in possession of all the facts before any decision is made. </para>

            <para>- I am discussing the statement of the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> that the Senate should adjourn till 10.30 to-morrow morning because the Prime Minister is not able to say to-day what the position is. Did he refer to the position in Australia, or on the other side of the world? As Leader of the Opposition, I claim my right to deal with every line and syllable of that statement. 1" say now that if it is the intention of the Government to  gag " the Leader of the Opposition, we  ' on this side, are prepared to allow the electors to judge on which side the balance of justice lies. As I have said, all kinds of rumours are afloat, and all kinds of manoeuvres are taking place. In the streets of Melbourne, newspapers containing the statement that the Government does know the nature of the decision which has been arrived at on the other side of the world are being circulated. The Opposition protests, in the only way open to it, against what is going on, or, more correctly, against what is not going on. In view of the statement of the Leader of the Senate this afternoon, we shall probably be asked to-morrow to come to a decision regarding something which has already been decided. Should that be so, we shall not be in a position to come to an intelligent decision because we have not been placed in possession of any of the facts, let alone all of them. </para>

        <para>The <inline font-weight="bold">PRESIDENT (Senator the Hon. P. J. Lynch).</inline> - That is so, and the Standing Orders also prevent the revival of a question which has already been decided by the Senate. </para>
        <para>SenatorCOLLINGS. - I merely wish to emphasize that there has been a desire on the part of the Government this after noon to prevent the Opposition from saying what it desires to say on the subject of the adjournment of the Senate. - With my colleagues of the Opposition,' and other honorable senators, I was on my way to Queensland where I had a political engagement which would have involved my travelling over a considerable area of that State. We were recalled to Canberra, only to find that we are not permitted to express ourselves or to do any business. We are not willing that the Senate should be adjourned from day to day at the whim of the Government, while honorable senators are cooling their heels about the building, with nothing to do of value to the country. We are denied, by the Government, an opportunity to contribute any measure of service to the taxpayers who pay our salaries. I register the objection of the. Opposition to the adjournment of the Senate to an unusual hour and to the tactics adopted by the Government. </para>
