            <para>.- I thank Hie PostmasterGeneral <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator A. J. McLachlan)</inline> for his courtesy in having supplied mo with a proof report of his second-reading speech. I have done my best to assimilate it, even though imperfectly, in the short- period which has intervened between the adjournment of the Senate  last, night and the hour of meeting today. I protest against the practice of withholding from members of this chamber the. opportunity to arrive at a proper understanding of measures before having to deal with them. With me, this is a complaint of long standing. Senators are not afforded the opportunity to which they are entitled, to give proper consideration to bills before &#34;being called upon to express their opinions concerning them. Their only alternative is to remain silent knowing that they have not an adequate knowledge of the, contents of bills. Seemingly, protest against the practice is useless, and in the circumstances, wo must discharge to the best of our ability the obligation that rests upon us. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Having studied the bill, and the speech of the Minister upon it, I should be lacking in my duty did I not, on behalf of the Opposition, express concurrence with the comments of the honorable gentleman in regard to the stupendous nature of the work involved in the preparation of the measure and the essential steps which preceded its preparation. That the commissioners have performed excellently is unquestionable-, even though we may not agree with th, whole of their findings. I would couple with them in my remarks the draftsman, whose task must have been an exceedingly difficult one, as well as the ministerial representatives of the States and their taxation officials, who attended the several conferences which preceded the drafting of the measure. There can be no questioning the desirability of the goal aimed at by all parties, that the taxpayers of Australia should be enabled to discharge their liabilities by means of one return and one assessment. That, of course, has not yet been attained. Still, it is as well that wc should strive for it. There is not the slightest doubt that sooner or later, and the sooner the better, the federal idea will have to give way to that of unification which to us seems inevitable The sooner we can secure the abolition of six competing and conflicting States, and the passage of all legislation by one national parliament, the better. In the matter of taxation, there would then be one authority instead of seven, each having different ideas. </para>
          <para>The matter of the abolition of the board of review, and the substitution therefor of an appellate tribunal presided over by a single judge of the Supreme Court, has not been brought to fruition so on that matter I need not express any opinions&#39; at this juncture. It is to be regretted that agreement between the States and the Commonwealth &#39;has not been found possible in relation to the profits derived from a trade or business which is carried on in more than one State. I understand that Queensland is one of the offenders in this regard, for reasons with which I am unacquainted. The failure &#39;to reach agreement is further evidence of the wisdom of my suggestion for the abolition of competing authorities. </para>
          <para>Every source of information should have been made available to honorable senators. I am sure that the Minister is not responsible for the fact that we have not before us the Treasurer&#39;s comparisons. </para>

          <para>We of the Opposition are very definitely of the opinion that direct taxation is always preferable to indirect taxation, and we just as definitely hold the view that the tax upon income is the fairest of all taxes, being really a tax upon the margins which the people of a country have available for the upkeep of the </para>
          <para class="block">State. Taxpayers and their associations, who, by means of intensive propaganda and almost continuous parliamentary representation, seek to have taxation reduced, should realize that, but for the existence of a well-ordered State, and the prosecution of its activities, the conduct of the manifold ramifications of business and industry, with all that that connotes, would be impossible, with the result that the income of the individual would not merely be  jeopardized,  but might more easily than many persons imagine become, non-existent. Some of the taxpayers&#39;* associations are adroit at preparingfigures which prove everything but thetruth. I remember seeing one preposterous statement fairly recently, in which the detailed cost of government in thiscountry was worked out at so much a head. The result was astounding, but analysis showed that the figures were misleading and unfair, because they gave no credit whatever for the different assets created by the state activities, or for the advantages which those activities bring to the taxpayers and every unit in the community. </para>
          <para>The Opposition believes in one or two fundamental principles of taxation. One is that, in no circumstances, should there be taxation without representation. I can imagine some of our friends in the Federal Capital Territory saying that we should put that completely into operation, but, of course, at the moment we on this side are not in control of the Treasury bench. We believe also in the fundamental principle that the taxation burden should be always placed definitely and exactly where it belongs. Those who receive the most advantages and benefits from the operations of the taxing authority should carry the taxation burden, whilst those who receive the least of them should not be asked to bear an unfair proportion of the faxes. To summarize it  in the  popular way, we believe that taxation should be placed on the shoulders of those best able to bear it. That it. is not so much a case of how much is taken away from a man by taxation, but how much he has left after the taxing authority has finished with him, is a point all too frequently lost sight of when the basis of levying of taxes is being considered. </para>
          <para>In our opinion, surpluses in the hands of a government are indefensible. By that I mean, not that a government should cut its coat absolutely and only in conformity with the cloth, but that a government&#39;s job is to render service, and not to make profits. It is obvious that if a government ha3 a surplus left, it has taken too much out of the pockets of the taxpayers, or has rendered too little in the form of services to the taxpayers, or has paid its public servants and those carrying on the detailed work of the administration too little by way of reward. To be guilty of any one of these, in my opinion, is not right. I do not mean that a government should not make provision for emergencies. On the contrary, it must do so. A government should not dissipate, in time of plenty, all that it has, because there may come a lean time; but for a government to have ever-recurring surpluses is wrong, not only for the reasons I have given, but also for the reason that it is given an opportunity to pose as a distributor of largesse, and, of course, when it does so it sees that the largesse is distributed in those directions which will bring it most kudos and most political advantage. </para>

          <para>I am pleased that this bill does not differentiate between women who are receiving alimony and those who are receiving separation allowances. I noticed in the Minister&#39;s second-reading speech that he appeared to be somewhat in doubt about the wisdom of the decision arrived at. But it has been arrived at, and we, as an Opposition, approve. Provision has been made in the assessment of total income for the taking into consideration of the value of residence and quarters, meals and sustenance provided for employees. If that is passed, I hope that every care will be taken to see that the returns of employers in this connexion are keenly scrutinized, 30 that the employers will not be allowed to make a profit as far as their income tax is concerned by reason of the charges they make. I notice also that losses due to embezzlement by employees are now to be allowable deductions. I shall want to know in committee whether it should not be made compulsory on employers to protect themselves against such losses by taking out fidelity bonds. If an employer were careless in the matter, I see no reason why responsibilities resulting from that carelessness should be placed on the general community. </para>

          <para>I notice that an allowance is also to be made for the exemption of subscriptions to associations. To some extent that is the position now, but I shall want to know in committee what were the associations to which contributions have been allowable deductions and what are the associations proposed to be included ; also whether contributions to political campaign funds are to be included. If they are to be included, I shall have somer thing to say about it, because the party we represent is unable to obtain those large contributions to political funds which the Government and its supporters are so easily able to get. Concerning the deduction to be allowed for the housekeeper of a taxpayer who is a widower, if the housekeeper is solely maintained by the taxpayer and is attending to his dependent children, I should like some further information. I can visualize the case of people whom I know where the* daughter of a taxpayer, who is a widower, is keeping his house and looking .after him and his affairs generally, and where there are no other children. I shall want to know later whether that exemption should not be extended to meet such a case. </para>
          <para>On the question of the equalization of payments to life assurance societies and superannuation funds, the Government has arrived at a compromise. The amount now allowable as a deduction in respect of contributions to life assurance societies is &#163;50, and that for superannuation fund contributions is &#163;100. It is now proposed, under the compromise, to- make a joint allowable deduction of &#163;100. In his speech last night the Minister quoted the report of a British commission issued in 1920. I am not quite sure that I have the hang of the position correctly, but it did not seem to me that that report had any bearing on the question at issue. It seemed to me that it related to family allowances and not to contributions to life assurance societies. I expect the Minister will elucidate that point in committee. The reduction from &#163;150 to &#163;100 in this connexion may conceivably cause undue distinction between different classes of contributors, those who are to receive more and those who are to receive less. </para>
          <para>I agree entirely with the necessity for the registration of taxation agents, but it is a pity that unity has not been accomplished on this point. I do not think that we should have the States registering taxation agents with the Commonwealth doing the same thing. The Commonwealth should be the one authority for the registration of these agents. I agree also with the provision that no retrospective amendments shall be allowed in assessments beyond a period of three years. That applies whether the assessment amendment would be for or against the interests of the taxpayer. Some alterations have been made in respect to the time for lodging of appeals, and I am of the  opinion  that a still further widening of the provision is probably necessary. </para>
          <para>An anomaly which has always existed in the Australian taxation laws and which this bill does not propose to alter, arises from the exemption of income from Commonwealth bonds under assess ments of income tax for State purposes. This phase of the position is open to considerable argument, but I wish to show briefly how unfairly it works, apart altogether from the fact that it seems to be dangerous at a time when the demands of the people on the taxing authorities are becoming increasingly greater and when the tendency of the times is towards the State itself providing more and more of the .amenities of life and rendering more and more social services to the community. One cannot do these things without increasing taxation. It seems wrong that when we are facing the need for increased taxation to meet the ever increasing demands on the Treasury, we should be decreasing the taxable area. Moreover, the system operates inequitably between certain forms of income, because the man who invests his capital reserves in Commonwealth bonds escapes taxation to the extent of his investments, while the man who invests capital in industry, thus helping to promote the prosperity of the community, is penalized. I propose to show, by quoting two parallel examples, how unfairly the present system operates. The non-exempt taxpayer, whom I shall call &#34; A &#34;, with an income of, say, &#163;2,000 from rent and &#163;500 from, a business, would pay federal tax on the whole &#163;2,500, at the higher rate which applies to incomes of &#163;2y500. On the &#163;2,000 he would pay &#163;279 3s. 4d., in addition to &#163;87 10s. special property tax. This amounts to over &#163;366, which his neighbour, whom I shall call &#34; B &#34;, would escape altogether, because his &#163;2,000 is exempt from State taxation, being derived from interest on tax-free bonds. </para>
          <para>There remains the &#163;500 of non-exempt income which each of them derived from a business. &#34; A &#34; would pay tax on this in full, for his income would be too large to entitle him to any statutory exemption. &#34; B &#34;, however, would get a statutory exemption of &#163;125, which would reduce his taxable income to &#163;375. Then &#34; A. &#34; would pay at the rate of between 15d. and 16d. in the &#163;1, while &#34;B &#34; would pay at the rate of a little over  4&#189;d.  in the &#163;1. So that, in respect of the same income of &#163;500 from business, &#34;A&#34; would pav &#163;32 18s. 7d., and &#34; B &#34; only &#163;7 ls. lid. Income from approximately &#163;650,000,000 of capital, earning in Australia about &#163;23,700,000, is not available to the States for taxation. That is a vast annual income not included in the full incidence of Australian direct taxation. Inequalities of this kind exist because we have too many tax-levying authorities. That brings us back to the platform of the Australian Labour party, which includes unification, and the abolition of six out of the seven taxing authorities. </para>

            <para>.- &#39;This bill is the result of agitation in Australia for many years past for simpler and more uniform taxation methods, which can be easily understood by those who have to pay taxes.

              <para>- It is unjust, at any rate, and, as far as Western Australia is concerned, it is also visionary, because the people of that State, by a two to one majority have expressed their opposition to it, and their preference for complete self-government. If I thought that this bill represented a step in the direction of unification, I should oppose it at every point. But, of course, it really has nothing whatever to do with unification, which is opposed throughout the Commonwealth by at least two of the great political parties, and in Western Australia is opposed by every section of political thought. I refer the Leader of the Opposition to the opinions expressed some time ago by the Labour Premier of Western Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collier,</inline> in an interview published in the press. In the course of that interview he opposed unification, and went so far as to say that unification would mean ruin to the people of Western Australia. </para>

          <para>To the extent that this measure simplifies and renders uniform our taxation laws, it will be regarded as a valuable and acceptable addition to Commonwealth legislation, particularly when the States observe their obligation to pass complementary legislation, based on this measure and on the recommendations of the royal commission on taxation. Uniformity is very desirable as long as the basis of taxation is just. There is a feeling, however, that the tax gatherers are taking advantage of this opportunity to tighten up the law, and to increase the burdens of taxation borne by primary producers. I admit, that relief has been given in some directions, but the cumulative effect of the provisions of the bill operates against the primary producers, and will increase the total burden of the federal taxpayer. </para>
          <para>This legislation is very complicated, and requires detailed examination in committee. It is really a matter for accountants and experts. If, however, the States bring their income-tax legislation into line with this federal measure, other than in respect of the amount at which taxation of income commences, p heavy increase of State taxation must follow. Speaking generally, State taxation has been more reasonable, and the exemptions under it are more generous, than under federal law. Uniformity of taxation legislation is desirable, but I hope that the federal taxpayer and the State taxpayer, the same individual, will not be asked to shoulder too great an increase of the general taxation burden for the sake of uniformity. If the States&#39; bring their legislation into line with this bill there must be a withdrawal of many of the concessions which the States are at present granting. Thus, uniformity, if attained, will lead to a considerable increase of the amount of taxation collected through Federal and State sources combined. It seems to me that the increases are particularly directed against graziers, farmers, and pastoralists. I wonder, also, whether uniformity is to extend, not only to income-tax legislation, but also to the whole range of taxation covered by the royal commission&#39;s report. As indicating the differences which exist in the taxation systems of various States, it is interesting to recall that New South Wales, alone of all the States, imposes no State land tax. All the other States, smaller in population and poorer in resources and taxable capacity than New South Wales, have State land taxes of varying, but generally, heavy incidence. New South Wales, which has more than one-third of the population of Australia, and considerably more than one-third of its wealth, particularly in the form of land value, is very fortunate in having no direct State land tax upon those enormous land values. The bringing of State income tax into line with the federal measure will, therefore, impose a heavier burden on the residents of the land-taxing States such as Western Australia, than on the residents of New South Wales, who have so far escaped the heavy direct taxation on land which is a feature of the budgets of all the other States, and of the Commonwealth. </para>
          <para>Of course, when the Constitution was framed, it was never anticipated or intended that the Federal Government would enter the field of direct taxation of income. The power to tax income was included only in the closing stages of the Federal Convention, and it was then regarded as an emergency power which, it was said, would be used only in times of national emergency such as war. However, with the growth of the federal octopus we find that the Federal Government has duplicated almost every avenue of taxation which the fathers of federation intended should be reserved to the States, and there seems to be little hope that it will retire from any field of taxation which it has once invaded. Thus, we have duplicated State and Federal income taxes, State and Federal land tax, and State and Federal probate duty. In every case the State and Federal governments each insist upon bleeding the unfortunate taxpayer alike in life and in death. A few years ago, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. S.</inline> M. Bruce, when he was Prime Minister, in a notable speech delivered at Perth, stressed the need for encouraging enterprise and employment in Australia, and, in order to do this, he said that it was necessary for the Federal Government to withdraw from the field of income taxation, leaving it entirely to the States. He stressed the undesirability of one government collecting revenue for another government to spend. To-day there seems little prospect of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce&#39;s</inline> desire being carried into effect. The Commonwealth Government has not yet been able to abolish even the super tax on certain incomes imposed by the Scullin Government during the darkest days of the depression. It is well to remember that any increase of the weight of taxation under this measure may apply not only to ordinary federal income tax, but also to the super taxes on property incomes for the retention of which provision is made in this measure. I trust that that provision does not mean that the super tax on property incomes is to be extended beyond the end of this financial year. In view of the fact that the Government anticipates having a surplus of over &#163;4,000,000 at the end of &#39;this financial year it should dispense with the provision for continuing this super tax on income from property. However, many of the main recommendations of the Royal -Commission on Taxation have been put into effect, and some provisions of the bill which are of advantage to the taxpayer may be summarized as follows: - </para>

I emphatically protest against the announcement made by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> in the House of Representatives, that the Government proposes to abolish the Board of </para>
          <para class="block">Review and replace it by a single judge. This is a retrograde step; and one which has caused indignation and alarm amongst the general body of Australian taxpayers. It is the most stupid taxation proposal made by the Government, and is one which, I hope, will not be agreed to by the Senate. It is a proposal that strikes a blow at rights which the taxpayers have enjoyed for the last fourteen years. The Taxpayers&#39; Association, and many other leading organizations, representing the majority of taxpayers, are vigorously opposed to it. The Board of Review was established in 1922 for the express purpose of enabling taxpayers to appeal from any decision of -the Commissioner with a minimum of expense and delay. That purpose has been adequately fulfilled, and, from its non-judicial character, it has proved to be the most satisfactory tribunal to which small taxpayers in particular can appeal. With its trained personnel it is generally regarded as being vastly superior to an ordinary court for the determination of cases depending on an interpretation of business facts. </para>
          <para>The proposals of the Ministry in this regard have evidently been based upon the recommendation of the recent Royal Commission on Taxation. This matter was dealt with in the .commission&#39;s third report at pages 154 to 157, but it is submitted by the Taxpayers&#39; Associations of Australia that the final recommendation was made without a true grasp of the actual facts. Certain inaccuracies as to the number of appeals, &#38;c, were apparent in the report, and these were corrected some months later in a subsequent report. Little, if any, evidence was submitted to the commission in regard to the Board of Review, for the reason that it was presumed that the board, which had given such general satisfaction for a number of years, would naturally be retained. That the board is welcomed by taxpayers is indicated by the fact that the number of appeals to it is five times as great as the number of federal appeals taken to the Supreme Court and to the High Court. </para>
          <para>The Board of Review was established under the federal act of 1922, for the express purpose of providing taxpayers with the means of having any decision of the Commissioner of Taxation reviewed by an expert tribunal with the minimum of expense and delay, and without the necessity for embarking upon costly legal proceedings. This procedure was recommended by the first Royal Commission on Taxation, and was based on the English system, where taxpayers appeal first to a board of special commissioners. Under the English system the right of appeal from decisions of the special commissioners to a higher court is limited to questions of law only. In dealing with the question of appeals, the first royal  commission  said: - </para>

            <para>There was perhaps no single subject upon which such unanimity of opinion was manifested by witnesses as upon the necessity for the appointment of a tribunal other than n court to deal with the numerous cases under the income tax act in which taxpayers dissent from the decisions of the Commissioner, but for various reasons, are unable or unwilling to assert what they believe to be their rights, in a superior court. </para>
            <para>The expense, delay, and risk of proceedings in the superior courts arc said to deter taxpayers particularly where the amount  involved is not large, from seeking a judicial determination of points at issue between themselves and the Taxation Department, and some witnesses considered that there were occasions on which departmental officers had taken advantage of this reluctance. </para>
            <para>It is contended also that in many cases, no point nf law arises, but the issue is one depending upon differing views as to facts. All witnesses were agreed that, where a question of law is involved, an appeal should lie from the suggested board of appeal to the High Court or a Supreme Court. </para>

          <para>As the outcome of the commission&#39;s recommendation the present board was constituted in 1922, .and has functioned successfully and with general satisfaction since that date. </para>
          <para>I wish to refer to some of the advantages of the board. </para>
          <para>Disputes between taxpayers and the Commissioner of Taxation are inevitable under any form of taxation, and particularly under such a necessarily complex measure as an income assessment tax act. What income is assessable? What deductions should be allowed? These are questions upon which genuine differences of opinion will inevitably rise. The taxpayer is, however, more than frequently in no position to incur the prospect of heavy legal expenses in having his point of view contested. The Board of Review, however,  provides  a simple, cheap and efficient remedy. The board deals expeditiously with appeals in a  businessslike  and practical manner. Its simple procedure offers an attractive contrast to the formalities of a court of law. Taxpayers appear before the board in person, or may be represented by agents or accountants. In important cases they are frequently represented by leading counsel. The board&#39;s proceedings are usually conducted in camera, so that publicity may be avoided. Any taxpayer may, however, have a public hearing, if he so desires. </para>
          <para>The board is a highly competent tribunal. The present personnel comprises a taxation expert, a leading accountant, and a barrister and solicitor. It is claimed that an experienced board of this nature is preferable to a conventional court for the determination of the majority of taxation appeals that arise. The members of the board have a wide knowledge of business matters, and are possessed of an all-round commercial experience. The value of the board is more obvious when it is realized that the great bulk of taxation appeals relate to disputed matters of fact,&#39; and not of law. Experience has shown that a tribunal of this nature is more suitable for the majority of such appeals than is a. single judge. Probably there could not be a better summary of the value of the Board of Review than the words of the Privy Council : - </para>

          <para>This statement appeared in a Privy Council judgment, delivered in 1930, in which it was held that this Parliament had full power to establish the board as a non-judicial tribunal. Previously, when the same case was before the High Court, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Isaacs said that the Board of Review afforded : - </para>

          </quote>
          <para>An outstanding advantage of the Board of Review is its influence in minimizing legal costs. The greatest advantage of the Board to the smaller taxpayer in particular lies in the fact that costs of contesting any decision of the Commissioner of Taxation are kept down to a minimum. Without the existence of the board, it  is obvious that many taxpayers would not contemplate an appeal from the dictum of the Commissioner. An unfortunate characteristic of any court of law is that high legal costs seem to be inevitable. Departmental officials -are prone to take advantage of this point, and to rely upon the taxpayers&#39; natural reluctance to invoke the tortuous and costly process of appealing to tile&#39; courts. For this reason the federal hoard has, perhaps, proved to bc of considerable embarrassment to taxation officials. But this fact demonstrates the main virtue of the board in the eyes of the taxpayer - he has, in all cases, the right of appealing to the board for redress. He can, if he so desires, appear in person, and incur no expense whatever. This fact, alone, ensures that (.-very objection lodged by a taxpayer receives the consideration it deserves at the hands of the department. Our experience in taxation matters in Australia during the last fourteen years has shown that the board is preferred to the tribunal proposed by the Government. </para>
          <para>The second royal commission has recommended that the judge of the proposed new taxation court should finally decide all matters of fact, and all matters of discretion. These powers are too wide to be exercised by any one man. Taxation appeals are mostly concerned with disputes as to facts, and the application of the act to them. A perusal of any volume of taxation decisions will confirm this statement, and will show that in many instances an examination of more or less complicated accounts is required. Consequently the deciding authority should possess a sound knowledge of business methods and principles. That is why it is essential to preserve the choice so admirably summarized by <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> Privy Council : &#34; If you want to have the assessment reviewed judicially, go to the court; if you want to have it reviewed by business men, go to the board.&#34; </para>
          <para>The great majority of taxpayers will not take their grievances to a court. They will not face &#34; the intricacies, delay, and expense of legal proceedings.&#34; This has been proved up to the hilt, and is the main objection to depriving the public of their present right to determine whether they will appeal to a court, or to an expert and businesslike tribunal&#39;. </para>
          <para class="block">In 1925 the original Board of Appeal was re-constituted in its present form as a Board of Review. A suggestion that a judicial body might be preferable was strongly opposed by the then Federal Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> and by the then Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> and Parliament, for the second time, emphatically decided that a tribunal of taxation and business experts was much to be preferred to anything in the nature of a court. I refer honorable senators to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of the 18th September, 1925, at page 252S. It is extraordinary that the Minister in charge of the bill should suggest abolishing the board at the very time when some of the States are actually adopting the federal principle of a Board of Review. </para>
          <para>The Income Tax Assessment Bill introduced in New South Wales provides for the establishment of a tribunal similar to the present federal board. The Governments of Victoria and South Australia are also reported to be considering the appointment of similar &#34; nonjudicial5&#39; tribunals. Surely the adoption by the States of this principle gives added weight to the necessity for the retention of the federal board. </para>
          <para>The principle of having one court of final appeal for purposes of both Federal and State cases has considerable merit, and is welcomed by the taxpayers and the taxpayers&#39; associations throughout, the Commonwealth. &#39; But why the establishment of this court should necessitate the scrapping of the Board of Review cannot be seen. The removal of the board would strike a severe blow at the rights of taxpayers, and would lead to a reversion to the state of affairs which obtained in the federal sphere prior to 1922, and aroused the greatest dissatisfaction amongst taxpayers generally. If the Commonwealth Government and the governments of several of the States favour the idea of a special court, then let there be such a tribunal to hear appeals from the Board of Review. This would bring the present system into line with the English practice, and would certainly be more acceptable to taxpayers. </para>

            <para>. -  Under this measure, itis proposed to take a step in the right direction, even if it is only a small step. Thousands of persons in the community pay very little income tax, and thousands of the supporters of the Labour party have no taxable income, yet the Opposition appreciates any action taken to simplify our taxation laws, and to eliminate the irritating features of the act which the taxation authorities are called upon to administer. Although we constitute the Opposition, we realize that on occasions the Government can take a step in the right direction. When they come to deal with their income tax returns, many of my friends get into a Serbonian bog. With the Minister, I hope that the day will come when we shall have a uniform income tax return for both Federal and State authorites. Why should it not be possible to arrange for one collection and then divide the total amount collected between the Federal and State governments according to their needs? Some States, of course, might want more than others. There seem to be conflicting interests at work. Some States cannot come into line with the Federal Government, and sometimes the Federal authorities cannot accept the States&#39; ideas. These difficulties, however, are not insuperable, but they emphasize what my leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings,</inline> has claimed - the need for unity which will ultimately lead to unification. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> described this ideal as the dream of visionaries, whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Arkins</inline> referred to it unfavorably in many ways, but I believe that eventually uniformity will be achieved in income tax matters. It will certainly be welcomed by the Labour movement. It may take many years to accomplish, but we are now steadily moving in that direction. Every one directly interested in legislation realizes that this need is paramount. </para>

          <para>Unfortunately, many people who support the Labour party have no income on which taxes can be levied. If a government believes in taxation as a means of obtaining revenue, I should imagine that one of its first aims would be to see that the people as a whole have something to tax, but to-day thousands of our fellow citizens are, so to speak, left on the shelf financially, being dependent solely on wages for relief work, which are not taxed. </para>
          <para>Since 1930-31, State income taxation has increased by &#163;600,000. In the same period, Commonwealth income taxation has increased to &#163;8,300,000, the detailed figures in respect of the latter collections being as follows :  - </para>

          <para class="block">These figures are particularly interesting to members of this Opposition, because we feel that, in the remission of taxation by this Government, the richer people have been more than favorably treated. This conclusion must be drawn from these figures, because, whilst they show a diminution in income tax collections, they reveal an increase of collections from indirect taxation, which is generally paid by the workers. Some peoplecontend that it is the rich people who pay the bulk of the taxes. Dealing with this matter, the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Sun,</inline> under date the 18th May, 1936, says in a leading article, in which it attacked the leader of the Labour party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> - </para>

              <para>- No ; I mean all those who contribute useful service which enables the community to carry on. From that point of view, the workers pay taxa tion. There can be no doubt about that, because if we are compelled to have a number of non-productive workers, these naturally have to be fed, clothed and housed, and they are fed, clothed and housed by the people engaged in producing food, clothing or housing. I admit that, by a process of juggling with methods of taxation, it is possible temporarily to inflict a financial injury on the workers, because for a time the workers as a whole must bear the burden of any additional taxation However, I admit also that eventually through our arbitration system, under which our industrial courts base their judgments on the cost of living, this burden may be lightened. Such statements as that which I quoted from the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> seem to me to be absurd. This paper estimated the public wages fund at &#163;450,000,000 per annum. Actually it represents the total income of the community, so that in that respect it has made a mistake. Its claim that if taxation were reduced to the extent of &#163;50,000,000 per annum the community would be enabled to employ every ablebodied man is absurd ; because under the present economic system it is impossible for private enterprise to find work for all our people, and it has become necessary for governments to impose taxes for the purpose of undertaking public works with the idea of providing work for the unemployed, whilst at the same time, developing the country. Whether the revenue of the Government is derived through income tax or any other form of tax, if it is used in such a way as to add to the productive capacity of the country it not only enables employment to be increased, but also makes possible an improvement of the standard of living in the community. The idea propounded by the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> that under the present economic system a diminution of taxation by &#163;50,000,000 per annum would automatically increase employment is an obsession which cannot be supported by reasonable argument. It does not follow that the people relieved of the payment of taxes will use the money remitted in providing employment. If, for instance, the taxation of the Commonwealth were reduced by &#163;50,000,000 per annum - and I suggest that the bulk of the remission would benefit the rich - and the people so relieved used this extra money in travelling abroad, a reduction of taxation would not automatically mean an increase of employment here. </para>

          <para>I am not suggesting that the Labour party stands for taxation merely as taxation or that it .suggests that increased taxation will solve our economic problems, l t says nothing of the kind. It takes cognizance of all the economic relationships in modern society and says emphatically that a wise government can use its revenue from taxation for the purpose of improving the general economic position of the country by providing work and wages for all of its people. Supporters of the Douglas Social Credit System contend that taxation can be done away with altogether. They argue that all the finance necessary for the continuation of the necessary functions of the State can be  produced  under a uniform financial system of social credit. By that means they claim that the taxation of both rich and poor can be eliminated. The Single Tax League believes in a uniform tax, namely, a tax on the unimproved value of land. The  single-taxers  have been promulgating their ideas for many decades, but do not seem to have made any headway. Recently in the Sydney Domain, I heard one of their spokesmen, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Huie,</inline> still preaching the same old story which T heard him preach in the same spot 20 years ago. I understand that adherents of this school of thought are subsidized from a fund bequeathed for the purpose of advocating this particular idea. </para>

              <para>- There is something in the honorable senator&#39;s suggestion, but the present Government would describe it as visionary. Once a government lays its hands on any form of taxation it is unwilling to loosen its hold. A tax may be imposed in special circumstances such as those which existed when the sales tax legislation was enacted, but as the years pass various excuses are offered for its continuance. Some day, however, when the Labour party is in power it will no longer be imposed. </para>

              <para>- Yes, in a time of financial crisis. Even <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. S.</inline> M. Bruce said that in the circumstances no other action was possible. Only recently the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> said that if something were not done <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> correct Australia&#39;s adverse trade balance, similar steps to those taken by the Scullin Government might have to be taken The introduction of a measure of this kind reveals the way in which various interests seek to transfer the burden of taxation from themselves to other sections of the community. The primary producer complains that he is unfairly taxed; the brewer says that his product is overtaxed, traders complain of heavy restrictions on their trading activities; landlords complain of the heavy taxes on property. Representatives of the various interests bring pressure to bear, in an endeavour to unload their burden and place it on others. The Labour party recognizes the need for lightening the burden of taxation oh the poorest sections of the community. It is not so greatly concerned with those who can afford to paytaxes. I believe that there will come a time when taxation, as we know it, will no longer be imposed, and that some other means of obtaining revenue to meet governmental expenses will be found. But whilst- taxation in its present form remains, the Labour party stands for making its incidence such that the burden will fall most lightly upon those least able to bear it and most heavily upon those with large incomes. </para>

              <para>- Those persons in the community who are not producers, and are not helping to develop the country, should bear the greatest part of the burden of taxation. That is not so today. The Leader of the Senate has told us that, to a great extent, Government bonds are free of income tax. Governments must have money, and, accordingly, they have encouraged investors to lend it to them by making the conditions as attractive as possible. Theoretically, a man who exercises initiative, either in primary or secondary production, and uses his money for the betterment of the community, should have greater consideration than a man who does nothing for the community, but merely lives on the interest derived from his investments. </para>

              <para>- I congratulate the Treasurer and the departmental officials, as well as the members of the Royal Commission on Taxation, whose exhaustive report forms the nucleus of this bill. I also include in my congratulations those private individuals whose special knowledge of taxation was made available to those engaged in the preparation of this measure. In the nature of things, the extremely intricate and detailed work which they performed, they cannot expect, and will never receive, special thanks or recognition. The work has been completed with extraordinary rapidity, having regard to the long period occupied by an English commission on a similar undertaking. That body has been sitting for nine years, and has not yet completed its labours. I do not suppose that I arn regarded as one given to  offering compliments too freely, but I think that all those who contributed to the consummation of the desires of so many taxpayers, are alike to be congratulated. </para>

              <para>- The first point I want to emphasize is that the bill represents in fact a consolidation, and although it contains a certain number of variations, it does not open up anew every section of our income taxation. The bill, in the main, follows the lines of previous acts. I think that the subdivision of the bill into many more clauses than were contained in earlier bills of this sort is an improvement, and reference is thereby made much easier. On this point I made an interjection yesterday regarding the memorandum which was prepared for the guidance of honorable senators, showing opposite the various clauses in this bill the relevant sections of the existing act. I can appreciate the difficulty of having this explanatory memorandum reprinted following the passage of the bill through the House of Representatives, where certain amendments were made; but I suggest to the Government that it might be worth while to reprint it with all the amendments as finally passed by the Parliament. If this be done it will be of great assistance, not only to taxation experts, but also to the ordinary man in the street. Legal practitioners and taxation experts generally are familiar with the sections of the present act, and if my suggestion were given effect to, they would he able to pee at, a glance which are the corresponding provisions of the new measure. Uniformity of principle has been achieved in the taxation measures to be passed by the various States, though, of course, not in respect of details which depend to some extent on the financial needs of present and future State Governments. I do not want to raise bogeys, but there is a doubt in my mind as to how far it will be possible to get the various governments, Commonwealth and State, to stand by the uniformity which at last has been achieved. I think it will be rather deplorable if, a few years hence, every government in Australia passes amendments altering principles in their legislation; that will mean that we shall again have something like seven different acts in force instead of, substantially, one. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>The bill as it stands is more explicit and simpler than the existing law. We, who have so often asked for all the simplicity possible .in taxation measures, welcome its introduction. Indeed, I would go even further and say that the bill achieves an objective which might with advantage be extended to other forms of legislation, such as, for instance, the tariff. During the discussion of the tariff schedule last night, I had occasion to point out that certain provisions were more complicated and difficult for the man in the street to understand than are those contained in the schedule which preceded it. It seems to me unfortunate and not altogether logical that at a time when we are doing our best to simplify taxation measures, the tariff schedule is moving in the opposite direction of obscurity and difficulty of comprehension. A great deal of the tariff is almost unintelligible to the men most concerned with it, and it is with them we are most concerned, as we are concerned in this bill with those who pay income tax. This bill was considerably improved in detail during its passage through the House of Representatives, though I would not suggest that there is no room for further amendment of it. Indeed, I have several amendments which I propose to move in committee. At this stage I shall mention only one, which relates to the rather vexed matter of appeal by the taxpayer against assessments. As the bill now stands the taxpayer is required in the first instance to lodge notice of objection to the assessment. I do not altogether agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> that this bill represents a tightening up of the provisions against the taxpayer; I do not think that is a fair statement to make when it is considered that this bill has been before a great number of experts, not only governmental, but also private practitioners who have looked at it from the taxpayer&#39;s point of view. I do not wish to impute that the Government is trying to tighten up this bill unduly and take advantage of the opportunity to slip in clauses which might be detrimental to the taxpayers. As a distinguished friend of mine, who certainly had a knowledge of taxation matters from both sides, used to say, &#34; In matters of taxation the Commissioner and the taxpayer are at arm&#39;s length.&#34; </para>

            <para>- HUGHES. - Occasionally that is so. There is naturally a tendency, which has been noticeable and has been illustrated by certain <inline font-style="italic">obiter dicta</inline> from the High Court Bench, for the Commissioner to demand, at any rate, his pound of flesh. On the other hand, on the part of many taxpayers there has no doubt been a desire to pay nothing at all. It is for us to see that the scales of justice are balanced evenly between the two. In doing so I think it is right that Ave should remember that the Commissioner &#39;and his staff are in the first place highly expert men who have devoted their lives to their occupation, and that they have the assistance of expert legal officers to whom they can refer at any moment. The ordinary taxpayer, particularly the country tax: payer, is not in that happy position. The country taxpayer is often ignorant, as I am certain all honorable senators are aware, of even the rudiments of bookkeeping. In taxation matters he is placed, technically, in the position of defendant. Wo should see that he is given every reasonable opportunity to present his case in the very best light. I feel that the provisions relating to notice of objection have in this respect at any rate, tended to tighten up the law against the taxpayers. I propose to move, at a later stage, an amendment designed to ensure that to some extent the provisions of the law shall be extended so that when a breach of the law comes up for adjudication the taxpayer&#39;s case shall be the best which he can put forward - not perhaps the case which he made out when he was unaware that he had some alternative or additional ground to plead that was not set out in the -first instance. </para>

          <para>I do not agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> that it i3 necessary that at the present time we should discuss the respective merits of a single appellate tribunal for the Commonwealth and &#34;States, and a board of review. This is a matter of which  there is a great deal to be said on both sides. The Treasurer stated that if it is possible to arrive at a joint agreement on this matter with the -various State governments, the suggestion will then be laid before Parliament in the form of a complementary bill. A discussion of the respective merits of these two tribunals appears to me to be outside the ambit of the bill now under consideration. I shall hold my hand on this general question. Just as there is a great deal to be said for uniformity of taxation measures, so also there is a great deal to be said for uniformity of judicial rulings, instead of a continuation of the conflicting rulings which may at present be made by different boards in different States at different times. I am certainly prepared to consider the desirability of a single tribunal if eventually some arrangement is arrived at between the Commonwealth and the States, and the Government brings in a bill to give effect to it. I do not propose to delay the second reading of this .bill, which is essentially one for consideration in committee, but there are two or three points of a general nature which arose from the discussion this morning to which I should like to address myself before I sit down. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline>remarked that taxation should be placed upon the shoulders of those best able to bear it. I think that that is already done in Australia. I do not know what the exact percentage is at the present time, but some years ago I remember I was astonished to find that a relatively small percentage of the people in Australia paid direct federal taxation. </para>

              <para>- I thought the case was even stronger than that; certainly with an exemption of &#163;250 no one can suggest that the taxation is being forced on to the shoulders of those who are unable to sustain it. A number of further concessions which have been made in recent years in connexion with our income tax legislation have been wholly to the advantage of the smaller man. It cannot be fairly claimed that under the present Australian system of levying taxes heavy burdens are imposed upon those not in a position to pay. But apart from the direct taxation, there is also indirect, taxation.&#39; I direct the- attention of the Leader of the Opposition to the fact that indirect taxation, although it may come back eventually to one or two special sections of the community, is distributed over everybody. Every person pays it. The Labour party, more than any other party, except perhaps that led by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie,</inline> advocates the continuation of very high tariffs, the indirect taxation of which affect everybody. The low-tariffists  are not responsible for the volume of indirect taxation. I do not believe in high tariffs, although I am fully aware that, if I were to adopt the attitude which some members of the Labour party would accuse me of adopting, I should seize on high tariffs for the purpose of taking away from the taxpayer a large amount of his burden, and spreading it generally over the whole of the community. I do not believe that that is sound&#39; finance, and for that reason I am opposed to it. The Leader of the Opposition has stated that surpluses are wrong in principle; but all Treasurers in good years are liable to have surpluses if they have budgeted prudently. Does the honorable senator suggest that any surplus which may happen to fall to a Treasurer at the end of a year is to be distributed regardless of the dictates of economy or anything else; that it should be regarded as a gift of the gods, and expended? Is it not the duty of the Government to act like any prudent man who, finding that he had obtained an unexpected windfall, employs it for the purpose of reducing his expenditure in the following year? </para>

            <para>.- The object of this bill, which is long overdue, is to consolidate and simplify the taxation acts; consequently, to every business man it will be very welcome. Some of the clauses are not exactly consolidating in purpose, because they embody some alterations which will require more investigation and explanation during the committee stage than has yet been given. &#34;While this bill will be of great advantage to the Australian taxpayers by simplifying the various acts, it seems to perpetuate the present unfair distribution of the taxation areas between the Commonwealth and the States. Australia has drifted into a most peculiar state of affairs; the Commonwealth has almost the whole area of taxation, and the States have to take the leavings. Only this week honorable senators have been treated to the spectacle of the Treasurers of the several States meeting in Canberra to beg for financial assistance from the Commonwealth. That occurs repeatedly, and  the  Commonwealth is obliged to pay grants to them in order to enable them to carry on their essential services. I do not know what would have befallen some of the States if the Commonwealth had not granted nearly &#163;2,000,000 to South Australia, rendered substantial assistance to Tasmania, Western Australia and Queensland, and even distributed various sums to Victoria and New South Wales. My object in speaking in this strain is to urge the Government to devise at once some method for putting on a permanent and sound basis, the financial relationships of the Commonwealth and the States. At the present time they arc most unsatisfactory to all parties concerned. I do not blame the States for directing attention to the big surplus of &#163;4,000,000 which the Commonwealth expects this year, while declining to yield any of its avenues of taxation. Their area of taxation is so curtailed that they cannot carry on without large grants from the federal exchequer. This bill seems to me to perpetuate that disability. In reply the federal authorities say in effect : &#34; We are in the income tax field for good, and we shall not get out of it.&#34; In the first place, income tax was introduced as a war measure, and for no other reason. The Commonwealth should be in a position to relinquish a certain field of taxation to the States.&#39; </para>

              <para>- Income tax seems to be one of the things that the Commonwealth should not touch, if it can recoup itself in some other direction for the loss of revenue. It should be prepared to say to the States: &#34;The Commonwealth is voluntarily relinquishing the income tax to you ; but do not ask for further assistance.&#34; I offer this suggestion, because I consider that within the next few years some effort will have to be made by the Commonwealth Government to simplify the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States. </para>

              <para>- We are &#39; drifting along in the same old way year after year. The States are increasing their taxation, but they are getting poorer, and are depending more and more upon subsidies granted to them by the Commonwealth. This year the federal surplus will approach &#163;4,000,000, which is equivalent to nearly half of the collections of federal income tax. The administration should be working towards the goal of relinquishing income tax or some other field of revenue to the States. In suggesting the income tax I am not dogmatic; I do not lay it down as my final opinion. </para>

          <para>I commend the Government and those responsible for the consolidation and simplification of the law, but I also remind the Government that this is not the final stage. Before long it will have to grasp firmly the nettle of the financial relations of Commonwealth and States. The sooner it works along these lines, the sooner will the States be made happy. and the Commonwealth removed from that unenviable position of having almost to offer bribes or sops to obtain their goodwill and ease the relations between the several governments. I do not desire to dwell on this point; but for many years it has seemed to me that the Government which will tackle this problem firmly and quickly will be deserving of the gratitude of the whole of the community. In this regard the Federal and State taxpayers are exactly the same set of persons. The reference sometimes to the great burden imposed upon the State taxpayers by federal taxation is absurd. Federal and State taxpayers are the same people. No State can start along a path of improvement unless it knows that its financial position is secure, and that there are certain fields in which it can exercise its powers of taxation, untrammelled by the Commonwealth. Therefore, I hope that the Government will at an early date undertake the reform I have suggested. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>Honorable senators will appreciate that, at present, there is a variety of concessional deductions under the Commonwealth and State acts. An attempt has been made to bring these into harmony, and in this connexion the Commonwealth&#39;s contribution has been to concede a deduction of&#163;50 to a married man in respect of his wife, or, wherethe taxpayer is a widower, in respect of a female relative having the care of children under sixteen years of age, provided that the wife or relative is a resident and is wholly maintained by the taxpayer. This concession, it is estimated, will cost the Commonwealth from &#163;300,000 to &#163;350,000 in revenue the next financial year, but it was regarded as a proper deduction to be made in the interests of the married section of the community, as well as in the interests of uniformity. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I am familiar with a deduction of that nature, but it may be that it appears in the Queensland law. I should like the Minister to indicate in his reply whether it is new in Commonwealth law. </para>
          <para>Without doubt, a greater degree of uniformity is highly desirable, not only in our income tax legislation, but also in the laws relating to other subjects dealt with by our so-called federation. Numerous newtaxes have been introduced in recent years, and taxpayers are to-day faced with many involved considerations when they set out to prepare their returns. It should be possible to make provision on one large return for all the information a taxpayer is under obligation to supply. As this bill makes a useful contribution towards the achievement of uniformity, I shall support it. </para>
          <para>Generally speaking, I am opposed to the taxation policy of this Government, for it bears with undue severity on the working classes. The Labour party believes in direct taxation. The ideal canon of taxation is that taxes shall fall most heavily upon the shoulders of those best able to bear it. That consideration should be borne closely in mind in the organization of our national finances. It seems to me, however, that the working people of Australia have not had a fair deal from this Government. Sales tax, for example, imposes severe hardship on the people on the lowest rung of the social ladder, whose capacity to pay is very limited. The general policy of this Government undoubtedly favours the richer classes of the people to the detriment of the workers and the producers. </para>

          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Commission on Taxation, which conducted its investigations a few years ago. It is not always that a government finds itself in a position to introduce legislation to give effect to the findings of royal commissions, which makes it all the more pleasing that in this particular case that happy result has been achieved. It may, in the circumstances, be justly claimed that, not only the appointment of but also the expense incurred by, the Royal Commission on Taxation has been justified. Of late years royal commissions have been 3et up with more or less monotonous frequency. They may be likened to a sink down which the public funds have been poured with remarkable liberality, while the unfortunate taxpayers have stood by in bewilderment. Happily, however, the Royal Commission on Taxation has amply justified itself. </para>
          <para>A good deal has been said by the honorable senators of the Labour party regarding the distribution of taxation over the community. I have obtained some illuminating figures on this aspect of the subject which show quite clearly that income tax at least has been imposed in accordance with the general principle that taxes should fall most heavily on the shoulders of those who are best able to pay. In 1934-35 a total of 149,366 taxpayers with taxable incomes up to &#163;200 paid &#163;197,414 in taxes, or about &#163;1 7s. a -head. It cannot be said that that is an unbearable impost. A total of 46,987 taxpayers with taxable incomes ranging from. &#163;201 to &#163;500 paid &#163;374,427 in taxes, or 5.9 per cent, of the total income tax collected; 22,769 taxpayers with taxable incomes from &#163;501 to &#163;1,000 paid &#163;656,925 in taxes, or 10.4 per cent, of the total amount collected ; and 13,245 taxpayers with taxable incomes exceeding &#163;1,000 paid &#163;3,079,697 in taxes, or 48.8 per cent, of the total amount collected. Those figures do not include company taxation. It will be seen from what I have said that the taxation of this country is distributed equitably over the whole community. We know, unfortunately, that the sales tax falls upon those in menial circumstances as well as those in a more affluent position, but it should be remembered that many commodities in common use are exempt from sales tax. </para>
          <para class="block">I hope that the list of exempt goods will be enlarged during the next financial year. I have made these remarks principally because the honorable senators of the Labour party devoted most of the time they occupied to the pointing out of alleged taxation injustices to the workers. No doubt they realize that their speeches will read well in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and will &#34; go down &#34; with people who do not know the facts of the case, and who are likely to believe the frequently-made contention that this is &#34; a rich man&#39;s government &#34;. </para>
          <para>I shall support the bill because it implements, to a very large degree, the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Taxation. The measure has been well received by taxpayers generally, and the Government may be heartily congratulated upon having introduced it. </para>

I assure honorable senators again that no large fundamental principles of the existing law have been altered. The variations made have been inspired by a desire to achieve uniformity with the States. That remark has particular reference to certain observations of the Leader of the Opposition, and I implore him not to imagine that the Government has neglected to give full information to the members of both Houses of the Parliament respecting the nature of such variations. An explanatory memorandum  appropriate  to a measure of this size was prepared and made available to honorable senators and other interested parties on the 11th March last. It set out clearly the wording of the existing law, and, on the opposite page, the variations proposed in this bill. The memorandum was prepared by expert officers of the Taxation Department and other gentlemen whose services were made available for the purpose. I assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> that, after this bill has been passed by both Houses of the Parliament, a memorandum will be prepared and made available to the legal profession, taxation, experts and others who desire to make a comparison of the new law with the old. </para>

              <para>- Apparently the document was not forwarded to the honorable senator. The Leader of the Opposition also referred to the issue of tax-free Commonwealth loans. That, I suggest, is not a matter with which, at the moment, we are concerned. It is one for decision by the Loan Council. If the Loan Council decides to issue loans free of taxation, the Commonwealth and State governments will have to bear their share of the blame or credit. I am, however, confident that if in its wisdom the Loan Council approves the flotation of loans free of income tax, it will be because of its belief that that system will not increase materially the cost of money required for industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> referred to the observations which I made regarding the Government&#39;s intentions concerning the Board of Review. Whatever may be done in that matter will not be affected by this bill. The provisions relating to the Board of Review have been retained, and will continue to operate, and Parliament will have an opportunity, if the States come into line, to consider legislation to substitute a single judge, or some other appellate tribunal, to take the place of the Board of Review. I knew that there is a considerable body of opinion that a single judge would not be able to deal with thu large number of appeals that would bc made. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> suggested that, through the various alterations of the law made in this measure, we may be levying further tribute on primary producers, and he referred to a number of items in respect of which this bill has taken from primary producers benefits which, hitherto, they have enjoyed. The provisions contained in the bill which benefit primary producers may be summarized thus : The rebate of tax allowed in respect of business income retained in the business is, in effect, limited to primary producers; special deductions are allowed to primary producers in respect of capital expenditure on wire and wire-netting, and in respect of the extermination of pests, and clearing; the averaging provisions are retained for this class of taxpayer; the carry forward of losses is primarily in force in  the interests of primary producers; concessions allowed to co-operative companies are, in practice, mainly limited to co-operative companies dealing in primary produce; and the depreciation allowed on structural improvements is restricted to primary producers. If, as the result of our efforts to obtain uniformity in taxation methods, there should be a slight increase of any burden imposed on primary producers, that additional burden will be more than offset by the provisions to which I have referred. I attended two conferences to consider the adoption of uniform taxation measures, and I was deeply impressed by the desire of Commonwealth and State Ministers and officials to achieve uniformity, in the interests of taxpayers. Five of the States are already considering legislation to implement the recommendations of the conferences. Ever since the presentation of the report of the royal commission there has been constant consultation between Commonwealth and State authorities, and also between taxation officers of the various States. The Commonwealth and State Treasurers, and officials representing the different treasuries, are confident that uniformity will be achieved, and in order that it may be maintained, arrangements have been made for periodical conferences between Commonwealth and State Ministers and officials. I thank honorable senators for their gener ally sympathetic reception of the bill. </para>

Such cases have arisen frequently in connexion with companies. The company is then constituted by the Commissioner an agent for the person in order that the Commissioner may collect the tax. That, I understand, broadly was the reason for the inclusion of this provision. </para>

            <para>.- I should like to know why it has been necessary to amend the definition of &#34;dividend&#34;. In. the original act &#34; dividend &#34; includes &#34; any distribution made by a company to its shareholders whether in money or other property out of the profits &#34;. The definition in this clause is in similar terms with the addition of the words &#34; and any amount credited to them as shareholders &#34;. I am at  a  loss to understand why these words have been included, because money credited to taxpayers as shareholders of a company may not actually be available to them for some considerable time. Such an amount would be of no use to them until it had been distributed. It would be very embarrassing to a person to be assessed in respect of an amount which he had not received. Will the Minister explain why these words are included ? </para>

            <para>. - This definition is dealt with in paragraph 117 of the report of the Royal Commission on Taxation. The substance of the commission&#39;s recommendation is that the words &#34; out of its profits &#34; should be deleted from the definition and inserted in clause 44, where they should more properly appear. It is necessary to provide that dividend shall not include a return of paid-up capital. The words &#34; and any amount credited to them as shareholders &#34; were inserted to make it clear that the distribution refers to the amounts credited as well as to the amounts paid. It is a definition which the members of the legal fraternity consider necessary. </para>

            <para>.- Money credited to a shareholder may not be received for some. time. I do not wish to do anything to assist any person who is liable to escape the payment of income tax, but in this amendment a person may. be expected to pay a heavier tax for a specific year, because he has not actually handled money credited to him. If he does not pay income tax on the amount in one year he will have to -pay it in the following year; but it is unfair to ask him to pay on an amount which he has not received, except in respect of bonus shares which represent an immediate addition to his capital which he can utilize. He cannot utilize credit unless he has received the money. </para>

            <para>.- According to this definition a &#34; taxpayer &#34; is a person who derives income. The act to be amended defines a &#34; taxpayer &#34; as any person chargeable with income tax. That definition is clear, and I cannot understand why any person should be included as a taxpayer who does mot come within the provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which deals only with income. Under the proposed amendment, all persons deriving income become &#34; taxpayers &#34;. I could as easily understand the definition if it provided that &#34; taxpayer &#34; means &#34; all persons in Australia &#34;. Clause SI provides that taxpayers are persons in receipt of an income of &#163;250 or more annually. </para>

              <para>- It deals with income from property. The honorable senator is splitting straws. A resident of Australia who is not a taxpayer to-day may be a taxpayer to-morrow. There is something in the suggestion made by the Minister during his second-reading speech that we should deal only with the fundamental principles, and not waste time haggling over the language employed. Even if we secured minor alterations, we would not improve the measure. Unless we have some important amendments to propose, we should facilitate the passage of the bill. </para>

            <para>.- The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> cannot dispose of the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> in that way. A definite change in the definition of &#34; taxpayer &#34; is proposed. Prior to the introduction of this measure a taxpayer was a person chargeable with income tax, but now a taxpayer is a. person deriving income. It is <inline font-style="italic">mom</inline> than a matter of mere verbiage, because the term &#34;taxpayer&#34; is now all embracing. The amended definition extends the operations of the act to probably hundreds of thousands of persons in receipt of a small income, who are not taxpayers, but who will be liable to furnish returns. Is it suggested that, in the past, the Commissioner has had any difficulty in dealing with such cases? If it is proposed to change, radically, the previous definition, such a change should be clearly set out. Perhaps this matter is not of enormous importance, but it is certainly one well worth careful consideration, because, in effect, the term &#34; taxpayer &#34; is now to embrace an enormous number of people who pay no tax at all. </para>

            <para>. - Any alteration of this definition would necessitate a redrafting of the whole of the measure. Suppose that certain people enter secretly into a trust, or other arrangement, and a number of them are not taxpayers, because they are not chargeable with income tax. Under the existing definition the inquisitorial powers of the Commissioner do not extend to them, and the Commissioner is thus deprived of an opportunity of bringing them before him for examination. If the definition proposed in this measure be adopted, however, he will be given an opportunity to examine any persons who, he believes, are attempting to evade taxation by some internal arrangement of their affairs. </para>

              <para>- He had certain powers, but the object of this definition is to extend them. I admit that this definition embraces people who do not pay tax. As we proceed with the consideration of this measure, honorable senators will find that this term is used in a variety of ways. Generally speaking, it is now used as meaning a person deriving income, rather than in accordance with the old definition which was a person &#34; chargeable with income tax&#34;; it has now clearly a wider significance. </para>

              <para>- This is obviously an arguable matter, and in the memorandumwe are informed that the full High Court, by the prevailing judgment of the Chief Justice - I take it that the court was equally divided and, that being so, the decision of the Chief Justice, as , the Senior Judge, prevailed - has held that the Commissioner of Taxation was right in converting to Australian currency the income of a taxpayer received in England in sterling. This particular taxpayer has now appealed to the Privy Council. In view of the fact that this case is <inline font-style="italic">sub judice,</inline> will the passing of this clause affect the rights of Payne if his appeal succeeds? </para>

            <para>. - Yes. This provision may appear likely to operate harshly in respect of certain individuals, but we must work on the basis of the conversion of all profits made overseas by Australian residents if we are to be enabled to tax any income derived outside the Commonwealth by Australian residents. Whether the money is, or is not, brought to Australia is the good fortune, or misfortune of the taxpayer as the case may be. The economics of income taxation must be based upon the value of our currency; otherwise no finality would be reached and administration would become most difficult. I shall cite one or two instances on this point. Supposing a taxpayer derives income overseas during the financial year about to close. If the present rate of exchange of &#163;25 is maintained to the 30th June next the taxpayer, for the purposes of furnishing his return, will have to convert his overseas income into Australian currency at that rate for the purpose of furnishing his return of income. If he has not converted it into good Australian pounds, that is his misfortune. It is a matter of good or evil fortune according to whether the rate of exchange fluctuates or remains static. The assessment must be based on the Australian pound. There has been a good deal of discussion regarding the decision of the High Court. Although the matter has now gone to the Privy Council, the taxpayer concerned will not suffer any injustice, because whatever the final decision the legislation will not be made retrospective. The clause as originally drafted was altered in the House of Representatives to its present form. The omission of any reference to telegraphic transfer rates for calculating exchange is due to a decision to allow the common commercial practice applicable to the circumstances of a particular taxpayer to operate. I admit that the subject is full of complexities, and that from time to time difficult cases have arisen, but that is the basic principle underlying the clause. </para>

            <para>.- The Minister&#39;s explanation does not answer the objection which has been raised. Honorable senators know that organizations which claim to be religious bodies actually engage in trade, and, because of the exemption granted under this provision, obtain an advantage over their competitors. I have in mind an organization whose income runs into thousands of pounds a year. This organization is competing with local traders. It is true, I believe, that its profits are devoted to the maintenance oi missions and to other religious purposes, therefore it can legitimately claim that it has a religious standing. But  when an organization, religious or otherwise, deliberately enters into business and competes with the ordinary trader, its profits should be subject to the same toll by the Taxation department as are the profits of the average business man. One of these religious bodies, to my knowledge, pays no taxation. An organization which makes thousands of pounds a year from its trading operations should pay the income tax. I assume that the Taxation Department takes pains to ensure that this particular institution expends its profits in a proper manner; nevertheless in exempting it from taxation, the department is doing an injustice to its competitors. If it were competing on fair lines I would raise no objection; but it pays no taxation, while its competitors are obliged to do so. The Minister should give to the committee some further assurance that institutions engaged in ordinary trading will not escape the taxation disabilities which are the lot of the private trader. </para>

            <para>. - The subject raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> is most vexed. Some of the institutions, while they do engage in business, use the fruits of their industry ill most estimable ways. Others are organized to make a trading profit. In this respect their operations resemble those of a State or Federal Government; they have the advantage of escaping from the income tax and various other charges on their profits. They are apparently the cared-for darlings of the several Commissioners of Taxation of the Commonwealth and the States. I point out, however, that this matter was introduced at a conference of Ministers and taxation commissioners, representing the Commonwealth and the States, and it was decided that the existing law should not be amended. Nevertheless, I shall have regard to the representations made to-day by honorable senators, because it has been demonstrated to me on more than one occasion that one institution was simply trading under the cloak of religion. The Federal and States Governments, however, have difficulty in saying to it: &#34; You shall be taxed because you do not expend your money in the way you should,&#34; while saying to the larger and more important organizations whose services to humanity have been so marked in Australia : &#34; You shall be exempt from taxation.&#39;&#39; If a line is to be drawn, the trading profits of all these religious bodies will have to be taxed. The point which influenced the Ministers at the conference to which I have alluded was that any decision to compel religious institutions to pay income tax upon trading profits would react harshly upon an organization which is doing great service to the poor of Australia. </para>

            <para>. - The explanation offered by the Minister does not meet my objection. The organization, which I have in mind, has two spheres of operation. One brings it properly under the definition of a religious body; but it is also a huge trading concern, and, in my opinion, should not, on that phase of its operations, be exempt from tax. On more than one occasion the Labour party has been requested to take up this matter by the unions of employees who are engaged in similar occupations in private industry. By reason of its religious appeal to the public, this particular organization is not competing fairly with private enterprise. It markets articles which have to be manufactured and placed in containers. From time to time in my letter box I have found propaganda directing my attention to the advantages of the products made by this organization and informing me that if I present myself at the local store with the enclosed coupon, I shall be given two boxes of that product for the price of one. The employees of other firms complain that owing to this unfair competition their output is being reduced. The appeal of this organization is to the religious feelings of the community. For example, a certain organization of a properly religious character and entitled to recognition as such, engages extensively in laundry work. It takes, into its laundries women who are unfortunate in more senses than one and gives them a means of livelihood. Making a canvass of the shipping companies, its representatives point out what charitable rescue work it is doing and as a result, obtain their laundry work. Its competitors in private  enterprise, however, lose a considerable amount of business through these tactics. I emphasize that the organization does not pay award wages and is not subject to the same overhead costs as the private concerns; but it has a religious appeal to the public which no commercial competitor can have. I have in mind more than one organization ; they are not confined to the Seventh Day Adventists&#39;, the Anglicans, or the Roman Catholics. One of them, can be rightly claimed to be religious in its activities; what it does with its profits is no concern of the national Parliament. The point to be borne in mind is that it makes profits like private industry; it is competing unfairly with commercial enterprise. What prospect lias any business man of competing successfully against the Salvation Army? J! fail to understand why it should be exempt from taxation in &#34;regard to its trading departments. </para>

              <para>- Nonsense. It engages in laundry work, and in the manufacture of uniforms, and a hundred and one other things are produced on a wholesale scale by its subsidiary institutions. The competition is most unequal.  If  the department has a definition of what is a religious, a charitable, or a scientific organization, I desire to know it. I could collect in a very short time a number of cranks who would be able to convince the Taxation Department that they were scientists. If the Commissioner of Taxation happened, to sympathize with their activities, probably they would obtain exemption from income tax on any profits they might make. This morning I stated that the Opposition believes in the income tax as the fairest form of tax, and the possibilities of escape from it should be reduced to a minimum. </para>

              <para>- I accept the explanation of the Leader of the Opposition, it is, however, not substantially different from his former remarks. He referred to three Christian organizations - the Seventh Day Adventists&#39;, the Anglicans and the Roman Catholics - and added that there was another organization, which apparently did not come within the category of those that he named. Hu proceeded to object to the distribution  if  their coupons as a means of advertising their products. I know of at least half a dozen organizations which utilize the coupon system for advertising purposes. </para>

              <para>- I see no objection to it. It is a most useful form of advertising. When we mention institutions which use religion as a cloak, and we do not identify them we are doing wrong. From time to time I have received many letters dealing with organizations which it is suggested are resorting to unfair business tactics, or which use the cloak of religion to escape from the payment of the income tax. In endeavouring to discover whether such statements have been justified, I have received sufficient proof that the institutions render valuable service to the community. All of their profits are not devoted to extending their business, but are expended on christian services not only in Australia but also in other parts of the world. </para>

I consider that honorable senators who have referred to certain christian organizations as entering into unfair competition with private enterprise should supply the names of them. If such practices are found to be proven, a law against them should be made. . I believe that the Minister referred to one such institution; if he knows of one it is his duty to see that a law is framed to prevent it from continuing to trade unfairly. </para>

              <para>- I agree that the Salvation Army engages in certain forms of business, but it is not a commercial organization in the ordinarily accepted sense of the term. It conducts hostels in the various capital cities, and social centres in the country, but its hostels are conducted not so much for profit as for the purpose of rendering definite service to the outcasts of all nations. Profits which the Salvation Army makes out of its hostels are used for the furtherance of its religious and social services. I am neither an apologist nor an advocate for the Salvation Army, but I think we must all admit that its officers and soldiers are the most self-sacrificing people in the whole of the Christian religion. They accept less money for their services, they work harder, and the whole of the profits made in any of its many activities are utilized for the benefit of the needy and the weak who have fallen by the wayside. The Salvation Army does not barter pieces of silver in the market place for the purpose of commercial gain. </para>

In New South Wales the members of certain organizations are continually on the doorsteps of members of Parliament, asking for protection in their businesses against the competition of semi-religious organizations, but whenever taxation legislation is under review the references to these organizations are clouded in mystery. Apparently no one is willing to say more than that some charitable or religious organizations - no names are mentioned - are engaged in business, and because they escape taxation, are competing unfairly with businesses privately controlled. If there is anything in the allegation that such bodies are using the cloak of Christianity to make profits without paying taxation, it is about time that legislation was framed to check them. In fact I would go further and say that they should be closed up altogether. </para>

            <para>. - The bill is the outcome of a conference and an agreement between Commonwealth and State taxation authorities. The several Treasurers and their taxation advisers, in the conferences which were held to frame this uniform taxation measure, gave very careful consideration to the issue which has been raised in this discussion, and I am advised that any alteration of the provisions would be objectionable, because it would be a departure from the agreement made; moreover, it would not meet the wishes of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings,</inline> and I do not think I could provide a satisfactory definition of the words &#34;religious, scientific, charitable, or public educational institution.&#34; Those who have practised law know that there are thousands of pages of controversial matter concerning these words. The Commissioner of Taxation himself would prefer to depend on the legal interpretation given to this provision rather than include in the clause a definition which by means of some legal subterfuge, might be evaded. I am also advised that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie&#39;s</inline> suggestion would, if adopted, react unfavorably against many missions that are conducted in this country, the profits from which are sent abroad to forward missionary activities. The problem is a very complex one, and while I admit that there is an element of unfairness in the business activities of some of these semireligious organizations, I can assure the committee that under the law as it stands, if the Commissioner of Taxation has any doubt as to the character of the business conducted by these bodies he does not hesitate to- levy taxation. I am quite sure that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> were surrounded by the cranks to whom he referred, and claimed exemption from income tax, he would find the Commissioner adamant. In the circumstances, I cannot accept the suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie,</inline> and I ask the committee to pass the clause as it stands. </para>

I deprecate this searching criticism of their activities and the implication that some of them are purely trading concerns. The revenues derived from their activities are utilized for the furtherance of scientific, educational, religious, or philanthropic purposes, and it is no exaggeration to say that they relieve the Commonwealth and State governments of hundreds of thousands of pounds of expenditure on social, educational and other services which, but for their existence would have to be raised by taxation of the people. </para>

          <para>This amendment is designed to remove an anomaly which has been brought under notice as existing in connexion with the copra trade of the Mandated Territory of New Guinea. An Australian company is producing copra in that Territory, but does not export and sell it in the copra market outside the Mandated Territory. The company sells the copra within the Territory to a purchaser who exports and sells it elsewhere. The actual exporter is obliged to pay an export duty to the Government of the Mandated Territory, and hence he is entitled to the exemption granted by sub-clause <inline font-style="italic">(q)</inline> now under consideration. The actual exporter, however, usually depresses his purchase price for the copra by the amount of the export duty and. thereby transfers the burden of&#39; the duty to the producing company. This company is not, in the technical sense contemplated by sub-clause <inline font-style="italic">(q),</inline> an actual payer of the export duty to the Government concerned. It merely bears the burden of the duty through the ordinary operations of trade as they are influenced by the export duty.  Consequently,  the Australian company is technically subject  to  the Commonwealth Income Tax. This result was never intended by the Parliament when the provision in the existing law which corresponds to sub-clause <inline font-style="italic">(q)</inline> was enacted. The amendment now proposed will cure the defect. </para>

          <para>The removal of the exemption under (iv) above is in accordance with the recommendation of the royal commission, which gave very serious consideration .to this item of the exemption in the interests of Commonwealth and State uniformity. The royal commission pointed out that, when breeding stock is sold in the ordinary course of business, the proceeds of the sale are included in the taxpayer&#39;s assessable income in the usual manner. The exemption of profit on the sale of breeding stock sold for the purpose of putting an end <inline font-style="italic">to a</inline> business, or a part of a. business, rests on the argument that the breeding stock is equivalent to plant, and that when the breeding stock is sold, the proceeds represent the realization of a capital asset. To this the royal commission replies that when the breeding stock is purchased, the purchase cost is nil owed as a deduction ; similarly in the case of breeding stock, which is bred by the taxpayer, he receives a deduction of the working expenses of the station property incurred in rearing live-stock. The view of the royal commission is that live-stock possesses the characteristics of a fixed asset and a trading asset, and though an animal may be acquired primarily for breeding or wool-growing purposes, its ultimate sale is by no means a minor consideration. No justification, therefore, exists for a continuance of the concession, as in all cases the full cost of every head of stock purchased or reared has been allowed as a deduction, and the recommendation of the royal commission is that the proceeds of breeding stock sold upon the realization or discontinuance of a business, from any cause whatsoever, should be included in the assessable income of the taxpayer. The profit on  the  trading stock realized by a merchant in similar circumstances is not exempted from taxation. The State Ministers in conference all supported the recommendation of the royal commission. </para>

            <para>. -  This provision refers to certain dividends which are exempt from taxation if paid wholly and exclusively from certain funds. It appears  that  the words &#34; wholly and exclusively &#34; will create an anomalous position. Where it is feasible for a company, trading both inside and outside of Australia, to declare separate dividends &#34;wholly and exclusively &#34; out of each class of profit, the Australian shareholders are not liable to further tax in respect of the proportion of the profits derived outside Australia. In a number of cases, however, it is not practicable for a company to adopt this course, and the shareholder, although the conditions are unaltered, becomes liable to tax on the whole of the profits whereever derived. The declaration of  separate  and distinct dividends becomes impracticable to a company deriving only a small proportion of its profits in Australia. There seems to be no logical reason, other than to facilitate departmental administration, for the retention of this anomalous provision. It appears inherently wrong that a shareholder&#39;s liability to tax should be dependent upon the manner in which a company declares its dividends. </para>

            <para>. - The present section  in  both  the  Commonwealth and State acts provides a rigid test in that the expenditure to be allowed as deductions must be &#34; wholly and exclusively &#34; incurred in the production of assessable income. In the bill before us the general allowance clause in respect of business deductions has been widened considerably. The bill also combines in one clause both the general allowance  and the general  disallowance sections of the present act. The clause as drafted was accepted only after the most careful consideration. Although the word &#34; necessarily &#34; does not appear in the New South Wales bill, it does appear in the uniform bills drafted for the acceptance of other State parliaments. The representatives of the States were persuaded to accept the clause in the interests of taxpayers only if the word &#34; necessarily &#34; were included: It must be borne in mind that there are taxpayers who will exploit the provision by claiming exemption from taxation oh the ground that the deductions which they claim relate to expenses incurred for business purposes. Tor example, expenditure incurred in entertaining prospective clients would be claimed as an allowable deduction. Any deduction which is not allowed is as much a subject of appeal against the Commissioner&#39;s decision as is any other item of expenditure. In England a deduction is not allowed if the expenditure is not wholly and exclusively laid out for the purpose of the business. It has been held in that- country that for an expenditure to be deductible it must he &#34; essential &#34; to the earning of the gross receipts. In the United States of America the law provides that &#34; business expenses deductible from  the  gross income include the ordinary  and  necessary expenditure directly connected with or appertaining to the taxpayer&#39;s trade or business &#34;. I admit that one State has not yet come into line in this matter, but the Government is not without hope that it will do so, in the interests of uniformity. </para>

            <para>. -  This matter has been broughtunder my notice, and  I  understand that the word &#34; necessarily &#34; has given rise to some dissatisfaction.  The  Minister says it has been included in the clauses in order to catch exploiters; but surely the law, which has to be obeyed by the general community, is not drafted solely on the chance of an occasional exploiter attempting to evade it. I understand that the Commissioner construes the first part of the clause as relating only to obvious losses and outgoings, such as wages, sales of products at less than cost price, taxes, &#38;c. ; but when it comes to matters such as expenditure on advertising, which all honorable senators will admit is an important item in any business, the Commissioner has held, in some instances, that such expenditure is out of all proportion to the needs of the business, and has disallowed a portion of it. Similar action has been taken in respect of other kinds of expenditure which are not indisputably &#34;necessarily incurred in carrying on a business &#34;. The original act includes the words &#34; all losses and outgoings . . . actually incurred &#34;. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It  does not contain the word &#34;necessarily &#34;. The use of that word makes the justification for the expenditure a matter of personal opinion. Surely no one is more&#39; capable of forming an opinion as to what is necessary for the proper development of a business than is the man who conducts it. In my opinion, it would be better of the word &#34;necessarily &#34; were deleted in favour of either &#34; relevant &#34; or &#34; actually &#34;. </para>

              <para>- It dealt with a number of English and American decisions, and as a result of its report, the word &#34; necessarily &#34;. was included in the clause. The new clause makes clearer the principle contained in the existing legislation. In the carrying on of a business there are items of expenditure which, although properly deductible from an accountancy point of view in order to ascertain the profits, do not survive the test set up by the act. The object of the clause is to give legislative effect to a principle laid down by the High Court in appeal cases. There will be some reduction of the yieldof tax from some businesses through allowance, in future, of deductions in respect of Arbitration Court expenses and certain legal expenses which have not previously been deductible.

            <para>The problem, therefore, is to draft sections relating both to the allowance and disallowance of deductions which will make it clear that the taxpayer is entitled to claim any expenditure properly incurred by him in the production of his income, whether derived from a trade or otherwise, without at the same time opening the door so wide as to permit the allowance of deductions for which there is no justification. This might, perhaps, be accomplished by means of a section under which the taxpayer would be allowed as deductions all losses and outgoings incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income, or in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income; with a proviso or limiting section excluding the right to deduct any losses or outgoings of capital, or losses or outgoings incurred in relation to the gaining or production of income exempt from tax. </para>

          <para>SenatorLECKIE (Victoria) &#91;5.13&#93;.- The Minister&#39;s contention that uniformity of legislation is desirable has great weight withme, but we have also to consider the protection of the taxpayer. The inclusion of the word &#34; necessarily &#34; seems to place on the taxpayer an obligation which he should not have to bear. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> referred to expenditure incurred in advertising. A business man may make a mistake and advertise too extensively; but at the time that the expenditure is incurred he regards it as necessary to his business. Another man may expend considerable sums of money in defending his patent rights, only to lose his case. Would the Minister say that that expenditure was not necessarily incurred in carrying on his business ? So long as the administration is sympathetic the inclusion of the word &#34; necessarily &#34; may be of comparatively little importance, but changes of officers might result in the administration becoming harsh. </para>

              <para>- The general opinion of taxation experts is that the concessions intended to be given to taxpayers, are being withheld from them. It does not appear to me that this one word carries such a great amount of weight. To say that unless we insert the word &#34; necessarily &#34;, the aim to achieve uniformity will fail, is, in my opinion, to exaggerate its importance. It is feared that the word will involve the commercial community, if not in further expense, at any rate, in a considerable amount of explanation in order to satisfy the Commissioner of Taxation that the expenditure incurred was absolutely necessary for the earning of the income. </para>

              <para>- Why ? Does the honorable senator suggest that expenditure which is not necessary for the production of income should be allowable as a deduction ? Surely not ! This clause specifically refers to all losses and outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or&#34; producing the assessable income. Suppose that a gentleman entertains honorable senators at a champagne supper in the interests of a certain industry; is he to be permitted to put the expenses down to advertising, and claim them as deductions? The Commonwealth Government hopes to bring all the States into line in this matter. It has been most troublesome for the officers of the department, and if uniformity is not obtained, more difficulties win be created for the tribunals. The wiser course for the committee to adopt would be to agree to the clause in its present form, on the understanding that if any difficulties arise they will be corrected by amending legislation. The only reason why thu officers of the department requested nin to give this undertaking was because they are aware that some taxpayers have such fears as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> has expressed. We desire uniformity, and if this provision does not operate as is intended, the Commonwealth Government will request the States at some future conference to agree to amend the law. </para>

            <para>. -  I notice that expenditure incurred by the taxpayer in the year of income for repairs, not being of a capital nature, to premises or rolling-stock used by him for the purposes of producing assessable income, shall be an allowable deduction. Will similar consideration be allowed in respect of personal exertion? For example, a worker has to paint his dwelling. The States and the Commonwealth do not allow such expenditure to be deducted. Therefore, I fail to see why it should be allowed in connexion with a business, when the individual is only improving his capital asset? </para>

            <para>. - The taxpayer may purchase a property in a state of disrepair and expend considerable sums to restore it to a habitable condition. It is considered that this expenditure is of a capital nature, which if it had been incurred before the purchase would have been reflected in the price paid ; therefore, this is treated as capital expenditure. The repairs must be to any premises or part of premises, plant, machinery, implement, utensils, rolling-stock, &#38;c, occupied or used by him for the purpose of producing assessable income, or in carrying on business for that purpose. For example, wear of machinery, the deterioration of buildings under the influence of weather, and of premises in which acids are manufactured, are forms of depreciation for which an allowance is made. In addition to this, however, provision is made for repairs, and the Commissioner of Taxation decides how much ought to be allowed for depreciation and how much for repairs. While expenditure on repairs of a capital nature is not an allowable deduction, repairs which are incidental to the earning of the income, and by way of every-day expenditure are deductible. Sub-clause 2 refers to expenditure incurred upon repairs to any premises or part of premises not so held, occupied or used. In that case no deduction will be allowed. </para>

            <para>.- Sub-clause (1) paragraph (&#38;) provides that sunns which are not otherwise allowable deductions, and which are paid by the taxpayer in the year of income to a fund to provide Individual personal benefits, pensions or retiring allowances for employees or dependants of such employees, shall be allowable deductions; and paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> enacts that sums paid to a retiring allowance or pensions fund for persons who are, or have been, employees or dependants of employees, shall also be allowable deductions. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">al</inline> deals with calls on shares in a mining company or syndicate carrying on mining operations in Australia, or in any company carrying on afforestation in Australia as its principal business. It is contended that the limitation of allowance to the amount of the net income of the year should he removed. As regards the sums mentioned in paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">c,</inline> in most instances where a company or a firm establishes a fund or pays retiring allowances, it is under an obligation to make a contribution to the fund or to pay retiring allowances irrespective of whether it showed a profit or loss in any particular year. It is suggested that a company or firm should be allowed to carry forward, as an ordinary business loss, the excess of contributions over the profits for the year. The retiring allowance received by the ex-employee is subject to tax in his hands. Therefore, if the limitation mentioned is allowed to remain, double taxation will result. Payments made under paragraph- <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> may be for the purpose of carrying on a particular undertaking during an unproductive period, and, as the operations mentioned are of national importance, the conduct of them should be. encouraged. Sub-clause 1 stipulates that gifts to a public hospital shall be allowable deductions, and although paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> seem to open up a wider field, a company or firm will not be allowed to deduct arrears of payments from&#34; the income of the following years. </para>

            <para>. - Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d,</inline> which exempts calls on shares in a mining company or syndicate carrying on mining operations in Australia, has been the law for many years, but it has not given very much relief. If the Government wishes to encourage mining operations, provision should be made to exempt application and allotment moneys. Is seems strange that calls on shares in a mining company should be allowable deductions, whereas application and allotment moneys are not. There is a lack of uniformity about the provisions which should be rectified. Some mining  companys  call up nearly all of their capital ; others are able to carry on with the application and allotment moneys. I suggest that the Minister should agree to the insertion of the words &#34;application and allotment moneys and &#34; at the beginning of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d.</inline></para>

            <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> has asked for the removal of the limitation of the deduction provided in paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">b, c</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">d.</inline> The honorable senator contends that, in most instances, the employer is under an obligation to make a contribution to a fund or to pay retiring allowances, irrespective of whether the business shows a profit or a loss in any particular year. Apparently the honorable senator has overlooked clause 66, which deals with contributions to pension funds in cases where the taxpayer is under legal  obligation to make the payment. Generally speaking, this applies in most cases where a fund is established. Under clause 66 there is no limitation of the amount of deduction which may be allowed. Paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> of clause 78 represent a concession to the taxpayer in regard to voluntary payments. They are allowed to the amount of net income  of  the year. Payments of this nature, as in the case of gifts to charity, cannot be allowed without any limitation. It was a consideration, in obtaining approval for the extension of the deductions under paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> and c, that it would be limited to the amount of the net income of the year. </para>

I am referring to the position of taxpayers who have shown an absolute loss, and have not been able to make contributions to a superannuation fund ; but who, in the following year, have made a profit, out of which they have paid a double contribution. There should be some elasticity about the provisions in order to allow a taxpayer to recover in respect of actual losses sustained. </para>

            <para>. - I cannot accept the  amendment. This  provision is in the law as it  stands, and  it is not the intention either of the Commonwealth  or the States to extend it.  Calls on shares in a mining company  or  syndicate may be regarded as expenditure which people make from year to year in the carrying on of their businesses; whereas application  and allotment  moneys are treated, apparently,  as capital  expenditure. Some mining companies are doing tolerably well, and, although I am a strong supporter of one of the industries concerned, my advice to those in control of them is to leave well alone. I, therefore, suggest that the honorable senator should not press his amendment. </para>

            <para>. -  I mentioned the subjectmatter of this clause during my secondreading speech, and I should like the Minister to clear up several points, because I understood him to say, when moving the second reading of the bill, that this is a new concession which the Commonwealth is granting. The Minister also said that an attempt had been made to make the Commonwealth and State acts uniform. Under this clause the Commonwealth allows a deduction of &#163;50 in respect of the spouse of a taxpayer which, I understand, is the same as that, provided previously. I have taken considerable interest in this subject, because it affects  those  who have the responsibility of rearing families. From time to  time  the imposition of a tax on bachelors, and spinsters has been mentioned, but those suggesting such a tax have received little support. It appears to be comparatively easy to impose indirect taxes in the shape of customs duties, sales tax and relief tax, but it would be more reasonable to grant further deductions of this Mature and in that way assist those who are bringing up families. I am pleased to find that this provision has been included in the bill, but I should like the amount to bc increased to &#163;72. The amount provided in  the  clause is small, but some benefit will be conferred upon those who are carrying a fairly heavy burden, and have to contend with many hardships. </para>

            <para>. -  I suggest that after the words, &#34; medical practitioner &#34; in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">r.</inline> the word &#34; dentist &#34; should be inserted. Provision has been made for the deduction of amounts paid to qualified medical practitioners, nurses, chemists, and public or private hospitals, but no such deduction is allowable in respect of payments made to dentists. This matter was considered by the Royal Commission on Taxation, which decided not. to include such payments because such a deduction is allowed by only one government. That does not seem to settle the matter, and unless such a deduction can be said to infringe some principle every government will be governed in its course by financial considerations. It is calculated that the deductions provided for in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> will result in Commonwealth revenue being reduced  by  at least &#163;300,000. It is obvious that no State, unless it is the rich State of New South Wales or the almost equally richState of Victoria, could afford to forgo such a large amount of revenue. This is a matter, not of principle, but of detail, in respect of which one government need not be bound by the decision of another government. It has been said that in many households the cost of dental attention is as great and in some instances greater than the- cost of medical service. </para>

              <para>- The health of a person frequently depends upon the condition of his teeth. Years ago visits to dentists were not considered necessary, but if the health is to be preserved such visits are now regarded as essential. Medical practitioners often advise their patients to visit a dentist every six or twelve months. The payments made to dentists are justifiable deductions just as much as are those made to doctor?, nurses and others. In fact, the service rendered by the dentist may be more &#39; valuable than that given by the others. </para>

            <para>. -&#34;-The royal commission considered the inclusion of dentists but stated that it was not prepared to increase the allowable deductions already provided for, more particularly as the payments made to dentists are allowed as deductions by only one State government. I understand that, payments made to dentists are at present allowable as deductions under the New South Wales Act, but that act is being made uniform with the Commonwealth and other State acts. Such payments may be considerable, particularly when gold fillings and expensive crown work are involved. If payments made to dentists were included, those made to others rendering similar service would also have to be considered. I understand that the Treasurer, when pressed by honorable members in another place, to see if something could be done in this direction, was obliged, in the interests of uniformity of assessments, to refuse an amendment on the lines of that now suggested to the committee. I ask honorable senators, therefore, not to press this matter. The Treasurer undertook to communicate with the other States and if they are prepared to fall into line with this suggestion, the Commonwealth Government will do likewise. That is .the attitude adopted by the Treasurer. In those circumstances, and in view of the fact that the government of -Now South Wales has agreed to abolish concessional deductions in respect of dental attention, it would be a breach of faith on the part of this Government to accept the suggestion at this stage. The arguments advanced by honorable senators, I admit, are quite logical, and could probably, with equal reason, be applied in favour of concessions in other directions. In view of the Treasurer&#39;s undertaking, however, I ask honorable senators not to press for this alteration. </para>

              <para>- It might be; but, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> said earlier, are we to pass measures in this chamber merely by saying &#34; Amen &#34; to them ? I believe that ultimately a concessional deduction for dental attention, as has been allowed hitherto in New South Wales, will have to be provided for in our income tax legislation generally. After all, when dealing with these matters we must bear in mind that not only people with big incomes pay tax, but also a large number who find it difficult to meet their assessments. Even senators may sometimes find it difficult to meet their income tax. We realize, of course, that income taxation is fair and equitable, but owing to the fact that the tax assessed on an income enjoyed for a certain period has to be paid in a period when the taxpayer&#39;s income has diminished, difficulties in payment very often arise. We know that many people with small incomes have to meet bills of from &#163;30 to &#163;40 annually for dental attention. It is reasonable, therefore, to allow this expenditure to be deducted from income. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> moved in this matter, I would support him, if only for the reason that the abolition of concessional deductions for dental attention by the Government of New South Wales is bound to react badly on taxpayers in that State. This is one of those comparatively small concessions, which, in hard times, many people appreciate very much indeed. I should like to express my opinion by a vote on this matter. </para>

            <para>.- I support the suggestion made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes,</inline> because attention to the teeth of children and adults is just as important, from the point of view of general health, as is medical attention Dental science has advanced tremendously during the last few years. It is known that defective teeth undermine general health. I differ from the statement of the Minister that this line of argument could be applied with equal force in favour of other deductions - for instance., in respect of expenditure for eye treatment and the purchase of optical glasses. Loss of eyesight will not cause death, but defective teeth, by poisoning the whole system, can do so. I should like to see a concessional deduction allowed for dental attention. </para>

I presume that -that allowance can be availed of in any form of medical attention. Does the Minister consider that the cost of this particular concession to the Government would be greatly increased if deductions were allowed for dental attention? More important still, does he regard this provision as a principle, or is it&#39; n matter of detail in which the various State governments are in a position to do what they think best? I agree that in this matter uniformity is essential, but as the deduction is limited to &#163;50, I do not think that the inclusion of dental expenditure would make &#39; very much difference. </para>

Whilst I do not base my argument on financial grounds only, I am informed that provision for dental attention in this clause would result in a considerable reduction of revenue. Although, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> has pointed out, a limit is prescribed, and that limit may not now be fully availed of in respect of expenses for medical and nursing attention, yet if the allowable deductions were extended to include the cost of dental attention, the concession would be used by a far greater number of people, and a considerable loss of revenue would result.

          <para class="block">For various good and sufficient reasons Parliament has seen fit to exempt certain classes of income from the payment of tax. Those exemptions include certain classes of Government securities, incomes from some forms of primary production and mining, and extraAustralian incomes in the hands of a resident when such income is subject to tax in the country of origin. It, therefore, seems inherently wrong that other provisions of the same legislation should, by indirect means, nullify the benefits of those exemptions i n many cases. That, however, is the effect of this clause, which sets out to allow losses incurred by a taxpayer against subsequent profits. Equity demands that that should be done; but the clause provides that, in arriving at the loss, exempt income shall first be taken into account. It provides further that when the loss is carried into the subsequent year&#39;s assessment, it shall be set off, in the first instance, against any exempt income of the year of assessment. In order to show how thebenefits of the alleged exemption may be lost, I cite the following example - </para>

            <para>Such cases at once raise the question of the general ability of the taxpayer to pay his tax. That ability may very properly be measured against the total income derived by him from all sources, so that when a concession is granted to the taxpayer in the shape of deduction of losses from profits and carrying forward unrecouped losses against future income, it is proper that the taxpayer&#39;s benefit should be limited to the excess of his loss over any net income received by him which is not taxed by the Common wealth. </para>

          <para class="block">Various chambers of commerce took up this matter. They desired that, in calculating the losses to be carried forward from previous years, the net exempt income should not be taken into consideration in arriving at the net loss. They claimed that, in effect, the set-off meant that&#39; indirectly, the exempt income was made taxable. The soundness of the argument is not admitted. The Royal Commission on Taxation examined this  subject exhaustively, and expressed the opinion that, as the deduction of losses is a concession given by the Government in any case, the Government has every right to limit the extent of the concessional deductions and the losses which should be permitted. Bound up with this subject is the ability of the person concerned to pay. The royal commission expressed the opinion that a person with exempt income is in a better position to meet the higher incidence of the taxation than is a person without such income. I draw attention to page 109 of the royal commission&#39;s report, in which that body adopted the principle which <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page expressed in 1928. The ability to pay is the test. When a concession is granted, it is not too much to expect that any income should be brought into the calculation. I cannot accept the amendment. </para>

It was held that it would be sufficient <inline font-style="italic">ti</inline> the losses were carried forward for three years, and also that the acceptance of a definite period of three years by all governments, or by a majority of governments, would be of decided advantage to primary producers.

The clause, however, provides for the inclusion in the assessable income of the gross premium ; whereas,  the  proviso inserted in the House of Representatives refers to the inclusion in the assessable income of a net premium, It has been found necessary, therefore, to introduce a new sub-clause, providing for the inclusion in the assessable income of net premiums in the case of leases of the type referred to in the proviso. The phraseology of the proviso has also been suitably altered to harmonize with the new sub-clause. While the Government has accepted this amendment, as remodelled, it does not. represent  the  final word. The matter was discussed yesterday at the conference of State Premiers, and it was agreed that  the  subject will be reconsidered from the legal and financial standpoints between  now  and September. If necessary, an amending bill will be introduced to make the provision workable. From the legal standpoint, this is most complex and difficult. The Government has accepted the principle of the amendment inserted by  the  House of Representatives, but the States and the Commonwealth desire to  be  given more time to consider its  effect.  The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> has promised that the matter will be discussed next September, after which some minor amendments may have to be made to the clause. </para>

            <para>. - The subject embodied in this clausehas been discussed by the various interests concerned. The complexity of the position between trustees, attorneys, and representatives of life tenants, and lifetenants themselves, who have taken a lease from a trustee, is considerable, and it has been decided to refer the matter to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Ferguson, with a view to ascertaining whether some method can be evolved whereby justice will be done to these people. They have represented that they entered into leases in conformity with the law which then existed. Subsequently a dispute arose in regard to the method by which the. position of the trustees of these estates is secured by the creation of  a  sinking fund from the amount paid by the tenant. The matter has been discussed with the Treasurer, and it will be reconsidered next September. What the decision of the Government will be I am unable to forecast, but I apprehend from the representations made to it that some relief will be given to these persons.  </para>

            <para>.- I direct attention to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of subclause 2, which sets out that where a taxpayer who in the year of income is a lessee of land used for the purpose of producing assessable income has, either before or after the commencement of the lease, incurred expenditure in making improvements not subject to tenant rights on that land, and was required to make them under the provisions of the lease, he shall be granted some relief from taxation. If a leaseholder is required to carry out certain improvements under the provisions of the lease and/or by a statutory authority, he should be entitled to some consideration. The position is that manufacturers and business concerns are frequently compelled by health or factory authorities to carry out certain works or improvements on their premises. Surely they should be allowed to deduct that expenditure from their income. As I interpret the bill, such persons will not be allowed to make this claim. I consider that the position may also arise in connexion with primary producers; the State governments have taken certain powers for the rehabilitation of farmers, and have provided for a moratorium. In some cases the States are compelling those in charge of the holdings to erect fences and carry out other improvements. At a meeting of experts associated with certain factories, it was found that this provision might put the business men to a good deal of expense without granting them any relief. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator A.</inline>J. McLACHLAN (South Australia - Postmaster-General) | 8.28 J . - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> asks that a deduction should be allowed to a lessee in. respect of improvements made by him as the result of a request of some statutory authority such as a municipal council or board of health. The bill already widens the present allowable deductions in regard to improvements. Under the present act, the expenditure in respect of improvements under a covenant of the lease is allowed. Under the bill, the deduction is extended to cover cases where improvements are made with the written consent of the lessor. In future, the lessor is to be assessed on the value to him of the improvements so effected. I visualize cases where_, if such were to occur, either the lessor or the lessee, by getting the local authority to take certain action, would derive benefits. I consider that that would be a particularly dangerous provision. Accordingly, after consideration by the departmental officers, it was resolved to leave the respective rights of the parties untouched. The only allowance which could be made was in respect of improvements effected with the consent of the lessor, and, furthermore, as the lessor is assessed on the value to him of those improvements, it is a matter for the lessor and the lessee to adjust between themselves when the lease is being drawn up. The taxation laws should not take cognizance of any relationship which may be brought about by some decision of an outside authority. I draw the attention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> to the extent to which the bill has already widened the allowable deductions. In many of the cases referred to, it was thought that the improvements would have to be made by the lessor or with his consent. In the latter event, a deduction according to the amount of expenditure will be allowed as a matter of course; but if the improvements are not made with the lessor&#39;s consent, it. is considered that a deduction should not be allowed to the lessee, nor should the lessor be assessed in respect thereof. To do so would be to allow an outside body arbitrarily to increase the imposition on the lessor or give a benefit to the lessee. The extensions of the deduction already proposed in the bill were arrived at only after most careful consideration, and they represent the basis agreed upon between the Commonwealth and the States. </para>

            <para>. - This subject has received very careful consideration. Representation  has been  made that &#34; distributable income &#34; should be defined to include the profit of the year and not the taxable income as at present. In determining  the taxable  income, all business expenses are allowed as a deduction. But if profits were allowed, companies would arrive at different results in respect of the same taxable income. For instance, one company might write off depreciation at  a  rate based on the estimated life of the plant, whilst the policy of another company might be to write off excess depreciation  so  as  to  get rid of the capital item at the earliest possible  date.  Some companies  also reduce  considerably the amount of profit by setting aside abnormal fees for their directors. The adoption of the profits basis would give an unfair advantage to the unscrupulous taxpayer, and would, to a large extent, nullify the provisions of the law relating to insufficient distributions of profits. By basing the calculation on the taxable income, all taxpayers are placed on the same footing, and as stated earlier, the wider provisions dealing with allowable deductions should cover the deduction of all legitimate business expenditure. Expenses in respect of patents and copyrights are regarded as capital expenditure. </para>

            <para>. -  I understand that the film industry in Australia is suffering special disabilities of the nature proposed in this clause under income tax measures of various States. Clause  137  deals with the Australian income of foreigncontrolled companies, insofar as such companies attempt to evade taxation by means of trading arrangements which do not disclose the true profits made from their Australian business. The film distributing interests claim that clause  137  is sufficient to cover their operations, and, therefore, there is no necessity for clause  138.  An assessment made on a foreign company under clause  137  results in the taxation in Australia of profits which are also subject to tax abroad. This double tax, however, is due solely to an attempt by a foreign company to avoid income tax in Australia. For quite a long time it has ,been suggested that attempts have been made by certain foreign film companies to evade payment of tax by selling their films in Australia at an unjustifiably high price, and keeping the profits in their own country, while showing a false profit in the country in which they operated. But the same charge in :all likelihood could be levelled against oil and motor companies, and other foreign-controlled enterprises. If it is shown that the price charged by the foreign company to the Australian business is fair, the assessment under -section  137  is withdrawn; in that case there is no avoidance of income tax in Australia, and therefore, double tax is not charged. Under clause  138,  however, -any profit which the overseas filmpro.ducing company may make out of its producing operations upon which it is liable to income tax abroad, is again taxed in Australia, notwithstanding that such profit may be properly attributable to sources abroad; that is, that the price charged to the Australian distributing business was fair. There is thus a vital difference between the two clauses, and a clear discrimination against the film industry. I understand, and I believe other honorable senators are also aware of this fact, and that this method of taxation, which is applied in the case of film companies, is different from that applied to other foreign-controlled companies, such as, for example, the oil and motor concerns. The film companies, are forced to pay a double tax, whilst the other companies are placed in. a different category. I understand that the governments of both New South Wales and Queensland are of the opinion that this is not a fair tax. When, the governments came together in conference, however, and decided on uniform legislation, all of them, apparently, accepted this means of taxation, presumably because it would bring in a greater amount of revenue. The taxation of foreign-controlled companies is dealt with in a different way in other countries. The United Kingdom, for instance, does not follow a course similar to that proposed in this measure. I suggest that the Minister should explain fully the particular reasons for the inclusion of this clause. If greater taxation has to ve op.id by the film industry, it will mean that films will become dearer, and that eventually the public who patronize .pictures will have to pay more for their entertainment. I suggest that the Government should extend to the film companies at least the same consideration which it extends to other foreign-controlled companies, such as those engaged in the oil and motor industries. </para>

            <para>.  -These- clauses repeat in substance section  28a  of the existing law. This section was inserted in the act in  1930,  and was received with expressions of satisfaction by all parties in Parliament, the only criticism being that it had been too long delayed. Under the pre-existing law, it was not possible to tax foreign  film-producing companies upon the income they derived through the exhibiting of their films in Australia. By the creation of subsidiary distributing companies in Australia and similar devices, their affairs were so arranged that their income was, technically, not derived from sources within Australia, and was, therefore, not liable to assessment. On the other hand, the charges to the subsidiary companies operating in Australia were so framed as to cause little or no profit to be made by them. Under the law as it then stood, the Commissioner pf Taxation could go no further than the subsidiary Australian companies in an attempt to assess and collect tax, but in this respect his powers were limited to cases where the business of the subsidiary company produced either no taxable income or less than the ordinary taxable income which might be expected to arise from that business. It was quite impossible for the Commissioner to obtain the necessary information to put into operation his powers in this respect, for he was unable to obtain from the subsidiary companies any information as to costs of production and other necessary expenses upon which he could form an opinion as to the amount of income which might be expected to arise from businesses of this nature. The attitude adopted was that this information was not available in Australia. Moreover, in the enforcement of any such assessment, the Commissioner could only levy upon any property in Australia of the subsidiary companies, and could not prevent the remittance abroad of large sums of money. Owing to the widespread demand that these foreign companies should pay tax upon the profits arising in Australia through the exhibiting of their films, this legislation was enacted. Its effect is that such a company must pay tax upon 30 per cent, of its gross Australian receipts unless it proves, by production of accounts, that this amount is excessive. This legislation has operated very successfully, and has resulted in the production of accounts which previously had been stated to be not available. The fact that, in some cases, 30 per cent, has been shown to be excessive does not detract from the value of the legislation, because it is only that  legis- lation  which has enabled the Commissioner to obtain the accounts necessary to ascertain what are the real profits of the companies. Moreover, the fact must be remembered that the legislation was closely followed by the depression period, during which the profits of these companies were, doubtless, considerably less than in normal times. If this legislation were now abandoned, the Commissioner would again be placed in a position where he would be limited to asserting such liability as he could, against the Australian subsidiary companies, while the foreign companies would go free in respect of the large profits derived by them through the instrumentality of the subsidiary companies. The fact that some States are not adopting a provision similar to this is not significant because, while the Commonwealth provision remains, they are able to base their assessments upon the information which the companies are compelled to produce by reason of the Commonwealth provision. This is a notional method of assessing an income. The Government says, in effect, to these companies, &#34;We shall tax. you on profits at the rate of 30 per cent, of your gross receipts &#34;. The onus is then on the companies themselves to produce the facts; if the facts are proved, then the Commissioner does not tax them <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> the 30 per cent, basis. What is wrong with that? </para>

              <para>- That is the profit on which the first assessment is made, and I do not know of any other class of business which returns so high a percentage of profit. It appears that under this clause profit, if any, properly attributable to overseas operations, which are subject to heavy taxation overseas, are liable to taxation in Australia. On the other hand, losses made overseas arc not allowed as a deduction against the income of the Australian companies. Neither are they carried forward and allowed as a set-off in future years, as is done in respect of all other taxpayers. It appears also that clause 13S applies only if the distribution of films is carried on in Australia by means of a subsidiary company. I am told that if the distribution is carried on by a branch of a foreign company, which is not separately incorporated, clause 138 will not apply. It seems to me to be an extraordinary state of affairs if we are prepared to continue legislation which gives an advantage to those companies that are represented here by a branch as compared with companies which are incorporated here. In these circumstances, it would appear that the bill penalizes a business because of the form in which it is carried on in Australia. Clause 137, which deals with other foreign companies, does not distinguish between businesses carried on in Australia by means of branches and those which operate through subsidiary companies. In view of the disclosures made to, and the information withheld from, the Royal Commission on Petrol, it would appear that if legislation of this nature is necessary in regard to the film industry, it is even more necessary in respect of some other foreign companies. I am opposed to the clause. </para>

          <para>The amendment proposed represents a re-arrangement of the terms of the existing sub-clauses 2 and 3 for the purpose of expressing their intention more clearly. By a recent decision, the Board of Review has interpreted the corresponding provision in the existing law in a manner which would expose the revenue to heavy loss unless the terms of the provision be amended as proposed. The original object of the provision, which was incorporated in the law by the Income Tax Assessment Act 1922, was to grant the concession provided by the section to a limited class of business which, being fully capitalized, was bound to appropriate part of its taxable income for the purpose of preserving its assets at their original value. That provision was never intended to grant the concession, at the expense of other taxpayers, to a person entering upon a business with the use of borrowed money and retaining his taxable income in order to pay off his indebtedness, and so build up his capital. But the recent decision of the Board of Review would extend the benefits of the section to such a case. Hitherto, the section has been applied almost exclusively to pastoral propositions, where the natural increase of live stock must be retained to replace worthless animals, and thus enable the assets of the business to be maintained at their effective strength. The alteration of the wording of the sub-clauses will not deprive primary producers of the benefit of the section in those types of cases in which it is now being applied. It should be noticed that it is taxable income which must be retained. Thus, a retention of proceeds of the business under the heading of depreciation would not be a cause for the application of the section to a case, because the law already provides for complete exemption by way of deduction in an assessment of the part of the taxpayer&#39;s gross receipts that represents the permissible provision for depreciation of plant and machinery. No further con cession, by way of reduction of the rate of tax on any part of the taxable income, could be justified or permitted in such a case. </para>

            <para>. - This is an example of how thoroughly the policy of the present Government differs from that laid down by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. S.</inline> M. Bruce when he was Treasurer of the Commonwealth. I am opposed to the amendment, which is designed to restrict, in more specific terms, the rebate allowed in respect of business incomes in the hands of individuals or partnerships. The original intention of section 30 of the existing act was to place an individual taxpayer or partnership on a basis more comparable with that of a company. Its intention was made clear in a speech delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> in October, 1922, but in the administration of the act that intention has never been given full effect. The Supreme Court of Victoria held, in effect, in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Kiddle</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">The Commissioner of Taxation,</inline> that the section should apply in cases in which some part of the taxpayer&#39;s income was retained for the development of the business. The amendment will completely override  that  judgment. Repeated applications by taxpayers to the department on this subject have met with a large proportion of refusals. From an economic point of. view it is desirable that individual traders and (partnerships should be placed on the same basis as companies in regard to their ability to retain some part of their income for development and expansion, without being subject to further tax, and it is suggested that an appropriate way to do that would be to exclude subclauses 2 and 3 entirely. I shall read some of the evidence given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKellar</inline> White,  president  of the Taxpayers Association of New South Wales, before the Royal Commission on Taxation on the 21st November, 1932. In respect of section 30, sub-section 2 of the act, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKellar</inline> White said - </para>

I have a. copy of the judgment in that case, which I  will hand in for the information of the commission. </para>

            <para>In connexion with this particular matter I have looked up federalHansard in connexion with the debates in Parliament at the time that the section was originally introduced in 1922. In introducing section 30 of the act in October,1922, the then Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> stated-- &#34; Relief or benefit is to be afforded to partnerships and to those carrying on individual business. At present a private company, although it may be to all intents and purposes a partnership, has a considerable advantage over the individual or partnership carrying on business. The private company pays tax at the company rate only on any part of its profits which is retained in the business and placed to a reserve, whereas individuals engaged in business, whose rate exceeds the company rate, are obliged to pay on the whole of their profits at whatever is the appropriate rate for their own income. The Government are desirous almost above anything to encourage the expansion and stabilizing of business by the placing to reserves of amounts which will help to effect these two objects; and in this bill, in order to give some encouragement to the individual or the partnership, and to place both a little more closely upon the terras enjoyed by the private company, provision is made by which. 15 per cent. of the profits earned by the individual or the partnership can be taxed at the company rate (of 2s. 5d.) instead of at the rate appropriate to the individual or partnership if the latter is higher than the former.&#34; </para>

We suggest that it should bo eliminated, and that the original intention of the section should bc given effect to. </para>

            <para>. - Several years ago 1 raised this matter in relation to some minor taxing bill. I expressed the view, which is not in any way extreme, that if it is incumbent upon the taxpayer to pay his tax when assessed, it should be equally incumbent upon the Commissioner to refund any over-assessment, which is admitted by him to be such. The Minister then in charge of the bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Brennan)</inline> explained that the word &#34; may &#34; was mandatory, and had been held to be so by the courts ; for that reason there was no necessity to stipulate &#34; shall &#34; in lieu of &#34; may &#34;. In view of the fact that this is the bill under which income tax, which is the principal form of direct taxation, is levied in Australia, I see no reason why the word &#34; may &#34; should persist in this clause. In drawing attention to this matter I am actuated only by a desire to see that equal justice is rendered to both parties. If honorable senators study the bill they will find that section after section contains the phraseology the taxpayer &#34; shall &#34; do this or that. If it is clear, on the Commissioner&#39;s own admission, that the excess of tax is repayable, the clause should read that it &#34;shall&#34; be repaid. That is only just. </para>

          <para class="block">Australia - Postmaster-General) &#91;9.43&#93; . - The honorable senator is quite correct in stating that compulsion embodied in the word &#34; shall &#34;, is employed against the taxpayer, while it is not employed where the Commissioner is concerned. There is a reason for the adoption of this language in relation to what is a clear liability on the part of  the Commissioner. The amendment of the assessment reduced the liability of the taxpayer. Money has been paid by him in excess of what ought to have been paid, and an action lies against the Commissioner for the recovery of it. The view expressed by the Crown Law authorities is that if the word &#34; shall &#34; is inserted in reference to the Commissioner in a taxing measure such as this he is obliged to refund the money without the right of any set-off. In the majority of contentious cases the Commissioner has other claims against the taxpayer. That is why there is a statutory obligation on the  taxpayer, but not on the Commissioner. The provision has been  so worded in order  to make sure that the Crown gets the money which may be owing to it on some  other account of the taxpayer. </para>

On that occasion, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan</inline> said that the word &#34; may &#34; is frequently interpreted by the courts to mean &#34; shall.&#34; On the other hand, the Minister in charge of the bill has just told us that it may be advisable for the Commissioner to retain money overpaid, as a set-off against other claims which the department may have against the taxpayer concerned. If  a  taxpayer is over-assessed he has to pay the amount, but may lodge an objection. In due course his objection is treated as an appeal. If, eventually, the Commissioner agrees that the taxpayer is right, there should be a definite obligation on the Commissioner to refund, without delay, the amount of the overcharge. Indeed it is not unreasonable to urge that there should be an interest charge against the Commissioner, just as there is an interest charge against the taxpayer who does not pay his assessment within the time allowed.

              <para>- If the circumstances were exactly the same, I have no  doubt  that it would be desirable  to have  uniformity. I agree that very often a taxpayer is overcharged, but it may well happen that  in  a previous year he has been undercharged, possibly because of his own malfeasance, to use a quite harmless word, and if authority were  not  expressly given to the Commissioner  to  set off against an overcharge an amount by which the taxpayer may have been undercharged, the Commissioner  would not  be entitled to retain the money and make the adjustment. There is, however, a presumption that governments, through responsible departmental officials,  will  always do the right thing. That is why, sometimes, in legislation referring to the obligations of governments are less manadatory than those relating  to  private individuals, and as the Commissioner of Taxation is the head of an important agency of government, there need be no fear that he will not do the right thing. If, as has been suggested, the Commissioner does not promptly repay money which, it is said, may rightfully belong to a taxpayer it cannot be put to any improper use; it cannot be stolen; it must be placed in some trust account, which may not be interfered with by any unauthorized person. No possible harm can be done by the retention of the word &#34;may&#34; in those provisions  of  the bill where the word &#34; shall &#34; might be used. If, however, the word &#34; shall &#34; is substituted for the word &#34; may &#34; in clause 172, the taxpayer who appeals successfully against his assessment may snap his fingers at the Commissioner and evade payment of money, which, because of under assessment in other years, he may owe to the department. </para>

            <para>. -  The committee may be interested to learn what happened about twenty years ago, concerning which I exonerate every living official of the Commonwealtih or State Taxation Departments. A friend of mine prepared his income tax return, was daily assessed, and paid the amount owing. Many years later, from certain information which he received, he discovered he had been overassessed to the extent of &#163;500. That amount had been paid into a trust fund, and, of course, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan</inline> lias told us, no possible harm could come to it, although the taxpayer suffered the loss of interest on the amount overpaid for the whole of that period. The Commissioner and officials of the department must have known that he was entitled to a refund, but no action whatever was taken to do the right thing. When, however, he learned that the money was due to him, he made a claim, which was paid without demur. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> has submitted a very reasonable amendment. I am surprised that any member of the Government should attempt to defend the present practice, but I hope that the Minister in charge of the bill will adopt a more reasonable attitude. No possible harm can come to the department if in clause 172 we substitute the word &#34; shall &#34; for the word &#34; may &#34;, thus requiring the Commissioner of Taxation to refund any money overpaid. There is no justification for the Commissioner retaining money overpaid, merely because the department may, at some later and unascertained date, have a claim against the taxpayer concerned. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment. </para>

The statement that persons liable to pay income tax are always anxious to discharge the debt, is inaccurate.

The honorable senator might as well say that a storekeeper who always has trouble in collecting a debt from a customer should be compelled to make a refund in cash on goods which the customer returns while he still owes money to the storekeeper. If we use the word &#34; shall &#34; the Commissioner will be obliged to refund the amount overpaid, and incur the risk of not receiving money which will be due to him later. It ap pears that &#34;may&#39;&#39; has an entirely different meaning from &#34; shall &#34;, and a mandatory provision will limit the powers of the Commissioner to protect other taxpayers. </para>

            <para>. - I am inclined to support the views expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DuncanHughes.</inline> It has been said that the Commissioner will refund money that is overpaid, but how is the taxpayer to know that money is owing to him? The Commissioner and his officers are the only ones who know, and according to the Acting Attorney-General, the onus will be upon the Commissioner, and upon no one else to refund the money. If the clause provides clearly that the money shall be refunded, the Commissioner has no alternative but to carry out the law. I cannot agree with the Leader of the Opposition, when he says that the Commissioner is justified in withholding money due to a taxpayer, because in a subsequent year the taxpayer may owe money to the department- </para>

              <para>- I do not wish to misrepresent the honorable senator, but I understood him to say that the Commissioner was justified in withholding money over-paid until such time as the taxpayer may owe money to the Commissioner. We should not employ words in regard to the meaning of which there is doubt. It should be obligatory upon the Commissioner to refund the money due to a taxpayer, particularly as the amount paid to the Commissioner may have been obtained by way of an overdraft. I trust that the Postin  aster-Gener  al <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator A. J.

            <para>. - I appreciate the point made by the Minister that, strange as  H  may seem, some of our common English words are capable of t-AVO meanings; that &#34; may &#34;, for instance, can, in certain circumstances, mean &#34; shall &#34;. I have had experience of what government departments can do so far as demands on taxpayers are concerned. Accepting the position, however, that the departmental officers may .be right in 49 cases out of 50, they will be tempted,  mi  the fiftieth case, if they are given permissive power under this clause, to cover up a departmental mistake, particularly when the amount involved is small. The department - and I do not blame it - gets every penny it can collect; I could give two or three instances of its actions in this respect. I support the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes,</inline> with this proviso - which, I think, offers a reasonable way out of the difficulty - that to it, after the word &#34;overpaid&#34;, the following words should be added: &#34; where the taxpayer is not otherwise indebted to the Commissioner &#34;. If the taxpayer is up to date with his payments I can see no reason why it should not be made mandatory on the Commissioner to refund any tax overpaid. </para>

            <para>. -  It was suggested by the Acting Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Brennan)</inline> that overpaid tax should  be  set off against other money that may be due to the Commissioner. I emphasize that this money is, admittedly, wrongly paid, or paid by a mistake on the part of either the taxpayer or the Commissioner, and ought not to bein the hands of the Commissioner at all. It would be grossly inequitable, therefore, to set it off against any amount whatever. This is a matter in which, I suggest, we should pay attention more to uniformity and to ensuring that the law operates equally both ways, than to any other aspect. I do not speak with any hostility; long ago, I suggested the use of the word &#34; shall &#34; in this connexion, and if &#34; shall &#34; is inserted in lieu of &#34; may &#34; in this instance there will  be  no room for doubt that the Commissioner is obliged to refund the tax overpaid. </para>

          <para>The purpose of this amendment  is  to make less rigid the time limit imposed upon a taxpayer wherein he may lodge formal notice of objection. The clause as drafted confers no right upon the Commissioner to extend the time of 60 days within which he may accept notice  of  objection, no matter what the circumstances may be; he may think it fair  to  extend the time, hut is powerless to do so. While normally a period of  60  days should be ample for a taxpayer to take the steps necessary to protect his rights, in many cases, owing to special circumstances, it will prove insufficient. It must be remembered that an objection in general terms is not sufficient; the bill provides that it must be stated &#34; fully and in detail &#34;. This entails, in all but the simplest cases, reference to the taxpayer&#39;s legal advisers. If a taxpayev resides in a distant part of the country, or, perhaps,- is at the time abroad, such period is quite inadequate. The Minister refused to accept the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> on the ground that it would defeat the endeavour to achieve uniformity. My amendment would bring about uniformity, because the bill before the New South Wales Parliament, which is supposed to be uniform with this one, provides for these contingencies. Clauses  219  and  241  of the measure provide that the Commissioner may extend the time for the lodgment of an objection up to twelve months, and should he decline to meet the taxpayer in this regard, the taxpayer may then apply to the board of appeal for such extension. The need to liberalize the existing provisions is all the more necessary in view of the fact that clause  170  precludes any amendment of an assessment other than in relation to errors of calculation or of fact, if the taxpayer has not lodged an objection. In other words, no matter how grossly incorrect an interpretation of the law might have been,no alteration can be made by either the Commissioner or the court unless the taxpayer has lodged objection on the proper ground and within the stipulated time. Unless it, desires to collect  taxe3  to which it is not, legally entitled, the Government would not lose anything by accepting the amendment. I do not believe that it has any such desire, and, therefore, I hope that it will accept the amendment. </para>

            <para>.  - The provision allowing for  60  days is a liberalization of the existing act, which allows for only  42 day3.  Acceptance of the honorable senator&#39;s amendment would seriously affect uniformity and pre judice taxpayers in States other than New South Wales. In Victoria, only fourteen days are now allowed for the lodging of an objection. In the administration of taxation acts, there must be a definite time limit for the lodging of objections and appeals. If the caseis one in which the Commissioner readily agrees that an amendment should be made, it can be done under the general provisions of the act, which permit the Commissioner to amend an assessment within three  year3  in respect of questions of fact. Whatever period is fixed, the same argument could be put forward in favour of an extension. If the honorable senator is right in his remark in relation to the bill before the New South Wales Parliament, I can only say that I have no knowledge of any departure from the uniform provision agreed to at the conference. This subject was discussed at the conference in my presence, and I was clearly of the opinion that a period of  60  days had been accepted by all the States. That, I submit, is a considerable period, and as the point raised by the honorable senator can be met in a variety of other ways, I must oppose his amendment. </para>

              <para>- The Minister says that we should aim at uniformity. My amendment would make for uniformity. As the bill stands, no matter how incorrect an assessment may be, a court cannot order the Commissioner to correct it unless the taxpayer has stated the proper grounds of objection. Nor has the court any power to allow an objection to be altered. On matters of appeal&#39;, it is submitted that the court or the board of review should be left as free as possible to determine the questions at issue, and should not be bound by technicalities as to whether or not the taxpayer included certain grounds in his original objection. It might be suggested that the acceptance of the amendment would leave the way open to unscrupulous tax agents to omit to disclose the real grounds of objection until the appeal reached the court. It is not thought that great weight can be given to the suggestion, and, in any case, the court itself has a discretionary power in the matter. </para>

            <para>. - I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> not to press his amendment. Strong representations along similar lines have been made to the Treasurer both by the Chamber of Commerce and at the conference. The almost unanimous opinion of the conference of experts was that, if the request were acceded to, it would tend to destroy uniformity. The States would not be prepared to accept the proposal, in view of the variety and status of the courts which now deal with appeals. The AttorneyGenerals of the. States have agreed to accept the extension asked for as soon as an appellate tribunal has been constituted. At this stage, however, I cannot accept the amendment. </para>

            <para>. - In my secondreading speech I indicated that I proposed to move an amendment along the lines of that now before the committee. In form it is shorter than the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston.</inline> It seeks the inclusion of the words &#34; and to such other grounds as the board or court hearing the appeal gives leave to add &#34;. My object is to ensure that taxpayers, who generally are not persons learned in the law, are not debarred from placing before the board or court anything that might be said on their behalf. In my opinion, any tendency on the part of a taxpayer to add to his original objection without justification is met by the requirement that the consent of the court or the board to the addition must be obtained. Many taxpayers, particularly those in country districts, know very little about the law; they are not likely to set down their objection in other than a roughandready form in the first instance, although they may subsequently want to add certain details.. If they desire to add them, I cannot see any reason why they should not be allowed to do so. This is not a vital matter, but is simply an attempt to ensure that a taxpayer is not debarred from putting forward all that can be said on his behalf. In the event of an appeal, the average taxpayer, who is largely ignorant of the taxation laws, is confronted with a body of financial and legal experts, and, therefore, he ought to be given every opportunity to put forward the best case that he can for himself. I cannot see that by agreeing to allow him to amend his objection, we shall do any injustice to the Commissioner or to the Commonwealth. </para>
