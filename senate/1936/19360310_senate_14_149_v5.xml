        <para class="block">All honorable senators will, I feel sure, agree with me that the motion is not merely a formal expression of loyalty, because for many years  His  Majesty King Edward VIII. has impressed his personality on the peoples of the British Empire over which he is now the ruler.  His  interest in the life of the people and in the progress of the countries constituting the Commonwealth of Nations which we call the British Empire, is real. He comes to the throne at a time when there are dark clouds on the world&#39;s horizon; at a time when the governments of many countries, and especially the governments of Europe, are called upon to exercise the wisest statesmanship to avoid those calamities which seem to threaten our civilization, and we pray that God may so guide him and those who advise him, that he, like his late lamented and beloved father, may use his influence to ensure the peace of the world. We believe that that will be his earnest endeavour. </para>

          <para>. -  On behalf of the Opposition in this chamber, I second the motion. It is unnecessary to add to the words of the Leader of the Senate. We very sincerely endorse the hope expressed by him that  His  Majesty the King and his advisers will be able to steer, not only the Empire, but also the other nations involved, through the darkness which at present seems almost impenetrable. We are encouraged to believe that that may happen as a result of King Edward VIII.&#39;s personal capacity to understand the problems of his people, and his desire which on more than one occasion before his accession to the throne he openly expressed, that the various difficulties which beset the world may be overcome. The members of the Opposition heartily support the motion. </para>
