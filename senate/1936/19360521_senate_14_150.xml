          <para>.- I think that I am right in saying that the ordinary procedure adopted by a person who is about to go overseas is for him to go first to the shipping office for a steamer ticket. When he reaches the booking office he is told that a ticket cannot be issued until he produces a passport. He then proceeds to obtain a passport, whereupon he is informed that it cannot be issued unless he produces a clearance from the Commissioner of Taxation. He goes from one department to another until eventually he reaches the Commissioner of Taxation. I understand that the Commissioner has recently adopted the practice of asking some one to guarantee payment by the traveller of his income tax if it becomes due during his absence from Australia. As a general rule a traveller begins to arrange for his passport and ticket and to pay any taxes due by him during the last fortnight before he leaves Australia. He finds himself in need of a guarantor and asks a relative or friend to act in that capacity for him while he is overseas. The friend agrees to do so. I contrast this procedure with that which obtains elsewhere. In England there is no necessity for an individual to get the permission of the Commissioner to go abroad. England is only a few miles from the Continent, but so long as one&#39;s passport is in order, a traveller can visit France, Belgium, Italy and other European States whenever he pleases. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The procedure in the Commonwealth is most cumbrous, particularly in view of the fact that no one is likely to leave Australia unless he has some means, and therefore should be in a position to meet his obligations. </para>

            <para>-I am neither criticizing the general principle of the clause nor seeking to abolish it. I am endeavouring to improve the method whereby some individual, who has no personal liability in the matter, might be heavily mulct in a law&#39; suit as a result of guaranteeing a friend. The financial position of a prospective traveller is often most difficult to determine, except by the Commissioner, and a guarantor might find himself liable for a large sum of money in respect of income not previously assessed, as well as future assessments. In Australia it has always been assumed that a tax does not accrue from day to day; it becomes assessable on the 30th June. But if the Commissioner thinks fit, he can require payment from the traveller in respect of any amount which is not due before granting a certificate. No provision is made in the bill for the Commissioner to require any third party to make himself personally liable for any default on the part of the traveller. I am informed that it has been attempted to make the guarantor responsible under this clause, but that the claim was eventually dropped. The committee should make it clear that there is no obligation on anybody, except the estate of the traveller himself, to pay for any taxation liability. In order to put the matter on an equitable basis, I move - </para>

            <para>- Yes, if the applicant has a clean sheet no obstacle is placed in his way of obtaining the certificate. Secondly, the intending traveller can obtain a certificate when arrangements have been made to the satisfaction of the Commissioner for the payment of all income tax that is or may become payable by that person. I have known of cases in which trouble has  arisen  in this connexion, and it has been necessary for an intending traveller to get his bank or some financial institution to guarantee his income tax. The Commissioner has no means of ascertaining a person&#39;s financial position, unless that person is prepared to lodge securities such as Government bonds or title deeds with him. I emphasize that the arrangements are in the hands of the taxpayer himself. If some person consents to act as guarantor, surely he must accept the responsibility <inline font-style="italic">to the</inline> Commissioner for the payment of any assessment. Nobody is forced to be a guarantor. This is a matter of ordinary business between the intending traveller and the third party. While I oppose this amendment, which I consider would reduce the facilities of the intending traveller as well as increase the difficulties of the Commissioner, I want the committee to know that this matter has been discussed departmentally because of some complaints made regarding the cumbrous nature of the administration, and the difficulty experienced by some taxpayers in obtaining guarantors. The law as it stands is elastic, and there are several ways in which arrangements can be made to satisfy the Commissioner. I fail to follow the argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> that if the guarantee has been given by some individual, the liability on him should be limited to the amount of the value of the estate of the taxpayer. If the taxpayer has the assets, he can lodge transferable securities with the Commissioner. In other circumstances, the Commissioner acts on the good faith and integrity of the guarantor. He accepts the guarantee, and that is the only reason why he issues the certificate. The matter is being discussed by the Commissioners with a view to making the system less cumbersome, and obtaining a more direct method. It has not given rise to a great deal of trouble, but admittedly it has caused some irritation. </para>

            <para>- The Minister will agree that the guarantee is demanded, but in this clause there is no provision for any such guarantee; and the system may work out most inequitably, so far as the guarantor is concerned. The Minister stated that the matter is one for discussion by the various commissioners, but no State Commissioner of Taxation ever issues a certificate to a prospective traveller; it is issued by the Federal Commissioner, who cannot give a discharge in respect of any taxes which may be due to the State Commissioner. </para>

            <para>- Yes, but in the capacity of Deputy Federal Commissioner. I have travelled abroad, but I do not think that I ever had a clearance from a commissioner in respect of State tax; invariably it is issued in regard to Federal tax. The Commissioner has no right to demand this guarantee. The liability should be limited to the assets of the man who is going away ; this would prevent, in future, a guarantee from being required by prospective travellers. The Minister has admitted that there is considerable merit in my contention, because he has said that the Commissioners will give careful consideration to the matter. I ask the committee to decide it now. </para>

Some who travel from one country to another with extraordinary facility, earn &#163;50 a week, but spend &#163;55 weekly. In these circumstances the Commissioner should have power to obtain a guarantee that their income tax will be paid before they leave Australia.

        <para class="block">Duncan-Hughes be agreed to, guarantees will not be obtainable in future. At present the law provides that, if a taxpayer proposes to leave Australia before paying the income tax due by him, he can arrange for a person to guarantee payment. If the amendment be carried, and the taxpayer does not return, or the tax is not paid by the guarantor, the guarantee will be worthless. Certain persons who come to Australia to engage in boxing or wrestling contests receive very large sums of money.When they have fulfilled their engagements, and wish to leave Australia, the Taxation Department informs them that they cannot depart until they have paid the tax, or satisfied the Commissioner that it will be paid by someone else. Boxers or wrestlers are usually under engagement to some persons in Australia who may take them, say, to New Zealand; and in such eases their manager guarantees to pay the tax due by them. If such persons have no assets in Australia, what would be the value of the guarantee if the amendment were carried ? </para>

          <para>. -  This clause, which is similar to a provision in the present act, is so drastic that it should be most carefully reviewed. In the ordinary course, such a procedure is not permissible. The power given to the Commissioner to collect the tax from a person who does not owe money to the Commissioner, but who owes it to a person indebted to the Commissioner, may lead to an extraordinary state of affairs. The person who owes money to the taxpayer may also be indebted to others urgently awaiting payment, but under this provision the Commissioner can demand the payment of the whole of the money due to him regardless of the claims of other creditors. The Commissioner has the power to seize sufficient of the cash assets of such persons to satisfy his claim. </para>

          <para>. - The honorable senator recognizes, I think, that this provision only repeats the law as it has been in operation for some time. Prior to the simplification of the law which gave priority to Crown debts, the Commissioner was placed in the position of an ordinary person taking out a garnishee. If he resorted to such proceedings his garnishee took priority over all others in the field. We have substituted simpler methods, shortcircuiting what could be done by a tedious process of law. That is the basis of this provision, any rigours of which must be attributed to the law which gives priority to Crown debts. </para>

Any amount which has been paid to the Commissioner by a company under the provisions of clause 88a of the Income Tax Assessment Act J 931, or of clause 253 of this act, and which amount has been deducted from the preference dividend due to a shareholder shall, on the shareholder satisfying the Commissioner that his total net income was less in any year, in which a deduction was made, than the statutory exemption of &#163;250, be refunded by the Commissioner to the shareholder.&#34; </para>
        </quote>
        <para>Clause 253 contains a provision to which during the last three or four years I have repeatedly referred, pointing out an injustice which it inflicts on a large number of small preference shareholders. I shall recapitulate my arguments on this matter in the hope that something may be done to remove this injustice. That clause repeats a provision contained in the Act of 1931 whereby companies were given the option of deducting from dividends on preference shares a proportionate share of the amount of special property tax paid by the company. Our income tax law has always recognized that a very large number of people do not come within its purview because they are not in receipt of an income on which tax could be justly levied. Yet, under this provision, if a person has a total income of only &#163;5, and that income happens to be derived from dividends on preference shares, special property tax is deductable from it by the company. Thus a person .who is relatively poor is taxed at the highest rate. </para>

I have here two printed notices received by certain people from United Provisions Limited. One notifies a preference shareholder of a dividend of 4 per cent, on 250 preference participating shares, and forwards a cheque for &#163;9 3s.&#39; 4d., rep- resenting the dividend less 16s. 8d. for special property tax. This shareholder is not obliged to pay income tax at all, because his income does not reach the statutory minimum. Yet he has to pay this heavy property tax. </para>

As this man has an income very much in excess of the statutory minimum of &#163;250, he gets the advantage of the provision that the first &#163;250 of income is not liable to the property tax. This is an instance where a taxpayer who is better off, gets full advantage of the law, whilst another taxpayer, who is relatively poor, is penalized. </para>

            <para>- I have suggested that the Commissioner should make a refund on receiving a declaration by the shareholder that his total income for the year has not reached the amount of the statutory exemption ; but I have been told by Ministers, and by officials of the Taxation Department, that the administrative difficulties would be too great to permit of such an arrangement. I fail to see that any difficulty would arise. If, over a period of four or five years, a person had received an annual income of less than &#163;250, any amount deducted on account of the special tax oh income derived from dividends on preference shares could not fairly be said to belong to the department. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator A.</inline>J.McLACHLAN (South Australia - Postmaster-General &#91;12.5&#93; .  - On the surface, the proposed new clause appears to contain an element of justice, but I submit that it abrogates the whole of the principles underlying the taxation of the income of companies. The argument which the honorable senator has used in regard to preference shares could be applied to ordinary shares. In regard to income earned by an individual in his private capacity, he would not get the benefit which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> has proposed. Who has to bear the burden of the special tax on income derived from property? The. shareholders mustbear it, and in the long run it falls on the ordinary shareholders. The company deducts the tax, and if under the proposed new clause the preference shareholders are exempt from the payment of it, the whole of the burden will fall on the ordinary shareholders of the company, for the reason that, as preference shareholders are entitled to dividends at a fixed rate out of the profit available, the special tax on property income has to be deducted from the remaining profits before any dividend can be distributed among the ordinary shareholders. The contention has been advanced that the statutory exemption, which is the right of the individual, should be extended. The honorable senator seeks to impose on the department the burden of refunding the amount of the special tax to a particular class of persons. The proposal would benefit thousands of shareholders, and completely undermine the principles of company taxation. </para>

          <para>. -  I have not made any criticism of the arrangements made by the department to collect the tax, nor do I suggest that any company is at fault in this matter. My contention is that the law provides that poor people shall &#34;not be taxed. The statutory exemption has been fixed as high as &#163;250 a year, and the law says that any person whose income is less than that shall pay no income tax at all. Yet cases arise in which persons whose total income is much less than &#163;250 a year are compelled to pay this heavy special tax. I claim that the principle of the income tax should be recognized in every clause of this bill. But this is not done, because a person who has no income other than that received by way of dividends on preference shares is forced to meet this particularly heavy impost. </para>

            <para>- That is not the point. It is interesting to see the honorable senator supporting the big man, and showing no sympathy with the underdog. What administrative difficulty would arise if I wrote to the Commissioner of Taxation, and said that I was receiving &#163;50 a&#39; year in dividends on preference shares, and had no other income whatever? I would merely ask for a. refund of the amount paid as special property tax ? It would be only necessary for the Commissioner &#39;tfr maKe an investigation to verify my statement; and the refund could be made. </para>

We are dealing with the taxation, not of an individual, but of a company. Assume that a company has to pay ls. in the &#163;1 property tax, and that a number of the shareholders have total incomes, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> has suggested, under &#163;250 a year. It is said that the Commissioner should refund to them a certain amount of this tax. Obviously this would mean that the total company tax would not be paid as required by law, and, therefore, such a suggestion is impossible, unless the refunds were paid by. the shareholders with taxable incomes. If we agreed to the proposal submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne,</inline> the Taxation Commissioner would no longer receive the full amount of the special property tax from the company, because the non-taxable shareholders would obtain a refund of portion of it. </para>

The present act contains this provision in regard to both agents and trustees, and persons in receipt or control of money for non-residents, but it was deliberately omitted from the draft bill as being superfluous. In the House of Representatives a doubt was raised as to whether, in certain types of cases, it was not open to argument that the paragraphs would give the taxpayer some indemnity over and above the guarantees provided for in the other paragraphs of the section. The Crown Law officers are of the opinion that there is something in that view and consequently the Government decided to re-insert these paragraphs, in conformity with a promise given by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey).</inline> I think that the new paragraph will meet the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie.</inline></para>

          <para>.- I am not sure as to the meaning of the proposed new paragraph. Under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> a person in receipt or control of money for a non-resident is authorized to retain so much of it as is sufficient to pay the tax which is, or  will  become, due by the non-resident. In respect of royalties he may have to make several payments during the year to his principal overseas, and it would be unreasonable to require him to go to the Commissioner every time that he sends a remittance overseas in order to ascertain the liability of his principal. Moreover, I doubt whether the Commissioner wouldbe able to tell him the amount of that liability, because the royalties would vary from time to time. </para>

        <para>Reports were duly received from the respective commissioners, submitting proposals for the redistribution of the electoral divisions in each of the States specified, and those reports were tabled in Parliament on the 28th June, 1934. The proposals of the commissioners were subsequently adopted by Parliament in respect of the States of New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia, and, as a result, the new divisions in those States were brought into effect prior to the general elections held on the 15th September, 1934. </para>
        <para>With respect to the States of Victoria and Western Australia, however, the original proposals of the commissioners were disapproved by the House of Representatives, and, as time did not permit of fresh proposals being obtained and dealt with before the dissolution, the&#39; 1934 elections in those States necessarily had to be held on the existing boundaries. </para>
        <para>The motion agreed to by the House of Representatives on the 5th July, 1934, in relation to the original proposals submitted by the commissioners in regard to Victoria, was as follows: - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>That thi* House disapproves of the distribution of the&#39; State of Victoria as proposed by the Distribution Commission, and requests the Minister to return the same to the commission with the view of a fresh distribution being made of this State having regard to community of interests and the margin of allowance provided for in section 19 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>Sub-section 2 of section 24 of the Com&#39; monwealth Electoral Act reads -  - If. either House of the Parliament passes a resolution disapproving of any proposed distribution or negatives a motion for the approval of any. proposed distribution, the Minister may direct the distribution commissioners to propose a fresh distribution of the State into divisions. . </para>
        <para class="block">Pursuant to &#39;.the resolution of the House of Representatives, the Minister for the Interior . duly directed the commissioners  for the State of Victoria to propose a fresh distribution. Their fresh proposals for the distribution of the electoral divisions in that State are now before the Senate. </para>
        <para>The proposed redistribution involves  jio  alteration of the number of electoral divisions in Victoria, the number of members of the House of Representatives to which that State is entitled on the basis of its population as disclosed by the 1933 census, being twenty, as at present; but, as will be seen from the table furnished in the Commissioners&#39; report, a realignment of the boundaries of the divisions in that State is necessary in order to provide a more equitable basis of representation than now exists. For instance, in the metropolitan area the Division of Henty, as at present constituted, contains more than twice as many electors as are embraced in the Division of Melbourne, whilst as regards country divisions, Flinders contains over 30,000 more voters than does Ballarat, </para>
        <para>It may be remembered that the first proposals submitted by the distribution commissioners for Victoria provided for the elimination of the country division ot Corangamite and the substitution therefor of an additional metropolitan division. The fresh proposals submitted by the commissioners are less drastic, in that the existing basis of ten metropolitan and ten country divisions is preserved; and whilst the marginal difference in enrolment between the average of the metropolitan divisions and the average of the country divisions has been increased from 2,930, as provided in the first proposals, to 8,068, the numbers allotted to the several divisions under the fresh proposals are, in all cases, well within the margin permitted by the law. </para>
        <para>Honorable senators will observe that, r; is proposed to name the new division created by this redistribution &#34; Deakin &#34; in honour of the late Honorable Alfred Deakin, one of the most outstanding of the great men associated with the foundation of the Commonwealth. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> commenced his parliamentary career in the Legislative Assembly of Victoria in 1879, later holding office in that State as Solicitor-General, Commissioner for Public Works, and Chief Secretary. He took a prominent part in the federal movement, and was a member of the delegation sent to London in 1900 to secure the passage of the Constitution Bill through the Imperial Parliament. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> was a member of this Parliament from the inception of the Commonwealth until his retirement in 1913. He held office as Attorney-General in the first Commonwealth Ministry, and,  subsequently, on three occasions as Prime Minister, he guided the destinies of this country wisely and well. Several divisions in other States bear the names of notable men associated with the foundation of the Commonwealth - Parkes, Barton, Reid and Watson in New South Wales; Griffith in Queensland; and Forrest, in Western Australia - and it is thought fitting that as the opportunity now presents itself the name of Deakin should be similarly perpetuated in Victoria. </para>

          <para>I take this opportunity to reply to a question asked on the 13th May by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> in connexion with Australian publicity methods in London. At the time, I suggested to the honorable senator that this subject could be appropriately dealt with during the debate on this measure, and I promised him that I would have the matter investigated. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> asked whether I had noticed the criticism of Australian publicity methods in London, which appeared in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Labour Daily,</inline> of the 12th May, 1936. The criticism was embodied in a paragraph containing the following statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gordon</inline> Donkin, described as a well-known world traveller, to members of the Millions Club :  - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Donkin</inline>said Australia House was costing a lot of money and needed great assistance. Its influence was lessened by the fact that several States had moved from the building to offices nearer the heart of London. The displays were unsatisfactory, the windowdressing &#39;being bad, and the photos being rarely changed. A good scheme was to show films of Australia in the6,000 schools in England, he suggested. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>In regard to the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Donkin</inline> that the influence of Australia House had lessened because several States had moved to offices nearer the heart of London, it is pointed out that with the exception of the office of the AgentGeneral for South Australia, which was transferred from Australia House in 1935, the agencies-general of the States, which are not at present located in Australia House, are in its near vicinity, as are also the offices of the High Commissioners of Canada, South Africa, New Zealand and Southern Rhodesia, the furthest away from Australia House being no more distant than Trafalgar Square. Therefore, I fail to understand how <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Donkin&#39;s</inline> allegation in regard to the loss of influence of Australia House owing to the removal of the offices of several States nearer to the heart of London, can be sustained. The agenciesgeneral for Victoria and Tasmania are still accommodated at Australia House; the agencies-general for New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia are housed nearby in The Strand. The Agent-General for South Australia now has his office at British Industries House, Marble Arch, London. My knowledge of London may be becoming hazy ; but I doubt whether Marble Arch is nearer the heart of London than are the places in the vicinity of The Strand. </para>
          <para>The High Commissioner&#39;s office reports that the displays in the Exhibition Hall at Australia House and in the available windows are by no means unsatisfactory, although it is recognized that improvements could be made if more money were available for the purpose. The High Commissioner&#39;s office states, however, that more money, if provided, could be better expended in directions and places giving access to the greatest number of people, as is already done with the great bulk of trade publicity funds. </para>
          <para>With respect to the suggestion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Donkin</inline> that it would be a good scheme to show films of Australia in the 6,000 schools in England, the High Commissioner&#39;s office reports that this matter has been thoroughly explored and, having regard to all the circumstances, particularly the difficulties of the education authorities, it was considered that this avenue of publicity is best utilized by the present arrangement under which scholars are invited to attend exhibitions of films which are arranged away from the school premises, but in co-operation with the school authorities. The High Commissioner&#39;s office cites as an instance, which is by no means solitary, the fact that on the 15th May last a display of Australian films was arranged for school children at the Regent Theatre, Sheffield, which accommodates 2,000 persons. </para>

            <para>. -  I desire to refer briefly to the foreshadowed activities of the Commonwealth Government in stimulating the search for oil in Australia. It is recognized that the position is serious; a cable message in to-day&#39;s press supplied an additional reason why a stimulus should be given to the search for oil, not only in Australia, but also throughout the British Empire. In view of the threatened shortage of supplies in Sarawak, it is more than ever clear that a successful outcome of the efforts of the Government will be of incalculable advantage to the British Empire. That shortage may be of vital importance, in relation to the Singapore Naval Base and the defence of the Pacific. If Australia can supply some of the oil requirements for defence and other purposes, it will render immense assistance to the Mother country, and indeed, to the British Empire. I commend the Government for approaching this matter, with due recognition of its real importance, and to some extent overlooking the more economic features of oil production in relation to its commercial aspect in world affairs. Recently, I asked the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> a question in connexion with the value of the shale oil field at Murrurundi which, I have reason to believe, is of real importance, and in relation to which the honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thompson)</inline> and I will probably, at an early date, approach the Government. For the information of honorable senators I desire to foreshadow some of the reasons that we propose to advance to the Government in support of our contention that the field at Murrurundi which, at one time, was worked by the British Australian Oil Company, should be thoroughly explored. Perhaps I shall have the sympathy of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> in view of his remarks this morning, because my feelings in regard to my native place at Murrurundi are akin to the sentiments that he expressed about&#39; Mernda. In the Upper Hunter district there is a shale deposit known as the Teemi Field. When it was being operated, I represented my district in <inline font-style="italic">Urn</inline> legislature of New South Wales. Owing to industrial troubles and lack of capital the company, which had successfully produced commercial petrol and marketed it in Australia, was obliged to cease its activities. This property lay in the hands of the liquidator for some considerable time; but, subsequently it was purchased, I have been informed, by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. The Government should pay particular heed to that fact. Gradually the whole of the works were dismantled. A remarkable aerial tramway, which brought shale from the mine to the retorts at Murrurundi, had been constructed. It also has been removed; possibly it was not an economical proposition. The assets of the company included a large depot at Hamilton, Newcastle, where crude oil was refined; this too, has passed into the hands of new owners. To-day all of the retorts have been removed and in their place stand the containers of the Shell Company. What the arrangement was in connexion with the removal of that plant, I do not know; perhaps it is not of vital importance to my remarks. Nor am I certain of the identity of the interests which control the lease, but if it is not being properly exploited it i&#187; open to the Government of New South Wales, in co-operation with the feder.il administration, to take steps to develop the field. I urge upon the Minister ihe necessity for paying particular attention to this deposit. The answer which he gave to my question was not an adequate one, but I realize that it was supplied to him departmentally and was not of his own framing. It simply stated - </para>

          <para>Honorable senators will have noticed that this morning I obtained the discharge from the business paper of my motion in favour of the creation of an international thought exchange. I adopted that course because, under the Standing Orders, it is not competent to anticipate the discussion of a motion which appears on the business paper, and that would have precluded me from discussing it on the first reading of this bill. The discharge of the motion gives me the opportunity which I desired to deal further with this important subject. Another reason for my action was that the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has asked honorable senators to refrain from discussing the position of the League of Nations during this difficult time through which the world is passing. In anything which I may say this afternoon I do not propose to offend in that direction. The terms of my original motion indicated that, at that time, I did not desire the Government to be primarily responsible for the steps necessary to give effect to it. All I asked was that the Senate should express its opinion, which would be submitted to  His Excellency  the Governor-General for transmission to  His  Majesty&#39;s Government in Great Britain. I knew, of course, that in due time, the Senate&#39;s expression of opinion would be returned for the opinion of the Commonwealth Government as  His  Majesty&#39;s Australian advisers. But this matter is of much wider significance. It affects not only the British Empire, but the whole world, and I believe that such an expression of opinion would be welcomed by the British Government. The motion, in its original form, read - </para>

          <para class="block">At the suggestion of the Leader of the Senate I agreed to alter it to the form in which it appeared on the noticepaper this morning. The main point is that the invitation should go forward with the approval of the British Government. It is immaterial whether it should be extended to the governments of other countries through the League of Nations, or whether it should be issued in the name of  His  Majesty&#39;s Government. If, as I firmly believe, honorable senators are sincere in . their desire to forward this proposal, the cause of world peace will, undoubtedly, be advanced. As honorable senators realize; changes in world affairs of the deepest significance have taken place since I placed my motion on the notice-paper of the Senate some months ago. It is possible that the Government would, quite rightly, . have hesitated to take the action suggested in the motion in its original form ; but the real essence of the proposal is contained in paragraphs 1 and 2 which invite an expression of opinion in favour of the suggested international <inline font-style="italic">conference.</inline> I therefore intend, when Parliament reassembles after the approaching recess, to restore the motion to the notice-paper either in its original form or in some simpler language which may, perhaps, be more acceptable to the Government and honorable senators. Shorn of all trimmings, the motion which I introduced some months ago affirmed the desirability of an international conference to be attended by the educational experts of all countries, whose function would be to examine the suggested languages, and recommend the adoption of one for the interchange of thought among the peoples of the world. I am not so much interested in .he particular language to be chosen - whether it be basic English, Esperanto,  Chocktaw  or Sanscrit. My concern is that, after careful examination of the proposal, the nations should bind themselves to adopt one particular vehicle of thought for universal use. Similar proposals have already been accepted internationally, as witness the conventions relating to patents and postal administration. Standardized laws relating to these subjects are operating quite successfully, and the same results would follow the adoption of an international language if the nations would agree to have it compulsorily taught in all their schools. It would be immaterial whether or not the League of Nations  accepted t lie approved language, or whether it retained French and English for the purposes of its deliberations. The important thing to remember is that once there was agreement among all nations to use a particular language, in from ten to twenty years a considerable proportion of the world&#39;s population would be exchanging ideas in a language -understood by all when the wireless receivers were turned on, and we should then have the growth of an informed international public opinion. There would also be the development of an international literature, flowing in a common groove, all of which, I suggest, would make for world peace. </para>

              <para>- So, no doubt, is the honorable senator. My concern is that at the international conference, which I have suggested should be held, one language should be selected for universal use. I admit that English would have a strong claim for selection, because at least 500,000,000 people throughout the world speak it in some form, and already English is compulsorily taught in the schools of many foreign countries. 1 firmly believe that the adoption of my proposal would be the first step along the pathway to peace. I do not suggest, of course, that world peace is to be achieved by the waving of a magic wand. The establishment of peace among the nations must be a gradual process; but I believe that the adoption of a particular language for universal use would be a definite start. Many notable public men in other countries share this belief. Koki  Hiroto,  the new Prime Minister of Japan, declared not long ago that the greatest underlying cause of war was the misunderstanding, mistrust and suspicion existing _ between the peoples of different countries, due to the difficulty of exchanging ideas on national aspirations. I direct the attention of honorable senators to the opinion expressed by a gentleman who is competent to speak on radio development, not only in Australia, but also in other countries. I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> T. Fisk, who is recognized as one of the three greatest authorities. Marconi comes first, and either a gentleman in the United States of America or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisk</inline> is undoubtedly entitled to the second place. Whatever qualifications may be possessed by the others, one &#34;is safe in saying that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisk</inline> is one of -the greatest living authorities on radio matters.

              <para>- Exactly. Why should there be any hesitancy on the part of the authorities?  This is a matter  which  should be considered seriously by this Parliament. Recently, I had the privilege of visiting New Zealand, where I discussed the proposal with members of both political parties in the NewZealand Parliament, from whom I received gratifying assurance of sympathetic interest and support. I received such assurances, not only from the Prime Minister and his supporters, but also from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Forbes,</inline> the Leader of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coates,</inline> and others. I was offered, and availed myself of the opportunity, of a national broadcast from 2YA, Wellington. Since my return to Australia, I have received letters assuring me of sympathetic interest from the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Oppose tion. Before leaving New Zealand I was assured that a motion similar to the one I moved in the Senate would be introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> J. Lyon, a supporter of the Government, who was entrusted with moving the adoption of the addressinreply. Last week I received from the Prime Minister of New Zealand a letter stating that he would discuss the matter with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyon.</inline> A portion of that letter read - </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>As I have already indicated, you may depend upon it receiving our sympathetic consideration. </para>
          <para>Later in the day I received a cablegram from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyon,</inline> which read, &#34;Will introduce motion next week.&#34; I have since learned that the New Zealand Government feels that there may be some difficulties associated with the discussion of a motion in which the League of Nations is involved; but, quite  apart from the action which the New Zealand Parliament may take. I trust that the Senate will support the motion which I intend to move in the next session. How can we hope to eliminate the barriers of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisk</inline> speaks if we do not make a start ? Surely we are not bound by that maxim of the conservative. &#34; Nothing shall ever be done for a first time.&#34; I believe that honorable senators will not agree with the suggestion that we should not take the lead in matters affecting humanity, but must wait until we are driven to do so &#39;by public opinion. There is no reason why we should emulate Gilbert&#39;s &#34;Duke of Plazatoro,&#34;  who led his army from behind. It is an established parliamentary rule, supported by <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> and other leading authorities, that within its constitutional rights Parliament is master of its own business. In this instance I suggest that the Senate has the right, and it is its duty, to request that action be commenced in the centre of the Empire. Since moving the motion some time ago, I have been agreeably surprised at the support I have received from persons in Australia, the United States of America, Canada, and Great Britain. In one newspaper, with a very wide circulation, in the United States, over a column was devoted to the subject, and wholehearted approval given. Included in the letters which I have received is one from <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Ross,</inline> K.C., D.C.L., of Montreal, Canada, who, as some honorable senators will know, is a well-known lecturer  on economics and social questions. I acknowledge the courtesy extended to me by the Leader of the Senate in affording me this opportunity to deal further with this subject, and to withdraw the motion appearing on the notice-paper, in order to have thi? opportunity to deal with it. I am not insensible of the help I have received in this respect. The wife of Major-General <inline font-weight="bold">Sir W.</inline> H. Beech, CB., C.M.G., D.S.O., apparently the honorary secretary of an influential social movement in England, said - </para>

          <para class="block">At the invitation of numerous bodies and societies, such as the New South Wales Constitutional Association, the Legacy Clubs, the Modern Languages Association, the London Peace Society, Rotary Clubs, large churches, and at luncheon gatherings, I have submitted my proposals, and in every case enthusiastic approval has been expressed. I do not ask support merely on the grounds of friendship, but I appeal to the heads and to the hearts of honorable senators. I believe that, if action were taken in the direction I suggest, it would not be long before the trouble and turmoil through which nations of the world are- now passing would commence to diminish, and there would be a better understanding between the nations. At a luncheon given to the Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page),</inline> prior to his departure for England, he delivered a speech from the view-point of the party I represent in this chamber, in which he said that nothing is more vital to the primary &#39; producers or to the secondary producers than the relationship which exists between the peoples of the world. The depression through which we passed recently was not really local in its origin. We may devise marketing schemes for the disposal of pur dried fruits, wheat, butter, and other primary products, but such methods of dealing with trade depression are like giving a patient phenacetin - the drug allays the pain, but does not attack the root of the malady. The root cause of our economic troubles to-day oan be traced to the dislocation of world trade following the Great War, which forced every country to look selfishly to its own particular interests. We must deal with the underlying cause of our present trouble, and, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hiroto</inline> hinted, a certain way to do this is  to enable the nations of the world to understand each other better. But to-day, \vp. cannot do this, because we do not speak a common language. Let us reason out this matter and attempt to lay down a common basis of intercourse by establishing a common means of thought exchange. </para>

          <para class="block">The citrus-growers of South Australia have done everything in their power to bring about co-ordination in this industry throughout the Commonwealth. Unfortunately, they have not been successful in that direction. I feel sure that other honorable senators will recognize that it would be unfair to penalize South Australian citrus-growers, simply because growers in other States will not fall into line with them in their endeavours to establish a sound export trade. Reviewing briefly the organization of the citrusgrowers, I point out that in 1921 thu Murray Citrus Association was formed, and a year or two later a Federal Citrus Association was formed, with which was affiliated the growers&#39; associations in South Australia, Victoria, and  New  South Wales. Four years ago the New South Wales association ceased to function, the only association remaining in that State in which the citrus-growers were interested being the Federated Fruitgrowers Association, which practically controls the fruit industry in that State. The citrusgrowers of New South Wales are prepared to rejoin the ranks of the citrusgrowers generally, provided that the head-quarters of the organization i* established in that State. The other associations are not prepared to agree to this because they believe that Melbourne is more suitable and central than Sydney. </para>
          <para>It is unnecessary for me to- remind honorable senators that, in 1934, a conference, representative of the Victorian Citrus-growers Association, the Murray Citrus Association, and the Federated Fruitgrowers Association in New South Wales, decided to ask the Federal Government for a guarantee of 16s. 6d. a case on export oranges. To that proposition this Government replied that it would guarantee to the growers up to about 13s. a case. At another conference, held in 1935, it was decided to ask for a bounty; that was granted, and honorable senators will recall that, in the dying stages of last session, it was increased considerably. The citrus-growers generally appreciated that action very much. 1 point out. however, that citrus-growers in South Australia did not reap very much benefit from the grant made in 1934. Certainly neither of these proposals originated with the South Australian growers, but they sent delegates to each of the conferences concerned. In April, 1934, the Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> called a conference of citrus-growers at which he placed before delegates an expert opinion on the proposals by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lowan,</inline> an officer of the Development Branch of . the Prime Minister&#39;s Department. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lowan</inline> concluded his report, which was a lengthy one, as follows: - </para>

            <para>The <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> consumption of oranges in Australia, exceeds that of all countries except the United States of America, with which it compares very favorably, lt follows, therefore, that even assuming a wider internal distribution could be arranged, the possibility of appreciably reducing our surplus by that means would not be great. Thus large-scale export would appear to be essential if curtailment of production is to be avoided. </para>

          <para class="block">That conference adopted a resolution outlining the nucleus of an Australian association, and suggested to the Commonwealth Government the formation of a committee to deal with the export trade. That conference also elected a subcommittee to draw up a constitution with the object of placing it before this Government. I emphasize that that conference was called by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page, and that at it he was accompanied by governmental officials including <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lowan.</inline> Its resolution was implemented, and then an extraordinary situation arose. Although the conference, being representative of the Victorian, New South Wales and South Australian citrus associations, was virtually an interstate conference, and arrived at its resolution unanimously, the Federated Fruitgrowers Association of New South Wales commented on the proposals as follows : - </para>

          <para class="block">In effect, this association suggested thai the proposals should be remitted to its own State organization before anything should be done, although the New South Wales delegates were a party to the original proposals. In the circumstances, practically nothing has been done along the lines decided upon by the citrus-growers generally to foster their export trade.

The net return a case on oranges exported to England for each of the last three years was as follows: 1933, 4s. 2d. ; 1934, 3s. 9d.; 1935, 2s. 3d. The members of the South Australian Citrus Association and the Murray Citrus Association asked this Government to guarantee a return of 15s. a case of oranges in England. This price would mean a net return of 5s. a case to the Australian growers. I do not think that this is an exorbitant return. To ensure this price it will be necessary for the Government to provide a bounty or guarantee of about 3s. a case until the export trade is firmly established. The growers do not ask that this bounty bo permanent. They are prepared to levy themselves in this matter. All that they require is that the Government should assist them in this way for a period o!&#39; from three to four years until the export trade is firmly established. As an indication of the growers&#39; earnestness in thi? matter, I mention that the South Australian Citrus Association sent a representative to England to investigate thihome market, and last year the growers of that State exported 21,7 61 cases &#39; to that country. This man did  remarkably  good work, and he is now making another visit overseas on a similar mission, <inline font-style="italic">li</inline> the South Australian Citrus Association is prepared to bear the cost of pioneering the industry, surely it is deserving of some support from the Commonwealth Government.

Speaking in Tasmania recently, the Acting Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline></para>

          <para class="block">Thorby) indicated the probable formation of an Empire fruit council, which, he said, would probably allot quotas along lines similar to the procedure followed in respect of meat. Should that council be established, it would be essential for Australia to have supplies of fruit on the English market this year, in order to qualify for quotas later. The primary producers of this country expect great results from the Ottawa agreement; and, if further agreements are to be entered into, we should, beforehand, establish a trade in citrus fruits, so that when the negotiations take place, there will be some basis for representations on behalf of that industry. For that reason alone, the industry should be encouraged. In the view of the association, a market in the United Kingdom is necessary as an outlet for our surplus production. The association does not suggest that government assistance be provided indefinitely, but only in the developmental stages,&#34; in order that the industry may be established on an economic basis, and placed in an independent position. &#34;When grants were made to the States to assist the wheat-growing industry, the States were led to believe that the distribution of the money would be entirely in their hands. When this subject was before Parliament in December of last year, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> advocated that the Commonwealth should stipulate the conditions under which the money should bc distributed. We were then told distinctly that the State governments would have the right to distribute the money as they liked. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> thought that provision should be made for distribution on an acreage basis; but he also was told that the manner of distribution would be left to the States to decide. The people of South Australia were, therefore, astonished when &#39; the distribution in that State was made on an acreage basis, and especially when they were informed that that was the result of instructions from the Commonwealth Government. If it is contended that the Constitution necessitated the disbursement of the money on an acreage basis, I ask why, in previous years, grants were made on a bushelage basis? If a distribution of money on a bushelage basis was constitutional in 1934, why was it not con stitutional in 1935? In reply to a question as to the method of distribution in Victoria, I was informed that, in that State, some of the money was distributed on the basis of acreage, and the balance by means of reductions of freight and transport charges in respect of wheat sold, or delivered for storage, pending sale. I do not understand the basis of distribution in Victoria, and therefore I ask the Minister to clear this matter up. </para>

If this matter is pressed on them, I think we must face the fact that it will not be possible to have any but a neutral language adopted.

              <para>- That is so. English is, as I think we will all agree, a magnificent language. It has grown by slow degrees from a number of sources - Greek, Latin, Arabic, and others - whereas Esperanto is based on a scientific arrangement of some&#34; of the prevalent languages in Western Europe. I hold strongly the view that Esperanto is a scientifically designed and beautiful language, and has great claims for adoption as an international medium. Any person who favours the adoption of an international language, in the belief that thereby his own mother tongue will be preserved to the exclusion of all others, is, in my opinion, doomed to disappointment. With the world in its present state, I can see no possibility of any arrangement being arrived at except on the basis of a subsidiary language which is essentially neutral. Subject to that qualification, I most cordially compliment <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Abbott</inline> on having brought this matter forward. He has placed before the Senate one of those really big ideas which  should he followed up. The honor able senator can rely on any support that I can give when the matter comes before the Senate later. </para>

            <para>. - I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DuncanHughes</inline> that the difficulty associated with the adoption of a common language is that of national prejudice. Each nation has its own literature and traditions, its people love their mother tongue, and will not willingly adopt another language. Honorable senators should remember, however, that the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Abbott</inline> is for an auxiliary language - an addition to the mother tongue of the people of every nation. The adoption of an international language would not destroy the traditions of any people, because they would still be preserved in their several mother tongues. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Duncan-Hughes  expressed the opinion that any proposal to make English the accepted auxiliary language would be doomed to failure because of national prejudices in Europe, and I would add also, in the Orient; but I remind him that English is used to-day by approximately 300,000,000 people in their business communications, and is the official language of probably 500,000,000 people. One reason for the great use of English throughout the world is that it is the language of the 127,000,000 people of the United States of America, that great country which was once a British colony. The influence of Britain in India and other eastern countries, and of the United States of America in Mexico, Argentina, Chile and other American republics makes English also known .by an additional 100,000,000 people. </para>

              <para>- No; Ogden has proved that. Remarkable to relate, many countries, including Japan and various European States, are to-day adopting the idea of basic English because of its simplicity. The Society of Basic English in Great Britain has published many works, including the classics in abridged form, and books on astronomy and economics. Already a book dealing with the League of Nations has been published in which modern English is transposed into basic English. Probably a vocabulary of 60,000 words would be contained in the original work; but on opposite pages the same facts are set forth in basic English, which is limited to 850 words. Honorable senators will admit that that hardly seems possible. English has, unfortunately, become a jargon language. If we desire pure and  undefiled  English, we are obliged to go back to Bunyan, or to the <inline font-style="italic">Old</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">New Testaments.</inline> As appearing in those pages English is found in all its glory, and it tinkles along in all its simplicity, t desire that Australia should be first among the nations of the world to request the League of Nations to take action to establish an international language. The influence of radio has spread through all countries, and, to-day, there are approximately 90,000,000 wireless sets receiving messages from all parts of the earth. That is representative of modern progress; it leads one to believe that the establishment of an international language is not a remote possibility. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir George</inline> Pearce cited the American Civil War as an indication that language does not tend to preserve peace; but I remind him that history shows that 250 years ago civil, war reigned in England. To-day, however, &#34;the Yorkshireman,  the  Lancashireman  and the  Dorsetman  are distinguishable from one another only by their dialects, and even these show a tendency to disappear. Reading H. V. Morton&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">In Search of Scotland,</inline> recently, I noted that the author stated that 160 years ago the Highlander was a barbarian. That, of course, is merely his opinion. A means of intercourse to enable men of different races to converse with one another in a common language and understand one another&#39;s ideals and aspirations is the greatest incentive to them to work for the  maintenance  of peace in the world. Is not that peace worth striving for? Recently, I saw a film of the graveyards in France containing hundreds of thousands cf little wooden or concrete crosses in memory of men who were killed in thiprime of their life. Having regard to such experiences, is it not worth while to endeavour to remove the cause of war? Let us not always have counsels of despair. Humanity has infinite possibilities. To be always thinking in the past, and believing that &#39;to-day we cannot do something to solve the greatestproblem of all - the peace of the world - is a disgrace. I hope that some day the League of Nations will attempt to create an auxiliary language by which men will be able to understand one another, and make a concerted effort to usher in an era of universal peace, when man will work for man, each for each, and all for all. </para>

          <para>The population of Australia is a matter of serious concern. Six and threequarter million people hold a continent of approximately the same size as the United States of America. While Australia has not the advantages of the water-ways of the American continent, its average climatic conditions may be superior. The population of the United States of America is 127,000,000. Figures show that the computed average natural increase of population in Australia is 110,000 annually; by 1973, therefore, the population will be about 7,500,000.

              <para>- We have heard that complaint from the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> or his friends for the last 25 years-. I have no doubt that, if we examined the reported utterances of public men when Australia bad a population of only 1,000,000, we should find references to the need, first to provide employment for those already in this country &#39;before seeking additional population from overseas. The Leader of the Opposition knows very well that in Northern Queensland there is room for at least 10,000,000 people, and that no other part of Australia is so inviting to an aggressor. It is wrong for the honorable gentleman and his friends to object to migration schemes on the ground solely that there are still some unemployed people in this country. If Australia had twice its present population there would be less unemployment than there is at the present time, because then we should have a wider home market, which is the best market for our primary producers. The intense nationalism that has been displayed in other countries is contracting our overseas markets, so we must give more attention to the development of the home market.

          <para class="block">I entirely agree with that statement. Admittedly many attempts have been unsuccessful; the attempt to settle returned soldiers on the land was a colossal failure, due in many cases, not to the quality of the land, but to the unsuitability of the settlers. If inquiries were made in the farming districts of New South Wales, and in fact, in any State, it would be found that 90 per cent. of the failures are due to the unsuitability of the settlers. It was once thought that any man who settled onthe land could become a successful farmer, but experience has shown that considerable theoretical training and years of practical work are essential before a man can work his holding profitably. Some may say that that is ridiculous, but as farmers have to combine technical skill with very hard work for long hours, it will be realized how difficult it is to make a success of farming operations. We shall have to do as is suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gordon</inline> Bennett, the editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Farmer and Settler,</inline> whose scheme has been placed  before the people of New South Wales and has received substantial support. It has also been largely embodied in the scheme suggested by the select committee of the New South Wales Parliament. Our natural increase is so small that even 40 years hence the population will not exceed 8,000,000. This is astounding when we remember that we are holding a sparsely populated continent at no great distance from countries in the north occupied by peoples numbering hundreds of millions. In the matter of closer settlement, we appear to be powerless to improve the present unfortunate position. </para>

            <para>. -  I am sure that every true patriot and virile Australian is grateful to find that the Government is making a laudable effort to place the defence of Australia on a sound and self-contained basis. The stimulus given to the search for oil is opportune, even if overdue. The recent Italo-Abyssinian war should be a warning to those who prefer to neglect our defences and rely upon the good-will and assistance of another nation or group of nations in times of national emergency. As Australia is an island continent, many people pin their faith on an efficient and powerful Empire navy, which really means the Royal Navy. Support from the British navy may have been possible before the Great War, but it could not be expected to-day. In any case, why should we &#34;loaf&#34; on the Mother Country? If ever Australia is threatened, Great Britain will have sufficient troubles and responsibilities of its own. The heart of the Empire is not likely to be un covered to meet any critical situation confronting Australia, and we would have to do our best, pending the arrival of a fleet superior to that of the enemy. From whatever standpoint our strategical position is viewed, Australia must possess a strong, self-contained air force. Such a force, acting alone, would not be sufficient to prevent the hostile occupation of this continent. An efficient and highly trained mobile army working in co-operation with the other arms is essential. Amateur strategists are prone to allow their enthusiasm for the youngest branch of our defence forces to influence them unduly, and to overlook its limitations. They underrate possible opposition, and ignore the increasing improvement made for offensive and defensive operations by sea-borne fighting craft. No nation desiring to acquire this continent would rely upon its naval and air power alone. I have been unable to ascertain what the Labour party really means by &#34; adequate defence &#34;. It has been said that its policy means defence within our shores, when the situation demands - a kind of waitandsee policy. Surely the members of the Opposition do not think that an army can spring up as if by magic when ;i state of national emergency arises! The Australian Imperial Force achieved its fame after three years&#39; training and experience in the hard school of war. Under peace conditions, Australia can attain a reasonable standard of training and efficiency if given the men and material. The Government rightly realizes the necessity to establish reserve-: of modern equipment and material. A progressive programme is being followed, and, in due course, ample reserves will cither be visible or capable of fulfilment when desired. Meanwhile, what is being done to create a reserve personnel? The old Australian Imperial Force is no longer a force to be considered. In future, the militia must supply our reserves, but its strength is so weak, and its training so scrappy in consequence of this weakness that the discharged personnel cannot bc classified as dependable reserves. Each year, Parliament votes pay for 35,000 of all ranks for twelve days&#39; training, but not one-third of that number draws the full twelve days&#39; pay. Commanding officers, with the help  of mayors, aldermen and citizens&#39; committees have had &#34; drives &#34; for enlistments, and have expended money, time and energy to this end, but with heartbreaking results. Their experience has been like pouring water on stone and expecting it to produce grass. All employers are not unpatriotic. Flash uniforms and busbies will not attract young Australians. The voluntary system, which has been given a fair trial, has failed. It will never be satisfactory until the Labour party gives that system its full support, and throws its weight behind the Government. An increase of pay, especially during camp periods, will have to be provided. Is it fair to ask the man on the basic wage to give up a week&#39;s wages for a paltry 4s. a day for a six-day camp? The pay should he increased to at least 8s. a day, as it was 25 years ago. There is one phase of our defence system in which enthusiasm is not lacking or which at least responds . to a little encouragement. I refer to the rifle clubs, the members of which are potential infantrymen - the branch of the militia forces that is so much under strength. At present, there is a good deal of unrest owing to the reduction by one-half of the annual allowance of free ammunition. The Government should encourage, rather than penalize and antagonize, a body of citizens voluntarily and without pay doing something to fit them to take their place in a national army if they should ever be called upon to do so. I strongly  urge   that an amount be placed on the Estimates next year to meet the expenditure involved in restoring the 100 rounds &#62;f ammunition for each official member. It is the young men who have taken up rifle shooting as a Saturday afternoon pastime who should be encouraged ro remain in the clubs, because once their interest is lost by the withdrawal of practice ammunition they spend their Saturday afternoons in some other form of recreation. </para>

          <para class="block">There are some anomalies in the </para>
          <para class="block">Repatriation Act, and the regulation thereunder, to which I direct the attention of the Minister. For instance, a man named Brown applies for a war pension. The Medical Board is not sure if he is entitled to a pension, <inline font-style="italic">*o</inline> he goes into a repatriation hospital for observation; he may be detained there for two or three weeks, or perhaps longer. While in hospital, he receives a sustenance grant of two guineas a week under regulation 113 <inline font-style="italic">i,</inline> that being the amount of the war pension he is seeking. If he is a married man, his wife and children receive a small additional amount. Another man named Smith applies for a service pension.  His  annual income is under &#163;80 - the statutory earnings permissible for such a pension. The Medical Board is undecided in his case, so he also goes into a repatriation hospital for observation and treatment in the hope that his disability, which precludes him from regular employment,  be diagnosed and &#39;treated. He may be refused a pension. Unlike Brown, he gets no assistance for wife and children while he is in hospital. He may have had casual work for two or three days in each week, but while he is in hospital, which may be for a month, his wife and even his children have to endeavour to earn a few shillings to keep the home going. The Minister should bring this anomaly under the notice of the Minister for Repatriation. Another anomaly is instanced in the case of a man - whom we may call Robinson - who applies for a service pension on the 1st January, and whose pension is approved on the 8th May. Both he and his wife benefit as from the 1st January. Another man - say Jones - who receives an invalid pension of 18s., knowing that the service pension is greater, applies for it on the 1st January. Assuming that his application is approved on the 8th May, he would receive the pension only as from the latter date. </para>

              <para>- The invalid pension is 18s. a &#39; week, and the service pension for a. man and wife is 30s. I suggest, however, that these  cases could be brought into line without involving much additional expenditure. Such action, would be an admirable gesture on the part of the Government. </para>

            <para>. - I congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Abbott</inline> on having introduced the subject of an international thought exchange, and on his speech thereon. I promise full support of his proposal, which is designed to accomplish what I consider to be a great humanitarian ideal. </para>

          <para>I support the request made by my colleague from South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McLachlan, for assistance to citrus-growers to enable them to improve their export trade. I hope that the department will act immediately in this matter to see if something along the lines suggested can be done. Apparently the Government&#39;s unwillingness to act is due to the refusal of the citrus-growers of New South Wales to fall into line with the proposals of growers in the other States. In a Sydney shop recently I was amazed to be informed by the vendor that he had only American oranges in stock. To see what these were like I bought one; it was the worst orange I have ever tasted. Even if the growers in New South Wales persist in their attitude on this matter, I suggest that the Government would be justified in acceding to the request of the South Australian growers. </para>
          <para>In regard to the trade negotiations with Belgium, I feel sure that all honorable senators hope that a long-term agreement will soon be arranged, in order that the barley-growing industry in this country may be stabilized. South Australian growers supply 80 per cent, of the total harley produced in Australia. </para>
          <para>A matter deserving of the fullest consideration of this Government is the cost of living allowance for Commonwealth public servants resident in Canberra, particularly those on low salaries. It was stated recently by the Commonwealth Statistician that the cost of living here is now 20 per cent, higher than in any of the other capital cities. I trust that, in view of the improvement of our economic conditions, and in order that justice may be done to these people, the Government will restore this allowance. Coupled with this problem is that con fronting families in which two or three boys are approaching the age of employment. Replacing of these young people in industry iis a serious problem for parents residing in Canberra. I urge the Government to act in this matter as soon as possible. It must be obvious to all honorable senators that this problem will become more pressing as time goes on, and that if it is not dealt with quickly and effectively a serious disability will be placed on residents of the Federal Capital Territory during the next 20 or 30 years. </para>
          <para>Last year I drew attention to the unsuitableness of the workshop provided for linesmen at the Causeway. This may seem to be a matter of little consequence, but it is of the greatest interest to the men concerned. I was told by the PostmasterGeneral last year that something would be. done in the matter, and that an amount had been placed on the Estimates for improving this workshop, but we find that these men are still forced to work, in all seasons, in what is little more than a dog-box. Such conditions, I feel sure, would not be tolerated in industry. </para>
          <para>In view of our economic recovery, and the consequent increase of employment, I am very sorry that so much has been said recently in regard to the introduction of a 40-hour working week in industry. I say definitely that it would be in the interests of this country as a whole if consideration of this matter were left solely to the Arbitration Court. </para>

              <para>- We would be giving a lead if we left it. entirely to the Arbitration Court. If this Parliament is not prepared to follow that course, it would be proper for it to say clearly where it stands in the matter. I shall not go into it in detail, but to members of the Opposition and their friends, who  have been talking so much about it - and I give them credit for being genuine in their desire to improve the standard of living - I say, without hesitation, that, if they thoroughly analyse the problem, they will realize that the introduction of a 40-hour working week in industry will increase the costs of industry, while, at the same time, tending to lower the standard of living. I ask honorable senators who support such a proposal to bear in mind three or four contingent matters. Firstly, is it suggested that a 40- hour working week shall be appliedin primary industries? &#34;We can easily imagine that, if this were done, the price of milk, to name only one commodity, would rise tremendously, and that, through similar increases in respect of other commodities, the cost of living, generally, would undoubtedly rise. Furthermore, in this connexion we must bear in mind that we have to meet interest on our national debt which, to-day, is approximately &#163;1,250,000,000. Again, do honorable senators who support the 40-hour working week proposal remember that we must pay an old-age pensions bill, amounting to &#163;14,000,000 annually, and pensions to soldiers, amounting to &#163;12,000,000 annually? In considering this matter we should keep these related financial obligations in mind. I suggest that members of the Opposition should weigh these aspects carefully, and then ask themselves whether they are not leading the people they profess to be assisting to a fool&#39;s paradise. </para>

              <para>- There will always be a certain percentage of unemployables, but, in view of the improvement which is taking place in governmental finance, the time is not far distant, if Governments will push on with essential works, when this problem will be overcome. Undoubtedly, work makes more work. In this connexion, also, we should bear in mind our financial obligations in respect&#39; of our railways, both State and Commonwealth. I ask honorable senators opposite to visualize the effect of a 40-hour working week if applied to our railway employees. If  We  earnestly desire to improve our standard of living, our slogan should be : &#34; More work and more money.&#34; I suggest that, in considering industrial matters of this nature, the Government should start from the bottom and increase the real wages of those engaged in industry, in order that they may be enabled to reap the benefits from our increasing prosperity to which they are justly entitled. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Quorumformed.&#93;</inline></para>

              <para>- It is, of course, desirable that all the States should co-operate; but I see no reason why two States should not decide to organize. Every recipient of a bounty is in favour of bounties; but the mere granting of a bounty does not strengthen an industry, because it does not of itself provide for any permanent improvement. Everything that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McLachlan said to-day about what those in this industry intend to do was said when the Government first paid a bounty to them. The promises then made have not been fulfilled. We shall not get anywhere with an industry which fails to organize itself, for, in addition to governmental and financial assistance, organization within the industry is essential. The dried fruits industry has succeeded only because it has been organized. Before that <inline font-style="italic">development</inline> took place, hundreds of thousands of pounds were paid out without any permanent benefit resulting. Only when the whole industry adopted a definite policy, and became organized, thereby enabling the Government to assist it by finding markets, did progress take place. The same can be said of the dairying industry, and of others. Those engaged in the citrus industry must take notice of these things. They were warned by the Government that the bounty would not continue, and that they must organize themselves. The bounty was given merely to tide them over the period required for organization. I suggest that honorable senators, to whom representations in favour of bounties are made, should impress on those who approach them the need for organization. I shall bring the honorable senator&#39;s representations under the notice of the Acting Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thorby).</inline></para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline>McLachlan, in referring to the distribution of the wheat bounty, said that some department had stated that it would be unconstitutional to distribute the money on a bushelage basis, whereas that difficulty would not arise if distribution were made on an acreage basis. It makes a great difference who distributes the money. It is certainly not unconstitutional for the Commonwealth to distribute a bounty on any basis that it thinks fit; but the Slates are forbidden to pay bounties on primary production. It may be that that is the  explanation of the difficulty. I shall have the matter inquired into further. Section 91 of the Constitution reads - </para>

              <para>- I cannot answer that question off-hand; but I should say that the Minister would not allow one State to sprag the wheel. I remind the honorable senator, however, that Western Australia also exports oranges, and that there must be some considerable degree of uniformity. At this stage, I cannot reply to the honorable senator other than to say that the Constitution does not prevent a State from distributing a grant on an acreage basis, although there may be doubt as to its right to distribute it on a bushelage basis without the passing of a resolution by both Houses of the .Federal Parliament. &#34; </para>

          <para>I listened attentively to the interesting remarks on defence by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand,</inline> which, I am sure, the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> will study.  His  remarks as to the alleged anomalies in the Repatriation Act will be brought under the notice of the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes).</inline> I may add that, when introducing service pensions, the Government recognized that there would be a natural desire on the part of those who would become eligible for them to press for extensions which would make them equivalent to war pensions. In this matter, we must be careful, because this class of pension is different from a war pension. It may be that those who point to these so-called anomalies do not realize that their agitation would gradually cause service pensions to become equivalent to war pensions. I think that I am right in saying that the organizations representing the returned soldiers deprecate any agitation in that direction. </para>

The Government ascertained the cost of living figures, not only for Canberra, but also for hundreds of other towns. If the claim for an allowance to public servants in Canberra is based on the cost of living, and if it is agreed that all public servants are to be treated alike, there is no justification for treating public servants in Canberra differently from similar public servants in a number of other places. If there is to be an allowance to those living here, because of the cost of living being higher than in, say, Sydney, then public servants living in other parts of the Commonwealth are equally entitled to an allowance. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir GEORGE</inline>PEARCE.There are plenty of such places. I know of towns in which the cost of living is 40 per cent. higher than in the capital cities, and, moreover, where the disabilities are greater than in Canberra. I assure the honorable senator that all the factors which he has mentioned were taken into consideration when the Government decided to discontinue the Canberra allowance. That concession was given, not because of the cost of living here, but because of the decision of the Government of the day to remove the Federal Capital from Melbourne to Canberra, thereby necessitating the transfer of a. number of public servants. They had either to come to Canberra or leave the Service. At that time there was a great disparity between living conditions in Canberra and Melbourne. The allowance was limited to those public servants who were compulsorily transferred to Canberra. It was always regarded as a temporary allowance. When the initial stages associated with the transfer passed, there was no justification for treating public servants stationed at Canberra differently from similar public servants in a number of other centres of population. To restore the Canberra allowance would be, not to remove an anomaly, but to create further anomalies. </para>

          <para>It has been the practice to introduce a bill of this character, from time to time, to make a formal appropriation of &#163;10,000,000 for the payment of war pensions at the rates determined by Parliament, and no alteration of these rates is sought to be made under this measure. This is a formal measure to finable the payments to be met, as they fall due. At present approximately &#163;2,000,000 is available from the previous appropriation, but this amount will be entirely exhausted in the payment of war pensions before Parliament re-assembles after the coming recess. It is, therefore, necessary to obtain authority for the appropriation of a further amount so that payments of war pensions may be regularly met. </para>

          <para>This bill is designed to implement the forecast on this subject contained in the budget speech in September, 1935. The Treasurer then said -  &#34;As a result of further investigation into means whereby the Commonwealth can assist <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> the .problem of relieving unemployment, at has been decided, subject to satisfactory arrangements with the States, to make provision from revenue for an amount of &#163;100,000 in 1935-36, to be used in the form of contributions towards interest and sinking funds on loans for the public works of local authorities. </para>
          <para>It is known that many local governing bodies are debarred from proceeding .with public utility schemes by reason of the consequent debt service being beyond their rateable capacity. It is hoped that, as a result of consultation with the State governments, a scheme can be evolved under which, with joint help on the above lines from the Commonwealth and State governments, a number of such public utility proposals may be undertaken, with consequent amenity value to country districts as well as absorption of men who are now unemployed.&#34; </para>
          <para class="block">The measure in its present form has been drafted, following considerable correspondence and discussion with the State governments, which have signified their general agreement with its provisions. The proposal originated in an endeavour by the Commonwealth Government  still  further to assist the employment position. It has become yearly more difficult to help the States in this most important aspect of public affairs, by making capital grants to the States from loan moneys, owing to the fact that the Commonwealth Government&#39;s share of loan moneys available reduces the amount of moneys directly available to the -States for their own purposes. Capital grants by the Commonwealth to the States from loan moneys mean in reality little more than relief to the States of interest and sinking fund  charges.  It was, therefore desired to adopt some plan whereby the </para>
          <para class="block">Commonwealth could extend further effective help to the States in respect of employment along new lines. </para>
          <para>The annual grant to the States will he &#163;100,000 for a period of ten years, beginning with the present year 1935-36, and will be for the purpose of subsidising interest and sinking funds on certain of the loans raised by local public authorities for public works purposes. The other principal provisions of the present bill are - </para>

              <para>That the State governments will make contributions towards interest and sinking fund on these works to at least the same amount as- the Commonwealth grant, or a capital contribution of an amount conveying the same relative relief. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="3.">
              <para>That the States need not disburse the grants received in the year of receipt, but may pay such grants year by year into a trust fund and draw on such fund as may be necessary to meet the increasing annual subsidies, as new local works worthy of such assistance are approved and started. </para>

          <para>The bill represents a new method of providing increased employment over what it is hoped will be a wide area. Normally, local bodies outside the capital cities cannot offer such good security, and so cannot borrow on such&#39; good terms as the great metropolitan local bodies. The provisions of this bill will put selected local bodies on a considerably improved basis, and it will be possible for public works, such as water and sewerage, gas, electricity, public hospitals, &#38;c, which could not otherwise be put in hand for years ahead, to be undertaken in the near future. The bill will consequently make possible an appreciable degree of decentralization of public works expenditure, which hitherto hasbeen largely concen trated in or about the capital cities. Loans raised by local public bodies, under- the benefits of this bill, will provide an attractive field of investment, with adequate provision for meeting the service of the debt for many years. Indeed, in a. great number of cases, the whole of the life of the loans will be covered. The annual amount of &#163;100,000, provided for in the bill, will be allocated to the States on the basis of their relative populations as at the 30th June, 1935, and will be as follows :  - </para>

            <para>. - I am pleased that the Government has introduced this bill, which contains two principles to which I desire to direct attention. The first is that the Commonwealth is granting to State Governments sums of money towards the payment of interest and sinking fund contributions on necessary public works in rural districts throughout the Commonwealth. This is a principle to which every member of the Senate should subscribe. Assistance in rural development is undoubtedly a responsibility of the Commonwealth Government. My only regret is that the amount of &#163;100,000 a year for ten years is not larger. I realize, of course, that we cannot expect the Government to legislate for a longer term, but I hope that at the expiration of the ten years the principle will be continued, because it would be unfair to expect local governing bodies in country districts to incur heavy expenditure on public works on the lines indicated in this bill, if, later, the assistance were to be withdrawn. </para>

              <para>- Not necessarily. The higher male population in some States means that they make larger contributions to the Customs revenue. I approve of the principle contained in the Federal Aid Roads Act introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. S.</inline> M. Bruce when he was Prime Minister. The money made available under that act was distributed in the ratio of two-fifths according to area and three-fifths on the basis of population. I regret that the Government did not adopt that principle in this bill. I invite honorable senators to consider for a moment the vastness of this continent and the problems confronting the governments of States with large areas and small populations.Western Australia comprises one-third of Australia and has a coastline very much greater than that of any other State. South Australia, excluding the Northern Territory, which does not benefit under this bill, will receive only &#163;8,700 and Western Australia &#163;6,650. The amount to be allocated to these two States which, together, contain about one-half the area of Australia, excluding the Northern Territory, is only &#163;15,350, as against &#163;84,650 to be made available to four States in a more advanced state of development, and containing the bulk of the population. Almost the whole of the grant goes to the populous eastern States. </para>

In distributing a roads grant, areas must of course, be taken into consideration, because the area determines the length  of  roads. The large States have many more miles of roads than have States of smaller areas. The grants to be made under this measure are to be used for the payment of interest and sinking fund charges on approved State public works, such as water and sewerage schemes and electric lighting and gas services, and obviously the distribution must be on a population basis. </para>

          <para>The object of the bill is to provide a further measure of financial assistance to the States for the purpose of relieving unemployment by means of the development of forestry and the metalliferous mining industry. Under the Loan Appropriation (Unemployment Relief) Act 1934-1935 an amount of &#163;322,000 was provided for the purpose of assisting forestry, and &#163;283,750 for assisting the metalliferous mining industry in the States. The grant for forestry was made on a &#163;1 for &#163;1 basis, except in South Australia and Tasmania, and it was agreed also that not less than 20 per cent. of the money would be used for the purpose of providing employment for youths. This condition is being observed, although difficulty is being experienced in several States in finding sufficient youths for the work. Upwards of 5,000 men have found reproductive employment in the improvement of State forests generally, including regeneration, thinning and restocking, and the provision of firebreaks and access roads, as well as the eradication of noxious weeds. </para>
          <para>The grants provided by this bill are based upon the amounts originally made available following a conference held in December, 1934, when schemes were submitted by State forestry departments, and a programme was drawn up. The whole of the provision of &#163;283,750 for mining was made available to the States as a grant, subject to the condition that if any portion was used for advances a similar amount would be provided by the States for that purpose. There is evidence that some 6,000 additional men have been placed in employment, whilst the production of gold has increased considerably, notwithstanding industrial disputes in two important centres of production. I venture to say that no other expenditure to relieve unemployment has produced such good results. </para>
          <para>In respect of mining two conferences were held. At the first of these, held in December, 1934, the requirements of the States were examined and a schedule of requirements was compiled. That schedule formed the basis of assistance under the original act. At a further conference which was held in October, 1935, to review the results, the need for continuing the scheme for a further period was enunciated, and programmes were altered to cover the years 1936 and 1937. In determining the apportionment of the money to be provided under this bill for assistance to metalliferous mining, the Commonwealth was guided by the requirements set out in the amended programme, and not by the amounts originally made available. The present measure is designed to continue the assistance for forestry and mining on a diminishing scale for a further period of two years. The amounts allocated to the States are - </para>
          <para class="block">The funds made available are supplementary to amounts normally provided by the States for mining and forestry. The total amount of assistance for the relief of unemployment by these measures to be rendered up to the 30th June, 1938, will be: mining, &#163;493,750; forestry, &#163;563,500; total, &#163;1,057,250. </para>

            <para>.- Naturally, when money is being handed out to the States, especially for specific purposes - in this instance for the relief of unemployment - one does not like, to raise objections. Apparently the Commonwealth has - got the- money to spare and is merely handing it to the States, but this practice accentuates what I said last  night  concerning the undesirable dependence of the States upon the Commonwealth ; the principle of such dependence is wrong. The States should act independently in matters of this kind. Furthermore, all of the State governments levy special taxation for the relief of unemployment, and there has been no diminution of that impost, although unemployment has&#34; decreased greatly during the last two or three years. I do not raise objection to this measure, except to point out that the system it embodies is wrong. Before very long we shall have to devise means of overcoming the dependence of the States upon the Commonwealth in this way. It is a new and dangerous condition, which arose during the depression years. No doubt these grants will come as &#34;gifts from the gods &#34; to the particular States, but, I repeat, the principle underlying them is wrong and should not be perpetuated. </para>

            <para>. - Speaking solely in regard to the amounts allocated to South Australia, I ask the Leader of the Senate whether the facts concerning these allocations were not these: South Australia requested the Commonwealth to make up the amount which it proposed to devote to forestry to &#163;17,000, which was equal to the grant made for that purpose in 1934-35, and the Commonwealth replied that it could not make a grant higher than the amount at which it now stands. On the other hand, in respect of the mining industry, the State had sufficient funds to enable it to carry on for the present. That this was the attitude adopted by South &#39; Australia is clearly shown from the report, which reads - </para>

            <para>In addition, a fund was  established jointly  by the Commonwealth and States for subsidizing on a &#163;1 for &#163;1 basis the work of mining development. This latter fund is far from exhausted, and money is still available for assisting genuine developmental  opera  tions. There is no reason to doubt that funds for mining development will be available for some considerable time to come. The sum in hand will suffice to meet the requirements for a few years. </para>

          <para class="block">As- it possessed the necessary money for mining operations it was very proper for South Australia not to ask for any more. The Minister suggested that a request for  an amount for mining was not made by South Australia, perhaps because it could not use the money in that direction. South Australia was only too anxious to use any money it could secure for forestry, and it applied for an amount for this purpose greater than that allocated here. It seems to me to be a little hard that, in such circumstances, the allocation to a State could not be balanced up. Far from being open to criticism in this matter, South Australia took a very proper course in saying that it had sufficient money for mining and, therefore, would not ask the Government for any grant in that respect. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir</inline>GEORGE PEARCE  (Western Australia - Minister for External Affairs) &#91;5.28&#93;.  -  At first glance it would appear that South Australia has suffered some injustice, but I understand that, at these conferences, a certain method was adopted in respect of the distribution of the grant for mining, and a totally different method in respect of the distribution of the grant for forestry. It was decided that the amount to be given to each State for forestry should be half of what had been given for this purpose in the preceding year. South Australia, I understand, had requested less in the previous year because it had been spending a larger amount on forestry than had some of the less populous States; therefore, it did not need so much money for that activity. In respect of mining the allocations were made according to the capacity of each State to use the money usefully. South Australia&#39;s allocation this year appears to be below the proportion to, which it is entitled on a population basis, but this position arose in the way I have indicated. The States brought up their own proposals at the conferences. </para>

          <para>The provisions of this bill refer solely to the territories under the authority of theCommonwealth. By clause 2, the definition of &#34; Australia &#34; in the principal act is amended in such a way as to ensure that the act shall apply of its own force, to all the territories of the Commonwealth. This is already the case in relation to Papua, but the new definition extends the application of the act to territories governed by the Commonwealth under mandate from the League of Nations. The Commonwealth, as a signatory to the International Telecommunications Convention, has the obligation to enforce the international wireless laws wherever it governs. It is therefore desirable that it should be in a position to see that the duties involved in enforcing these laws, such as the allocation of wavelengths to avoid interference between stations of the Commonwealth and the territories, and by these stations with those of other countries, are effectively performed. No difficulty has been experienced, either in the Commonwealth or Papua, as a result of the control of wireless in that territory and in Australia proper by the Commonwealth Government. The LieutenantGovernor of Papua is consulted wherever possible, and is kept informed of all developments. The Administrator at Rabaul has requested that a similar arrangement be made for the mandated territory of New Guinea, and the extension of the application of the act to that territory will greatly facilitate the performance of the Commonwealth&#39;s obligations under the Convention. It will also make for uniformity throughout the Commonwealth and the territories under its jurisdiction in the regulations dealing with the control of wireless telegraphy. Clause 3 contains a provision which is intended to clarify the position which arose in Papua recently, when a person was prosecuted for operating wireless apparatus without a licence. The magistrate before whom the complaint was made took the view that he had no jurisdiction to hear cases in respect of offences against the Wireless Telegraphy Act. The inclusion in section 9 of the principal act of the newsub-section 3. contained in clause 3 of the bill will remove any further doubt in this connexion. Honorable senators will gather from whatI have just said  that the bill does not in any way affect the application of the act to the Commonwealth proper. </para>

            <para>. - The wording has been taken from the Wireless Telegraphy Act of 1905. There is considerable conflict of opinion as to the limits of the territorial waters of any country. Our understanding of the term has always been that it means the waters to a distance of 3 miles from the shore, but, having regard to the provisions of the Constitution, the territorial waters of the Commonwealth may extend further. A former Attorney-General, who is now Chief Justice of the High. Court, expressed an opinion on the subject some time ago, but even that opinion was not accepted by all parties. Australia has jurisdiction over the waters within the 3-mile limit at all events, and it may be that its jurisdiction extends beyond that limit. Whatever the. extent of the territorial waters of the Commonwealth may be in law, the Government desires to have jurisdiction over them in relation to wireless communications. </para>

              <para>- The Minister says that the term means at least the waters within the 3-mile limit. It meant that 35 years ago, but there have been many changes since then. The extent of the territories under the authority of the Commonwealth are ascertainable : it would be well if we knew definitely whether the territorial waters extend 3 miles or further, before agreeing to this bill. </para>

              <para>The incorporation of the provisions of the act of 1904 into the original act; </para>

          <para class="block">There are other minor matters which will be dealt with as we reach them in committee. The object of an Acts Interpretation Act is to lay down certain principles for the interpretation of words and phrases which frequently occur in statutes.  It gives a uniformity to defini tion and does something to prevent mistakes. The present law as to the interpretation of statutes is contained in two main acts - the act of 1901 and the act of 1904. Each of them has been amended on many occasions. The act of 1901 and the amendments thereto is  now  known as the act of 1901-1932, whilst the body of the law produced by the amendments to the act of 1904 act is known as the act of 1904-1934. I shall refer to the act of 1901 as the principal act and to the other as the act of 1904. The first of the four main purposes of the bill is the incorporation of the provisions of the act of 1904 into the act of 1901. The effect of that  will  be that whereas at present we have to look to at least eight or nine acts, although they are very short ones, in order to find what the Acts Interpretation Act really is, we shall, when the present bill becomes law, be able to find in the one act  all  of the provisions relating to the interpretation of acts. Under the present system of drafting, by which a codification of laws passed is kept up to date, it is unusual to find Commonwealth legislation relating to one particular subject, contained in more than one act. But prior to 1905 there was no such consolidating machinery as exists to-day, and the acts were more scattered than they have been since that date. The result is that, as both the act of 1901 and the act of 1904 were passed before the year 1905, each has, to a great extent, preserved its individuality. The relations between the act of 1901 and the act of 1904 have been not so much those of mother and daughter, so to speak, as those of sisters. The act of 1901 itself requires amendment, and the Government has taken advantage of the opportunity  to  effect the incorporation which is now before honorable senators for their consideration. Although they are going into the one act it does not mean that the provisions of the act of 1904 will become non-existent; on the contrary, with the exception of an amendment as to retrospective regulations and some minor drafting amendments making for greater clarity, the existing provisions of the act of 1904 will still remain the law of the Commonwealth. There fore, to a very large extent, the Senate is being merely asked, so far as that incorporation of the provisions of the act of 1904 into one act is concerned, to assist in the process of codification, but not to pass new laws. </para>
          <para>The second main provision is the date of the commencement of acts of Parliament. The present law is contained in section 5 of the act of 1901 - </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(">
              <para>1 ) Every act to which the royal assent is given by the Governor-General for and on behalf of the King shall come into operation on the day on which such act receives the royal assent unless the contrary intention appears insuch act. </para>

            <item label="(2)">

          <para>When the Federal Cabinet was in Perth last June, representations were made to it by members of the legal profession of that State that many times they were obliged to deal with cases in which persons were charged with offences  against  the laws, of the existence of which they had no knowledge. It is a well known principle that ignorance of the law does not excuse; but that does not cover the complaint of the legal practitioners in Western Australia. Their objection lay in the fact that copies of the laws did not have time to reach them before they were actually in operation. The Federal Cabinet recognized the force of those representations and the following provision is contained in clause 5 of this bill -  &#34;(1a.) Every act to which the Royal Assent is given by the Governor-General for and on behalf of the King on or after the first day of January, One thousand nine hundred and thirty-seven, shall come into operation on the twenty-eighth day after the day on which that act receives theRoyal Assent, unless the contrary intention appears in the act.&#34;. </para>
          <para class="block">The effect of this provision will be to postpone the operation of acts passed on and after the 1st January, 1937, for28 days; that is to say, during that period such acts will be dormant. As the result of this provision legal practitioners in distant States will have an opportunity to obtain copies of new acts, and thus acquaint themselves with their provisions before they have the effect of  law.  As it may be necessary sometimes to bring  an act into operation rather more speedily than the period of 28 days, provision is made for this contingency in the words &#34;unless the contrary intention appears in the act &#34;. The ordinary practice, however, will be that acts, which are assented to by the Governor-General, will come into operation on the 28th day after the date on which such assent is given. </para>
          <para>The third main heading is the application of the Acts Interpretation Act itself. The present law is contained in section 2 of the act of 1901 - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>This act shall apply to all acts of the Parliament, including this act, and shall be binding on the Crown. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">For many years it was considered that when the Acts Interpretation Act was amended,such amendment applied; not merely to future acts, but to all Commonwealth acts, whether passed before or after the commencement of the amendment. That may excite criticism from some honorable senators asbeing an instance of retrospective operation; but it has always been held in English law that so long as retrospective operation merely extends to procedure and matters of machinery, it does not offend against the spirit of English law. Therefore, the Acta Interpretation Acts were considered to apply , to the acts in existence, as well as to future acts. But in a recent case before the High Court, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Dixon suggested that amendments of the Acts Interpretation Act would apply only with respect to acts passed after the date of the amendment. Therefore, it is proposed to make it clear that such amendments apply to past, as well as to future acts. Sections 15a and 19a of the principal act, which were, inserted in 1930, and section 9b of the act of 1904, which was inserted in 1932, are expressly made to apply to acts whether passed before or after the commencement of those sections. Those two provisions can now be deleted, if clause 4 of this bill becomes law. Clause 4 states - </para>

          <para>The next important matter is the power to make retrospective regulations. This principle is of interest to honorable senators. It was referred to recently in the third report of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, and was discussed in this chamber only last week.  Almost all of the regulations, which are passed under the authority of an act of Parliament, are governed by section 10 of the 1904 act- </para>

          <para>But that provision has been altered by the act of 1932, under which regulations must be tabled in each House within fifteen sitting days after the making of the regulations, and may be disallowed by resolution of either House if notice of motion to disallowis given within fifteen days of the tabling of the regulations. Honorable senators may offer some criticism to the measure, but I believe that I shall have no difficulty in committee in satisfying them that whatever powers to make retrospective regulations are proposed in this bill are absolutely necessary in these days when the scope of acts of Parliament is so wide. Honorable senators will remember also that the matter of retrospective operation of regulations was dealt with in a High Court case. A wireless regulation had been made which purported to reduce, as from a past date, the payments due to certain broadcasting stations from the revenue received from licence-fees. The validity of the regulation was challenged, and the matter was litigated in the High Court. In its judgment the majority of the court decided that the relevant section of the Acts Interpretation Act did not permit of the making of retrospective regulations under acts in relation to which that section applied. The regulation, which was declared invalid by the High Court, was deemed to have commenced on the 1st November, 1927, a date much prior to the notification of the regulation in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette.</inline> Several regulations have retrospective operation; but in respect of  most of them, the time during which they were deemed to be operative has expired. I mentioned only last week a regulation relating to some payments made in London under the DriedFruits Export Control Act. The making of that regulation, I should add, was the only way in which justice could be done to the men affected by it. Later it was disallowed, but in the meantime, the obligation to the men concerned having been discharged, the regulation had no further force. </para>

              <para>-I understand that many years elapsed before it was discovered. The Government cannot, without giving rise to grave legal difficulties, make a clean sweep of all regulations having retrospective effect. They have been examined in some detail, and it has been discovered that most of them were designed originally, not to restrict the rights of citizens, but to confer benefits, and action is being taken to see that everything shall be in order in future. The bill, therefore, seeks authority, in certain circumstances, to make regulations with retrospectiveoperation if necessary. Clause 11 inserts after section 40 of the principal act, a number of headings and sections, dealing with offences and penalties, instruments and resolutions, and regulations. Proposed new section 48 reads -  (1.) Where an act confers power to make regulations, then, unless the contrary intention appears, all regulations made accordingly </para>

              <para>- That was designed to cover the position that arose in connexion with the dried-fruits regulations; but as six months has elapsed since these regulations were disallowed, the provision to which the honorable senator has referred will be eliminated from the bill. There are other minor amendments, with which I shall deal when the bill is in committee. In clause 10, there is a provision to be contained in a new sub-section of section 30 that, where an act or omission is an offence under an act of a State, or an act and an ordinance of a territory of the Commonwealth, and where the offender has been punished under any or either of those acts or ordinances, he shall not be punished twice for the same offence. </para>

          <para>I hope I have satisfied honorable senators that there is nothing very drastic in the new provisions of the bill. It is&#39; essential that some power to enact retrospective legislation should vest in the executive. Some rather extravagant fears have been expressed with reference to a number of regulations having retrospective effect, but I doubt that we could have had a better illustration of the need for such authority than was furnished to us in the regulations made underthe Dried Fruits Export Control Act. It is desired to have this limited power with such additional safeguards as may be deemed to be necessary. There is nothing in this bill to restrict the power of the Senate or of the House of Representatives to disallow regulations made under any act. </para>

        <para>The income of religious, scientific, charitable or public educational institutions is exempt from taxation under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">e.</inline> This provision is a repetition of the exemption provision in the present act. Some religious denominations provide for their own insurance risks by means of a fund governed and controlled by the denomination to which the profits, if any, from the transactions enure. It has been represented that a religious denomination which carries its own insurance risks through a company, should be accorded the same exemption as is conceded to the insurance funds of other denominations. Such a company does not come into competition with the ordinary commercial insurance companies because of the fact that its assurance business is transacted solely in connexion with church buildings and schools. A company is formed to facilitate financial and legal transactions, as well as re-insurances with other insurance trading bodies. Whatever savings are effected by the company enure to the benefit of the reserve funds, and thereby to the benefit of the various churches through rebates on premiums. In the circumstances it is considered that, asa matter of equity, such a company should be brought within the exemptions provided in the act. </para>
