As am atter of fact, I think" that upon an important matter like this, the States should have been consulted, because Part III. of the measure deals with State Advisory Councils of Science and'. Industry, and I hope that the State Premiers and Ministers in charge of those sub-Departments have not been overlooked. I would not like to think that the Minister had purposely done that. </para>

I am not going to make a second-reading speech now, but I want to say that had I been well enough to contribute to the second-reading debate, I would certainly have opposed the measure at that stage. But as it has got into Committee, I feel sure that the Minister will be acting in conformity with the sense of the Senate if he allows further time to elapse before we proceed to an analytical discussion of the clauses in Committee. I do not know whether it is competent at this stage to report progress and obtain leave to sit again, but, if so, I would respectfully suggest the adoption of that course'. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and it will be competent for any honorable senator to vote in Committee against any clause to which he objects. And, moreover, there will be a further opportunity, for those who object to the measure to vote against it at the third-reading stage. There never has been, on the part of any Minister, at any rate during late years, a desire to push through the Senate a measure for which the Chamber was not ready. On the contrary, every consideration has been given to the Senate by Ministers, and by the Senate to Ministers. I would suggest, therefore, that having passed the second reading of the Bill, we might properly proceed with the Committee stage on the understanding that consideration be postponed in respect of clauses to which honorable senators object, and regard as vital. Otherwise, we shall be in the position of having a lot of work thrown on to the Senate in the latter part of the session. I ask honorable senators to proceed with the measure on the understanding that if they wish a particular clause postponed, in anticipation, possibly of a protest from some State authorities, that clause will be postponed. This course will enable us to proceed with the business of the Senate. </para>

Part III. of this Bill deals with the establishment of State Advisory Councils of Science and Industry, and I should like to know whether the State Premiers have been officially notified by the Minister that the Bill has passed its second reading in this Chamber, and that it is now open to suggestions by them. We know that the State Premiers are busy men, and the fact that this measure has been a week before the Senate does not, in my opinion, constitute a sufficient notification to them that its provisions are now open to amendments which they may, perhaps, deem desirable. </para>

                    <para>. - No charge of discourtesy towards the State Governments can be urged against the Ministry, for the reason that, before this Bill was submitted for the consideration of the Senate, copies of it were forwarded to the State Premiers. As a matter of fact, some of the Premiers had written to us regarding the measure prior to receiving those copies. I have looked up the <inline font-style="italic">Ilansard</inline> report of the statement which I made on Thursday afternoon last, and find that it quite confirms my own impression of what then occurred. In that publication, I am reported as having said - . </para>

                    <para>. - I was one of those who was under the impression that the Minister had consented to the postponement of this Bill for a longer period than a week. I find, however, on reference to <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> that the honorable gentleman is keeping faith with the Senate. At the same time, I would point out to him that, although copies of the Bill were sent privately to the Premiers of the States on the 14th September, as late as the 23rd September, the Queensland Premier wrote stating that he had not received a copy of it. We know that the wheels of government "grind exceeding slow," even if they grind exceeding small; and it is quite on the cards that copies of this measure may have only just reached the State Premiers. I think that a reasonable opportunity should be afforded the Premiers of considering its provisions. If they ignore the communication from the Commonwealth after the lapse of a reasonable time, we shall at least have discharged our duty, and shall be at liberty to proceed with its further consideration. </para>

                        <para>- The clause is a very comprehensive one, embracing, as it does, the various parts into which the Bill is divided. The Minister in this case has almost created a precedent 'by consulting the States in matters that affect them and, personally, I am in somewhat of a quandary as to whether we ought to go on with the Bill now or not. However, I see no hurry, and the Minister would he well advised at this early stage to  allow  the Premiers another week. </para>

                <para>A Bill embodying the constitution of the Institute of Science and Industries is to be submitted to the Commonwealth Parliament early in the current session. </para>
                <para>The executive committee of the present temporary Institute, which is not representative of the States or the varied interests which will be influenced by the establishment of the permanent Institute, recommended to the Prime Minister that the absolute control of the policy and funds of the permanent Institute should be vested in three highly qualified salaried directors, of whom one should be chairman, and that their tenure of office should be fixed by the Act for a lengthened period. </para>
                <para>It has been recently announced by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gellatly</inline> that he has been appointed  chairman  of such directors, and that the status provided for the directors in the Bill was almost as strong as that of High Court Judges. </para>
                <para>No provision has been made in the direction of the policy or control of the funds in conjunction with the directors or otherwise for the representation of the States or their educational, commercial, industrial, or other varied interests which will be influenced by this important institution. </para>
                <para>I desire to bring under your notice that this State, and probably certain of the other States, do not agree with the proposals, and that it is essential that the States and the interests referred to should be adequately represented and possess some controlling influence in the councils of. the permanent Institute, if established. </para>
                <para>It has been announced that the Institute would establish bureaux of information in Sydney and Melbourne, and eventually in every capital of the Commonwealth, and that, in pursuance of the Prime Minister's scheme of trade organization, three bodies had been created to work in unison, viz. :  - The Institute of Science and Industry, the Bureau of <inline font-style="italic">Commerce</inline> and Industry, and the Federal Board of Trade. Whether all these institutions are to be constituted under the one Bill now proposed to be submitted to the Federal Parliament or under separate Bills has not been stated. </para>
                <para>The report and recommendations which were made to the Prime Minister by the executive of the temporary Advisory Council of Science and Industry, and upon which the Bill embodying the proposed constitution is based, have neither been submitted for consideration or approval to the Government or any of the institutions of this State, nor to the State advisory committees of the temporary Institute, the members of which were appointed by Order in Council to safeguard State interests. Consequently, no opportunity has been afforded for a study of the proposed constitution. </para>
                <para>The public are under the impression that such interests have been protected by their representatives on the State committees; but this is not so. </para>

                <para class="block">State authorities. When it was proposed to establish the Bureau, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gellately</inline> was appointed Director, and as the Minister in charge of the business, I gave him my "full confidence, and asked him to make a tour of the whole of .the States, and to interview members of the Government, and the leading scientific officers in each of the States. He went to New South Wales and interviewed the State Premier and other members of the Ministry, and also the leading scientific officers in the employ of that State. He visited Queensland also, and interviewed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan, Mr. Lennon,</inline> and other Queensland Ministers, the representatives of, existing scientific organizations, and the leading scientists in the employ of that State. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan,</inline> the Premier of Queensland, is naturally anxious about the destruction of the prickly pear, and he offered to the Institute of Science and Industry the experimental station established at Dulacca for the eradication of the prickly pear. That meant the transference of a big liability to the Commonwealth Government, but we are prepared to take it over, since we regard the eradication of the prickly pear as an Australian matter, and not one affecting only one. State. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gellately</inline> got into touch also with the Western Australian authorities, and they generously, gave us 25 acres of land for the purpose of establishing a forestry experimental station. The South Australian Government are cooperating with us in the same way. After all this, some honorable senators -complain that we are not acting in co-operation with the State Governments. I have received no formal acknowledgment of the receipt of this Bill from the Premier of any of the States, but I attribute that to a mutual arrangement arrived at between the Commonwealth and State Governments that, for the purpose of economy during the war, the failure to forward a formal acknowledgment of the receipt of the Bill is not to be regarded as discourteous. Apart from that, the failure would be justified at the present time, in view of the extreme waste of paper which took place under the previous practice. I ask honorable senators to be reasonable. I have made them a fair offer. If there is any clause upon which they desire to consult the Premiers of their States, I am  willing to postpone it. If we pass a clause, and it is subsequently discovered that some big question arises in connexion with it regarding the co-operation of the State authorities, I shall be willing to consider a proposal for the recommittal of that clause. I could not say anything fairer. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that the unbounded generosity of the Minister in charge of the Bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> must have astonished every honorable senator. At our last sitting, when the Bill went through the second-reading stage, the honorable senator offered an interval before it would be again considered during which the State Premiers would have an opportunity to consider it. I take full 'blame and responsibility upon myself for assuming that there would be an interval, and it has surprised me to find that, immediately we meet, this is the first Bill submitted to us. I frankly admit that I am not prepared to-day to consider its provisions in detail. I may have wrongly interpreted the statement made by the Minister, but I certainly went away last week under the impression that we should not see this Bill again for some time. The unbounded generosity of the Minister in postponing the consideration of the Bill when the postponement is represented by the interval between the last minute of the last sitting of the Senate and the first of the present sitting has carried me off my feet. In the circumstances, I object to the honorable senator claiming that he has made some sort of concession. Believing that the measure would not come up for consideration to-day, I am quite unprepared to deal with it. I venture to say that the division which took place fairly represented the opinion of honorable senators, and were it not for party considerations, it would more accurately have represented their opinion on this matter. The Minister may press the further consideration of the Bill now; but if he does, its clauses are not likely to receive the consideration they deserve. </para>

He proposes that the clauses of a Bill should first be decided, and the definitions applicable to them considered later. I can quite understand that from the point of view of the Government that is a serious proposal. If we carry the definition clause as it stands, and desire subsequently to alter later clauses, the Minister in charge of the Bill may remind us that the alteration cannot be made because we have already carried the definition clause in- a certain form. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior's</inline> proposal threatens the alteration of our whole parliamentary procedure, I must stand by the Government. But I have to admit that the honorable senator appears to be proposing the right course to follow. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like to make this matter clear. In  accordance with parliamentary procedure, for which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> must accept his share of responsibility, the  Chairman  of Committees has the power to make formal alterations in a Bill to fit what has been done by the Committee considering. Where the adoption of a clause in a particular form requires an alteration of a definition, that alteration ia generally regarded as a formal matter. If, however, the  Chairman  of Committees believes that some big question of principle or policy is affected, he will direct attention to it. No  Chairman  of Committees . would alter the principles of a Bill, but a verbal alteration to make a definition fit a clause is a common parliamentary practice. I can give honorable senators the assurance that no definition will be allowed to remain in the Bill which would be in* conflict with the principles of the measure as carried by the Committee. </para>

                    <para>. - This is really the vital clause of the Bill. I am opposed to the adoption of the measure at the present time, and it was only because I was suffering from some physical infirmity that I was not present in the' Senate to utter a. protest and cast my vote against the second reading. My attitude is not due to any lack of appreciation of scientific investigation in regard to its general value. No man with any pretension to knowledge of what education can effect can 'be blind to the value of scientific investigation, either from the educational or the practical stand-point. But continual complaint is being made by the public - and in some respects it is very well founded - 'that there is too great a tendency to impose Departments upon our Commonwealth, machinery where State Departments already exist. In almost every State there is some organization having for its objective the scientific investigation of pests  and the pursuit of investigation generally, which may have valuable bearing upon Australian industries. By this measure it is proposed to add to those State Departments a Commonwealth Department. I have read the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> upon the Bill, and am in absolute accordance with all that he said. In Australia we have States as large as several European countries, and, although we have nothing approaching the extremes of European climate, yet there are zones of clearly defined and widely varied climatic conditions throughout Australia. </para>

                <para>I do not suppose, for example, that any one scientist in Australia could, with notable success, investigate the incidence of the growth of the prickly-pear pest at one extreme of our Commonwealth, and at the same time undertake' micro-biological investigations for the alleviation of orchard pests in such a temperate 'State as Tasmania. The Queensland scientist specializes in investigations having for their object the reduction of pests peculiar to the tropic zone; and, similarly, the Tasmanian scientist devotes his attention to. matters especially affecting the cooler country in which he resides. "New South Wales is as large as the territory of France and half that of Spain combined. It has its scientific investigation bureau; and it must be remembered that a very large percentage of the population of the whole of Australia resides in New South Wales. Yet, here, it is proposed to start something which the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> stated would cost halfam'illion sterling for a beginning. I do not say that the money might not, in the long run, be well spent; but I call attention to the huge amounts we are 'being called, on to find for war purposes alone. The principle of compulsion is about to be imposed in connexion with our subscriptions to war loans. At the same time, it is sought to recklessly -spend every year, under the measure before the Committee, the equivalent of at lea3t the interest on half-a-million of money; .and it is to be in the direction of investigations now being ably pursued by State organizations. Can it be wondered at that the expense of administering the affairs of the Commonwealth increases by leaps and bounds ? If it were necessary to do something in the various States to expedite their activities, we might well say that the proposed new Federal Department would have some value; but such is not the case. If we have the money to spare, let us subsidize the existing State institutions; and, if we have not the money to do so, it logically follows that we should, not spend it at all ; and, as a fact, we have not got the money. </para>
                <para>Honorable' senators, to use an Americanism, have been to some extent." bulldozed " in regard to this measure. Many honorable senators, if they could without loss of face, would retrace their steps; and, if the measure were at the present moment in its second-reading stage, it would not be sent into Committee. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. The other day I had an opportunity of reading a production called <inline font-style="italic">The Scientific Australian.</inline> I do not say that it is devoid of merit, but within its pages will be found a very exhaustive and illustrated article on the biology of the dragon fly; as children, we knew it as the horse-stinger. At this time in the affairs of our nation and of the world, money is being spent in the review of an investigation of purely academic interest. I do not say that the article in question is not of valuable scientific interest, in a sense; but it is not valuable in the light in which we should regard matters at this time. </para>

                        <para>- The extraction of alcohol from watermelons may be a matter of general scientific interest, but what has such a subject to do with our present national position and requirements? Today, machinery is in existence in the various States, and is equal to all we require in the circumstances.

It is not as if we were intending to import geniuses from other parts of the world who might be far ahead of our Australian scientists. Nothing is to be added to our collective national ability in the way of investigation. This is merely an attempt - and one, perhaps, which cannot be derided, since it is well-intended - to duplicate machinery already in existence, and to open up one more avenue for the expenditure of money which we cannot spare, at any rate, until. the war is won. </para>

                        <para>- The object of the measure, as I have already emphasized, is to insure co-ordination amongst all the scientists in Australia in dealing with the various problems that will come  before them. Queensland is doing magnificent work in combating the tick pest and prickly pear, but unfortunately those pests spread beyond the borders of that State, and it follows therefore that, unless there be co-ordination in other States, notably Kew South Wales, any expenditure by Queensland will be a waste of money. It is this lack of co-ordination that probably has permitted the spread of these pests to a greater extent than would otherwise have been possible, thus constituting a grave danger to Australia. The right way to bring about unity of action in the various States is by means of this Commonwealth. Institute. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> said that probably State officers would be called upon to undertake work in connexion with this Institute. I hope that, if any State officer is good enough to be a leader of this Institution, he will be transferred to the Commonwealth Service, because he will then have a larger sphere of operation. </para>

                        <para>- No. Under the Bill there is power for the Governor-General, which, of course, means the Commonwealth Government, to get into touch with any of the States in regard to any problem they may be interested in. Take prickly pear and the tick pest as an illustration. Queensland, the Northern Territory, and New South Wales are equally interested in these problems. If Queensland spent  £1,000, 000  in the eradication of these pests, and if New South Wales and the Northern Territory failed to cooperate, every penny of Queensland's expenditure would be absolutely wasted. It will be the duty of the Institute to advise the Minister, who, in turn; will advise the Government that it is necessary to tackle certain problems, and, having got in touch with the States, and gathered information from all parts of the world where research work has been carried out, certain definite proposals will be made. We might say to New South Wales, for instance, that it was proposed to spend  £6,000  a year for five years on research work, with a view to eradicating a certain pest; that the Commonwealth contribution w'ould be  £3,000,  that New South Wales would be expected to provide  £2,000,  and, perhaps, Queensland  £1,000  a year. An expenditure of  £100,000  in a twelve months campaign against the tick pests in Queensland and New South Wales would be a sheer waste of money. There must be a great deal of continuous scientific research work in order satisfactorily to cope with many of these problems. The whole country will participate in the benefit following a successful campaign. Surely there is no crime in a proposal like this ? There is no desire to dissociate Commonwealth activities from those of the States; but, on the contrary, to insure scientific co-operation. If it is decided to handle the tick problem, the research work will be carried out, not in Melbourne, but in Queensland, which is the home of the tick pest and the prickly pear, the work being subsidized by the Commonwealth Government. At present there is not adequate co-operation between the States. New South Wales might have one proposal to cure the tick pest, and Queensland scientists might advise another course. Naturally both Governments would be guided by their scientific advisers, and, perhaps, neither course would prove the correct one; but we believe it will be possible by means of the Commonwealth Institute to find the solution of these problems. E ask honorable senators not to be prejudiced against the Bill, or to regard it from a party stand-point. It will be the object of the Government to co-operate with the State authorities irrespective of party views, and it is hoped to get the same co-operation from them, in order to eliminate the various pests to which I have referred, and benefit the future generations of Australia. It ia true we cannot definitely state just how we are going to do this, but we are going to try, and no people in the world ever succeeded in doing anything unless they had the courage to make the attempt. </para>

                <para>SenatorFOLL (Queensland)  [4.33].  - I intend to support the amendment for the same reason that I opposed the second reading of the Bill, namely, on the ground of unnecessary expenditure. I was afraid, when I was speaking last week, that mine would be the voice of one crying in the wilderness for economy, but I find that I was under a misapprehension, and that other honorable senators on this side of the Senate are also desirous of seeing practical economy effected  in Government administration. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> spoke of the need for coordination, and said it was necessary to do certain things in order to make Australia great. I am just as anxious as any other honorable senator to see these problems dealt with effectively, but I am opposed to the proposal, because 1 consider that an unnecessary expenditure will be involved. The Minister has stated that at present there is no co-ordination of effort between the States; but I know that there is in existence a border agreement between New South Wales and Queensland in regard to the tick pest, and that it is impossible for stock to be moved over the border without first having been dipped under proper Government supervision. That is one direction in which coordination is being practised to-day; and I fail to see why mutual action of that kind cannot be extended without the appointment of three highly-paid officials, such as is contemplated by this Bill. I am satisfied that if any State is in a position to confer a benefit upon the Commonwealth by co-operation with it, no effort will be spared by it to bring about the desired result. To suggest otherwise would be ridiculous. Matters in which the States are jointly interested are usually discussed at the Premiers'Con ferences. </para>

                <para>SenatorFOLL. - I have. I entirely fail to recognise the necessity for the creation of a new Commonwealth Department for the purpose of performing work which is already being well done by State experts. The Vice-President of the Executive Council stated that probably the directors of the Institute will be appointed from the experts in the various State Departments. That admission means, if it means anything, that the Commonwealth is to be saddled with a further expenditure in connexion with work which is already being admirably done by State experts. </para>

                        <para>- I do not dispute that. But will the honorable senator say that the State Governments are not prepared to pay equally well for the services of experts who are qualified to deal with the pests that affect our primary industries? As a matter of fact, experts have already been secured from other parts of the world to combat certain pests peculiar to Queensland, and some of these officials have rendered very admirable service. If it were possible for the Queensland Government to secure a man who was able effectually to deal either with the cane beetle or with the prickly pear pest, it would not hesitate to spend millions of pounds with that end in view. Already thousands of pounds have been offered by way of reward in this connexion. Yet we are now told that it is necessary to call into existence a new Commonwealth Department to deal with these very problems. The Vice-President of the Executive Council stated that it will be the function of the Board to purchase various appliances for the States. That means that the States will be relieved of a certain amount of expenditure. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable gentleman said that there were a lot of appliances at Dulacca which had been acquired by the Commonwealth. As those appliances were previously the property of Queensland, I presume that the Commonwealth has paid for them. I fail to see how the new Department which it is proposed to establish under this Bill, will confer any benefit upon Australia. At the present time it is quite competent for the Government to take action in any desired direction, either in conjunction with the whole of the States or otherwise. There is nothing to bar effective cooperation with a view to the eradication of recognised pests. I protest against the Bill on the ground that the expenditure proposed is unjustifiable, and I trust that the time is not far distant when the Ministry will make some attempt to practice that which they are so continually preaching, namely, economy. </para>

Senator Foll</inline> mentioned, amongst other things, that a border agreement exists between theGovernments of New South Wales and Queensland - an agreement under which all stock crossing the border has to be dipped with a view to preventing the distribution of tick throughout other States. That agreement is all very well in its way, but I would remind the honorable senator that the necessity for it was due to the inadequacy of the State efforts to deal with the tick pest. Now the opposition to the Bill proceeds from a desire to confine the operations of each State to the territory within its own borders. </para>

                        <para>- I shall deal with that phase of the matter presently. The Queensland Government, being a generous Government, had no desire to confine the tick pest to Queensland territory. They desired to spread it over the Commonwealth, and it was because of protests by the other States that the agreement to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> has referred was entered into. It is not a scientific agreement in any sense of the term. It is a purely political agreement, and one which was arrived at between the State Premiers. But the Bill which is now under consideration is intended to co-ordinate the various efforts on the part of the States- </para>

                        <para>- We shall. Every State in the Commonwealth for many 'years has been making disjointed, disconnected, spasmodic efforts to cope with pests. They go on for a certain period in a certain direction with the idea of eradicating some pest. A change of Government takes place, an economical Administration comes into power, some great economist gets up in his place in Parliament, and the money which has been put aside for the purpose is cut off, with the result that the pest has a good time of it forever afterwards. That is one of the effects of the disjointed efforts that have been made in the past so far as science is concerned. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> said money was being spent in following to its source the dragon-fly, or horse-stinger, as we have been in the habit of calling it, and he seemed to suggest that some scientist might waste his time and energy in attempting to extract sunbeams from cucumbers, and whisky from watermelons. I should not be surprised, because many scientists have a kink of some kind or other in their brain. There is no telling to what extent scientists will go, although I believe, even if successful, the attempt to extract whisky from watermelons would be unprofitable. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I have seen thousands of tons of wheat carted out from stacks in South Australia alone, and spread on the roadside, or burnt when it could be burnt/ Had the scientists been at work in connexion with that wheat, some valuable by-product might have been discovered. The wheat that has been wasted in this country during the last four years would have paid the cost of this Institute for the next ten years at the least </para>

                <para>Every State in Australia has its own little set of scientists, and each is as jealous of the other as are rival politicians. In their opinion, no good ever comes from the man over the border. That is the kind of handicap under which Australia has been labouring for many years, and this Bill is the first practical attempt to overcome these difficulties. No one can overlook the tremendous waste of money that has taken place in this country because of the lack of long, continued scientific application to the pests that have afflicted us; but there is another aspect of the question even more important. We must look to the future. Men are going up and down this country condemning Australia because it does not manufacture its own requirements " Why," they ask, " have we been dependent on Germany for the last hundred years for the bulk of our scientific requirements?" The reason is simply that we have been too parochial and too parsimonious. We have been looking at every threepenny-bit that ought to have been spent in scientific directions, while pouring out thousands of pounds in other directions where they did no good. </para>

                        <para>- W.e have been attempting to save money instead of looking for scientific outlets. After all, money is required to develop" science fu every way. We have been depending on Germany for many years. We all hope that from this moment onward we shall so develop our scientific research that we shall be able forthwith to provide for ourselves, with the aid of science, everything that Germany and other countries have been finding for us. We shall not succeed in doing so, however, if every State is left to pursue its own investigations in its own way up to a certain point, only for the scientists to find, when on the verge of making some discovery, that the money is stopped, on the ground that they have been too long in finding out what they set out to discover. This Bill, I take it, is a practical, common-sense way of linking up the scientific work of Australia, so that no Inter-State jealousies, no State parsimony or State interference, shall come in to stop the work when it is nearing completion. Let us not blab here about economy. There are many ways in which the Government can economize if they like. </para>

                <para>We must look to the future scientific development of our industries. The question of the eradication of pests, big though it may be, is comparatively small in relation to the possibilities of the future. It is high time the Federal Parliament carried a measure of this kind. It ought to have been on the statute-book years ago. The States and the Commonwealth should link up their scientific efforts so that Australia may progress and become independent of other countries for much of the goods and materials which she has hitherto drawn from them. It is necessary for our national salvation to develop our industries, and there is no greater force in the development of. the resources of any country than science. The brains, energy, and research of the scientist, if properly and intelligently applied to the problems of the future, will do more than anything else in that direction, t see no reason why the consideration of the Bill should be postponed. I see no reason why an attempt should be made to consult the States on this Bill more than on any other. The Government, in this matter, are on right lines. There may be a little opposition in the Senate, but those who are opposed to it have as much right to their attitude as I have to mine. After all, it is by honest opposition and fair criticism that we find out the imperfections of a measure. Opposition to any measure tends to improve it as it goes through Parliament. I trust the Minister will persevere with the Bill, and that it will ultimately be carried. If it is, I believe it will be of tremendous benefit to Australia. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is confusing two distinct questions. Had I been present at the time, and had I moved in the direction indicated by him on the motion, " That this Bill be now read a second time," and had that amendment been agreed to, it would have involved the disappearance of the measure from the ambit of parliamentary action. I remind the honorable senator, however, that this Bill has passed the second-reading stage, and the effect of my amendment, if carried, would not be to destroy the measure. It could still be placed upon the statute-book, but it would be a legislative enactment which, because of the exigencies of the nation, would not become operative until the lapse of a certain time after its passing. I claim, therefore, that my amendment is perfectly in order. </para>

                        <para>- As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has pointed out, the carrying of the amendment will mean the defeat of the measure. It cannot, therefore, be regarded as in any sense an amendment of the Bill. Usually when those opposed to a Bill desire to defeat it they submit to the motion, " That this Bill be now read a second time," an amendment to provide that it be read that day six months. If to postpone a Bill for six months involves its total defeat, how much more forcibly can it be contended that it will be defeated and destroyed by carrying a motion for its postponement for five years. </para>

                        <para>- The amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> is taken exception to as being out of order, because its purpose is to postpone the operation of the Bill for a period of five years. It has been pointed out that one of the means adopted for the defeat of a Bill is to submit an amendment to the motion for the second reading that it be read that day six months. It was argued by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie that if the effect of carrying such an amendment was to defeat such a Bill, how much more would the effect of carrying an amendment, postponing its operation for five years, be to defeat it. But the argument does not hold. An amendment that a Bill be read this day six months is moved to the motion, " That this Bill be now read a second time." The whole force of the motion for" the first and second readings of a Bill is in the use of the word " now." If an amendment is carried that a Bill be read a second time this day six months, the effect is to take the control of the measure out of the hands of the Minister in charge of it. Where that is done the <inline font-style="italic">Minister.</inline> drops the Bill. The Government do not go on with it six months later. They do not literally give effect to what has been resolved. This "Bill has reached the Committee stage. It has been read a second time, and its principles have been approved by the Senate by carrying the motion for the second reading. We are now in Committee upon the Bill, and it is open to honorable senators to submit amendments to modify the operation of any particular provision or of the whole of the provisions of the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maughan</inline> may describe the effect of the amendment in any terms he pleases, but the amendment is merely a proposal that the operation of the different clauses of the Bill shall be suspended for a period of five years. I am not speaking as to the merits of the amendment, but solely on the point of order. It has been quite customary for us in regard to many enactments, on the second reading, in Committee, and even on the third reading, to provide that the operation of a measure shall be suspended indefinitely. I have in mind a Bill which was discussed in this Senate for years, session after session, and also in another place. I refer to the Navigation Bill. It was passed years ago, but it has not come into operation yet, because we provided that it should come into operation " on a date to be proclaimed." The date has never yet been proclaimed. The measure is in suspension, like Mohamet's coffin. It may not be proclaimed in operation for another ten years. To provide that a Bill shall come into operation only after a certain date is not to ignore the fact that its principles, and even its details, are affirmed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap's</inline> amendment has been moved at the Committee stage, and its effect, if carried, would be that, while we should have approved of the general principles of the Bill and of its details, as they stand, or as1 they may be modified by discussion in Committee, the whole scheme would not come into operation until a definite .date. That is really the amendment now submitted to the Committee, and I contend that it is perfectly in order. It is not at all comparable with an amendment moved to the motion for the second or third reading of a Bill which has the effect of taking the control of the measure out of the hands of the Minister who has charge of it. When an amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Bill, to the effect that it be read this day six months instead of now, is carried, the Minister in charge of the measure may bring on the Bill again at the close of the six months, but in practice that is not done." </para>

                        <para>-  That is so, but it is a question of policy for the Government to decide. If the Minister in charge of the measure chooses to swallow the amendment to his motion for the second reading and bring it on again six months later, he can do so. That does not touch the effect of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap's</inline> amendment moved in Committee. We may approve generally of the principles, and it may be of the details, of the Bill, and the effect of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap's</inline> amendment would be merely that its operation would be postponed for a period of five years. It would not matter whether he suggested five years or twenty years, his amendment would still be in order. What the Government may do if it be passed is quite another matter - a matter of policy and of Government responsibility. </para>

It is fair, therefore, to describe it as a most extraordinary amendment. If to move that a Bill be read " a second time this day six months " means the shelving of that measure, how much more definitely would a Bill be shelved, and the efforts of the Government be practically stultified, if one could successfully move that a measure come into operation five years hence ? </para>

It would stultify legislation, and would take the power of governing out of the hands of the Government of the day, and would be in every way out of harmony with the Standing Orders. </para>

                        <para>- I think the matter has been sufficiently discussed. There is no doubt in my mind with respect to the question itself, and I have taken the opportunity to look up, as authority, the latest edition of <inline font-style="italic">May.</inline> In my view, it would be  a  comparative waste of time to further debate the subject. The only question is whether the amendment is or is not in order. I am not concerned as to what may be the motive of the mover of the amendment, or as to whether the action of the honorable senator is extraordinary. I have, nothing to do with what the effect of the amendment -might be. My duty is simply to decide whether the amendment is in order under our Standing Orders and according to the usual parliamentary practice. The only rules laid down in regard to an amendment, either in Committee or at the second-reading stage, are that it must possess three qualifications. First, it must be relevant; second, it must be intelligible; and, third, it must be consistent with the measure and with itself. Our Standing Orders say nothing at all contrary to that. Therefore, the question with which I am concerned is - Does the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> comply with those three qualifications? </para>

                    has stated that the more proper course would have been to take such-and-such action. With that I have nothing to do, although probably it might have been more acceptable had the action been taken in that manner. But, because
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline>
                    did not avail himself of his right to do a certain thing at a certain stage, he is not deprived of his right to take some other course at a later opportunity. After all, should an honorable senator feel that he has lost his chance of proposing a certain course of action, the Senate always has its own remedy, seeing that a Bill may be recommitted.
                </para>
                <para>There is no question in my mind but that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap's</inline> amendment is relevant. There is no question, either, but that it is intelligible; and that it is consistent is also equally clear. </para>

I am not going to be placed in a position of having it charged against me that I am opposed to scientific research and scientific education generally. I believe that no member of this Chamber values scientific research and education at a higher standard than I do. But we must remember that this 13 a Federation, and that the activities which this measure allegedly, .and probably honestly, seeks to stimulate, are already in existence, and are being applied vigorously every day of our national life. One would think that the States were jealous legislative entities, and that they were in the habit of erecting a kind of Chinese wall against the progress of scientific investigation. No assertion of the kind could be further removed from the truth.

                        <para>- The Tasmanian Government. Was that not evidence of practical co-ordination between State activities? I do not believe in being a slave to formal phrases, though I know some people can erect a phrase into a kind of fetish, but I remember also that when the Irish potato blight broke out in Tasmania the State Government sent to New Zealand for a man who had had experience of the disease there. He was brought to Tasmania, taken through the affected districts, and a3 a member of the Tasmanian Legislature I helped to vote a considerable sum of money in payment for the investigations. </para>

                        <para>- And the Commonwealth could do the same now, without creating this unnecessary machinery. That is exactly my point. The Minister knows that I am not offering factious opposition to the measure, but at the risk of repeating myself, I say again that at a time when we are resorting to compulsion to find the financial sinews of war, we should not seek to duplicate State activities or to superimpose a new Commonwealth Department on any State activities. </para>

                <para>In the underground- chambers of the Tasmanian Legislature will be found great piles of scientific communications from the Congress library, the proceedings and debates of the Smithsonian Institute, and other similar institutions. Scientific men are cosmopolitan in their correspondence. I venture to- say there is no scientist in Australia, be he never so obscure, who does not receive week by week, and month by month, a most voluminous correspondence from scientific investigators in all parts of the world. In connexion with the Queensland tick pest, one would have thought it was a comparatively late discovery, but twenty years ago, when crossing the Queensland border, 1 had evidence of the fact that there was tick" pest in that country, be cause stock had to be dipped before they were admitted into New South Wales. And we all know that our scientific knowledge with respect to the pest comes from Texas, in the United States. </para>
                <para>I freely and frankly admit that the" intention of the measure is a -laudable one, but once more I say that at the present time, when the Commonwealth taxpayers are subject to increasing taxation, and when compulsion" is being resorted to in regard to the Commonwealth's financial schemes, it is politically criminal for us to duplicate well-established State activities. It is not for me, with so many able representatives from Queensland in this Chamber, to boast of the scientific researches of the great northern State. Abundant evidence of this fact may be found . in the rewards offered to scientific investigators for satisfactory methods of eradicating Queensland tropical or sub-tropical pests. If the Commonwealth Government have money to spend, let them give assistance in this direction. If, however, they have not the money, they should not endeavour to put unnecessary legislation on our statute-book. While the machinery of the Bill may in itself be desirable and commendable, the present is not the time to put it into operation. I am not one of those who seek refuge behind the phrase, " the time is not ripe," but I do urge that the Commonwealth Parliament would render itself liable to be placed in a politically criminal light if it authorized the disbursement of this money, not along established channels, but along a new channel which will add to the expense of administration. </para>
                <para>In the Northern Territory the Commonwealth Government have under their own jurisdiction an area as large as seven American States. What are they doing with it? Has Commonwealth administration stimulated the people there to grow enough European food for themselves ? Practically everything they use is imported. Do they grow horse feed, rice, or wheat? There is a Territory which under Commonwealth jurisdiction is nothing more than a sink for money. Let economies be effected there, and some of that* money be devoted to promoting scientific investigations in the Territory. In the Capital City Territory also there is room for scientific activities for the destruction of rabbits. </para>

Variety in scientific investigation, and in research work generally, may be that versatility needed to produce the desired result. We may have three or four, or even seven or more, directors of this proposed Institute, but the Director himself may exercise a paralyzing influence on the genius of investigators in the various Departments. There is no royal road in science. It is only by studious experimentation and well-considered research that valuable results may be obtained. It would be a dangerous innovation for the Director of the Institute to say to scientific investigators, "You are proceeding on wrong lines. You must work along lines suggested by me." </para>

                <para>There is nothing valuable in the Minister's assertion that co-ordination is imperative. I repeat that the Northern Territory, which is under Commonwealth jurisdiction, is supposed to be fertile and blessed with an abundant rainfall suitable for the growth of dozens of tropical productions. The Commonwealth Government have abundant sphere for their scientific activities, and until they can show better results there they will not be justified in creating an Institute which will override existing State activities. I really believe the best way to develop our tropical territories would be to give independent representation to the people who are interested in their progress, and that scientific experiments and activities should be directed on the spot instead of from the Commonwealth Capital thou: sands of miles away. That is my prognostication in regard to Australian political and national development. In the United States of America there are dozens of scientific departments of research. </para>

                    because the views which he expresses are pretty sound. But I am astonished at his attitude towards this Bill.  His  main contention is that this is the wrong time to establish an Institute of Science and Industry because we are in the throes of war. But what have been the effects of the war? The struggle has entirely dislocated our commerce, it has cut us off almost entirely from the other side of the world, and it has shown us clearly the remarkable degree in which we are dependent upon the products of other people. Now, when we feel our need most acutely and possess the essential raw materials, why should we-deter action?

                        <para>- Exactly. <inline font-weight="bold">"Senator Bakhap</inline> has affirmed that the motive underlying this measure is a laudable one. Then, why should we not enact this legislation at a time when it is most urgently needed ? We have been told that we cannot spare the money that will be required under the Bill. But, as a matter of fact, a measure such as this will probably result in the saving of very large sums indeed. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> has already pointed out, if an Institute of Science and Industry had been in active operation a year or two ago, the Commonwealth would have saved many thousands of pounds in connexion with the ravages wrought by the mice plague. Had such an institution been in existence at that time a scientist would at once have laid hold of the damaged wheat, from which he would have extracted alcohol, which could have been used in connexion with motor traffic. It is being largely utilize! for that purpose in America to-day. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> has merely to travel through Queensland in order to discover immense quantities of timber, together with millions of tons of sawdust, which are now going to waste, and from which alcohol could be extracted. There are plenty of other materials available in Australia the utilization of which would open up new avenues for the .profitable investment of capital <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap's</inline> argument, however, is that variety is better than coordination. He might just as logically contend that an army without a general is preferable to an army with a unified command. The effect of his amendment, if carried, will be to make the Bill a dead letter. Why did he not attempt its destruction upon the motion for its second reading ? </para>

But no analogy can be instituted between the two places, because there are very few white people in the Northern Territory. There is not the variety there for which the honorable senator yearns. The Northern Territory is merely a challenge to us to solve the pressing problems that there confront us. </para>

What happened? They directed the attention of scientists to what was taking place, and the introduction of the ladybird followed, with the result that the citrus-growers were saved millions of pounds annually. Some honorable senators appear to be obsessed with the idea that it will be necessary for the scientists appointed under this measure to be permanently located in Melbourne. </para>

                    <para>.- During the course of this debate a considerable amount of light has been thrown upon the activities of the States in the direction of eradicating recognised pests and of developing scientific research. I have already pointed out how the Queensland Government have endeavoured to deal with various pests peculiar to that State, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap,</inline> in the course of his eloquent address, showed that years ago Tasmania also made an equally serious attempt to effectively combat certain pests and to promote scientific research generally. It is not correct, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> seems to imagine, that I and others are opposing the Bill because we are against scientific research. No one here is more anxious than I am to see pests eradicated, and science progress in this . country. I believe the development of science in a country stands for the development of the country itself, and insures its future prosperity. But. I shall always protest, as I am protesting now, against the duplication of offices, and against the Commonwealth Government spending money that should be spent by the States. I am against the Commonwealth taking activities away from the States when the States are discharging them satisfactorily. I have here a summary of State efforts in relation to certain questions in Queensland, and when I have quoted it, honorable senators will see that the State Governments are not simply sitting back and doing nothing, as the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> would have us believe. The State Governments are just as interested as is the Commonwealth Government in the eradication of pests. No matter which side the Government come from, it is not likely that they will let an opportunity pass of dealing with a question that affects their own State, nor are they likely to quibble over the expenditure . of a few pounds, or to be influenced by petty State jealousies when the welfare of their State is at stake. I do not believe such petty jealousies exist between the States, as one honorable senator would like us to believe. I am confident that politics in the States have not reached such a stage that one Government is jealous of the other regarding the discovery of scientific methods of dealing with a pest that affects a number of the States. State Governments would always be willing to cooperate, and New South Wales, South Australia, and Queensland, are cooperating now in regard to the eradication of the tick. The following is a summary of what has been done in Queensland in recent years in relation to the prickly pear : - </para>

                        <para>- Even if it is spreading, the experts in the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Stock are doing all they possibly can to prevent it. They are doing exactly what the Minister intimated would be done if this Board of Directors were appointed. The State Departments have made quite a number of experiments, and one was giving satisfactory results just prior to the war; but, unfortunately, the war made the_ particular commodity they were using almost unprocurable. The next paragraph should appeal to the Committee, because the Minister stated that when the new Board of Directors was established, the Government would endeavour to obtain from other parts of the world the best possible advice on the eradication of pests. </para>

                <para>I have referred to the border agreement - between the Northern Territory, South Australia, Queensland, and New South Wales, to cope with the tick.

                <quote>
                    <para>Between the years 1891 and 1899 the cattle tick spread rapidly throughout Queensland. This was caused primarily by the passage of cattle from the heavily infested districts to the principal markets and meat-works at Rockhampton, Brisbane, and Townsville. The rapid extension of the area infested was mainly due to the fact that in the early nineties it was impracticable to dip, as the majority of the runs in the unsettled districts were unfenced, and the value of cattle had depreciated to an amount only equal to the value of the hides. </para>
                    <para>Operations in controlling the pest were, therefore, practically restricted to the thickly infested districts and in the prevention of an extension to the western areas and to adjoining States. </para>
                    <para>Until the active co-operation of stock-owners was obtained, the methods employed were those of quarantine and a gradual extension of dipping operations. The calls made upon the Stock Department were very heavy, and the funds raised by assessment were inadequate to provide for the initiation of a vigorous campaign, which would have necessitated an expenditure of some hundreds of thousands of pounds. </para>
                    <para>A vigorous campaign is now being waged against the_ tick menace, and the stock-owners in closely settled Southern districts are co-operating with the Department in carrying out cleansing operations in areas adjoining territory not infested. The Warwick area is now considered free from ticks, and other districts embraced in the scheme have been materially cleansed. </para>

                    <para>. -  It seems to me that when introducing this Bill, the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> failed to remove a great stumbling- block in the way of its progress. A number of honorable senators seem to be convinced that one result of the measure, if passed, will be to duplicate the work now being done by different State authorities, and consequently to duplicate the expense of that work. If that is so, the Bill should not be further considered. If, on the other hand, the Minister can make it quite clear that the work and expense now undertaken by the State authorities will not be duplicated by the Commonwealth Government, and that the effect will be to bring the different bodies of scientific men employed in the States into cooperation with a central body established by the Commonwealth, he may look for some progress with the measure. It is inevitable that a central establishment must be set up if the Commonwealth is to take this matter in hand. That must involve the establishment of a highly-trained and highly -paid central committee; and before honorable senators pass this Bill, it is essential that the Minister should make it perfectly clear that it will not mean a mere duplication of efforts now being put forward by the State Governments. "We were assured years ago that if we only had Federation, the cost of government in Australia would be greatly reduced. Many people thought that the abolition of State Governors and State Parliaments would follow Federation almost immediately, and that consequently the cost of government after Federation would be merely nominal compared to what it was before. But nothing of the kind has happened. We have no assurance that if this measure is passed the work now being done by the State Governments in this direction will be discontinued. On the contrary, we have good reason to believe that it will be continued independently of the Commonwealth Government, as it is at present. </para>
