                        <para>- Has the Minister  for Defence been informed that yesterday Lieutenant Wills, when the <inline font-style="italic">Loongana</inline> was about to leave Launceston, refused permission to the two highest dignitaries of the Catholic Church in Tasmania, Archbishop Delaney and Monsignor Beechinor, to accompany the Catholic Apostolic Delegate on to the wharf, notwithstanding that a pass for that purpose had been issued to them either by an officer of the Union Steam-ship Company or by the Naval Officer? Was the refusal  in  accordance with the usual custom, and, if it is not usual to refuse to those who have received passes permission to go on to a wharf, will the Minister have the officer responsible suspended until the matter has been inquired into? </para>

It must be remembered, however, that the circumstances of New Zealand differ from those of the Commonwealth. In the Dominion, an importing country, the realization of a comparatively high price can be insured by the regulation of local prices. It is impossible, however, to regulate the price which oversea buyers will pay for Australian wheat, more than two-thirds of which is exported. The object of the New Zealand Government, no doubt, is to insure a sufficient local supply. </para>

                    <para>. - A Supply Bill is one of the most important measures that can come before the Senate,but apparently the Government are determined to push this measure through the Senate in the next few hours. There was nothing at all to prevent the Government taking whatever steps they deemed necessary in order that senators might have a full and ample opportunity of discussing every item in the Bill. I hope this is the last occasion on which the Government will ask the Senate to rush through a Supply Bill for such a large amount in the course of a few hours. </para>

                        <para>. - In the absence of the Leader of the Opposition, who is engaged in other business connected with the welfare of the Commonwealth, and which I hope will be successful, I do not propose to say much on this measure. It is readily agreed by all parties that in this hour of the nation's danger there should be harmony in the community, and it is with a view to promoting such harmony that I propose to point out instances in which the Government are responsible for creating disputes when they ought to be healing all divisions in public opinion. The Government are setting man against man and union against union. But if they wish to bring about the unity of all classes of the community for the sake of recruiting, they must set an example to private employers. Lately they have been guilty of what I regard as one of the most dastardly acts that any Government or employer could be guilty of. I refer to the dismissal from Cockatoo Dock of a number of men who had refused to sign a certain agreement. There may be reasons for requesting men to sign that document, and there may be good reasons in the opinion of the men for not signing it, but this is not the time when the Government should be holding a pistol at the head of the workers and saying, " Sign this document or leave our employment." Men who have given good service to the Commonwealth, and earlier to the State Government, are being compelled to leave Cockatoo Dock, where they have been employed for almost a life- time, because they decline to sign an agreement which is obnoxious to them. Those men comprise not only followers of the party to which I belong, but also supporters of the National party, men who quarrelled with their fellow-employees in order to stand by the Government on the conscription issue. It is scandalous that  we should find the Commonwealth Government using the heavy hand of tyranny at this stage in the nation's history. Personally, I would rather do anything than sign such an agreement. Instead of forcing upon men an action that is objectionable to them, we should be trying to get the people together in a solid body to resist the common enemy. Ever since the present Government have been in office they have shown a desire to do something to injure the unionists of Australia, particularly in connexion with the shipbuilding industry, of which I have an intimate knowledge. Men have done almost everything possible, short of the grovelling that is necessary in some countries to-day, to fall into line with the wishes of the Government. Some of them have given up the principles of a life-time in order to try to assist the Government in the hour of need. Now they are dismissed. Thank God, there are private employers who will not draw such distinctions, and those who have been dismissed will obtain employment. But that fact does not excuse the tyrannical action of the Government. I have read in the press that fourteen turners, thirteen fitters, and one pattern-maker lately employed at Cockatoo Dock have been dismissed, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> Salter, manager of the dockyard, is reported to have said that fourteen of the men who had been put off in accordance with the instructions of the Prime Minister were old hands. I guarantee that the manager was sorry to dismiss those old hands, who had held responsible positions, not only in the unions, but also in social and political life. I take this opportunity of entering my protest against the injustice done by the Government,and I hope that the time will come soon when we shall be able to turn the tables on them. </para>

                    <para>Another matter to which I wish to refer is the administration of the German concentration camp in New South Wales. Some time ago I informed the Minister privately of some irregularities which I thought were occurring there. Rumours of grave irregularities are current, of which I know nothing, but I shall mention one case, with the particulars of which I am acquainted. I told the Minister that I had written to the State Commandant in regard to the liberation of a certain German internee in order that he might attend race meetings and other gatherings. I received a rather sharp reply from the Commandant, who practically said I did not know what I was talking about, because there was no man of that name interned in the camp. I had made a mistake in the spelling of a foreign name, and, when I discovered that, I told the Minister that I proposed to take further action. Evidently he communicated with the Commandant, because I received a letter from the latter to the effect that this internee was liberated because he suffered from locomotor ataxia. Despite what the doctors say, his ailment is very slight. He can get about the streets and follow his business as a commission agent. That does not look as if he had much locomotor ataxia. Will the Minister make inquiries into the management of the German Concentration Camp, and see that these unfair proceedings are terminated ? A searching inquiry is necessary. With reference to this internee, a paragraph appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of 18th March to the effect that a German named Herman Hey man - I spelt it Hayman, and his first name in full, and yet the State Commandant said there was nobody there of that name - was sentenced by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Love,</inline> Stipendiary Magistrate, to six months' imprisonment at the Water Police Court, Sydney, on a charge of having, at Sydney, on 5th February - falsely pretended to George Weil and that he  had £300  worth of chemicals at  the  German Concentration Camp,  and,  being a friend of Colonel Holman,  who  knew they  were  there, he would be able to remove them, and  that  he  had  arranged for their disposal,  by  means of which he obtained £6. </para>
                    <para>A  further sentence of three months' imprisonment, to  be  cumulative, was passed upon the accused on a charge of endeavouring  to  impose upon Ernest Victor Finckh,  by  falsely representing that if Finckh gave him  £3 5s. he  would " square " the guard  at  the German  Concentration  Camp, and get away with  15  ozs.  of  cocaine belonging  to  a German internee. </para>
                    <para>That is the man who was walking about the streets of Sydney, a full-blooded German, who would sneer at me, an Australian, and tell others that he had me beaten. He is under lock and key, but he makes a charge against Colonel Holman at that Camp that should be investigated. </para>

                    <para>Some time ago I had occasion to refer to the distress in Sydney amongst the dependants of returned soldiers. Somebody on the other side said at the time that I ought to be ashamed to bring such cases forward here. This is the only opportunity I and others like me have of ventilating these cases publicly. The Minister demanded that I should give him cases, and I did.  His  version of those cases was published in the papers, but my version was refused publication. This is the only opportunity I have of explaining my attitude. I took action because statements were published in the Sydney press that the dependants of soldiers were in want. I am sorry to have to say anything about this now, because I have read the repatriation regulations, and believe that these people will be better looked after in the future, but I have to defend myself. I brought certain cases forward as they were published in the press, and had to go back to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pontey,</inline> the honorary organizer of the Fruit and Vegetable Fund for Fighters' Families, for an explanation of them.

                        <para>The reports supplied by the Department are apparently prepared by the Lord Mayor's Patriotic Fund, who are the people mainly to blame for the whole matter. Firstly, because they failed to provide relief for special distress amongst the soldiers' dependants since August, 1917, and secondly, because they endeavoured, through the War Council, to prevent other people obtaining and dispensing the necessary help. It is beside the point for the Lord Mayor's Fund to quote the amount of relief which has been given to these women since the inception of the fund in 1914. It is admitted that grants of money were made to many soldiers' dependants for special distress prior to August, 1917. The point is, What has been done since August, 1917? As far as I can see, nothing, or practically nothing. The families only received a matter of a few shillings per week, and many of them received this before August, 1917. Then, again, the basis of this weekly dole is absurd on the face of it, for the reason that the women with seven children only receive the same weekly payment from the Lord Mayor's Fund as the women with only two children. As far as I can see, from the reports furnished, there has been no attempt to deal with the real question at issue, so far as I am concerned, which is, that there has been since August, 1917, a deal of distress amongst active service soldiers' wives, which the Lord Mayor's Fund has not only refused to relieve, but has endeavoured to prevent other people relieving. I have never said one word about the amount of relief granted to the families prior to August, 1917, and if a public inquiry takes place, I will undertake to prove my statements that there has been a deal of distress since August, 1917, right up to the hilt. In my opinion, it is a serious bar to recruiting to allow these grievances to continue as they are. </para>

                        <para>This is the case in which a Court ejectment order was made for rent totalling £2 2s. She had got into arrears through having to undergo an operation, and when she received the notice to quit on the 3rd December, 1917, she applied personally to the Lord Mayor's Fund for assistance to meet it, and was told her case would receive consideration. When she received the summons for ejectment on the 12th December, 1917, she called again at the Lord Mayor's Fund, and was told that it had not been possible to get the Committee together to deal with her case. (They managed to get' the Committee together, however, to vote ,£100 to be wasted in buying toys, a number of which went to children who had no one at the war.) Finally, when the fortnight allowed by the Court ejectment order had expired, the Lord Mayor's Fund wrote and said nothing further could be done for h'er. Furthermore, when this case was investigated by the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> at the beginning of February, 1918, the Lord Mayor's Fund people  stated  they knew nothing of the circumstances, and that they had not been applied to for assistance. This is a plain misstatement of fact, because I have their letter of refusal, clearing showing there must have been an application for assistance, or there would have been no need for the letter of refusal. It would appear that other people are open to charges of misrepresentation. There has never been an explanation of why this woman's appeal for assistance, to the extent of £2 2s., to save herself and children being put out in the street, was refused by the Lord Mayor's Fund. </para>

                    <para class="block">Every ease is inquired into fully by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pontey,</inline> but I shall not occupy time by reading all the information that I have at my disposal. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Pontey  is not a supporter of Labour; indeed he has been its consistent opponent, but he is a reputable citizen, and has lost business by his efforts in the establishment of a fruit and vegetable fund for the unfortunate wives and children of soldiers who have been neglected by the Government which sent them overseas to fight. Those who went away were promised that conditions would not be altered, but they have been altered, and it is the duty of the Government to put things right, and to restore harmony. Until that is done, recruiting must suffer. When it has been done, we shall get all the recruiting we want. I advise the Government to give an honorary commission to every man in this Parliament under the age of fifty years, so that he may go out and do what Captain Carmichael is doing. There are in this Parliament and in the Public Service many men under the fighting age who have not done anything like that, al ienator <inline font-style="italic">McDougall.</inline> though the obligation is not upon one, but upon all in the community. Every man- no matter what his age - should offer his services. When this has been done, we shall get more sympathy from the class that I represent. But while the victimization and oppression of men continues, so that children have to seek their bread in the dust-bins in the streets, we cannot expect the assistance that we desire. I assure honorable senators that it is, unfortunately, only too true that many families have to send to the markets for stale fruit and vegetables, which they use, cutting away the bad parts. Yet the men are told that if they do not volunteer they are -disloyal. There is no disloyalty in the ranks of Labour. But those who will not remedy the state of things about which I complain are doing the work of the Hun. I say: Go into the back ways of the city, and make things right there., Let men get back to their employments, so that they may earn their living. When you have done that you can ask for the sympathy of the class to which I belong, and will have assistance for the Empire in time of need. It is said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pontey,</inline> who has ruined his own business by his philanthropy, has an object to serve. I do not know what that object can be, if it is not to assist the deserving. </para>

                            <para>I do not think it is very widely known throughout the Clarence District that there is a depot of the above nature existing in Sydney, whereat the wives and families of fully 1,200 men at the Front are receiving a weekly donation of vegetables, fruit, jam, &amp;c. This institution, which is entirely apart from the Red Cross, is conducted by  a  philanthropist named R. M. Pontey, and assisted by a number of willing co-workers - ladies and gentlemen of independent means - who roll up at the little depot at 9 o'clock every morning and work like galley slaves, making up hampers and delivering them to women and children, who call on regular days to receive the donations. </para>
                            <para>The writer had the pleasure of seeing the good work that was being accomplished, and he feels sure than an appeal to the farmers of the Clarence to send along a donation has only to be made and the thing is done. </para>
                            <para>On the ground floor of the depot, 16 Carrington-street, Wynyard Square, the distribution is going on all day long. It is like a miniature vegetable market. Inside, piles of bunches of carrots, cabbages, rhubarb, pumpkins, preserving melons, potatoes, &amp;c., &amp;c., are to be seen, from which the willing workers make up an assorted hamper for the applicant, who sits and waits her turn with a patience that was pleasing to observe. </para>
                            <para>A small staff attends to the clerical part of the business, for the whole affair is run on  Teal  business lines; every applicant is registered, and identification is certified by the local clergyman, police sergeant, or public school teacher, so there can be no duplication or "ringing in." The applicant is each provided with a card which she presents when she comes for her gift, and this is dated and initialed, so that everything is worked according to a system. </para>
                            <para>The use of the building is granted free by the Resumed Properties Department, and the organization is registered with the State War Council, which brings their affairs under the control of the Auditor-General. Upstairs, in another room, are men and ladies busily engaged in making jam. On the occasion of my visit, several big cauldrons were steaming away, while the workers were cutting pie-melons and grammas into cubes and lemons into slices. The jam, when made, is put into pickle bottles or empty treacle tins, and distributed in the same careful way as the vegetables are. One of the city merchants supplies the sugar at cost price. </para>
                            <para>Now, the workers upstairs, as well as downstairs, are all volunteers. They receive not one penny for their work, and they work like niggers the whole day long. It is their way of helping to win the war, and they are doing it without  a  grumble. There are no I.W.W. hours at this depôt, no awards, no anything but extreme gratitude from the hundreds of women who are being helped. </para>
                            <para>My object in writing this article is to endeavour to enlist the sympathy and assistance of the people of the Clarence electorate. By helping the families of the man who is fighting for you, you are at least doing something. There are lots of times when you produce things on your farms that are wasted. Don't let them waste. Put them on the steamer and send them along to R. M. Pontey, 16 Carrington-street, Wynyard Square, Sydney. I feel sure the steam-ship companies trading between the Clarence and Sydney would be only too pleased to carry the parcels freight free. If they will not, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pontey</inline> will pay freight out of cash donations he gets from well-wishers. </para>
                            <para>I would suggest that a few enthusiastic young ladies at each centre in the district combine and undertake to receive the donations and have them sent along. I was pleased to learn that the Casino ladies, with <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Fanning</inline> at their head, were amongst the best contributors to this depôt. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pontey</inline> assures me that regular supplies come from Casino. </para>

At present <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pontey</inline> is unable to assist women with only child; it is only women with two or more children who are assisted, but I feel sure that when the scheme becomes more widely known sufficient donations will come along to enable him to give these women a weekly dole also. </para>

They are actuated by a profound and humane incentive in the fact that no less than 4,500 children and 1,200 mothers, the dependants of men who are fighting for Australia, are looking to the fund each week to supply them with the necessary fruit and vegetables that their slender allotments and separation allowances do not permit them to purchase. The incentive is deepened, too, by the fact that every week there are fresh applicants for assistance, at an average of 200. </para>

                        <para>The Committee is desirous of obtaining evidence on the subject of inquiry in the several State capitals, but the funds at our disposal under the vote on the Estimates of this Department for expenses of Select Committees are insufficient to cover the cost. I have, therefore, by direction of the  President  of the Senate, to request that you will be good enough to make available from Treasurer's Advance the amount of £350, which it is considered will be required for the purpose above mentioned. </para>
                        <para>The Secretary to the Treasury replied as follows - </para>

                            <para>The secretary of the Select Committee appointed by the Senate to inquire into the  effect  of intoxicating liquor on soldiers, &amp;c, has shown me the memorandum which has been received from you with reference to the application for a sum of £350, to enable the said Committee to visit and obtain evidence in the several State capitals, requesting that the matter should be again submitted to me, in view of the ' desirableness of strict economy at the present time. </para>
                            <para>I quite agree with the Treasurer that the necessity exists for strict economy, owing to the financial stress caused by the war, but I desire to point out to you that, as you no doubt are 'already aware, 1 have consistently refused to admit the right of either the Treasurer or the Government to review parliamentary expenditure, and have even refused to discuss the matter with them, because I have always held, following out the practice of the House of Commons, that Parliament should be supreme master in its own household, and that as it has, to impose taxation and find the money for all services, and has no voice in Cabinet discussion on the apportionment of money so provided, it should be supreme in matters relating exclusively to itself. </para>
                            <para>The £350 asked for by the Select Committee, however, comes under a different category, and is not included in my Estimates of Senate expenditure. It is a request for money which comes from the Select Committee, and as such I have forwarded it on to the Treasurer.

                                <para>was considerably surprised when I read the President's letter, and I determined to bring the matter before the Senate, so that, as a senator, I might know exactly the position of Select Committees in regard to securing funds to enable them to fulfil their proper functions. The President's letter was divided into three parts. It is not necessary to waste a single moment in dealing with the first paragraph, hut paragraphs 2 and 3 raise rather important issues. I have not been in the Senate very long, and I bring this matter forward as one seeking information. I do not quite clearly understand the second paragraph. I realize that the President's mind has been expressed in faultless language and in perfect grammar, and I know that it is my own fault if I fail to grasp his meaning; but, as I understand it the paragraph states that the  President  refuses the right of the Government to review or question the expenditure of money that Parliament deems necessary for its own carrying on. </para>

                        <para>In order to support his contention the  President  deals with an analogy from the House of Commons. Again, I am a little bewildered. It seems to me on the face of it that there is no perfect analogy between a House that has the fate of a Govern- . ment in the hollow of its hands, and in which a member's vote may unseat the strongest of Administrations, and crumble it to the dust, and a House that can pass half a dozen motions of censure on the weakest of Administrations without .the position of the Ministry being affected in any way. Therefore I need not trouble very much about the analogy that the  President'  has drawn. It does not seem to me to be a perfect one. </para>

                                <para>- If the analogy is a perfect one, Well and good. In paragraph 3 of the President's letter we are told that the request of the Select Committee for .£350 does not come under the category of that which Parliament deems necessary for its carrying on, because it is not included in "-my Estimates of expenditure." I. like the use of the word " my " ; there is a regal touch about it reminding one of the words used by  His  Gracious Majesty the .King in opening Parliament.  His  Majesty says, " My beloved peers," " my faithful commoners," " my loyal subjects," " my Army," or " my Navy." Do I understand from the use of the word " my " that it is not a case of what the Senate thinks is necessary, but a case of what the  President  thinks is necessary for the Senate to carry on. </para>

I was not a member  of  the House at the time  of  the incident I have in mind, and  if  I  am  wrong in regard  to  some  of  the details, other honorable senators may be able to put me right.  I  have  to  rely,  pf  course,  on  the records for information, and I understand that some years ago the Senate appointed a Select Committee  to  deal with the discharge  of  a federal servant. That Committee was for the purpose  of  conducting what became known  as  the "Chinn Inquiry." The Committee, I understand, had not been sitting very long "before  it  was discovered that the £100 placed  on "my  estimates" was not sufficient, and a request was made for more. I think I  am  right  in  saying that the Treasurer  of  the day flatly refused to give any additional funds. The  President  of that day, when the reply reached him to the effect that the Government were not prepared' to grant any. more money, did not say that the case " came under a different category " from " my estimates," and that the matter was one for the Government to decide.

                            <para>I have looked into the matter carefully, and, so far  as  I have been able to ascertain, this action on the part of the Government is entirely without precedent. I take  a  very serious view of it, because if it were allowed to pass without question, this or any future Government might at any time entirely nullify the power of the Senate to inquire into  a  particular matter by refusing to provide the necessary funds. I would point out, also, that several Select Committees have paid visits to other States and other places, in order to collect necessary evidence, and that their expenses were met entirely without question by the Government of the day. A Select Committee on the Tasmanian mail service visited Tasmania. There was  a  Select Committee to inquire into the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Carroll,</inline> which went to Sydney and Brisbane; and a  Select Committee which was appointed to inquire into the matter of the press cable service, and of which I happened to be  a  member, visited Sydney, and there was not, so far as I can ascertain, any question raised by the Government of the day in regard to the expenditure. According to the authorities I have looked up, in the House of Commons- -the procedure of which is used largely as  a  guide for the Senate - there has never been any question as to the payment of the necessary expenses incurred by  a  Select Committee to inquire into any matter. I thought it my duty to make this announcement to the Senate, because, as I have- said, in my view the position is  a  very serious one. It will be for the Senate, and the leaders of the Senate, to take the. necessary action, if they consider it proper, to safeguard its rights, and not to have its powers abrogated or nullified at the discretion of any Government. </para>

Another strange coincidence is that he was a senator for Queensland. It is not for me to-day to belittle any Select Committee previously appointed by this Chamber, nor do I desire to aggrandize the Committee of which, for a moment, I happen to be  Chairman.

                                <para>- I say that, by a strange coincidence, his name was the same as that of the present  President  of this Senate - Thomas Givens. How can I say whether it was the name of the same man who is now President? What I want to know is - " Why this differentiation ?" In view of the answer of the present  President  regarding the Committee of which I am  chairman,  to the effect that it was for the Government to please themselves, I felt that I, and also the Select Committee, were denied the rightful support of the  President  in our efforts to fulfil the functions with which we were commissioned. This Committee, remember, was not appointed by me, but by the Senate, and, therefore, I thought I was entitled to the proper support of the  President  of the Senate. On receipt of the letter I went personally to the Leader of the Government in this House with a request that more money should be provided. It was rather an easy task for me, not only as a member of the Senate, but as a member of the party to which the Leader of the Government belongs, to prefer such a request, for I think I can claim that the personal relationship between the members of the Government and myself is most friendly. But supposing a member of the Opposition had been  chairman  of this Select Committee, and he had thought it his duty, again and again, to assail the Government, as he was entitled to do, in the discharge of his parliamentary duties? Would it have been an easy task for such a man to arrange with the representative of the Government for a further advance? As a result of my interview with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> I received the following letter: - </para>

                    <para>For the information of your Committee I forward herewith copy of a letter which I have received from the Secretary, Commonwealth Treasury, relative to the question of providing additional funds to enable the Committee to take evidence in the several State capitals. </para>
                    <para>From a conversation I had with the Acting Treasurer, it did not seem to me at all likely that any further sum would be available, and therefore I consider the Committee would be wise to make their arrangements so as not to exceed the amount already provided. (Sgd.) Thos. Givens, </para>
                    <para>President of the Senate. </para>
                    <para class="block">This letter informed us that the Government had made available the sum of £200, but through the  President  we were told not to expect any further money for the purpose of our inquiry. There was not a single word of protest from the  President,  or any indication that he offered any objection to the Government's refusal to grant the necessary money. I cannot but feel that it was not my duty to ask for further funds in order to carry on the work of a Committee appointed by the Senate, but that that was the duty of one who is supposed to be the custodian of our rights. I am not asking that the  President  should do anything that is not his duty, but I do desire to know how the Senate stands in a matter of this kind, .especially in view of the statement made by the then  President  on 10th September, 1913, that it would be a very serious abrogation of the rights of the Senate if the money required for the Chinn inquiry were not provided by the Government. I feel that there is in this question something more important than the mere provision of money for the Committee of which I am  Chairman.  The action of the Government raises a question as to the free and unfettered right of the Senate to appoint Committees. Either the Senate has, or has not, that right; if the right does exist, it must be free and unfettered. I recognise that this raises a very big question from the point of view of the Government. The Senate might be in future, as it has been in the past, hostile to the Government, and might appoint Committees without number merely for the purpose of harassing the Government, and spend moneys recklessly. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad that the Minister has raised that point. I admit that there is the possibility of that difficulty arising. In a private conversation with a well-known gentleman, who, as a professor in one of the Australian universities, is required to study constitutional history, I asked him what would be the position if the Senate were to be continually appointing Select Committees which might recklessly spend money, and in some way upset the -Budget of the Treasurer. His reply was to the effect that representative and democratic government, as we understand it, presupposes, firstly, that sane men are returned to Parliament, and, secondly, that once a man is in Parliament he realizes the responsibilities of his position. These two things not being conceded, representative government fails. That seemed to me a reasonable argument. Every Select Committee that is appointed by the </para>

Suppose that the Government flatly refused to make the money available, what could the Senate do f The Senate's action would depend upon the circumstances of the cases. There may be a time when the Senate will be absolutely powerless to do more than offer a dignified protest. I Was a member of the other branch of the Legislature at a time when that Chamber deemed that its rights had been interfered with by the Senate. By the way, I supported the action of the Senate on that occasion, and another place felt that it was powerless to fight this Chamber on the issue then raised. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> moved - </para>

But the strongest case the Senate could ever have in a matter like this would be perceptibly weakened if the records of this Chamber showed that a President, speaking, presumably, on behalf and in the name of the Senate, had stated that it was for the Government to decide whether it should or should not grant necessary supplies.. </para>

Then that sum will become portion of the President's Estimates. and he will not allow the Treasurer to even discuss the expenditure of it.

                                <para>- I admit that there may be difficulties, and if honorable senators care to declare that another place is justified in refusing supplies to this Chamber, I do not mind. But I desire the Committee of which I am  Chairman  to be placed on the same footing as the Select Committee which inquired into the Chinn case. A previous  President  said that, the refusal of funds to carry on the work of the Senate would be an abrogation of the rights of this Chamber. If the Senate chooses, of its own volition, to abrogate those rights, nobody can blame the  President.  But I repeat that if the Senate does concede that another place might justly refuse further funds to a Select Committee of this Chamber, then every Select Committee becomes merely the creature of the Government. </para>

                                <para>- This Senate could always refuse to pass more than a month's Supply, and few Governments would choose to come back month after month ,for Supply rather than provide £250 to carry on the work of a Senate Select Committee. The Senate must express an opinion as to whether or not its Select Committees are to. be the creatures of the Government, and are only to be appointed when the Government concur, and agree to find the' money. In this particular case the Government did not object to the Committee. The Senate would do well to guard its right to appoint Select Committees. In another place, when members appoint a Select Committee, and the Government refuse to give them supplies, they can say, " We are in a majority, and if you refuse to enable the Committee to carry on, you cease to be a Government." Having that right, they have also to face the responsibility of possibly forcing a dissolution; and if the Government threaten to ask for a dissolution, it is quite possible that the majority of members m&amp;y decide not to appoint the Committee in the circumstances. There is no fear of that in the Senate. , </para>

I can quite understand the Treasurer saying, "I will not grant the money, whatever the consequences are"; but that is no reason why we should not demand our rights. There are times when we can maintain our rights. </para>

                                <para>- Decidedly. There are demands which the Government dare not refuse. There are other occasions on which they survive, until, as happened on one occasion, they foolishly go to tie country. The Government have acted a little strangely over the matter. When I moved for the Committee, the Minister of Defence, speaking on behalf of the Government, said they raised no objection to it, but rather welcomed it. .1 have had every assistance from the Minister since the Committee was appointed. On one or two occasions the military authorities deemed it necessary to censor some of the evidence before publication in the press. I may differ from the Minister as to the necessity for that, but I recognise that he has a great Department to administer, and that he has responsibilities which the members of the Select Committee have not. When I have gone to the Leader of the Government in the Senate we have always had a very pleasant conversation.' </para>

                                <para>- Yes; but in view of the fact that the Government did not oppose the Committee, it seems a little strange that Lord Forrest, the late Treasurer, should, on behalf of the. Government, have said that, on the  score  of economy, no more than £100 ought to be allocated. It is not for me to say what the duty of the  President  of this august assembly should be. But I should not have been so disappointed if, in his answer, instead of saying it was merely a matter for the Government to decide whether they should give the money or not, he had pointed out that there were three members of the Government present when the Committee was moved for, and that that was the time, if any, for them to have spoken on the question of economy, so that the Senate would  have the opportunity of voting with its eyes open, and of then deciding whether £350, in addition to the first £100, should be spent in order to get the information required, or whether the Committee should be put on one side, on the ground that the amount asked for was too large. The members of the Government did not point out those things then, and we were, therefore, justified in asking for the money. The Government have since granted £200 more. I have had no direct official communication from the Government to confirm what the  President  has been good enough, to tell us in his letter, that from his conversation with the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> he gathered .that the Treasurer has asked that we should not spend any more. I quite recognise that the Government can cut off supplies if they like. They may say they will not grant £150 more, and I do not know whether we shall want the whole of that. We have done a good deal of work, and we still have some of the £200 in hand. It is quite possible that we may not want even the £150 that we ask for, but we may. We have visited all the capitals on this inquiry except Sydney and Brisbane. The  President  can continue to say, if he so desires, that it is not a matter in which he is concerned, but one merely for the Government. The Senate 'has the power to disown its own creation, and disband the Committee. </para>

                                <para>- Certainly. The Senate can do more if it so desires. It can abandon its right to appoint free and unfettered Committees. I have not attempted to aggrandize the importance of the  Committee  of which I am the  Chairman.  I have not claimed for it more importance than for .any other Committee appointed by the Senate, whether it was to inquire into the dismissal of a Federal servant, to unravel some great problem in connexion with the post-office at Balfour, Tasmania, or one to obtain information on one of the great social problems of the day. All Select Committees appointed by the Senate Stand, 'so far as the Senate is. concerned, on an equal footing. All are children of the Senate, and all are entitled to the same consideration from the Senate. I feel strongly on the question of the right of the Senate to appoint free and .unfettered Committees. A person may not believe, as a citizen, in the bi-cameral system. He may be honestly opposed to the creation  Or  existence of the Senate, but once he accepts nomination, and is returned to the Senate, seeing that the people of Australia are in favour of the bi-cameral system, he will be doing wrong to those who voted for him if he in any way minimizes the powers, functions, and privileges of the Senate. He may try to persuade the people to do away with the Senate altogether, but so long as he is a member of it, it is his duty to see that its privileges' are maintained. I am therefore justified in asking why the  President,  when the Chinn Select Committee was  refused  Supply by the then Government, made a statement to the effect that such a course, interfered with the rights of the Senate, while in the case of the present Committee, he says it is quite a matter for the Government to decide whether to grant Supply or not. Do the Government propose to give us as little money as is necessary to do the work? While saying nothing about the importance of the Committee, I venture to assert that the doings of no Committee ever appointed by this Chamber have been followed, with keener interest by so large a percentage of the people outside. I am confident that there are a good many people outside this august Chamber who will watch the answer to these questions with a certain amount of curiosity, and perhaps with some anxiety. </para>

When an honorable senator feels that it is necessary for the carrying out  of his duties in the Senate to make an attack on another individual, the least that that other individual has a right to expect is that he shall not be placed at a disadvantage when that attack is delivered. My only excuse for speaking at all now is that I would not have the right to speak on this matter at a later stage, because the Standing Orders prohibit the revival of a previous debate. . </para>

                            undertook to  prove  that my attitude as to the rights of  the  Senate in respect of the Estimates was entirely wrong. He contended that there is no analogy between the position of the Senate in this matter and that of the House of Commons, a body which makes and unmakes Ministries by a wave of its hand. I am not responsible for the fact that the Senate possesses the same privileges as are enjoyed by the House of Commons; but it certainly possesses those privileges, and the responsibility for that rests with the members of the Convention which drafted the Constitution, with the people of Australia who accepted the Constitution, and with the Parliament of Great Britain which enacted it. If honorable senators .will turn to section 49 of the Constitution, they will see that it is there laid down that -

                            <para>Coming . .to his next complaint, he pointed out in a most sarcastic way - his_ remarks constituting a bitter attack upon me - that my attitude towards the Chinn Committee was quite different from that towards his Committee. In what respect, may I ask, was it different? The Chinn Committee sent a request to me for more money in the same way that the Committee of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> is  chairman  sent its request, and that request was forwarded by me in the same way that I forwarded <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas'</inline> request. But the Government of the day flatly refused to grant any additional money to the Chinn Committee; the present Government have not refused to grant money to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas'</inline> Committee. I reported  tol  the Senate the refusal of the Government to grant money to the Chinn Committee. That was the only action I took, because it was for the Senate to go further, if it so desired. In this case, there has been no refusal by the Government to grant money. Had there been such a refusal, I should have deemed it my duty to report the matter to the Senate. </para>

                                .complains that I speak  of  the Estimates of the Senate as "  my  Estimates."  In so  doing, I speak  as  chief executive officer  of  the Senate, which I am by virtue  of  holding the position of President.  No  personal vanity or personal feeling prompts the expression. The attitude I have always assumed towards the Treasurer in regard to the Senate's Estimates is that set out in the letter that has been referred to. I  do  not acknowledge the right of the Treasurer to discuss, and much less to dictate tq me concerning, the Estimates of the Senate. In taking that attitude I am following the practice of the  Speaker  of the House of Commons, and for the reasons set out in the letter. But there is a difference between the Estimates' of the Senate and the request of a Select Committee for money. When I require money for expenditure on repairs or renovations, my attitude towards the Treasurer is quite different from my attitude in regard to the Estimates. The amount required may be a  £5  note, or it may run into thousands of pounds, as in the case of painting, expensive repairs/ or lift alterations. When money is required for such purposes, I have to go cap in hand to the Treasurer, and to discuss with him the proposed expenditure. Such an application for money on my part differs entirely from the submission of Estimates, because the Senate has not authorized the expenditure which it is proposed to make. Nor is there any analogy between a Commit-' tee's request for money and the submission of ordinary Estimates. I remember reading some  time ago that

                        <para class="block">It has already visited Launceston, Hobart, Adelaide, and Perth. It would be infinitely cheaper for the Committee to bring to Melbourne from, say, Perth, the few witnesses which it means to examine than for the members of the Committee, accompanied by the secretary and a <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reporter, to travel to such places to examine those witnesses. If the Committee, at its own sweet will, and without the sanction of the Senate, or of any executive officer of. the Senate, is to spend as much money as it pleases, that will lead to wholesale extravagance. The Committee visited Tasmania, its trip there being in the nature of ' a very agreeable peregrinating picnic. It travelled overland from Launceston to Hobart. I am not objecting to the visit to Tasmania, but I point out that this Committee took with it a messenger. The practice has been that the necessary and unavoidable expenses of travelling shall be met by the secretary to the Committee, the members of the Committee not handling any money at all. This Committee had with it a messenger as well as a secretary. I have no objection to that. But having taken a messenger to handle their luggage and perform various little offices, there was no need to pay large tips each way to the stewards on board the steamer on which the members slept for a night or to the railway porters. When a messenger is provided for the convenience of the members of a Committee, there should be no need for much tipping. I find that the Committee's trip to Tasmania cost about £90. It would have been much cheaper to bring to Melbourne the witnesses to be examined, giving them the trip, instead of having the Committee peregrinating expensively in war time when every shilling is required. Had I not issued my veto against the further employment of a messenger, the Committee would probably have continued to travel round with him as well as with a secretary. After I had signed the voucher for the large sum that I have just mentioned, I learned that one of the members of the Committee had stayed behind the rest, and further tips and expenses, amounting to some JE2 10s., had to be met on his account. It is. for the Treasurer to say 'what amount the Government will give to a Committee. Should the Senate vote a sum of money, the case would be different, but where the Senate has not done that, I, as  President,  should not be asked to take any responsibility. I defy <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas,</inline> or any one else, to show that I have treated his Committee differently from any other Committee. I say, advisedly, that, in all my experience, this is the most extravagant Committee that I have known. </para>

Although Naval- Officer in Charge had given admission pass to wharf on departure of s.s. <inline font-style="italic">Loongana</inline> to His Excellency the Apostolic Delegate and his party, Wills insolently refused to allow the two dignitaries named to come upon the wharf. In the name of all Tasmanian Catholics I demand full investigation by Defence Department. </para>

                        <para class="block">The clergyman who signs this telegram is a member of the Roman Catholic Church in Tasmania. I admit that he is using rather strong expressions in demanding an investigation by the Defence Department, and I do not propose to say whether I believe his assertions are correct or not. I propose to supplement his statements, by what tha secretary to the Apostolic Delegate told me, when I consulted him after receiving the telegram. The secretary to the Apostolic Delegate lias informed me to the following effect: - Father McNally, a Launceston clergyman, knowing that the Archbishop of Tasmania and Monsignor  Beechinor,  who is the second highest dig,nitary in the Roman Catholic Church in Tasmania, and one or two other gentlemen, wished to go upon the wharf to take leave of the Apostolic Delegate upon his departure, went to the office of the Union Company, and secured a pass, signed by an official in the' office. This pass was issued to Father McNally and party, giving them permission to go upon the portion of the wharf which is roped off. A motor .took Father McNally and a couple of other clergymen down to the wharf 7 and they used the pass to get past the barrier, while the car returned to Launceston, and brought down the Apostolic Delegate, along with Archbishop Delaney and" Monsignor Beechinor. But when these three gentlemen arrived at the barrier, they were stopped bv Lieutenant Wills. Of course, the Apostolic Delegate was allowed to go through, because he had his steamer ticket; but Lieutenant Wills, in the words of the secretary to the Apostolic Delegate, and as shown in the telegram which I have read, insolently refused to allow Archbishop Delaney or Monsignor Beechinor to go on the wharf, although Father McNally stood there, and showed his pass, which gave permission to himself and party to go into the enclosed space on the wharf. </para>
                        <para>According to the telegram the pass was signed by a Naval officer. I put the question to the secretary to the  Apostolic  Delegate, and he said that, although he was not certain, .he thought it was simply an official of the Union Steam-ship Company who had signed and issued the pass. In any case, the point is immaterial. </para>

                            has also received a telegram from Father McNally  making exactly the same charges and assertions as to the insolence of Lieutenant Wills, but in slightly different words. It adds that there was intense indignation on the part of members of the Roman Catholic Church who happened to be present, a'nd that they took it to be meant as a public insult, which was offered to the two dignitaries of the Church by this official.
                        </para>
                        <para>My reason for bringing this matter forward is that it affects not only the two church dignitaries who might have taken the action of Lieutenant Wills as an insult, but also a large section of the people of Tasmania*, who would resent an insult purposely put upon the dignitaries of their church, just as any other section of the people of Australia would resent an insult put on any of the dignitaries of their churches in the circumstances alleged in these telegrams. I make this as an <inline font-style="italic">exparte</inline> statement. Perhaps the Minister for Defence will communicate with the Minister for the Navy with the object of having an inquiry made. If the assertions are borne out by the evidence, I hope that the Minister will take the necessary steps to show the officials under his control that they must not go out of their way to insult any member of the public. </para>

                            <para>. - When a Supply Bill comes before the Senate it is an occasion for an honorable senator to wander from "Dan to Beersheba," and speak on almost anything under the sun; it is one of those occasions upon which honorable senators feel that they are free.; but with all the weighty things that are happening abroad, it is rather difficult for honorable senators to concentrate their attention upon mere money details. I am sure we all feel absolutely helpless with regard to what is going on in Europe, but I believe that "doing one's bit" is a text for a sermon which might still be applied here, and "one's bit" in Australia just now seems to me to consist in insuring economy with efficiency, not only in private concerns, but in national undertakings. In matters affecting recruiting and administration, and in other matters, the Government may be guided by the honest opinions that honorable senators may express. </para>

                        <para>Australia does not appear to be suffering very much as a result of the war. The recent Sydney Agricultural Show, an annual festival, resulted in a record amount being taken at the gates, and in drawing a record number of visitors. We are told by Ministers that there is less horse-racing than existed prior to the war, but, so far as one can see and judge, the racing crowds are bigger now, and the amount of money spent in racing is far greater than it was previously. To-day I came across a case showing that secondhand machinery merchants' businesses are flourishing as they never flourished before, and throughout the length and breadth of Australia, so far as I can see, the war has not really touched us. Evidences of prosperity and of increased expenditure of money can be seen on every side amongst private individuals. There are other evidences of prosperity, all of which has been brought about by the expenditure of the British money that has been paid for produce which still remains unshipped to the Old Country. This state of things makes one wonder what the future holds for us. </para>
                        <para>What does the future hold for Australia ? No senator dare make a guess as to what is going to happen. No one here this afternoon can say with any certainty that Australia will not some day he a jewel in the hair of the  Germanian  frau. We cannot prophesy, we cannot even guess, what is going to happen; but the duty which lies nearest to us is that of making the government of the country as efficient as possible, and of doing all we can, directly or indirectly, to help on the great events abroad. If some philosophers or observers came to Australia to-day and saw the evidence of indifference, luxury, comfort, and spending which exists in this young, virile Democracy of ours, to which so many of us are proud to belong, it would strike them that we were decadent. I do not say it; but I do say that comfort, luxury, and extravagance, if placed before duty, have brought down empires, and they are contributors to decadence, as history teaches us. </para>
                        <para>This Senate has the responsibility of taking a broad-minded view as to what its functions and duties are. I do not think that there is one honorable .senator on this side of the chamber who is anxious to make the difficulties of the Government greater than they already are. Heaven knows how great they are, and what  improvization  has been attempted to meet them during the last three years. </para>
                        <para>The Government are to be congratulated upon a reduction in the Estimates as compared with the corresponding period of last year. The Treasurer, in presenting this. Supply to us, has gone some way towards safeguarding economy in expenditure, and I trust that he will continue this policy so that when the next Supply comes before us, we may have further evidence of the fact that the Government appreciate the necessity for economy. The Treasurer has told us that the total loan expenditure of Australia on the war, to the 1st of next September, will amount to £233,000,000, but even should the war cease at an early date, I have no doubt the total liability of Australia, when all our engagements are cleared up, will be something' approaching £300,000,000. The Treasurer has told us that we have raised, by loan, the sum of £106,000,000, out of a total expenditure of £233,000,000, and that our shortage to-day is £127,000,000. He says, again, that we have borrowed from the British Government the sum of £47,500,000, and that we have a deficit, so far as money raised in Australia is concerned, of £80,000,000. He further says, and rightly too, that this position is not creditable to Australia. We are engaged, and successfully engaged I am glad to say, in raising another internal loan of £40,000,000; but on the Treasurer's own statement, apart from the amount, we have borrowed from the British Government, we have yet to borrow another £40,000,000 before September next in order to make both ends meet. Personally, I do not think Australia is facing the financial problem. On the figures as we know them, the Commonwealth to-day is doing little better than paying the interest on the money it borrows, in addition to the ordinary expenditure of the Government. Britain is paying 4s. and 5s. in the £1 of her war expenditure from revenue, whereas Australia is not paying ls. in the £1 of her capital war expenditure from revenue. I, therefore, say, without fear of contradiction, that we are not facing the financial position. With regard to war loans, I should like to say in all sincerity that I am not enamoured of the cheap-jack methods that are being adopted in order to raise money. I am not enamoured of false-whiskered men in Collins-street, on a so-called tank, or on the model of a ship, singing chanties to induce people to come along and pay £100 for 100 £1 war bonds. I am not  enamoured  of all this camouflage and the many circus-like tricks adopted now to raise money from the people of Australia. My experience is that, as a rule, there is one class of people that will always give to Bed Cross, benevolent, and comfort funds; who will always do their best with regard to war loans, and make all the sacrifices that they can be reasonably expected to make under present conditions. There is another class of the community who will do nothing. Capitalists have come to me and said, " I am not going to put money into war loans, because I can get 6 per cent., 7 per cent., or 8 per cent, for my money, and I should be a fool to invest it at 4£ per cent." I believe the time has come when this Parliament, by an Act and a stroke of the pen, will have to call upon every man to do his bit, if not voluntarily, then by compulsion. </para>

I believe that the voting on the question of conscription was very mixed, and I am. quite sure that the men who to-day are making sacrifices also advocate conscription; and, personally, I believe that, if it is right to advocate conscription of manhood, it is right to advocate conscription of wealth. I have already said that I do not agree with the circus-like methods resorted to for the purpose of raising' money; in my opinion," as they say in America, they " cut no ice." I do not think they bring any large aggregate contributions to the Treasury, while, in the eyes of all serious-thinking men, they degrade the present serious war position. </para>

                        <para>It seems to me that the future Budget of the Commonwealth, supposing all goes well with us, and we are allowed to carry on in the future as in the past, will amount to at least £50,000,000 per year, without there being any provision for sinking fund on our huge war debt. It will be generally admitted, I think, that the sum required for interest on £250,000,000 or £300,000,000, for soldiers' pensions, and for the Repatriation Department, will amount to a . total of very nearly £20,000,000 a year. That leaves us about £30,000,000 ho carry on the ordinary governmental services, and to complete the building of Naval Bases, and to provide that defence which, in my opinion, it will be necessary to provide in the not distant future. So, taking a general view of the future position of the finances of the country, nothing less than a Budget of £50,000,000 a year will pay our way, without any regard to a sinking fund on our debt. That is one of the reasons why, in my opinion, we are not at present facing the financial position as it ought to be faced by us as a party, as a Parliament, and as a Government. I am glad to see that the Treasurer has indicated that in his next Budget speech he will introduce additional taxation. I am expressing a purely personal opinion when I say I believe in graduated taxation of all sorts - graduated land taxation, graduated income taxation, and graduated probate taxation - and a graduation that hits hardest the man who has most. </para>

Personally, I would go further, and scientifically so graduate our taxation, in view of the enormous commitments of the war and the burden we shall have to carry, as to make it almost impossible in the future for men in our community to gather together the huge aggregations of wealth that are now being accumulated. In this, also, I am expressing my individual opinion. </para>

It is fair to assume that, excluding these, the total capital wealth of Australia to-day is in the vicinity of £2,000,000,000; and, if things go reasonably well - if we have a reasonable peace by negotiation, and we achieve some of the objects for which we are fighting in Europe - that capital wealth will remain as a basis of taxation. </para>

                                <para>- I am informed that the sum of £1,600,000,000, when the census .was taken, was the estimated  wealth so far as then could he ascertained, and it did not include public utilities or public ownership. It was admitted, and is admitted, that that census was not complete. Since then Australia has been exceedingly prosperous; businesses of all sorts have been most profitable; and, consequently, I think it a reasonable assumption that the capital value of the wealth of Australia in private hands today is in the region of £2,000,000,000. </para>

                                <para>- Perhaps so. I have attempted to closely follow all that is going on in Australia, and all that the Government is doing, for myself; and I am sure that honorable senators, let alone the man in the street, must be surprised at the activities of the Government to-day in its control, partial or complete, of huge enterprises that affect the life of the whole of the people of Australia. We all know that this year's expenditure will amount to considerably over £100,000,000. In addition to that, the Government is controlling primary and secondary products, which also are valued at considerably over £100,000,000. A table recently completed shows the activities of the Government, and included are items such as these: - The Winter Pool of butter was valued at £8,500,000 and the butter sold to Great Britain at £4,530,000. Other commodities dealt with were: - Leather Board, £3,500,000; frozen rabbits, £1,500,000; skins, £600,000; hides, £110,000; jam, £1,093,000; wheat, £30,000,000; coal, £192,000; metals, £19,000,000; sugar, £8,000,000; and wool, £25,340,000. All those commodities are being controlled to-day by the Government, who, in addition, are engaging in shipbuilding and operating the Commonwealth line of steamers. They have recently appointed a Board, controlling shipping space to the value of millions per annum, and the Government are also attempting to fix the prices of necessary commodities. It must be clear to any business man that, in all the circumstances of the war, the creation of these monopolies was a statesman-like action. I do not criticise the conception of the public control of these various commodities in war time, so that there may be one united seller and one buyer, and that our trade and commerce, when shipping space is limited, shall be controlled. But I join issue with the Government most seriously in connexion with their administration of these Pools, inasmuch as they have appointed to the Committees and Pools men who are interested in the businesses which those bodies operate. In my opinion, the time has come for enlarging the personnel of these bodies.We are reaching a danger-point when the Government create monopolies and give the control of them to interested persons. I am not suggesting that any man on these Committees is anything but an honorable man. I know that all are prominent in the commerce and industry of the country; but I think the principle of giving the control of Government-created monopolies to interested persons is wrong. Consider, for instance, the Shipping Board. </para>

On general principles, the Board is guided by instructions from the Imperial Government, but, apart from those general instructions, the Board does practically as it thinks fit. I regret very much to have received to-day from the Vice-President of the Executive Council a reply that the sight of ships' manifests is refused to honorable senators. There should be nothing in the ship's manifest that need be hidden from us. </para>

                                <para>- I understood from the Minister's previous answer that the manifests were to be kept a close corporation, and I am glad to have his assurance now that honororable senators may inspect them privately. I can understand that publicity is undesirable, but I know of no reason why an honorable senator should not have an opportunity to know as much as a member of the Shipping Board. I infer from the Minister's interjection that these manifests will be available to honorable senators to peruse privately and confidentially. I am not suggesting for one moment that in connexion with any of these bodies there is anything that is  not strictly honorable, but I suggest that their <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> should be enlarged.

I am glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> is on the Board, because no man in this Parliament has a better knowledge of shipping from the stand-point of labour. But I remind the Government that shipping is perhaps the most important activity in Australia today. The members of the Board are in a position to bestow favours; they can keep back information. The control of shipping should be in the hands of not only the Government officials, ship-owners, and colliery proprietors, but also two or three gentlemen who have no interest whatever in shipping. I am merely illustrating what might occur under the present system of administration, and in the most kindly spirit I suggest to the Government the enlargement of all these Boards and Committees. The. metal industry supplies another illustration. I understand that one Board controls practically all the copper, zinc, and lead produced in the Commonwealth, and with the exception of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgins,</inline> who represents the Government, the members of the Board are interested persons. I hope that in the read]justment of the work of the various Cabinet Ministers, which I understand is now being carried out. the points I have mentioned will be considered by the Government, so that there may be no suspicion that anything is wrong, and so that there will be men on the Boards who will insure that the public shall get a fair deal. </para>

                        <para>I very much regret that the Ministry did not think fit to bring in a Bill to provide for the payment of the additional new Ministers. I was disappointed to read the statement that these four extra Ministers will cost the country nothing. The salaries paid to the ten good men and true who constitute the Government today total about £15,000, or an average of £1,500 each. The labourer is worthy of his hire, and it would have been a shortsighted policy for any member of this Senate to have objected to any reasonable addition to the sum allowed by Parliament for the payment of Ministers. The Government are responsible for the administration of Government expenditure totalling over £100,000,000 per annum, and the control of primary, secondary, and other products valued at considerably over £100,000,000. If we compare what is happening in the commercial and manufacturing world with what happens in the Government service, we realize at once that one of the reasons why private enterprise is more efficient than Government enterprise is that the former offers a greater reward for the men who create the efficiency. I understand that, a few years ago, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Delprat,</inline> the general manager of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, and the caretaker of a capital of £2,000,000, received a salary of £3,000, and it is quite reasonable to assume that his salary to-day is in the region of £5,000. </para>

                        <para>The question of the cost of living demands attention in its relation to the matter of efficiency. It is generally admitted that the cost of living has gone up considerably. I am not speaking, for the purpose of this argument, of imported goods. I believe it can be safely said that the cost of the products of Australian which may be called necessary commodities in the lives of the people, has certainly gone up, rightly or wrongly, to the extent.' of at least ls. per week per head, man, woman, and child. The Government have made a Department for the fixation of prices. For the sake of my argument, I do not wish unduly to criticise that Department. Personally, I think it is not nearly strong enough. I do not think there are men there who are sufficiently weighty in the business community, or who have sufficient experience in business to carry out for the benefit of the whole people the duties for which they are "laced there. A rise of ls. per head per week in the cost of the necessaries obtained in Australia means £250,000 per week being paid by the people of Australia more than they paid in pre-war days, or a sum amounting in a year to £13,000,000. Those are the gigantic propositions that the Government and the officials of the Government have to control to-day. I would urge the Government to strengthen this control in every possible way. We have to have it until the war is over, and  for some time afterwards, because it makes for the best possible government, and that is one way in which we can aid. </para>

                                <para>- I have a case which I could easily make good if I desired to occupy the time of the Senate, but even in the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> McCheyne  Anderson in 1915 the desirability of the co-operation of business men was laid down. In <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Rich's report on the Liverpool Camp, made on 18th August, 1915, it is stated that " business men might well be employed in matters where their training and experience would be of the greatest advantage to the military authorities, that is, in connexion with ordnance and on finance committees." I repeat that the fundamental mistake made by the Minister for Defence or his advisers when the war started was in not organizing the Department on the lines suggested previously, and in not separating the military from the civil administration. I do not wish to probe this matter further, but I am glad that the Prime Minister, in his announcement regarding the progress report of the Royal Commission on Naval and Defence administration immediately formed and created the Business Board that has been so long wanted.

I earnestly hope and trust that this business body will have ample powers to check extravagance and carry on the business of the country with the necessary economy. I hope it will not be camouflaged, or strike the stone wall of officialdom. I do not know what powers the Board has, but I hope the Minister for Defence will be sufficiently sensible now, after all the experience the Department has gone through, as evidenced by the reports of the Royal Commission, to carry out the recommendation made by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ian</inline> Hamilton, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> McC. Anderson, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Rich, that the civil should be separated from the military side of Defence matters. </para>

                        <para>I am pleased indeed to read in these reports of the obvious success of the Government factories, such as the saddlery factory, the clothing factory, and others. I should like to know, but the information is not contained in the reports, what prices are being charged the Defence Department for the products of these factories. If the prices charged the Department and credited to the factories are prices which are competitive, and no more than will be charged by other manufacturers, then the triumph of the Defence Department, so far as these factories are concerned, is complete. </para>

                                <para>- Yes. I feel strongly that, perhaps through no fault of the Minister for Defence, the interned alien question has not been treated with the seriousness it deserves. I shall not detain honorable senators on the subject beyond summarizing some of the things that have happened in New South Wales. So long ago as the 25th August of last year the recruiting officers from all over the State met and passed this resolution : " That this conference urges the Federal and State Governments to take firmer action in regard to any enemy aliens in our midst, in the interests of recruiting." There has been simmering in. Sydney for many months, if not for years, rightly or wrongly, very grave dissatisfaction with the Defence Department for allowing enemy aliens the freedom they have. I have come across cases where a particular German has been at a recruiting meeting, and has been seen to sneer and make disparaging remarks. I have here the absolute definite evidence in the form of a letter from the Defence Department itself that a German is still in the employment of the military at Victoria Barracks, Paddington. I do not wish, and, obviously,, it is not altogether desirable, to pursue this subject very far, but for the information of the public, and, if necessary, of the German Government itself, I should like to read to the Senate a bill-of-fare that was given to the German internees that came from the East to Sydney in 1915 by a well-known Eastern trading boat. They were given all the saloon accommodation. </para>

This menu was for troops and prisoners. The breakfast consisted of oatmeal porridge, grilled steak and onions, fried sausages, and boiled potatoes. The dinner consisted of soup, steak and kidney pie, boiled mutton and caper sauce, cabbage, boiled potatoes, stewed prunes, and boiled rice. For tea there was haricot steak, curry and rice, cold roast mutton, pickles, &amp;c, and cold roast potatoes. The second menu is similar to the first. </para>

That should make some improvement in the position. When there is any doubt about a man, it is safer to put him behind the wires. In this connexion I am reminded of the verse - </para>

                        <para class="block">I do not know what is going to be done in connexion with the re-organization of the Defence Department. The reply of the accountants who investigated the methods of the Department to the defence of  Colonel Thomas  was that, in their opinion, that officer is not qualified for the position he holds. I trust that the Business Board will have full control of the civil side of the Defence administration, in which case things will be very much more satisfactorily managed. Let me add a word or two about recruiting. No doubt the recruiting movement has failed, for various reasons, one of many being. I think, that there is not enough sympathy with the men on the part of the military officers in the camps. Such sympathy would be a great help towards recruiting. Metaphorically speaking, we say to unenlisted men, " Gentlemen, come on," and when they have donned khaki, we say, "You are here, and be damned to you." I appeal to the Minister to consider this matter. It must be remembered that our soldiers are volunteers. They enlist of their own volition. They are ready to make the supreme sacrifice, if necessary, and most of them give up something to join the Army. This not being a conscript country, in which soldiers can be bandied about from pillar to post, in the Prussian style, I say that if more sympathy were shown to new recruits, it would go a long way towards making camp life more popular. Another thing that, in my opinion, has militated against recruiting is a recently promulgated general service order that the recruit must hand himself over to the military body and soul, without knowing what is to be done with him, or where he is going. Before that order was issued, I think it could be safely said that, in spite of the falling off in recruits, the infantry only was affected, enough men being available for the artillery, the Army Service Corps, the Army Medical Corps, the Engineers, the Cyclists Corps, the Wireless Corps, Light Horse, and all the other branches of the Army. A man, when about to enlist, wants to know where he will be put. </para>

                                <para>- Some time last year there were in the Liverpool Camp hundreds of artillerymen and hundreds of men who had enlisted in special units, the Cyclists Corps and mechanical corps of various kinds; but as it was thought that no further artillerymen would be required at the Front, there came a sudden call from Head-quarters asking the  whole of these men to go into the infantry. One or two members of another place and I waited upon the Minister in reference to the matter, and pointed out that the honour of Australia was at stake, because these men had been specially advertised for, and had joined special units. As a result of our representations to the Minister, the whole of these men went away in the corps in which they had originally enlisted, and I know, as a fact, that within a month of their landing in England, all the artillerymen were sent to France, because artillery reinforcements were very urgently required. From month to month and week to week the changes in the war are kaleidoscopic. If we cannot call for men for the artillery service, we should certainly not refuse men for special units. </para>

                        <para>My experience in regard to this war covers Egypt, Salisbury Plain, Abbeywood, and other camps of Australians, and I can say that the boots, clothing, and other equipment from head to foot supplied by the <inline font-style="italic">Defence</inline> Department for our soldiers cannot be surpassed by the equipment supplied to any other army in the wide world. It was the best that money could buy, and the best that any community could supply. The Australian soldiers preferred an old repaired pair of Australian boots to anything new that the British Army could issue to them. I have nothing but praise for the section of the Defence Department that deals with the equipment of our troops. </para>
                        <para>I notice that there is no special vote in this Supply Bill for the Repatriation Department, but I assume that the £1,000,000 set down for Treasurer's Advance is to be devoted to that particular service. I repeat that we are not in a Prussian community, and that every man is a volunteer, and not a conscript, and I urge upon the Repatriation Department, as well as the Defence Department, the need for employing sympathetic officers. If we wish to achieve success in respect to our treatment of returned soldiers we must have them. </para>

                                <para>- Exactly. A nation can undertake no more important work than that of securing its own supplies of oil fuel. The work proceeding at Papua is a Government monopoly. Private enterprise is not allowed to bore for oil in that Commonwealth territory. Our Government Departments have spent five years in boring for oil at the rate of less than 800 feet per annum, and at a cost of £60,000, and they have not yet succeeded. </para>

                                <para>- The kerosene industry of New South Wales has had violent fluctuations between success and non-success; but it is an entirely different matter. It obtains the oil from shale, whereas I am speaking of boring for natural oil wells. Nothing could be more important to Australia' than to make it self-contained so far. as oil fuel is concerned. No motor can be started without oil. The Germans have obtained control of the Rumanian oil wells, and they are about to obtain control of the Batum oil wells in Asia Minor. If they can retain the control of the oil wells of those two districts after the war, they will control one-third of the world's output of oil. The whole of Australia's requirements are supplied from the Dutch East Indies and the United States of America, by two monopolies - .the Standard Oil Trust, and that association of international Jews, the Shell Oil Company. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. George</inline> D. Meudell has had considerable experience in regard to this matter. </para>

                                <para>- Because the Government have the monopoly, and will not allow private interference in Papua. In maintaining that monopoly they have a responsibility to the people of Australia, to Parliament, and to themselves to deal with this matter in some better way than they have dealt with it hitherto. It seems nothing but playing with this matter when they spend £60,000 in five years, and bore at the rate of less than 800 feet per annum. I appeal to them to put the matter on a business basis, and go ahead with it. It is of vast importance to the internal development of . the Commonwealth. There are plenty of men in Australia who have "the requisite experience and knowledge. The plant required is not very elaborate. One can bore with a diamond drill for tin or gold, even in these war times, at 30s. a foot, and I am informed that it is not any more difficult to put down a bore for oil than it is to put down a diamond drill. </para>

                                <para>- So far as indications go, the oil belt runs from New Guinea to Java, and the probabilities are that supplies of oil will be struck more easily and more quickly in  Papua  than they would be further south.  The-  place should be exploited very speedily, because in Timor, half of which is owned by the Portuguese and half by the Dutch, there are good indications of the presence of oil. If we do not strike it, some one else will. </para>

                        <para>I estimate that our war Budget after the war will be £50,000,000. We will have to spend £20,000,000 per annum on fixed charges of interest on war loans and obligations for repatriation as well as pensions, and we must also look forward to the expenditure of large sums of money upon the development of the defences of Australia. I have already said that I hope the Government will face the position, and that the rich people of Australia will have to bear the biggest part of the burden. I believe that there is a good deal of evidence of misery being an accompaniment of millionaires. The building up of excessive wealth brings in its train extreme want in the community. Speaking broadly and generally, I hope the Government will so shape its financial course that we shall face the obligations of the future, and not pass on too much to posterity. One honorable senator opposite interjected an observation with regard to the War-time Profits Bill. Personally, I think that measure will break down, for I know that two prominent accountants in Sydney each sent in approximately about 100 returns, and by a coincidence only two returns in each 100 were liable to the war-time profits tax. It will be remembered that I opposed this measure, not because it was not a good principle to take war-time profits, but because the Bill was inequitable in its incidence, and did not touch half the rich men. </para>

                        <para>With regard to further avenues of taxation, I was astounded to read in the latest publication by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> that the imports into Australia for the year 1916-17 totalled in value almost as much as those of the previous year. It may be interesting to know that the importation of alcoholic liquors in 1916-17 exceeded the imports of 1915-16 by about £500,000, the figures being £1,985,000 as compared with £1,488,000. In 1916-17 the imports of tobacco exceeded the imports of the previous year by over £100,000, and the imports of motor cars and motor bicycles, &amp;c, wore within £200,000 of those of the previous year. In 1916-17 the imports of motor vehicles exceeded those of 1914-15 by over £60,000. The total imports into Australia from overseas last year amounted in round figures to £76,000,000, as against £77,500,000 in the previous year; and the total imports of 1916-17 exceeded those of 1914-15 by over £10,000,000. I am quite prepared to concede that in bulk the imports. were less, because clearly the value would be much greater than in the earlier years, but it is a puzzle to me to read about the shortage of shipping and the stringency in the shipping business, and then to be met with these figures. And this importation is still going on. It seems to me to be a fundamental principle that the Treasurer should impose an import tax or a super-tax through the Customs in order to get extra revenue from those extravagant people if they will spend their money on imported luxuries. </para>
                        <para>I have had a few words to say with, regard to the Defence  Department,  and do not wish to repeat my remarks, but I would again urge the Minister to take into sympathetic consideration that universal service order and put a strong blucher boot into the Prussianism displayed by some of the junior officers of the Department, of which probably he knows very little. I again urge him to see that sympathy is extended to the men who go into camp, and to give this new Business Commission that has been created tr take over the civil side of the Defence Department absolute powers, subject to his veto. </para>
                        <para>There are one or two other matters to which I now desire to refer. I thirds it is clear that the proposed re-organization of the Ministry means the creation in Australia of a Trade and Commerce Department that is going to be all-powerful with regard to the whole of our primary and secondary industries. This new Department will take under its sheltering motherly wing practically everything now done by the Prime' Minister's Department, and will become a very important Department indeed. My friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Massy</inline> Greene will be the Assistant Ministers, and I urge them with all the power I possess to insure that responsibility rests upon some independent man, who will see that everything goes straight and well. Something has been said about the organization of industries. I can quite understand that it should bt. easy to organize wheat, wool, metal, or anything else that does not vary, but if the Government attempt to organize secondary industries they will be up against difficulties that are not experienced in the handling of primary products. My word, therefore, to the Government in this matter is to go slowly. You cannot pool boots the same as wheat. There are all sorts of grades and prices for boots, and jam, and biscuits, and milk, and commodities of that sort. While I may agree that the organization of monopolies in primary production is a statesman-like policy, similar action cannot be taken with regard to our secondary industries. </para>
                        <para>Just a word or two more. We are asked to pass a Supply Bill for three months, carrying the Government up to the end of June next. In this measure, there are many matters, some of them debatable, of which members have no personal knowledge, the items being covered by one line. Personally, I think it is our duty at this juncture not to  carpingly  criticise the Government; not to keep nagging at them; but to realize the immensity of their obligations, and the difficulties of their administration. It is the duty of the Government also to realize the immensity of their task, and, having had intrusted to them these great obligations, on behalf of the people of Australia, it is their responsibility to see that everything is carried out in an efficient manner so that, when their time comes, they can at least say  they  have done their very best. </para>

                                <para>- But this Bill only passed another House a few hours aso.

To my mind, the attitude of the Government is unfair. </para>

                        <para>We are asked to vote about £77,000 to pay for the rent of Commonwealth buildings. I should like to know why the Government do not find their own premises, instead of paying rent to some greedy, grasping landlord, mostly, I suppose, around the city of Melbourne. Why do they not, out of the funds at their disposal, erect the necessary buildings for their own accommodation instead of paying away public money year after year to landlords in Melbourne and elsewhere? Any Government worthy of the name would have looked into this matter long ago, and instead of paying rent would have constructed buildings for their own use. </para>
                        <para>We have been treated to a very illuminating address by SenatorPratten, who has informed us that he is in favour of what is known as the graduated system of taxation. I, for one, entirely disagree with him. I would not mind if we had a graduated income tax, or if we had no income tax at all. I would not, mind graduated death duties, or if they were wiped out altogether, but I think it is an entirely wrong principle to have a graduation in land taxation, and I am surprised that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> should have enunciated such a principle on the floor of this chamber. We have no graduation in municipal taxation. In the city of Melbourne, for instance, there is no graduation in municipal taxation, although, in. my judgment, it is on the 'wrong basis, the rate being struck on the rental value at so much per £1. If you go over to Launceston, it does not matter whether you are a large man or a small man, a woman or a child, you have to pay a poll tax of 2s. per head. That is, of course, an entirely obsolete system of taxation, and would not be tolerated for one moment in any other place except Tasmania. But it is not graduated, and they do not propose, even there, to impose a tax of 2s. 6d. upon one person and 2s. upon another. All persons, as far as I can understand it, by regulation of the Marine Board, are called upon to pay 2s. per head. It does not matter whether a person who goes to Tasmania lands in Launceston or not; if he merely journeys up the river and down again by steamer, he has to pay 4s. </para>

                                <para>- Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> pay? As in the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle,</inline> the oftener <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> goes over to Tasmania the more frequently the people of the Commonwealth have to pay the tax on his account. However, this tax has one good point - it is not graduated. I desire to offer my strongest objection to the idea of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> that there ought to be graduated taxation; and I am pleased to say that, notwithstanding the views expressed by him and by others, there is to-day a very marked change of public opinion throughout the Commonwealth on this question. As I remarked, in municipal taxation there is no graduation. In New South Wales the local rates are struck at so much per £1 value. It does not matter whether an estate be large or small, or whether the owner be an absentee or not, the same rate for £1 in value is paid. That is a basis of taxation which meets with my approval, and which I should like to see incorporated in any system of taxation which the Commonwealth Government may introduce should they decide to seek for more revenue from the land-owners of Australia. </para>

                        <para>The next annual Conference of the Australian Labour party, New South Wales, which will meet in Sydney in June next, will be asked to discuss about tea motions on the subject. The Barrier District Assembly will move in favour of graduated land taxation on an unimproved basis, without exemptions, and special taxation of land owned by absentees. Paddington (Australian Labour party), in favour of land values being heavily taxed without exemptions, so as to stop the withholding of land from its proper use, this to be the first plank of the Labour platform. Rozelle (Australian Labour party), in favour of land values being fixed without exemption, to pay the interest on the cost of constructing railways and tramways, freights and fares to be proportionately reduced, say, 25 per cent.; this proposal to be made a plank of the Labour  platform. Camden (E.G.), in favour of the imposition of a tax upon all land values, sufficient to meet the interest on the capital invested in the New South Wales railways and tramways, freights and fares to be reduced correspondingly, and also in favour of the taxation of land values without exemptions. Newcastle (E.G.), in favour of taxation on unimproved land values without exemption for the purpose of paying the interest on the cost of railways and tramways, fares and freights to be reduced in proportion to the revenue received in this way. ' St. Leonards (Australian Labour party), in favour of a uniform tax upon unimproved land values to raise revenue to pay the interest on the national debt. Kandos (Australian Labour party), in favour of a tax upon all land values, sufficient to meet the interest on the capital invested in the New South Wales tramways and railways, failes and freights to be reduced correspondingly. Goulburn (Australian Labour party), in favour of taxation upon unimproved land values, without exemption, for the purpose of paying the interest on the cost of railways and tramways, fares and freights to be reduced in proportion to the revenue received in this way. These motions indicate pretty clearly that, notwithstanding what honorable senators opposite may say, there is a growing feeling, at any rate in N6w South Wales, that the idea of a graduated land tax will be abandoned in the near future; and we may look forward to the platform of the Labour party making a pronouncement in favour of a straight-out land value tax without exemptions. In South Australia, where an election has just been held, with a magnificent victory for the Labour party, the platform of that party stands out boldly for taxation of this kind, and a similar attitude is adopted by the party in Western Australia. That is the system of taxation which the Commonwealth Government, if they desire to do the fair thing by the people, will adopt whenever they tackle the question. </para>
                        <para>We have heard something about nationalizing the tobacco and other industries, with the idea of appropriating the profits to supplement the national revenue; but such an idea should not be entertained fora moment. In Glasgow the astute aldermen, who are not elected by the men and women of the city, but mostly by the property-owners, have municipalized the tramway system, and, despite reduced fares and increased remuneration to the employees, they are deriving such enormous profits that they are enabled to meet the whole of the municipal expenditure with the money thus wrung from the users of the trams. Such a principle, in my opinion, is absolutely wrong. The' people who ought to pay the taxation in Glasgow are the people who  own the  place, and not those who use the tramways. </para>

                                <para>- I have no objection to tramways or ferries being nationalized; what I object to is such utilities being carried on by the community and made to provide national or local revenue beyond what is required to carry on the services. These services ought to be undertaken for use and not for profit, and the people who own the country left to pay the taxation. Honorable senators seem to entirely ignore the fact 'that the land of Australia to-day is worth £445,000,000, and that the owners of that land ought to be called upon to bear  the taxation. But the reason why honorable senators opposite desire the tobacco and other industries to be nationalized is, not that commodities and utilities may be supplied cheaper or better, but in order that they may provide sufficient revenue to prevent the land-owners from bearing their proper share of the public burden. It is quite apparent to me that that is the object behind all these moves for nationalization. This, valuation of the land of Australia was obtained from data supplied by the War Census cards, and was stated in a return furnished to the Senate. According to the same return, there is £275,000,000 worth of land that pays no taxation whatever; and yet honorable senators wonder why we cannot repatriate our soldiers, or why people cannot obtain land. The wonder is that people can obtain any land at all under the circumstances. </para>

                        <para>I find that at the next- Inter-State Labour. Conference, to be held in Perth on 17th June, this question of land taxation will come up for discussion, and the business-paper shows that a very considerable number of branches of the Labour party throughout the Commonwealth have had the subject before them. At the Conference I have just mentioned, the Paddington Branch, New South Wales, will propose that land values be heavily taxed without exemptions, so as to stop the withholding of- land from its proper use; and this motion, if carried, will be the first plank in the Labour platform. These persons are of the opinion - and we all know that their opinion is well founded - that the lands of Australia are not being put to their most profitable use. Whether one goes to Hobart, Launceston, Perth, Sydney, or Brisbane, he will find that the houses occupied by the working men are situated upon allotments which are so small that they are a positive disgrace to us. The reason of this is that year after year private land-owners are allowed to hold areas without paying any taxation worthy of the name in respect to them. Yet we are frequently told that a land tax can be passed on. I hold that it cannot. In New South Wales there are two Houses of Parliament. The members of the Legislative Council are a shrewd lot of gentlemen. They ha*6 no hallucinations to the effect that a tax of this character can - be passed on. Around Sydney there are between 50,000 and 60,000 vacant allotments, which, under our Federal land tax are called upon to contribute nothing whatever to the revenue. Some time ago it was proposed that the basis of the rating for water and sewerage purposes should be altered from the taxation of property to the taxation of land values only. What happened? </para>

He may know of one or two cases in which the frontages have been reduced; but I would remind him that under the old system of taxation in Sydney it has been necessary to resume large areas, to pull down the buildings upon them, and to reconstruct them on decent-sized allotments. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> knows that many of the allotments around Sydney were so small that they were a menace to the health of ' its residents.

                        <para class="block">New South Wales some time ago. A measure dealing with the matter was passed by that body with very slight opposition, .because for many years it had been a plank in the platform, not only of the Liberal party, but also of the Labour party. But when the Bill reached the Legislative Council,, the astute old gentlemen there said : " This is a proposal to make us pay more - a proposal to increase taxation." Consequently, they threw it under the table. Recently, a similar measure was again put through the Legislative Assembly and the Upper House was once more asked to pass it. What happened ? The large owners of vacant land there strongly opposed it. Why ? Because they knew that it is impossible to pass the tax on. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Allen</inline> Taylor, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Nash, Sir Thomas</inline> Hughes, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. R.obson,</inline> all have a very shrewd idea as to who would pay this tax. How can a man who owns a vacant allotment of land pass on the tax? The measure to which I have referred is now hung up, with the result that a man who wishes to purchase a home site around Sydney is obliged to pay an enormous sum for it. I should like to know, how the ordinary workman can pay £150 or £200 for a block of land on which he may live. It would take him half a life-time to amass that sum. Honorable senators opposite suggest a graduated income tax for the purpose of securing more revenue. Why? Merely, because they desire to avoid the necessity for levying a tax on the laud-owners of  Australia. It is high time that people were called upon to pay taxation for national purposes (proportionate to the land which they own. The St. Leonards branch of the Labour party affirms " That a uniform tax be placed .upon unimproved land values, without exemption, to raise revenue to pay interest on the national debt." The Lilyfield branch says " That the £5,000 exemption should be abolished from the Federal land tax." The Dunedoo, Kandos, and Annandale branches say " That Conference abolish the £5,000 exemption in the Federal land tax." The Goulburn branch affirms " The imposition of a uniform tax of 3d. in the £1 on all unimproved land values to replace the present Federal graduated land tax; other taxes to be reduced, so that the total amount of Federal taxation may not  be increased by the foregoing proposal." The Lithgow branch says, "That the </para>
                        <para class="block">Conference amend clause 17 (fresh taxation) by an increase in the incidence of the graduated land tax, and by the abolition of the £5,000 exemption." All these branches are in favour of wiping out the exemption and imposing a straight-out flat rate. The Surf ace Workers Union in Western Australia suggests a somewhat similar proposal. A further proposal comes from the South Australian Labour party, " That the £5,000 exemption on land values taxation be deleted, and an all-round land values tax be substituted to help to pay the interest on war loans." I place these suggestions on record,, not as the opinions of the Labour party, but as the views of a very considerable section of that party, and with a view to showing that this question is receiving a very great deal of public attention. </para>
                        <para>In my opinion, the Government will do well to take notice of what is going on, and instead of asking us to pass a complicated income-tax measure, to recognise the proper method of raising money for national purposes. I have not the slightest faith in the repatriation scheme of the Government, unless it is accompanied by heavy land values taxation without exemption. In my opinion, nothing else will bring down land values to use purposes. 'This is the only way in which we can make land cheap. Nobody knows that better than does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> although for several years now he has remained as dumb as an oyster upon it. I think it is up to the Government to bring forward a measure such as I have suggested. I have given some consideration to the question of how the necessary money to meet the cost of the part which Australia has played in the war can be raised. </para>
                        <para>I disagree entirely with many of the things which are being done in connexion with the present war loan, and which have been done in connexion with past loans. It has to be remembered that the contributions to these loans are purely voluntary. We have not yet reached the stage when a compulsory levy must be made. So long as we can get sufficient money for these loans, I do not think a compulsory levy in any other direction should be made. It would be very much better if a larger proportion of the cost of the war was raised by means of direct taxation of the land, instead of being paid for out of loans. Even if the war terminated at the end of the current year, we should be faced with an annual interest bill on our war indebtedness of £10,000,000, and it is impossible to say how much more we shall require to raise on account of repatriation, pensions to returned soldiers, and allowances to their dependants. The only proper method of raising this money is that which I have indicated, and which is so clearly outlined in many of the resolutions which T have  read </para>

                            complained that certain men have been dismissed from the Cockatoo Dockyard because they had not signed the agreement in regard to shipbuilding, and he regarded that occurrence as an attack upon unionism. I should like to point out that the agreement they were asked to sign has been signed by the bulk of the unions engaged in the shipbuilding industry - that is to say, it was signed by them as unions, and not by the industrial members. It does not seem to me, therefore, that the honorable senator is justified in saying that the dismissal of men for refusing to sign the same agreement constitutes an attack upon unionism.

The management of the German Concentration Camp was inquired into by the Royal Commission. I do not say that the Commission inquired into the Government policy of dealing with Germans, but

                            hinted that he did not think the business management of the camp was on good lines. All I can say in reply to that is that the Royal Commission, which, as honorable senators know, was fairly critical, reported favorably on the administration of  the  camp.

                        <para class="block">I have ascertained the facts as to how Hayman came to be at large. On the 23rd July, 1917, two medical officers at the camp reported that he was suffering from incipient locomotor ataxia, which was likely to become worse, and they recommended that, as his people were willing to support him, he should be released. The District Commandant approved of his release. Hayman is an unnaturalized German married to an Australian woman. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> raised this question in the Senate, I asked that a report and the papers referring to the case' should be sent to me, and I attached a minute that Hayman should be watched and a further report made as to his conduct. A further report was made on the 27th September, 1917, in which the police said that Hayman was complying with all the requirements of the law in regard to the restriction of enemy aliens, that nothing objectionable in his behaviour had been noticed, and that any spare time he had when not working was spent in his own home. The police were instructed to report if any alteration in his behaviour occurred, and, so far as the file shows, nothing further has been reported.

The sentry did not seem to know who the Minister was, or what right he had . to enter the barracks, and, although I showed him a number of letters in proof of my identity, he persisted, and quite rightly, in refusing to grant me admission, and it was only through the timely intervention of an officer that I was allowed to pass. </para>

I can quite believe that the Department does not please everybody in connexion with this matter, nor do I think it is possible to do so. I find that we not only displease people if we do not intern aliens, but we also displease men who are quite good Britishers if we do. Some aliens are no sooner interned than we find some quite loyal people are anxious to get them out again. Of course, the regulations are not administered for the purpose of pleasing everybody. They are administered with a definite object in view, namely, the protection of the Commonwealth. The rule I have always laid down for the Department to observe is that if information, of a definite or suspicious character in regard to any enemy alien is received, he is to be interned. If the case against him is not clear, the benefit of the doubt is to go to the country, and not to the alien. We have to administer these regulations through the agency of our Intelligence Staff throughout the Commonwealth, and their duty is to forward to us, after full inquiry, any information they gather in regard to enemy aliens. It may be that very often, as a result of inquiries, the Intelligence Staff become acquainted with facts which are not known to the man in the street, who may think that a certain alien at large is a danger to the community, and for various reasons we cannot let the man in the street know the facts. </para>

As the honorable senator knows, the Business Board has been definitely appointed, and its members are now ready to take up their duties. Before they formally do so the regulations have to be altered. For instance, the present regulations provide for a finance member of the Military Board. That will have to be altered. Then new regulations must be drafted also to give authority to the Business Board. </para>

I quite agree with him. There, however, the personal equation always comes in. We have to deal with human beings, and the trouble is that while, officially, every provision is made for the well-being of the troops, frequently, and unfortunately, we have officers who do not administer the personal equation, who do not mete out sympathetic treatment as they should. </para>

                                <para>- Certainly. The great bulk of the members of our camp staffs to-day are retired officers - men who have had considerable dealings with other men, and the camp commandants have full power to replace officers - to change their staffs. There are officers offering now, and there are, therefore, opportunities to pick and choose, which did not obtain in the early stages of the war. </para>

                        <para>On the question of enlistment for general service, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> says that prior to the issue of that order there was never any shortage for any other unit but infantry. That is quite true. What is more, that is one of the reasons why we were Compelled to issue the order. That is to say,  you have only to look at the fighting today to. realize that those who are bearing the brunt and sustaining the greatest number of casualties are the infantry units. If we were to continue to allow recruits to choose the arm of the service into which they desire to go we would be getting a surplus, probably, for the non-combatant arms, and would have men in camp month after month, doing nothing except training for long periods, while the infantry units went short of reinforcements. </para>

                                <para>- I do not think so, because there has not been anything like a serious falling off in recruits since the General Service* Order was issued. The decline in recruiting has been practically regular. It is now, I am glad to say, going up again, and I hope it will increase by leaps and bounds. But out of 2,000 or 3,000 recruits we frequently find that we get only 200 or 300 for the infantry. If the great proportion of them were, to be recruited for such arms as the Army Medical Corps it would be just as well not to recruit them at all, because we could always get men for those units when we wanted them. And, if they would not go into any other unit they might just as well have stayed at home as go into camp. Numbers of men have enlisted and remained in camp for a year and more before being absorbed as reinforcements into their special units. That sort of thing is extremely costly to the country all the while. To continue it would be to cause unnecessary expense, while at the same time the infantry might be starving for reinforcements. </para>

                                <para>- Certainly ; but does not the honorable senator see that once a man was accepted and had entered military service on the understanding that he was to go into the unit for which he had enlisted, there would be no right subsequently to transfer him, say, from the Army Medical Corps which he had joined, into the infantry. When there was a surplus of artillery reinforcements, and we acted on the advice of General Birdwood, and proposed to transfer the surplus into the infantry, there was an immediate outcry, in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> tells us he joined. It is true that that situation was shortly afterwards overcome, because meanwhile there came a call for further artillery reinforcements. This action has been taken at the suggestion of General Birdwood himself. He found that in every ship we were sending Army Medical Corps and Army Service Corps and artillery reinforcements, but only a small modicum of infantry; whereas what he wanted was infantry, and more infantry. He had already a surplus in the other units. Therefore, he asked that we should enlist men here for general service, and that when they were sent overseas he should be allowed to draft them into the units most urgently requiring reinforcements. If a man conscientiously desired to serve his country he would surely be ready to be drafted into that unit where the need was greatest. Therefore, by enlisting recruits for general service, a man has an opportunity to serve his country; and the Officer Commanding overseas, who should be the 'best judge of his own requirements, has the power to draft what numbers he can secure into those arms where reinforcements are most urgently wanted. </para>

                                <para>- It will require very little effort to draft them into the infantry. My own experience has been all the other way. I have received scores of requests by letters and otherwise, both from honorable senators and from parties outside, that recruits might be re-drafted from the infantry into such other units as the Army Medical Corps. I have never had the experience of a request for the transfer of men in the opposite direction. It certainly paralyzes me to hear this. The desire of the men referred to shall be gratified at the shortest notice. </para>

                                <para>- There certainly are, and because of those special circumstances it is all the more necessary that we should enlist the men for general service. If we had the compulsory system in Australia we would put men in that arm of the service for which they were most fitted, and where reinforcements were most needed. Any military officer will tell us that in the engineers and artillery they are always keen to get mechanics. If there were compulsory military service, men would be drafted as mechanics; but under the voluntary system we must take what we can get, and if there are not enough actual mechanics we must draft anybody whom we can secure. </para>

In the early stages we were told that Light Horse would be wanted; but when the Gallipoli campaign opened they were left in Egypt, and we were told that no more would be required. Nevertheless, we must meet the demand of the moment; and that demand to-day is for infantry, infantry, infantry - not for the Army Medical Corps or the Army Service Corps. And never have we had any difficulty in keeping up the supply of artillery or Light Horse. </para>

                            <para>. - Honorable senators who know anything of the practice of this House will exonerate me from any charge of discourtesy in not having spoken upon the subject-matter of the Bill in moving the first reading. It was suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> as a matter for surprise that I had not referred to the contents of the measure. The proper stage for doing so is upon the second reading, when the particulars of the Bill are ordinarily disclosed. Our procedure, being dissimilar to the other House, the first reading of a measure such as this is recognised as an opportunity for honorable senators to ventilate their grievances, and to bring forward anything they like. There is no occasion for the Minister introducing the Bill to make a single reference to it; and I have followed the practice, in conformity with the Standing Orders, which has been followed ever since the Senate was constituted. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> seemed to regard the introduction of these Supply Bills as a grievance. If there is any honorable senator who should hail them as a blessing, it is he, for they furnish him on each occasion with opportunity for giving us another of his well-known lessons on the virtues of land taxation. </para>

                            made some reference to matters which, I am sure, excite all our sympathies. That was a certain statement as to hardships being faced by a number of dependants of soldiers at the Front. We know that there must be individual cases of very great hardship and privation ; and to those who are suffering we proffer a full measure of sympathy. Having made that statement, and recognising that it is the duty of everybody, especially those charged with Ministerial responsibility, to see what can be done to alleviate the circumstances of those placed as I have indicated, I must point out that there is an obligation upon those who, like
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall,</inline>
                            make these charges, to be at least careful as to their facts before they make them. The honorable senator said that the cases to which he referred seriously and prejudicially affected recruiting. That would be true if they were all authenticated ; but a much more serious effect is produced upon recruiting when gentlemen like
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline>
                            make and remake statements for which there is not sufficient foundation, because they tend to create the impression that these conditions of privation and want are general throughout the States. When the honorable senator some months ago first brought the matter up, he undertook to supply me with a . number of cases for which he said he could vouch. He did so, and I have had them inquired into. At the same time, quite independently of any action I was taking, the Sydney

                            moved, no doubt, by the honorable senator's statements, sent members of its own staff to inquire. Without vouching for the literal accuracy of my words, I can say that they headed their column dealing with the matter with the line, " Charges not Substantiated." They had no possible inducement to do other than record the facts as they found them. I shall place before the Senate the facts of some of these oases. I do not want it to be thought that I am denying the existence of cases of hardship. They do exist ; but it is utterly wrong for any one to create the impression that they are general, and that every statement made in public is necessarily correct. I propose to suppress the names, and to refer to the cases by numbers, so that

I have no doubt they were sent to him as genuine, and that', prompted by sympathy, he assumed that they were all <inline font-style="italic">bonâ fide.</inline> All those I have here are cases he sent me himself. Will any honorable senator say that there is any evidence in the cases I have quoted of ungenerous treatment to these women? I do not know what views honorable senators take of the responsibility that rests upon us, but not one of these women can fairly say that she is financially worse off because of the enlistment of her husband. In every case I have shown that she is financially better off. Here and there, owing either to inability on the part of the applicant to present her case, or for other reasons, it is inevitable that from time to time cases of distress and hardship will arise.. That is an obligation which all these organizations have to endeavour to meet; but a series of cases of the kind I have quoted ought to be a warning to honorable senators to look closely into the facts before they take the responsibility of making public statements, and thereby creating an entirely false public impression. </para>

I do not quarrel with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> bringing these matters forward, except that, living as we do in times when every word 'of a public man counts, either for or against our efforts to obtain recruits, there is a responsibility on all of us, while trying to right anything that is wrong, to refrain from creating an entirely false impression as to the condition in which these women are placed. Let me deal with cases of another type to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> referred. He mentioned the case of a woman in New South Wales whose sou had enlisted, and who claimed that she was dependent upon her son, and, as a consequence, obtained from the Defence Department the separation allowance, and subsequently applied to the Lord Mayor's Fund. I am sorry to say there was no difficulty in getting police reports about this case. A few weeks before the son enlisted, this woman had gone to the police to know if she could not by law compel him to contribute to the upkeep of her house. She said he was hanging around and Would not contribute a shilling. When the son enlisted she came forward and signed a declaration that she was dependent on him. </para>

                                <para>- She could not, in the same breath, claim that she was dependent upon him, for she was not. I can well imagine that when a woman goes to a man like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> she finds no great difficulty in persuading him that she is the most ill-treated person in the Commonwealth. While we have to administer our patriotic and repatriation activities with every sympathy, we must remember that some efforts will always be made to impose on the funds. The obligation is cast on those who administer them, while doing so fairly and generously, to see that the money contributed by the public, or voted by Parliament, is not handed out for any other object than that for which it is intended. All the inquiries I have made so far indicate that, while here and there there .are a certain number of cases that call for' revision, the majority are on the basis of those I have quoted. I do not believe that in one case out of twenty I have inquired into, the woman is in receipt today of less income than she had before her husband enlisted, in addition to which most of them have had substantial grants out of the various funds. </para>

                        <para>I wish to have a word now upon a matter of very considerable interest which was raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas.</inline> I desire to welcome the honorable senator to the ranks of the champions of the rights and privileges' of this Chamber. Those who, like myself, were privileged  to occupy seats here years ago, will recollect that we were sometimes beside ourselves with indignation at the echoes of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator. Thomas'</inline> denunciation of the Senate from beyond these walls. A sinner who turns from sin is always welcome; and I congratulate honorable senators upon having received this addition to the ranks of the champions of our rights and privileges. But let me say there is nothing to be gained in a practical assembly by trying to create a grievance where none exists. I should be as ready as any one else to interpose if any step were taken which might seriously impair the efficiency of this Chamber, or deter it from carrying .out the duties assigned to it under the Constitution. Whilst the Senate has its rights, so has the other branch of the Legislature,' and the fact must not be overlooked that the Government have their responsibilities. The Senate on this occasion, as upon all others, was entitled to appoint a 'Select Committee to make any inquiry which honorable senators desired to have proceeded with. But when the expenses of the Committee, as in this case, exceed the amount which has received actual, or implied, parliamentary approval, and an additional amount is required, the Treasurer who is asked to find the amount, runs the risk of having it refused by another branch, of the Legislature, fie is therefore bound to have some regard bo;bh for the amount required and the purpose for which it is required. If that were not so, the control of another place over the Ministry, or its control of the purse, would be a matter of fiction. Whatever Parliament has made available for a specific purpose can, of course, be dealt with; but the "money now being sought by the Select Committee referred to, has never been passed by Parliament, ana must, therefore, be provided out of the Treasurer's Advance Account, and for every item so provided the Treasurer must justify his action to another place, as well as to the Senate. If the Senate regards the action taken as so serious as to represent an inroad upon its rights and privileges, it can give expression to its will at once by holding up the Supply Bill. The reason why it will probably not do that is that honorable senators will recognise that so drastic a remedy is not called for by the circumstances of the case. But if there were a genuine grievance, that would be the remedy in the hands of the Senate. In this matter, the Senate is in the same position as another place. If a Select Committee were appointed by another place, and a vote for its expenses came along here, we might refuse to pass it. We have that power. But to say that the Select Committee of another place would therefore become the creature of the Senate would be to use terms that would not fit the case. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> himself offered the solution of what otherwise would be an apparent difficulty in a possible conflict between the rights of the Senate and of another place, and the responsibility of the Government. He gave that in the conversation he had with a professor. The supposition was that that gentleman ' said that a democratic Constitution would be worked by sane men. That is the solution. Our Constitution could not be worked upon any other supposition. If honorable senators believe that greater freedom should be given to the Select Committee, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> is  chairman,  to prosecute its work, they can express their will to that effect, and the Government must take the responsibility of responding to, or refusing, the proposal made. No one seriously thinks that the rights of the Senate have been impaired by what has been done in this case. Nor does any one think that if honorable senators were firmly of opinion that this Committee should carry its investigation further, and travel over a greater area of Australia, it would be unable to make that  view known, or that the Government would not treat the expression of such an opinion with the respect it deserved. We ail know these things, and therefore there is no reason to become heroic over a matter of this kind. I feel sure that honorable senators have not troubled a little about it. I have not fol lowed the very useful work, and I say advisedly the very useful work, of the Select Committee very closely. But now that the matter has been raised, I invite the members of that Committee to consider whether any additional evidence they would be likely to secure by further travelling would do. more than merely add to the volume of . evidence of the same kind which they have already taken. They will obtain more evidence if they travel further, but do they expect to obtain different evidence to that which they have already secured? I ask them to consider whether they have not already obtained evidence from such a variety of- sources, and over a sufficiently wide area, that they may regard it as indicative of conditions throughout the Commonwealth, and whether, in the circumstances, they cannot come to a decision on the evidence they have already obtained? If they admit that that is so, I submit that there is no need that they should proceed further with their inquiries." If, after looking into the matter, they feel that they are entitled to ask the Government for additional provision, their decision to that effect should receive consideration. Judging by the newspaper reports of the evidence already taken by the Committee, that taken at one sitting appears to be practically a duplicate of that taken at a previous: sitting. The Committee has visited four of the States, and I ask them to consider whether they can expect that the evidence which they will secure in the other two would be fresh evidence, or merely a repetition of the. kind of evidence they have already obtained. </para>

                        <para class="block">I propose briefly to give the Senate particulars of the amount set out in the Bill, and a very brief statement of figures showing the actual expenditure and revenue to date. </para>
                        <para>This Supply Bill is intended to cover ordinary expenditure on Government services to the end of June. The amount provided by the Bill is £5,068,484. This amount is based on the expenditure estimated by the Treasurer in introducing his Budget in August last. </para>
                        <para>In addition to providing for this expenditure the present Bill in the first schedule proposes to amend previous Supply Bills for this financial year to bring them in conformity with the final provision in the Estimates. </para>
                        <para>The total of each subdivision qf the Estimates is shown in the second schedule to the Bill. </para>
                        <para>The position at the close of the present financial year promises to be good. For the nine months ended the 31st March the revenue was £19,209,000, and the approximate expenditure was £22,953,000. </para>
                        <para>The estimated revenue for that period was £20,500,000, being £1,291,000 more than that actually received, and the estimated expenditure was £25,000,000, being £2,047,000 less than the approximate actual expenditure. </para>
                        <para>In arriving at the exact financial position for the first nine months of the year it is, however, necessary to take into account the sum of £2,077,427, which was brought forward from last year for the payment of invalid and old-age pensions. When this is done it is found that the deficit on the Consolidated Revenue Fund at the 31st March last was £1,666,573. This deficit will .be temporarily met by an advance out of the Notes Fund, for which parliamentary authority exists. It must, however, be remembered that almost the whole of the revenue from direct taxation is received during the last three months of the financial year, and it is highly probable, therefore, that moneys advanced from the Notes Fund will be repaid out of revenue, and  that the  year will end with a balanced ledger, or even with a surplus. </para>

                                <para>- My statement does not deal with the loan expenditure, but only with revenue and expenditure. The Treasurer has expressed the opinion that when the direct taxation is "received between this and the end of the financial year, which, for the reason I have already set out,' will be much heavier for this quarter of the year than for the previous three quarters, the year will close with a surplus of a little over £750,000. These figures were given elsewhere by the Treasurer a few days ago, but I understand from him that the indications which have presented themselves during the "last few days .substantiate that estimate and justify him in saying that, at least, that will be the result at the close of the present financial year. </para>

I ask for the information because this year the Taxation Office is arranging to collect the war-times profits tax, and the figures will give us some indication of the cost of its collection. When the proposed taxation came under review in this chamber, there was a consensus of opinion that it would not produce as much revenue as honorable senators thought should be obtained, and that the cost of collection would be out of proportion to the amount collected. </para>

                                <para>- I had intended to move for the reduction of the vote for this Department by £3,713, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has informed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> has been the cost of maintaining the Commonwealth Police Force for the four months during which it has been in existence, but I realize that the forty-seven men who have been engaged must be paid until their services are dispensed with, and it is reasonable to assume that they will require some notice of the termination of their services. We have been informed that several of the members of this police force have already received three months' notice of the termination of their offices, and as the cost of the maintenance of the force runs to £928 per month, it would be a fair thing to reduce the vote by such an amount as would provide for two months' notice to the full staff. However, I shall adopt the procedure of moving to reduce the vote by £1 as an indication to the Government that the Senate requests the discontinuance of this police force. To-day we heard the  President  express the view that an item of £2 10s. , expended on tips- by a Select Committee during a visit to Tasmania, was unwarranted expenditure at a time like this, when every shilling counts. If every shilling counts, as we know it does, there is no justification for the continuance of an unnecessary police force in Queensland. As a representative of Queensland in this Senate, I desire to remove from that State the stigma which the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> or his Government, have placed upon it. It is an unwarranted reflection on the people of Queensland. If the establishment of a Commonwealth Police Force was justified in that State, surely it would be justified in any other State. If it is true, as we were told the other night by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> and also, by way of interjection, by Senator Russell, that other States have been equally guilty with Queensland in the matter of refusing to comply with requests to inaugurate prosecutions in regard to offences against the price-fixing regulations, why has Queensland been singled out as the only State in which to plank down a number of police officers who are quite unnecessary ? Surely the establishment of a police force was equally warranted in other States. The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has sought to justify the action of the Government by saying that almost since its inception the Commonwealth has had What might be called police officers in several of the Departments of the Commonwealth, for example, the Postal Department, the Department of Trade and Customs, and others. But I question whether those particular officers have been known as sub-inspectors, sergeants of the first class, or sergeants of the second class, or whether they have numbered forty-seven. Is it not a fact that this great increase in numbers has only taken place since the recent little trouble in Queensland ? However, as there is no necessity for continuing the extravagance or for further insulting the people of Queensland, I move - </para>

                            <para>. -  I am reluctant at  this  hour to take up the time of the Committee at any length, but I have  a  grievance which I desire to ventilate before Supply is granted. I wish to protest against the greatest infringement of individual liberty that has yet come under my notice in this country. As I see that the Government have  a  majority, and  a  division must have the same result as in the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks,</inline> I shall only briefly state the facts. A man named Wilson, found guilty of being a member of an unlawful association, was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for six months. The case was brought under my notice, and, exercising the care that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> told us an honorable senator should exercise before making a public statement, I had supplied to me the press reports of the case. The worst point in the police evidence - and I stake my reputation on this - was that the man had taken the chair at a meeting of the Industrial Workers of the World, and had said that he believed in one big union.  His  sentence expired many weeks ago, but I understand that he is still detained. I sent a number of telegrams to the Department in reference to the matter, but received no reply. I telegraphed to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant,</inline> who was in Melbourne, to look into the case, and then I did get a reply to the effect that no information could be given. In my communications I have taken the line of inquiring whether there was any serious reason why the man should be detained, because the evidence at my disposal showed that this man's character was such that his employers, a reputable building firm in Sydney, with whom he had been for two years, had offered to re-employ him if he were released. I rest my complaint on the gravity of the action of the Government in detaining this man - who has others dependent on him - in prison after the expiration of  his  sentence. I do not think that there was any intention on the part of the Government to deport this man. Although he was not born in Australia, his parents had lived here before his birth, but had subsequently gone to New Zealand. As to whether he was born here or in the Dominion, the evidence is very vague. My protest is based on an infringement of individual liberty by  Which  a man, not of criminal record, and for what is practically  a new crime under a new Act, is still detained, so far as I know, after having served his term. I do not think I could put the case any more clearly by speaking further. I communicated with the Department by telegram, and by letter to the Prime Minister himself, but received no reply except the one I have indicated. My impression was that there was something against the man if one might judge by the attitude of the Department; and I thought I was entitled to know the facts, so that I might not be led away on a false track. It is not often that I bring matters of this character before the Senate, and I only do so because, unless there is grave grounds to suspect criminality, this man should not be detained after he has served his term of imprisonment. </para>

We have taken the unusual course of abrogating certain inherent rights of a British subject, and I have defended that course from my seat in this place in connexion with the abrogation of the right of the individual by <inline font-style="italic">habeas corpus</inline> to have his liberty established. We are in a time of war, and because everything is critical, we have to take extraordinary measures. However, the circumstances that have been related by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> are such as might invite the careful attention of the Government. I hope, at any rate, it will be realized that nothing has been done by this Parliament that will take away from the individual his rights, except in so far as is absolutely necessary for the protection of the Commonwealth, and of the Empire now engaged in the war. I accept the assurance given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that he will give his personal attention to the matter; and I hope, for the sake of Parliament as well as for the sake of the Government, we shall have some vindication of the action that has been taken. </para>

                            <para>. - One would have liked to discuss that great " white elephant " of ours, the Northern Territory, but I suppose there will be other opportunities, because it is a matter well worthy of all the attention the Senate can give it, apart altogether from party bias. In this proposed vote, there is an amount of £16,000 for the development of oil fields in Papua. This represents a continuation of the policy that has resulted so far in the expenditure of £60,000, for work which, in the hands of an ordinary mining engineer, would probably have been done quite as efficiently for £10,000. </para>

For five years the men have been at work there, and, so far, have achieved nothing practical; and I enter my protest against the continuance of such a state of things. The Government have created a monopoly in Papua, and, while they will allow no one else to do anything, they are not doing the job properly themselves. I stress again that the discovery and production of oil in the Commonwealth territories is one of the most urgent matters we could be busied with; and I hope the Government will tackle it in a business-like way. If the present control confesses failure, let us call in some one else, and get ahead with the work. </para>

                        <para>I should, however, like to say a good word for the administration of Papua under Judge Murray. I understand that the net cost of Papua to the Commonwealth is so little that the Possession is almost self-supporting. During my several visits there, not only this year and last year, but years ago, I beard from the settlers and the white population generally nothing but good of the Administration. I hope that this Possession will be developed, for it will be one of the most valuable we possess in years to come; and 1 trust that Parliament will be broad enough to make some reciprocal Customs arrangements in this connexion. </para>

                            <para>. - Very serious inconvenience is experienced at the electoral office in making it reasonably certain that electors are duly enrolled. It is necessary in nearly all the States to have two separate rolls, one for Federal electors, and one for State electors. A good deal has been said and written on the subject, and I believe some investigations have been made, but. so far, no practical step has been taken to avoid the necessity for publishing two sets of rolls. </para>

As the boundaries of Federal divisions in that State are not likely to be altered for some time, it is easy for that State to have the one roll for both Commonwealth and State purposes. </para>

                                <para>- Apart from the grouped electorates, the fact remains that each Federal divisional boundary in Tasmania is the boundary  for  each group of electorates. That arrangement cannot be made in Victoria and New South Wales, because in those States the divisional boundaries may alter .according to the fluctuations of the population. In South Australia it is necessary to have one roll for Federal electorates, another for the House of Assembly, another for the Legislative Council, and yet another for the municipal councils. In fact, it is a continuous operation for an elector to insure that his name is kept on the four rolls. Some steps ought to be taken by the Government to see that this matter ' is brought to finality, and that once a man's name is entered on the Federal roll it should automatically appear on the State roll, and remain there so long as he continues in that division. </para>

I have mentioned repeatedly the disgraceful accommodation that is provided for the ordinary working men there. The present Government should not follow in the footsteps of previous Governments, but should, at once, from the resources at their disposal, provide accommodation for the temporary workmen employed at the Capital. It is unfair that temporary employees should be required to provide their own houses, and then, when they are discharged, be able to get practically no compensation. The Government have no more obligation to provide accommodation for the officers than they have to provide it for the temporary workmen. I do not object to the provision of accommodation for the officers, but if the Government can find thousands of pounds to build a house for the Administrator, they should be able to find a little money to provide accommodation for their other servants. </para></speech>

                            <para>. - I take this opportunity of reminding <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> and other honorable senators that, as far back as 1905, we provided in the Commonwealth Electoral Act an opportunity for the States and the Commonwealth to co-operate in the matter of uniform electoral rolls, and, so far as I know, Tasmania is the only State that has availed itself of that opportunity. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> were resident in Tasmania, he would find his name on the Commonwealth electoral roll; and also on the State roll, without any separate effort on his part to register for either. The Electoral Act of 1905 has since been amended to the extent of obliging electors to register for whatever division they are in, and when they go from one division to another to notify the Department of their change of address. The result is that the Federal electoral roll in Tasmania is automatically, so far as the elector is concerned, kept pure. There is no obligation thrown upon the police authorities to keep the roll pure, as has been the case in several other States in the past. All Tasmanian senators will bear me out when I say that during the last thirteen years we have had in that State one set of officers and one set of rolls. Time after time we have been told by the Melbourne press that we are frittering away money by having a duplicate system of registration and control in connexion with- electoral matters. </para>

                            <para>. - I am in entire sympathy with the remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating.</inline> I believe that a very large majority of the people in Queensland would welcome the adoption of the course he has indicated. I may say also that there are many members in the Queensland State Parliament who would welcome a change from the present system, for the reason that at the last State elections there were between 20,000 and 30,000 more names on the State electoral roll than were on the Federal roll, and I am of opinion, although I have no proof of it, that there were more names on the State roll than there were voters in the State. It is time some action was taken to bring about the co-operation of the State and Federal electoral organizations. </para>

                        <para>Another matter with which I wish to deal is the reduction during the last few months in the salaries of temporary employees in the Public Service. I know of deductions which have been made in the salaries of employees in the Federal Taxation Department, but as I am not allowed at this stage to deal with Treasury expenditure, I shall apply my remarks to Commonwealth Departments generally. I enter my protest against any reduction being made in the salaries of temporary employees. At a time like this, when the cost of living is increasing, we should be considering the increase rather than the reduction of the salaries of temporary employees. In the Governor-General's speech last year the Government announced their intention to economize, but I do not think any honorable senator, no matter what political opinions he holds, desires to see them economize at the expense of low-paid temporary employees. </para>

                            <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> drew attention to the expense incurred for renting premises. A good deal of this expenditure, so far as it is an increase, arises from the necessity for providing accommodation for those commercial undertakings which have developed in consequence of the war. The policy of the Government of the Commonwealth for some years has been to rent rather than to build in Melbourne, because of the anticipation, which some little time ago was general, that in a few years the Parliament would be moving to Canberra. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has sufficiently answered the questions raised regarding electoral law. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> who raised the question of the oil fields, knows the policy being pursued so well that he is inclined to regard it as ill, but the representations he has made from time to time in this chamber have not been lost sight of. I have forwarded them on to my colleague who has control of that important Commonwealth responsibility. I can assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> that he is quite wrong in regarding the reduction of the salaries of certain temporary employees in Queensland as part of a general policy. There may have been individual cases where the readjustment of some Department has brought about a reduction here or there, but generally speaking every move lately has been to increase salaries in the Public Service of the Commonwealth. I shall be glad if the honorable senator will furnish me with particulars of the cases he has in mind, so that I may look further into them. </para>

                            <para>this afternoon, in answer to a question by myself regarding the manufacture of enamel in Australia, stated that the. enamel made here was not good enough to be used for the purposes of military medals. This is an industry that will give a large amount of employment to returned soldiers. I have seen the enamel manufactured from the raw material, and seen the medals stamped out, and the enamel placed on them. I shall have great pleasure next week in showing the Minister the finished article, made in Australia by Australian workmen. I cannot promise to give him one, because they are made in connexion with the Red Cross movement, and cost a guinea each. If the enamel is not good enough, it is fair that the Government should make an attempt to perfect it. It should not be left to private individuals to introduce industries of that description, that would give employment to a large number of returned soldiers. It is a matter of repetition work, all done by machinery, on which the men could be given a standard wage. Most of these things are made today by female labour, which I have ob- 'jected to for a long time unless the women receive the same pay as the men. I do not say the enamel is good for anything else, but it has been proved good for the purpose of medals. I hope the Minister will go beyond the decision of his expert, and look further into the matter. I have some knowledge of the industry, because in years gone by it was necessary to obtain annually a number of medals for a certain association, and I know what I am talking about. If the enamel is fit for the purpose of making medals it can be made fit for other things, and if that is done an industry can be established that will give a large amount of employment to returned men. </para>

Has any request been made that the Government should train considerable numbers of aviators in view of the ample facilities existing here? If so, have steps been taken to give effect to the request? The establishment of the Woollen Mills at Geelong is one of the best things ever done by a Commonwealth Government. It is an industry that gives a great deal of useful employment. We ought to make a strong protest against the labour of returned soldiers or others being used to provide a lot of unnecessary trinkets. One would think we were a walking pawn-shop to see the number of trinkets some people display. This industry cannot be classed in that category.

Certain plant is being obtained, and the working out of plans, levels, and surveys is proceeding. It is proposed to locate the arsenal at Tuggeranong, where land has been acquired for the purpose. That is practically as far as we can go at this juncture. The intention of the Government is not that the arsenal shall be the sole establishment for the production of war material in Australia, but that it shall be the nerve or brain centre by which our industries shall be linked together. Leading hands and foremen will be given a course &gt;of munition making in the arsenal, and will then go back to their respective factories. We hope to have scattered throughout Australia men. who, in time of war, will know how to carry out certain operations for the supplying of munitions. lt is not easy to obtain machinery at the present time. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> could not get machinery for woollen mills now if he were to offer ten times its value; but we intend to get machinery as we can. </para>

                                <para>- It is pleasing to have the statement of the Defence Commission that the factories of the Department are a success, particularly the saddlery and clothing factories. But the statement of profit and loss hinges entirely upon the charges made, and the credits given in the accounts of the factory. We should be able to compare the  cost of the productions of the factories with the prices of private manufacturers. </para>

                            BOLTON (Victoria.) [11.20]. - In view of the report of the Royal Commission which inquired into the administration of the Defence Department, some of the officers of the Department, who have proved to be incapable and altogether unsuitable for the responsible duties intrusted to them, should be dealt with in a way in which they would be dealt with if they were employed by a business man. To those acquainted with the ways of the Defence Department the discoveries made by the Royal Commission are not so alarming. It is what the Commission failed to discover that is alarming. There are conditions existing on the Instructional Staff with which the Minister is not familiar, but with which he should be familiar. That branch of the Department is not altogether a very happy family - a state of affairs which is, I think, brought about by the fact that a number of eligible men, who are kept at home, are regarded as indispensable.
                        </para>
                        <para>The extraordinary feature of the whole situation is the direct and definite animus which is displayed towards returned soldiers, a fact which I have had brought under my notice on more than one occasion. One case in particular reflects very seriously on the administration of one branch of the Department. A returned soldier, who was employed in it for some months and was discharged, interviewed an officer with whom he had served at the Front, and in whom he had confidence. He explained his unfortunate position, and the officer told him not to be afraid to submit a report in black and white. The soldier did so, and an inquiry was held. It would be unwise on my part to wash dirty linen in public, or give great publicity to details, but if the Minister would look into the matter he would see that there are certain cliques in different branches of the Department who  work  in one with the other, not only for the purpose of neglecting their duty, but also, as has been proved, for the purpose of improperly appropriating and applying to their own use, not only the Department's time, but also departmental material. </para>

                        <para>It is a notorious fact that returned men have very little chance of attaining high place or high pay in various branches of the Defence Department. It has been shown over and over again that nearly all the highest paid positions are occupied by men who have not been to the Front, or, if. they have been away from Australia at all, have only been on transport work. Men, also, on home service, with no previous military experience, are to be found occupying these highly paid positions. The Royal Commission has reported that there are bootmakers and shoemakers employed in the Pay Office. I am informed that one man who is at the head of a pay branch was a letter carrier before the war, yet he has been promoted to a commission, and given a high rate of pay. </para>

                                <para>.-There is another matter which, I think, I should bring under the notice of the Minister. Among the returned men are a number of the permanent staff, called staff sergeants-major, who volunteered for service, and have won high rank and great honour on active service at the Front. During the war period a number of men, no doubt for good reasons, have been promoted to the honorary rank of staff sergeants-major without going to the Front. These latter have the pay and duties of their rank, while a number of the staff sergeants-major who have returned, after doing splendid service, have been reduced from the rank they won on the field of battle to the rank of warrant officer, in class 2. It will be seen that a man who has fought for his country is reduced to non-commissioned rank on his return, while others, who have never been from Australia, are permitted to retain that rank, to which they have been promoted from that of warrant officer. This fact creates resentment amongst the men who have done their duty to the country, and is also seriously affecting recruiting; and the Minister should take steps to in some measure relieve the situation. </para>

                                <para>.-I believe there is something in what you say. Some reference has been made to reductions of pay in the service. Within the last fortnight I have had several letters from returned men, who were corporals and sergeants in the Army Service Corps and various branches, to say that, for reasons they do not know, they have been reduced to the ranks, involving a reduction of pay from 9s. to 5s. a day. A corporal at Seymour writes that, without any complaint being made against him, he has been reduced from the rank of corporal to that of private. </para>

                        <para>I observe an item of £337,960 under the heading of "Universal Military Training (Citizen Forces)." I was under the impression that it was the duty of the Government to devote all its energy, and all its military effort, to matters that affect the war. I now see that nearly half-a-million of money is expended on work that does not assist in any way to win the war. The training of the Citizen Forces is carried out under great difficulties, and is not, in any shape or form, of military benefit to the men. Infantry are sent into camp without rifles, and Light Horse without horses, and they hang about for eight days or so, wishing to God they could get out. There is no interesting work for them, and the whole thing has degenerated, not only into something that is unnecessary, but into something that is really harmful to the military spirit of the young men of this country. The same remark applies to the vote for the Senior Cadets. </para>
                        <para>I was in Tasmania some time ago, and had an opportunity of inspecting the camps there. It struck me that, considering the small number of recruits that are secured in Tasmania, an expenditure of £20,000 or £30,000 per annum on a camp is bad business management. There is plenty of room at Broadmeadows for the twenty or thirty recruits per week which are raised in Tasmania, and they could be in the Victorian camp in two days. It seems absurd to have so many small camps throughout the Commonwealth, with large staffs, doing practically nothing; and I suggest a little more concentration in this direction. Another proposed expenditure which I do not understand, but which the Minister may be able to explain, is that of nearly a quarter-of-a-million of money for ammunition. It is extraordinary that that amount should be required for this purpose, because, so far as. I know, very little ammunition is being manufactured here or sent out of the country. </para>
                        <para>I am convinced that the spirit that is apparent amongst the employees of his Department is one which, if it continues, will never give satisfactory results. I used to have a commanding officer who said, " Show me a good captain and I will show you a good company," and also, " Show me a good company and I will show you a good captain." The matter rests largely with the responsible officers in charge of the Department. If these men have not the initiative or backbone to do what is right - to have the courage of their opinion and discharge incapable men - we will not get a service that will do its work honestly, energetically,' and efficiently. </para>

                            <para>. - I would suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> that he has said some things to-night without having previously examined their full import. He started by making' against the employees of the Department, as a whole, a serious and general charge of the misappropriation of Government property. Even though by interjection I was able to narrow his charge down to the Ordnance Branch, it still remains a serious accusation. The employees of the Ordnance Branch are in every State of the Commonwealth, and they deal with the very largest group of the Defence Department's activities. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton's</inline> charge will appear in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> as having been levelled against the whole of those employees, because he did not particularize any set of employees. When the honorable senator reads in cold print what he has said, he will realize that it is unjust to make a general charge against the whole of the employees in a branch because he has heard of individual cases of misappropriation. </para>

                                <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> really believes that statement, he ought not to vote for the passing of this Supply Bill, but should move for a Royal Commission to inquire into his- very serious charge. Recently, a Royal Commission inquired into the Ordnance Branch, and, although they criticised it very severely, they did not report the discovery of any  misappropriation such as the honorable senator referred to. Having regard to the fact that the Commission employed two highly-qualified accountants, who were independent of the Department, to investigate all the transactions and stocks in the Ordnance stores, and to make a very minute examination of the whole administration of that branch, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> is pretty daring, to say the least of it, to make a sweeping charge of the character he has made to-night. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable senator has seen fit to keep his facts to himself. He never told me of these things. As a member of the Senate he has responsibilities to the public, and one of those responsibilities is the protection of the property of the taxpayer. If he has knowledge that there is misappropriation of Government property in the Ordnance stores, it was his duty to acquaint the Minister of that fact. But I hear this charge to-night for the first time. </para>

So far as the Pay Branch is concerned, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton,</inline> or the Returned Soldiers Association, can produce before me to-morrow any men having accountancy qualifications, I can offer them well-paid positions in every Military District in Australia. We issued that invitation to the Returned Soldiers Association, and did not get a single response. I have in my bag at the present time a minute from the finance member of the Military Board to the effect that he has applied time after time to the Returned Soldiers Association for men with financial or accountancy qualifications, and has been unable to get them, and he has asked me to endeavour to borrow officers from other Departments, because he finds it impossible to get men with accountancy knowledge outside of the Government service. </para>

I do know that letters were sent to the Returned Soldiers Association asking that body to let us have the names of any qualified men. We have been compelled to secure the services of men from the various States who were engaged in businesses of their own. We have had to appeal to their patriotism to come forward. We have district paymasters coming to us for £600 or £700 a year, and leaving their own business where they were getting up to a couple of thousand. We have all along been understaffed with capable men in the Pay Offices, and still are. </para>

                        <para>The question of the staff sergeants-major and honorary rank is a very difficult one. I do not complain of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton's</inline> criticism. It is an anomaly, and we are trying to find some way to rectify it. We had some 400 staff sergeants-major on our administrative staff. We could not let them all go to the war. We wanted them here to train our soldiers, but we agreed to let a certain percentage go. Those who were kept here wanted to go to the war just as much as . those who were allowed to go. Those who went had the chance of gaining commissions in the field or being killed. The men who were retained here asked if they could be allowed to obtain honorary commissions here if they qualified. We wanted commissioned officers for training purposes, and so we gave them every opportunity of gaining honorary commissions. A certain number did so. A certain number of those who went to the Front also did so. Now, those who have come back from the Front have to obey the rule by which rank in the Australian Imperial Force does not confer substantive rank in the Commonwealth Military Forces. This is a very sound rule, because we are trying to send them all to the war in turn, and they might all come back generals or colonels. We would then have a permanent staff consisting of colonels or generals. </para>

                                <para>-I am considering that point. There is a certain amount of justice in the contention; but I want to deal with the matter as a whole. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> brought up the case of one man, who not only gained an honorary commission, hut the military cross on the field. He comes back, and, on the distinct understanding on which he went away, reverts to his position as sergeant-major. That is not right on the face of it, and I am looking for some way to do equal justice to all. It cannot be done in the off-hand, slapdash style that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> seems to approve. There are men still away, and men here who cannot be given an opportunity to go. Whatever I do must be just to the men who were allowed to go and who gained their commission, and to the men who wanted to go and were not allowed. </para>

                            suggested that we might save the vote of £300,000 for the training of the Citizen Forces. That would mean suspending the operation of the Defence Act in time of war. So far from agreeing to that, the Government propose to extend it. They recognise that the present position of home defence is unsatisfactory. We propose to stiffen the Citizen Forces by enlisting men who are not eligible for the Australian Imperial Force between the ages of twenty-one and fifty, and, if possible, to extend the time of training, because we cannot see what is going to come out of this war. There is the possibility that we may yet have to fight in this country, and we ought to have a force here able to deal with all contingencies.

                                <para>- The honorable senator distinctly asked what we wanted the item " Ammunition " for. We want it in order to keep a certain amount of ammunition in Australia in the event of the enemy, by any chance, being able to get here. We are, therefore, continuing the annual vote. </para>

                        <para>The honorable senator said we had too many camps. Already we have been concentrating them. Bendigo and Seymour have been abolished, and we have been concentrating at Broadmeadows. The same applies to the other States; but the recruiting authorities are now asking for more camps. They say we want camps where' the people can see the training going on, as this will stimulate recruiting. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton'sproposal</inline> were adopted, and all the soldiers were brought to Melbourne, the people in the other States would never see the men training at all. When a soldier enlisted he would have to say farewell to his friends, as he could not be sent home to his own State for final leave. </para>

                            <para>. - In reading the report on the administration of the Defence Department, I have not picked out the nasty parts, as some honorable members and many of the papers have done. I have also read the pats on the back given to the Department, and was very pleased to notice that special commendation was given to the administration of the Pay Office in Queensland. I believe it is well staffed by men who, with very few exceptions, conscientiously carry out their duties. Recently, however, a case came under my notice of a woman, named Rebecca Wright, who had two little children, and whose husband was at the Front. It was surmised by the District Paymaster that she had been receiving two allotments in- stead of the one to which she was entitled. She was accused of having drawn pay at two offices - at the Central Office at the General Post Office or at the Desmond Chambers office, and also in the Valley. An officer of the Department hearing this, stopped her pay pending inquiries. I saw the woman leaving the office in tears, and sympathetically asking the cause, discovered what had happened. The allowance to a soldier's wife is little enough, and it is a very serious thing for a woman with two little children to be without money for a week, or even for a few days. </para>

                                <para>- Very many soldiers' dependants are living from hand to mouth, the allowances to them not being as large as we should like them to be. Immediately I brought the matter under the notice of the Minister he had the pay restored. But, in the interval, had not assistance been given from the local Patriotic Fund, the woman would have been in a very deplorable condition. The point I wish to make is that, in cases of this kind, the Department should treat dependants as innocent until they have been proved guilty. </para>

                                <para>- Yes. It was subsequently discovered that there was no truth in the allegation that this woman had been drawing two allotments. Prior to the Minister's interference, I sent a telegram to the Defence Department in Melbourne urging that payments be continued, and just as I was leaving for the north to take part in the referendum campaign I received a reply to the effect that that could not be done until certain inquiries had been made, and that the matter was before the Crown Law Office. I do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> knew anything about the case until I brought it personally under his notice. The officials in Brisbane were blameworthy for stopping the payments, to this woman ; but the authorities in Melbourne, who issued the instruction that, pending inquiries, the payments should not be recommenced, were still more blameworthy. I hope that the Minister will issue the instruction that, in cases of this. kind, payments to dependants shall not be stopped until it has been proved that wrong-doing has occurred, and that the Department has a just case. </para>

For some unknown reason they have great difficulty in obtaining their annual leave, and a large amount of 'leave is owing to many of them. Their work is particularly trying, and therefore I urge the Minister to rectify this grievance. </para>

I have never said a word against unionism; in fact, I would persuade a man to join a union, but it is a serious infringement on the liberties of the employees on whose behalf I speak to compel them to pay compulsory levies. This union has struck a levy on its members to support the anti-conscription movement and to subsidize the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Daily Standard,.</inline> Many of them are entirely out of sympathy with both these objects. </para>

                            <para>- It is not the intention of the Government to deprive any one in any Department of the leave to which he is entitled under the Public Service Act. There must be some special circumstances operating in the case referred to by the honorable senator. Probably it is due to the fact that a number of telegraphists have gone to the war. In such a. case the holidays will be made up. to the men at a later date. I know nothing of the other matters to which the honorable senator has referred, but I shall see that they are brought under the notice of the Postmaster-General at the earliest possible moment. </para>

                            <para>. - I know that in many cases the casual employment of temporary men in the Public Service cannot be avoided, but the practice has grown to such an extent that it may become dangerous to the efficiency of the staff generally. One weakness lies in the fact that a considerable portion of the time of the permanent employees is occupied in teaching temporary employees the work which they have to do. A temporary hand, after learning the business, may not remain in the position for more than a month, and then another temporary employee has to go through the same operation. It is time the Post and Telegraph Department took into serious consideration the whole question of temporary employees. In my opinion, it would pay the Department to increase the number of permanent men. It would make the work more efficient. It would lead to better supervision, and might prevent a great deal of the pilfering that is taking place. As a rule, the permanent employee joins the Department as a lad, and is under continuous notice in doing his work. In time he grows up to realize that he has some interest in the work of the Department and in its general efficiency. I have no desire to asperse the characters of men who are brought in as casual hands, but they come from no one knows where, they are generally unemployed who seize the opportunity . of getting work, and they are called upon to do something to which they are not accustomed. I know that the system applies generally, but it is time we adopted a policy of staffing each Department with men who know their business and have an interest in the work of the Department as a whole. </para>

                            <para>. - Shortly after the outbreak of war, the Fisher Government determined that no permanent appointments would be made to the Public Service except in very exceptional circumstances. That rule was to apply for the period of the war. It was felt that those who went away to make sacrifices for their country should not come back to find themselves handicapped by reason of the fact that the positions which they previously held were occupied by those who had remained behind and had not made sacrifices. It may be true that temporary men are- not efficient, through lack of experience and training in postal work, but Australia should be prepared to put up with that lack of efficiency on their part in&gt; order to give some little return for the sacrifices which are being made by those permanent men who have gone away to fight for us. Our 'appeal for recruits would be useless if we had to tell the people that on their return they would not get an equal opportunity of securing positions in the Government service with those who enjoy the comfort of staying at home. </para>

                            <para>. - There is an item of £1,000,000 for the Commonwealth trading vessels, and I ask the Minister whether a balance-sheet will be laid on the table of the Senate in due course in regard to the trading of these ships, on the lines of the balance-sheets submitted in connexion with the Defence Department's factories? I presume that in the item of £183 for contingencies in the Military Branch of the Defence Department there may be included some cab hire for General Stanley and Colonel Thomas. In my opinion, the first progress report of the Royal Commission conclusively shows that General Stanley is not equal to his job. I direct attention to page 7 of that report, where, speaking of the Contract and Supply Board, the Commission reports that, prior to the creation of that Board, the system of purchasing military supplies was "most  unbusiness-like,  and that there is strong evidence of much waste of money through the faulty buying by inexperienced persons in the employ of the Department." I understand that General Stanley is responsible for this defect. General Stanley was an officer of Artillery in the Permanent Forces, and succeeded to a job which virtually put him in control of the whole of the business transactions of the Department. </para>

The words I used, I think, were that, the report of the Commission was a tribute to the unsuitability of General Stanley for the position, and the accountants, in their reply, made a most scathing reference to  Colonel Thomas,  and said in the most definite terms that he was unfit for the position. I am completely satisfied with the reply given by the Minister for Defence, that the new Business Board will take entire control, subject only to his responsibility to Parliament, of the whole of the civil side of the Defence Department. </para>

I hope this will usher in a new era; and I only regret that the Minister did not make the announcement much earlier. I take it that the item 132 in reference to war pensions is merely a book entry, as is another item in connexion with the Department of Trade and Customs. I do not think I am in order ; but, on the question of commissions which I was discussing in connexion with the item of £1S3 for contingencies, I should like some information from the representative of the Government as to how the Business Board, or the Royal Commission, is getting on with regard to its report on Naval administration.

Owing to the resignation of one member of the Commission, the Government, on the advice of the  chairman,  have decided on the appointment of an additional member to complete the inquiry on the Naval side. A gentleman has been selected, and is being communicated with; but, as we have not reached finality in the matter, I am not in a position to state his name. He is a well-known business man in Sydney, with special qualifications for this work. When he has been appointed, the inquiry on the Naval side will be completed, and the Government propose to consider whether any further inquiry is to be made in regard to expenditure overseas, where, it will be realized, a great deal of our expenditure lies. </para>

                                <para>- I understand that it is the intention of the Government to have reports dealing with all those trading concerns, on the lines suggested. Arrangements to that end are being forwarded as fast as possible, but the enterprise in regard to the trading vessels is a vast one hurriedly entered into, and the arrangements are only now being formulated. </para>

                            <para>.- The Auditor-General, in his early, report on the finances of the Commonwealth, draws attention to the incomplete accounts in connexion with the Commonwealth line of vessels. No complete accounts have ever been put before Parliament, and, seeing that those ships were purchased at least two years ago, speaking from memory, I think a reasonable time has elapsed, and some further information should be afforded to honorable senators. </para>

                                <para>- I am speaking of the sixteen vessels originally purchased by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> during his visit to London. Those ships were purchased with public money, and have been trading at a profit. The transaction has turned out to be an exceedingly good one for the country, but I think that after two years has elapsed Parliament and the country are entitled to a balance-sheet. </para>
