                        <para>- On Thursday last, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> drew my attention to a paragraph appearing in the newspapers, in which it was stated that fifty-two men of Australia&#39;s First Division had returned to the Commonwealth on furlough. Seven of these were said to be in New South Wales. It was stated that there was no welcome to them &#39;of a public nature, as no one was aware of their arrival, and they were not treated as returned soldiers. There was a complaint that they were not supplied with tram passes. It was said that they were nearly all married men, were drawing only a fraction of their pay, and that no deferred pay was given to them. I made inquiries into the statements appearing in the paragraph, and the reply is as follows :  - </para>

                        <para>The men referred <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> were shown on the ship&#39;s Nominal Roll as on duty. No documents showing in what way they were to be disposed of were received from the General Officer Commanding, Australian Imperial Force, until some time after - having been, apparently, delayed in transit. </para>
                        <para>The correspondence showed that General Birdwood had decided to utilize on transport duty, with the object of giving them two months&#39; leave in Australia, officers and men who left Australia in 1914 and had not returned there since their original embarkation, preference being given to those married men whose family circumstances are in any way distressful. </para>
                        <para>Instructions were immediately issued to District Commandants, explaining the circumstances of their return, and ordering that their leave should commence from the date of disembarkation, and be on full pay. </para>
                        <para>It will thus be seen that embarrassment was caused by the men arriving before their papers. As all future batches of men will be under the same conditions as this one, District Commandants will be in a position to make suitable arrangements for dealing with them as soon as they arrive. </para>
                        <para>In connexion with this policy of returning men on transport duty for leave, it should be clearly understood that, in the selection of the men to be so treated, no pressure can bo exercised from Australia, as the matter is entirely in the hands of the authorities abroad, who arc fully seized with the desirability of giving preference to married men and cases of family hardship and long service. </para>

                    <para class="block">This measure is the outcome of recommendations made by the Royal Commission that inquired into Defence administration. The formation of the Business Board of Administration is one of the recommendations of that Commission which was adopted by the Government. When the Military Departments of the States were taken over by the Commonwealth, there were different practices obtaining in the States in regard to the employment of what might be called the civil staff of the State Defence Departments. Some of the employees were public servants under the Public Service Acts of their respective States. As honorable  senators are aware, in the case of all transferred State Departments - and the Defence Department was one of them - the public servants of the States were taken over by the Commonwealth with all their rights under the State Acts. In some of the States certain of the employees of the Defence Departments were not public servants, but had been appointed under State Defence Acts. They were in a different category from the State public servants. These civil employees very frequently held clerical positions. There waa again another class of employees, who were semi-military officials, and were appointed under the Defence Acts of the various States. So that, as a result of the transfer of the State Defence Departments to the Commonwealth, we had a Commonwealth Department, on the civil side alone, with no less than three different classes of employees. It was frequently found that in one office three different classes of employees would be sitting alongside each other doing the same work, &#38;ut subject to different conditions of service. When the first Commonwealth Defence Act was passed, no alteration was made, except to incorporate those who Bad been in the Public Services of the States in the Public Service of the Commonwealth. Those who were civil employees not under the Public Service Acts of the States came under the Defence Department either as civil employees or later as military staff clerks. In later years very few appointments were made to the Public Service Branch of the Defence Department, most of the new appointments being made under the civilian regulations of the Defence Act. </para>

                            <para>- It will apply generally to all clerical staffs of the Defence Department. When the war broke out, an enormous and obviously a temporary expansion of the staff of the Defence Department became necessary. The number of temporary employees to be engaged was so great that it was extremely unwise to appoint them under the Public Service Act. If honorable senators will refer to that Act, they will see that it is possible only to engage a temporary employee for six months, with the possibility of an extension for a further three months, or nine months in all. That would involve a continually changing staff, and the continuous engagement of new men, absolutely inexperienced in the work they would have to perform. In consequence of that, it was decided that these appointments should be made under the civilian regulations of the Defence Act. After some experience that method also was found to be unsatisfactory, for the reason that it was necessary that we should secure the benefit of the experience which the temporary employees gained in the Defence Department, and they should not, therefore, be in a position to leave the Department in the lurch when they wished, because, perhaps) they received a better offer elsewhere. To meet this difficulty, a Pay Corps was formed, in which men were enlisted for the term of the war, thus taking from them the option of leaving the Department, since they were practically enlisted as soldiers. The object was to secure a permanent staff during the war, and at the same time to reserve the power to dismiss those who proved to be inefficient. This has undoubtedly led, as the Royal Commission testified, to a very great increase in the efficiency of the Pay Branch. </para>

                    </continue>
                    <para>Then, on the Ordnance side, in. both clerical and general divisions, we have public servants, many of them taken over from the State Departments, with all their accruing rights; men appointed under the Defence Act, both clerical and general; and others who represent military appointments. </para>
                    <para>Then there is a class known as military staff clerks employed under the Defence Act, and separated from the Public Service. The reason for this is that, in the event of an invasion of Australia, these men would have to be treated as soldiers. They would not have the right to resign in time of war, and would have to go wherever they were sent, since it is obvious that, in the event of an invasion, it might be necessary to shift the headquarters anywhere. It is, therefore, clear that the clerical side of the Defence Department should be under orders in the same way as soldiers. These men were therefore enrolled as military staff clerks. The conditions of their promotion, transfer, and so on, are governed by Public Service regulations. They are,  in fact, public servants, but they do not come under the Public Service Commissioner. </para>
                    <para>Honorable senators can see that under a system such as that there is great diversity of control and, in consequence, inefficiency. It has been decided therefore to establish a Business Board of Administration which is to take control, under the Minister, of the civil and business side of the administration. It has been thought desirable that for the period of the war and twelve months afterwards all these varying classes shall be brought under the one set of conditions and the one control. </para>

                            <para>- I shall come to that presently. This will put them all on the one basis. There is not the slightest doubt that the reform is urgently required, and should be given effect to as soon as possible, especially as we now have a centralized form of control, through the Business Board, whereas previously the control was not centralized. There were numbers of different authorities dealing with different branches, such as ordnance, military staff clerks, pay, and the ordinary clerks staff. We could not have that uniform system in such circumstances. Now, however, all have been brought under the Business Board. And, having the centralized control, we should have a uniform policy also. </para>

                            <para>- The military side will be entirely separate from the civilian side. The Commandant will retain full control and power in his district; and, for purposes of discipline, the civilian side will be under him, as previously. But all other considerations pass to the civilian control. It will be the duty of the civilian control to see that the Commandant has an efficient clerical staff, It will not in any way impair the efficiency of the military side, but will take away from it the control which it is the least fitted to possess - that is, the civilian control. </para>

                    <para>One of the recommendations which the Commission made was that Public Service officers employed in the Department should be brought under the Defence Act, and should be deemed to be persons employed in a civil capacity for purposes in connexion with the Defence Force. The Commission also recommended that arrangements be made for military staff clerks to be employed in a civil capacity in connexion with the Defence Force. It was pointed out that divided control of officers existed in the Department to-day, involving varied conditions of employment. This Bill is designed to abolish that divided control, and to bring all persons employed in the Defence Department in a civil capacity under the one set of regulations. </para>
                    <para>The Bill is intended to come into force upon a date to be fixed by proclamation, and will continue in force for the duration of the war and for twelve months thereafter, but no longer. If Parliament assents to the measure it will be necessary to make certain amendments in existing regulations; and, to give time for that procedure, the Bill will come into force by proclamation, and not automatically upon the signature of the Governor-General. </para>

They are, for the period of the war, and for twelve months thereafter, seconded from the staff of the Military Pay Corps, and they will all come under this enactment. Then, if during that term, they have received promotion - which will be  upon the recommendation of the Business Board - or if they are transferred or are disrated, and are reduced in salary for some offence - all such considerations will be based upon the recommendations of the Business Board.

                    <para>There are certain rights of public servants laid down under Part IV. of the Public Service Act, which rights are required to be maintained. First, we require all public servants to insure their lives. That obligation must bc maintained, otherwise an officer might cease payment of his premiums, and then, when he has returned to the Public Service, he would be uninsured. We have to provide, therefore, that officials shall continue to pay their premiums. The giving of leave is governed by the number of years in which an officer has been a member of the Public Service, or, in other words, by the term he has served under the Public Service Act. And, although he has ceased to be a public servant, the period which he serves under this Act is to be counted as service under the Public Service Act. So that there, again, his rights are to be conserved. </para>

                    <para>Concerning loaned officers, it must be remembered that those will include not only persons who have been already loaned, but others who may henceforth be required. When such officers are loaned, they will automatically come under this Statute. There is a clause in the Bill to meet the cases of loaned officers who may not desire to come under its provisions. It is not proposed that they shall be forcibly taken away from the Public Service. A period of fourteen days is to be allowed after the commencement of the Act; or, in the case of future transfers, after the commencement of employment in the Department, within which officers may signify that they do not desire to be brought under the Act. It will be assumed that any officers who do not express their desire to remain under the Public Service Act shall have consented to be brought under this Act. </para>
                    <para>There is another right, or privilege, possessed by public servants which it will be necessary to conserve. It is not proposed that the operation of this measure shall prevent an officer of the Defence Department, or an officer of any other Department loaned to the Defence Department, from securing transfer or promotion to another Department during the continuance of this Act. For example, a man. may be an officer under the Public Service Board, or in the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department. The Public Service Commissioner treats the whole of the Service as one institution, and an officer under the Department of the Postmaster-General has the right to apply for a position in any other Department where promotion may be offered. It is necessary, then, to safeguard loaned officers; so it is provided that they shall be eligible for transfer or promotion to any office in the Commonwealth Public Service just as if they had remained under the Public Service Act. Of course, it is provided that no such transfer or promotion shall be carried into effect unless the Minister, in writing, has consented to the officer concerned ceasing to be employed in a civil capacity in the Defence Department. That is essential in order that the Minister may not lose that control over his officers which this measure is designed to confer. In the strenuous times which the. Department is at -present experiencing, it may not be in the public interest to permit an officer to leave the Department. Public interest must be the first consideration; but consent, to the transfer or promotion being carried into effect will not be withheld where a suitable successor can be found to carry on the work performed by the officer in question in the Defence Department. If the Minister is unable to give his consent, the transfer or promotion will nevertheless stand. The officer will still continue to be employed in a civil capacity in the Defence Department as an officer loaned from the Department to which he has been transferred or promoted. </para>
                    <para>I come now to the question raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton.</inline> Under the Public Service Act, if an officer is charged with an offence, or with being -inefficient, or incompetent, that charge must be lodged by the head of his Department. A Board of inquiry must then be appointed, the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> and procedure of which are set out under the Act. The Board will comprise a representative of the branch of the Service to which the officer belongs, a representative of the Permanent Head, and a representative of the Public Service Commissioner. The Board will conduct its investigations! and upon its report the Com missioner will have to make his recommendation. The procedure under the civil regulations of the Defence Act are an exact copy of the Public Service regulations in that regard, but there is an essential difference between the control of a branch of the Service, such as the Defence Department in war time, and a branch like the Customs Department, or that of the Postmaster-General. Boards of inquiry have in some cases continued their investigations for as long as six and nine months before a finding has been presented. Necessarily., such a procedure could not, and should not, effectively be applied to a service of the nature of the Defence Department, which is actively engaged under war conditions. </para>
                    <para>It is proposed, therefore, that the regulations shall practically substitute for the Inquiry Board the Business Board of Administration, which will be in a position to make recommendations to the Minister as to the dismissal, or disrating, or transfer, of any officer under the Act. There are three classes of officers to be considered in this regard. First, there is the official who has been appointed under the Defence Act, and whose rights or privileges in that regard could at any time be altered by the Minister for Defence, by regulation. For convenience, and to keep in touch with other Departments, the Minister has adopted similar regulations to those existing in the Public Service, but there has been no obligation upon him to do so. Then there are military staff clerks and members of the Pay Corps, who may be dismissed at any time. These officers have a right to claim a Court of inquiry, but it remains with the Minister to say whether or not he will grant it. There is also the Public Service Officer who is appointed to the Defence Department, but who is governed by the Public Service Act, and. the Public Service officer who is loaned to that Department. In regard to military staff clerks, members of the Pay Corps, and Public Service officers appointed to the Defence Department, we propose to deal with them in regard to the questions of dismissal for inefficiency, disrating, promotion or transfer, through the Board of Administration making recommendations to the Minister. Where a loaned officer commits some offence which the Board thinks should be punished, it will have the .power to recommend that he be returned to the Public Service Commissioner. It will then be for the Commissioner to decide what action shall be taken in regard to that officer. The Commissioner may proceed against him under the Public Service Act by charging him with an offence, or may restore him to the position from which he was taken. Another feature of the Bill is that, whilst the war continues, and for twelve months thereafter, no permanent office is to be created in the Department of Defence under the Public Service Act. Any new office which may be created, will be created under this measure. </para>

                            <para>- If a new office has been created, yes; but not if an officer has been appointed. The honorable senator knows that under our Public Service Act the procedure followed is that before a person can be appointed to the Public Service there must be an office to which he can be appointed. Under this Bill it will be competent to declare a new office. Then an officer who is already in the Service may be appointed to it, or applications may &#39;be called from persons outside the Service. </para>

In the Ordnance Corps, possibly, the men will been listed; but the conditions governing that corps have not yet been laid down. All that has been agreed to by the Government is that there shall be an Ordnance Corps, and the Board has been asked to frame conditions under which it shall be established. One of the conditions which at present obtain in the Pay Corps is that a man enlists for the period of the war. </para>

                    <para>There is a difficulty in regard to officers who may be loaned to us from another section of the Service, or who may be in the Defence Department. Many loaned officers who were occupying, perhaps, subordinate positions in other branches of the Public Service, have, by reason of the necessities of the times, been called upon to discharge more responsible duties, and, &#39; as a result, are in receipt of higher salaries. Where an increase of salary is given to a loaned officer under this Bill, it will be treated as if that officer had been given that increase in the Public Service. It is only equitable that he should be remunerated for the services which he renders; but it is not in the public interest that he should be permanently raised to the higher class when it is known that the work will cease within a year or two after the termination of the war. In some cases this increase will be granted as an allowance. For instance, a postal officer loaned to the Defence Department may gain an increase in two ways. He may be entitled to an increment in the ordinary way, or he may be called upon to temporarily discharge more responsible duties in the1 Defence Department. In such cases the position will be met by an allowance being granted to the officer while he remains in the Defence Department. He will thus lose nothing, but will be paid for the more responsible work which he performs while associated with that Department. All officers of the Defence Department on re-transfer to the Public Service, will again become subject to the Public Service Act. Their salary on return, transfer, or promotion, will not be less than that received by them at the time they were under the civilian regulations under the Defence Act. </para>
                    <para>No permanent office is to be created in the Defence Department under the provisions of- the Public Service Act. In lieu thereof, civil offices may be created, that is, offices under the civilian regulations. In making an appointment to such an office, the Governor-General will state the opinion that, but for the passing of this Act, the office to which the appointment is to be made, would have been created under the Public Service Act. It&#34; is desirable that this point should be settled on the making of the appointment, in order that the appointee&#39;s obligations in regard to life assurance may be determined. If it is an appointment which would, but for this Act, have been  made  under the Public Service Act, then- the appointee must insure in  accordance with Part IV. of the Public Service Act. The reason for this is that as the appointee will eventually become an officer of the Public Service, he should, at once assume the obligation placed on all other public servants, of insuring his life. Clause 11 is intended to maintain uniformity between the Defence Department and the Public Service in the matter of increments, so that officers of the one shall gain no advantage over those of the other, and so that officers who become subject to this Act shall not gain or lose in the matter of status as compared with officers of other Departments of the Public Service. It is a safeguard also to assure that when officers return to the Public Service they will be on the same mark as, in all probability, they would have attained had they remained subject to the Public Service Act. </para>
                    <para>Clause 13 provides that service in the Public Service and service, in a civil capacity in the Defence Force, shall be regarded as continuous with each other, and the one included with the other for the purpose of determining any rights to which the officers are entitled, such as leave based on length of service. </para>
                    <para>Clause 14 deals with the consequences following upon the expiration of the Act. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> provides that all offices in the Defence Department which, by virtue of the Act, ceased to be offices under the Public Service Act, -shall again become offices under the Public Service Act. The next paragraph sets out that public servants, both those permanently attached to the Defence Department and those temporarily transferred from other Departments, shall again become subject to the Public Service Act, just as if this Act had never been passed. Another provision is that all civil offices created in the Department during the continuance of this Act, which, in the opinion of the Governor-General, as expressed on making the appointment to the office, would have been created under the Public Service Act if this Act had not been passed, shall be deemed to be offices under the Public Service Act in the Defence Department. The persons appointed thereto will become Public Service officers. When officers revert to the Public Service Act, they will go back .at the salary they are receiving at the time under the civilian regulations of the Defence Forces. In order that the salary an officer will thus receive on re-transfer to the Public Service Act may be as nearly as practicable the same as he would have received had he remained under that Act, provision is made in the Bill that officers in the Defence Department shall be treated in the matter of increments as nearly as practicable on equal terms and conditions with officers of similar status in the Public Service. It is also provided in clause 10 that any extra remuneration granted to defence officers for extra responsibilities imposed on them during war time shall be payable solely in the form of an allowance while carrying out the higher duties. </para>

                            <para>- For the simple reason that the Royal Commission did not profess to be a Commission of lawyers. They recommended only the lines upon which we should proceed. Their recommendations were considered by the Government, adopted, and then referred to the Crown Law officers, with instructions to draft a Bill to give effect to them - nothing more and nothing less. Moreover this Bill, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has it before him to-day, has been referred to the Business Board for their consideration, and they have approved of it. Upon that Board is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McBeath,</inline> who was  Chairman  of the Royal Commission, and he has approved of it without qualification. So that what we are putting forward in this Bill is merely intended to give effect in legal form to the recommendations of the Royal Commission. I hope that the measure will have a speedy passage, and I ask honorable senators, no matter what may be their views on the Public Service Act generally, to abstain from entering into a general discussion either upon the faults or the merits of that Act. As honorable senators know, the Public Service Act, as a whole, is under the consideration of the Government. The Acting Public Service Commissioner is only holding an acting appointment- </para>

                            <para>- It may be. The whole Act needs to be reviewed in the light of the changes which have occurred since it was passed. I ask honorable senators to regard that Act- as the <inline font-style="italic">status quo,</inline> reserving to themselves the right to press their views for an amendment of it, when it comes up for amendment, as it must shortly do. I ask them to give lis the additional powers that are contained in this Bill so far as the Defence Department is concerned, in order that we may get a more satisfactory service in the very important branches with which the measure deals. I refer particularly to the Pay Branch, which is doing a tremendous amount of work. Very few honorable senators have the slightest idea of the amount of work that it is doing. Recently I invited the members of this Parliament to visit the Pay Branch in order that they might see for themselves the work which is being done there, and I deeply regret that so few of them saw fit to accept that invitation. </para>

                    <para>. - I can only repeat the assurance that the clause does not impose additional taxation unless it may be an infinitesimal . fraction in certain cases. Originally the exemption was allowed in a set proportion in the case of joint incomes, some being deducted from the income derived from personal exertion and some from the income derived from property. That involved! a multiplicity of calculations, because there are many mixed incomes in Australia. It has therefore been thought, desirable to simplify matters by taking the exemption in the case of joint incomes entirely from property if the income derived from property is big enough to permit of that being done, and, if not, so much of the exemption is taken from it as represents the amount of that in income, and the balance is taken from the income from personal exertion. In order to give effect to that arrangement an alteration is made in the point at which the exemption vanishes. Originally that vanishing point was &#163;748 in the case of income from personal exertion, and &#163;506 from income from property. They are both merged as one income now, and the vanishing point is fixed at &#163;627, which is the mean between the two amounts I have just mentioned. The purpose is not to obtain any greater revenue, but is merely to simplify the calculations consequent on the distribution  of  the exemption between those two classes  of  income. </para>

                        <para>- I  am unable to meet the honorable senator there. The point he raised referred to allowances for depreciation. That is covered by paragraph <inline font-style="italic">e</inline> of clause 14. We are moving for the recommittal of that paragraph, although the honorable senator had the opportunity of discussing the question when the clause was before the Committee. I recognise that at that time there was a mild head of steam on, and that probably the honorable senator inadvertently overlooked the matter, but I do not think he ought to ask for the recommittal of the whole clause, nor can I acknowledge any obligation to assist him in securing the recommittal of clause 2. The matter the honorable senator wants to raise on that clause was mentioned in Committee, and he was informed that he could submit his proposal as a new clause. He did not avail himself of that opportunity. </para>

                    <para>. - I  point out that the honorable senator has had every reasonable opportunity of discussing any portion of the Bill, and therefore I think it is stretching it a little  bit  too far for him now to seek to open out a wide field of discussion by moving for the recommittal of the whole of the clause referred to, especially as the  one  point  which  I understood from the honorable senator&#39;s representations he desires to have discussed is included in the motion. In the interests of the orderly and expeditious transaction  of  business I think that even the generous instincts of honorable senators should not carry them too far, and I hope, therefore, they will join with me in dissenting from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten&#39;s</inline> amendment. </para>

When it was last under consideration, some discussion took place as to  whether the  exemption would date from the time  of  enlistment or embarkation, and the  question  was further involved by the possible case of an Australian enlisting in some other unit outside of Australia. I have drafted an amendment to meet the case; but , I think the better course would be first to strike out the clause and insert  a  new provision. </para>

                    <para>. -  It will be remembered that, on the second reading of the Bill, I pointed out how undesirable it was for the Commissioner to take up the rigid, narrow, and often harsh, attitude he adopts with regard to allowances for depreciation. I mentioned that it is felt throughout the community that the one thing necessary for our financial salvation in the future is increased production. I say that this is an age of machinery, and the more perfect we can make our machinery the better it will be for Australia. The attitude which the Commissioner of Taxation takes up in allowing, as a rule, only  5 per cent, for the depreciation of plant and machinery in the various factories and other industrial enterprises in Australia is manifestly unfair. It is well known to anyone who is familiar with the subject that machinery is scrapped very much earlier now than it used to be a generation ago. In America an intricate automatic machine of to-day may be scrapped for a better one tomorrow. That means progress. The reason for the scrapping is that the new machine gives a better return. Now what is the attitude on the matter of depreciation which the Commissioner of Taxation takes up ? Take the case of a tin shop, in which there are intricate machines dealing with tin plates for the manufacture of tins. The Commissioner says that there may be an allowance of 5 per cent, for depreciation on machinery of that kind. It is not an allowance of 5 per cent, every year, but of 5 per cent, on the diminishing value of the machinery calculated on his basis. The result is that it takes thirty years practically to write off the item, at the rate of 5 per cent, on the diminishing amount. Yet this intricate tin-making machinery will not, on the average, have a life of more than seven, or, at the outside, ten years. The business man, of course, must allow 10 per cent, every year on the original cost of machinery such as this. Take the case of a confectionery manufactory, a jam, or preserving, or canning factory, and also the machinery in the engineering shops in Sydney, and I ask any man who knows anything about&#39; what is going on to say whether the life of that machinery averages more than ten years. </para>

                <para>And further, this matter has relation to the rapid development of Australia, and that is a factor which should be considered by the Committee. If we place any check upon, or discourage the scrapping of old machinery for new, we shall be putting a brake upon the wheel of production. So far as I have ascertained, the whole of the secondary industries of Australia, generally speaking, consider they are imposed upon by the Taxation Commissioner in regard to the amount&#39; which he allows for depreciation. The remark has been quoted, in the course of debate/ &#34; Look at the profits made; look at the amount we allow you/&#39; I have given some thought to that phase of the question, and I cannot see how book entries can mean an addition of any further capital to a business. It has been stated that the 5 per cent, allowed as depreciation on machinery is earning profits. Maybe it is earning 20 per cent, in profits, but I cannot see how it is earning any at all; and if the Minister will make that clear I shall at least have received a lesson in business ethics. </para>

                        <para>- So far as I can see, the only additional capital in the business, as a result of any allowance in depreciation on plant and machinery, is the difference between what the taxpayer ought to pay to the Commissioner upon his assessment, and what he does pay. For instance, if a manufacturer has &#163;10,000 worth of machinery, which, on the average, he must replace in ten years, the only sound, businesslike and reasonable thing is for him to deduct &#163;1,000 each year from the original &#163;10,000 until the whole of the amount has been written off. He does not get that &#163;1,000 in cash. It is a book entry. </para>

                </continue>
                <para>The Commissioner says he will allow only 5 per cent., and will deduct only &#163;500 per annum, and that that 5 per cent, shall be only on the diminishing value of the machinery. The result is that in about eight years the manufacturer, with his nearly obsolete machinery, has it in his books at a book value of &#163;2,000, while the Commissioner has it in his books practically at a value of &#163;7,000.. If he goes on for another two years the manufacturer has to buy more plant and machinery, and he has piled up a book reserve fund for doing so. The </para>
                <para class="block">Commissioner would practically assess him then on &#163;15,000 worth of machinery. But I cannot see what capital the Commissioner puts into the business by his diminished allowance; and the only thing that will be saved by the manufacturer, if he gets all he is entitled to, is some few pounds&#39; reduction in the rate of income-tax on the difference between fair depreciation and unfair depreciation. </para>
                <para>This is a bigger question than some honorable senators, perhaps, realize. It means either encouraging or discouraging a man from buying up-to-date machinery, and helping to swell the country&#39;s industry. I am not asking more than that when a machine becomes obsolete, if the Commissioner has not allowed a reasonable reduction, then, when the machinery is scrapped, the difference between what the Commissioner has allowed and the realization by the owner upon it should be written off - the amount thus written off to be applied to the purchase, let us say, of new machinery. The methods of the Commissioner are inflicting hardship upon the primary and secondary industries of the community. There should be more generosity observed. </para>

                        <para>- If it were to amount to a great concession, it would mean a great remission by the Treasurer, and a great additional burden upon other sources. If the Treasurer were asked to give up but little, then the measure of encouragement to industry would be but little. I am not going to pretend that I can. expand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten&#39;s</inline> knowledge of business procedure; but I can justify my statement that it is perfectly fair, in considering the question of depreciation, to assume that the amount written off for depreciation every year is not permitted by any business man to remain idle. It is put out in some investment, earning interest. Let us take the simplest form of sinking fund. What happens when, each year, a certain amount is set on one side to meet the capital outlay at the end of a given period? It is put out at interest. An individual, or a firm, puts out such a sum as will represent - with the interest which it earns at the end of the period - the capital amount required. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> states that it is only a book entry. It is a mighty substantial one. In an ordinary business, with a profit, say, of &#163;1,000 per annum, on the assumption that one had to make no provision for depreciation, there would be &#163;1,000 to distribute among shareholders or to go into the pocket of the proprietor. But, having to allow for depreciation, only &#163;900 is distributed. Profit amounting to &#163;1,000 was made. What becomes of the other &#163;100? It is not locked up in the cash-box. It is either put into the business, or is placed in some other investment. It is earning interest all the while; and that must be taken into consideration. Nobody knows better than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> that all reserves are put into the capital of a company, and are earning the same rate of profit&#39; as is secured by every other section of the capital controlled. </para>

Will he go further and say that where it can be shown by the Commissioner that the allowance for depreciation outlasts the life of the machinery, that official shall take the difference? </para>

                        <para>- I admit that, but it has always been in excess of the amount necessary to be written off. Every sound business man adopts that method. If 5 per cent. is sufficient, he wipes off 7 per cent. or 10 per cent., and, the more profitable a company, the more prone it is to write off a larger sum in order to hide the profits which are being made. We cannot shut out eyes to that. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I have also known public bodies to protest against things which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has advocated, but that did not prove that the honorable senator was wrong. Unless it be possible to arrive at some formula by which we can determine with scientific and mathematical precision exactly the rate at which every piece of machinery will wear out, how can we adopt any other method than that we are adopting to-day ? How can we do other than leave men free - as they are to-day - to put before the Taxation Commissioner their evidence, to go before him and show that they are not getting a fair deal? In the circumstances I do hope that the Committee will not accept the amendment, which would operate unfairly to the Treasury and the taxpayers generally. </para>

                    <para>. -  I think the Minister was quite right in reminding the Committee that very often money written off for depreciation is re-invested, and is, to a certain extent, reproductive. But I would point out to him that if this capital is earning profit for its owner, it is, at the same time, liable to taxation. Not only does it increase the revenue of its owner, but it also increases the revenue of the Commonwealth. If the amendment be accepted I believe that it will do away with a good deal of the irritation that undoubtedly exists to-day. </para>

                        <para>- It will do away with a great deal of the irritation and injustice which is done under existing legislation. All that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> proposes is that when, from any cause whatever, machinery has to be scrapped, its owner shall be allowed to write off in his books the balance of the capital cost remaining on that machinery. The honorable senator was quite right in saying that machinery often has to be scrapped for other reasons than wear and tear. Some of us saw a very apt illustration of that in the Commonwealth Woollen Mills at Geelong, which we visited on Monday last. There we were shown several spinning machines, and we all marvelled at their perfection. But after we had seen seven or eight machines of that particular type, we were shown one which does quite the same quantity of work and which occupies only half the space. </para>

                        <para>- But if that concern were being conducted by private enterprise, and if, in normal times, a competitor came along and equipped mills with the latest machinery, I venture  to  say that the pioneer firm in the industry would have to throw out its old plant and spend, perhaps, many thousands of pounds in putting itself upon an equality with its rival. We desire to encourage enterprise, and the use of up-to-date methods, and the Committee will be doing only what is reasonable and just - and what will eventually prove to be in the interests of the Commonwealth - if it adopts the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- I was remarking, when I was interrupted, that the correct principle to follow is to tax a man upon his income. But if, unfortunately, a man has to scrap one of his machines which has become valueless, he will not be taxed on his income if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten&#39;s</inline> amendment be not adopted. I think it is only reasonable, where a man has to scrap a machine, that he shall be allowed to deduct from his income the value of that machine. Otherwise we shall be taxing him on what is not income. If, for example, he purchased a machine for  &#163;1,000,  after the lapse of two years, a little more than  10  per cent. would have been written off as depreciation. In other words, that machine would be valued at  &#163;850.  Then, if he were suddenly called upon to scrap that machine, he would make a loss of that amount. Surely it is a fair thing, then, to allow him to write it off his income. </para>

Now, if he be not entitled to write off the value of the machine upon scrapping it, I submit that he will be the victim of an injustice. The Minister has said that business men usually allow for depreciation a larger rate than experience has shown to be necessary. But it is within the power of the Commissioner to cut down that rate. Where scrapping takes place the individual concerned undoubtedly loses money. </para>

                    <para>.- No honorable senator who is a big Australian and desires to see Australia progress can possibly vote against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten&#39;s</inline> amendment. I am supporting it purely in the interests of progress. We continually hear cries from every part of Australia that we should support home industries and encourage Australian manufactures so that they may meet competitors from other parts of the world on a fair basis. The amendment will materially assist Australian firms now struggling under adverse conditions in the endeavour to compete successfully with other markets. The Government should give every encouragement possible to manufacturers to scrap their machinery and install machinery which is up-to-date. The point made by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> that some revenue would be lost was fictitious, because the amount of revenue lost on account of machinery being scrapped will be more than compensated for by the extra revenue received by the Government through the purchase of new machinery, and from the additional earning power of the firms who make improvements. When the war is over there will be a cry throughout the world for economic production.. Owing to the amount of scientific research which has taken place since war was declared, and the continual improvements made in every branch of machinery, a great deal of the machinery that was considered quite up-to-date in  1914  is inadequate for future requirements. In America, where machinery has reached a higher state of perfection than in any other part of the world, the rate of wages of the artisan is considerably higher than elsewhere. That is due to the high rate of production and the fact that the factories are so up-to-date. In the Ford motor industry higher wages are paid than anywhere else, and </para>

                <para class="block">I understand that the lowest paid man employed by that concern receives&#163;1 per day. Probably in America they have a Government that encourages manufacturers to be up-to-date. If our Government truly desire to see our home industries flourish, they should accept the amendment. Another class of machinery that depreciates rapidly is that used in farming, owing to its constant exposure to the weather. On my way to Geelong the other day I noticed a large amount of farming machinery lying idle in the paddocks, although apparently not more than a few years old. </para>

The simple issue is whether the Government will encourage Australian manufacturers to progress by giving them a fair chance to bring their machinery up to date and compete with other markets, or whether, through stubbornness, they prefer to leave things as they are. </para>

We arc living in a time when we have to be rather severe in our taxation, and the taxpayer for some years to come will have to pay taxes which would probably not be imposed in normal times. This Parliament, like other Parliaments, lays down the principle on which taxation shall be based. Having created a system of income tax, I, with other members of the Legislature, have employed professional men to carry out the policy of this Parliament. The Commissioner of Taxation has been instructed by Parliament to give effect to the income tax principle, and we look to him to do it. Wo one has been more severe in his criticism  of  that officer than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> who compared the work done in the New South Wales Income Tax Department with that of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. Many people will certainly derive considerable advantage from the allowance of 5 per cent, upon their plant. Others, perhaps, may suffer some disadvantage. Considering the exigencies of the circumstances, and in view of the fact that people who, under normal times, might well claim exemption, will have to pay a direct tax towards the upkeep of the nation, I am not going to assist any member of the Committee to extend exemptions in cases such as this. Consequently, I will vote against the proposed alteration of the clause, and adhere to the suggestion that the Commissioner should be held responsible for carrying out the instructions of this Parliament. </para>

                    <para>. - My honorable friend seems to have missed the whole point. My amendment was deliberately designed to make it mandatory on the Commissioner to allow the difference in cost of machinery in relation to depreciation and the value of machinery that is obsolete or scrapped. It is exclusively confined to machinery that gets out of date and can no longer be used. It only indirectly affects the question of depreciation, and, in my opinion, is manifestly an act of simple justice that ought to be done to any firm that desires to progress. We shall be placing a premium on inefficiency if we allow the Bill to pass as it stands j but if we incorporate the amendment I have submitted, we shall be placing a premium on efficiency, and providing every one with an incentive to use the most up-to-date machinery obtainable. I was much interested in the few remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll,</inline> and I emphasize that, in America, where, probably, manufacturers have reached a higher point of efficiency than in any other part of the world, machinery is not regarded as efficient if it is more than a few years old, and that, in fact,, in some cases machinery three and four years old is regarded as having outlived its usefulness. I urge members of the Committee to clarify their opinions on this matter. My amendment will only affect obsolete and scrapped machinery, and I ask honorable senators to. do the fair thing. I am not surprised that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> should vote against it; but I do not think he has given any good reasons why it should not be accepted. As a matter of fair play, the principle I have laid down should be incorporated in the Bill, because I am confident it will do a good deal to stimulate the future development of, and to increase production, in, this country. </para>

The professional members of the Commonwealth Public Service are, no doubt, capable officers, but it is not my intention to swallow piecemeal every Bill which may be prepared by them, and submitted by the Minister. I also want to say that my reason for supporting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten&#39;s</inline> amendment is not that I desire to see the revenue reduced, but rather, by encouraging the use of up-to-date machinery, to see it increased. We may differ as to the method by which taxation may be raised, but if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten, Senator Crawford,</inline> and I, or any other honorable senators, express their views on a particular matter, I do not know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> should be under any necessity to preach us a Sunday school sermon on the subject. </para>

While, on the face of it, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten&#39;s</inline> amendment appears reasonable and just, and I suppose it appeals to the majority of honorable senators, we ought to bear in mind, as has been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle,</inline> that at the present time the Government require  all the revenue they can possibly get, and that the future  will  be so serious from a financial stand-point that we should do nothing to deplete the revenue in any way. </para>

                        <para>- No; I want more information. I want to know whether we would lose or gain by the adoption of the amendment. If the retention of obsolete machinery is really interfering with production, Parliament, by legislation, should endeavour to encourage the installation of new machinery, thus leading to greater production. We must remember, however, that the amendment will really open the door, and that other concessions may be asked for. We gave way the other day in regard to mining plants. Personally, I was in favour of exempting expenditure for developmental purposes; but I realize how hard it is to differentiate in regard to mining plants. Now we are asked to authorize a somewhat similar concession. </para>

                    <para>. -  I am not prepared to accept the dictum laid down by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> that Parliament should swallow any line of procedure recommended by the Department in the collection of taxation. It appears to me that, on the contrary, Parliament should indicate the lines on which its administrative officers should proceed; and I take it that that is the principle now before the Committee. It seems to me that the advocates of the amendment have provided very good reasons for its rejection. They have emphasized the fact that the clause, as it stands, would have the effect of preventing the installation of up-to-date machinery, and the consequent retention of obsolete plant; and, further, that the exemption for depreciation value, on the 5 per cent. basis, would not be fair. The slight difference between the 5 per cent. which the Commissioner is prepared to allow and the  higher  exemption suggested by the amendment  is  infinitesimal from the manufacturer&#39;s point of view, because the additional return from the installation of up-to-date machinery would cover the difference many times over if a manufacturer followed modern methods of commercialism. </para>

                        <para>- That is my line of argument. I say that the exemption allowed by the Commissioner would not prevent the installation of modern machinery. The difference as represented by the amendment would be so slight that it would not be a factor in comparison with the added returns, and the greater revenue to the manufacturer himself, by the adoption of modern machinery. I am one of those who, from the first, opposed exemptions. I opposed even an exemption of the gold-mining industry; and I agree with the view advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> that it would be difficult to draw the line, once we open the door to exemptions. I, therefore, oppose the amendment, because <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> do not think the clause will  retard  the development of industry on up-to-date lines. It is, I think, fair that  the  Commissioner should fix depreciation, as in  the  past, on the 5 per cent. basis. </para>

                        <para>- It &#39;has never been contended that an allowance for depreciation is not quite fair. Even if the allowances made in 1916-17 for depreciation did amount to &#163;4,000,000, that only goes to show the extent to which this matter concerns those who are carrying on the industries of the country. What&#39; we are trying to do is to prevent any unfair differentiation. I venture to say that if one of our coastal vessels were lost, the difference between the value of the ship and the amount received in insurance would be allowed to the owners. </para>

                        <para>- I instanced the total loss of a ship, and did not. refer to what occurs when a vessel or any other property is disposed of by sale. The need for a more substantial allowance for depreciation is rightly urged by those who are not allowed to write off the value of machinery which has had to be scrapped. The practice of the Department touched me closely only recently. Those controlling a sugar mill in which I am interested had to throw out three boilers ten years before it was expected that they would have to be replaced. We had to spend a sum of &#163;4,000 in replacing them, and it seemed to me most unfair that we were unable to write off the amount of capital represented by these boilers, and be allowed for it as a deduction in the income return. That kind of thing is happening in connexion with businesses generally every day in the week. </para>

I have repeatedly urged them to take advantage of the fact that they have a majority to impose taxation upon those best able to bear it. I condemned this Bill from start to finish, but I could get no support from Senators Pratten and Crawford and those who are now supporting them. Honorable senators seem to forget that machinery is very scarce in Australia to-day, and it is most difficult to secure it. They overlook the fact also that machinery in Australia at the- present time, so far from having depreciated, has appreciated in value to a material extent. </para>

                <para class="block">Under the Act as  it  stands  at  present no depreciation is allowed upon buildings, although every one must recognise  that  buildings represent a considerable portion of the capital invested  in  almost every business. The proportion varies a great deal according to the character of  the  business carried  on.  If  my  amendment  is  agreed  to, as  I sincerely hope  it  will,  it  will  be for the  Commissioner . to say what rate of depreciation should be  allowed  upon buildings. I presume  that  the rate would vary according to the class of building. There are some industries  in  which buildings represent a considerable proportion of  the  capital invested. This is particularly the case in connexion with rural industries. In some of the States, buildings for the accommodation of rural employees, dairies, and other buildings connected with the dairying  industry  must be provided  in  accordance with a standard  fixed by  the State Legislatures. I contend that  it is  most unfair that while depreciation is allowed upon machinery, implements, utensils, rolling-stock, and articles used  by  the taxpayer, no depreciation is permitted with respect to buildings. They are necessary for the production of income. It does not matter what amount of repair is effected, the time comes when buildings must be renewed. In some parts of the Commonwealth where there are serious cyclonic disturbances, against which there is no form of insurance, buildings are sometimes destroyed, and must be replaced at great expense. </para>

Buildings housing plant used in many of our important industries &#39; are in all respects tools of trade; they are machinery used for the purposes of production. I fail to see that the principle of depreciation should  not  apply to buildings. It is logical and just that they should be included with those  items  on which depreciation is allowed. </para>

                        <para>- Many erections are so built. In view of the appreciation in the cost of building material, there is little, if any, depreciation in buildings to-day. Do honorable senators expect the Committee to exempt their palatial manufacturing buildings from taxation? I think a little of this sort of thing will do honorable senators opposite good. The cost of machinery has gone up enormously; so has that of building material. In fact, it is almost impossible to build to-day. We may be sure that for a number of years, irrespective of whether the war terminates shortly or not, prices will go still higher. I hope the Government will oppose the amendment. </para>

After discussion, the Committee struck out the first portion of the clause, which was then section 50a, and agreed to concentrate on the second portion, namely, flection 50b  -  making that applicable to all defaulting taxpayers who came within its compass.

Subsequently they were informed that the wireless school was to be closed, and that - whether they wished it or not - they would be transferred to general reinforcements.

                            <para>- Yes. If I chose to read further I could show that he affirms that he cannot further assist recruiting while the present position continues. He feels that he has been deceived, in that these men are about to be sent abroad in a service for which they did not enlist. This is regarded as trapping men into the Forces in order to send them away as general reinforcements. I understand that the Director-General of Recruiting has forwarded a sympathetic reply to the representations that have been made to him. although I do not know the exact terms . of that reply. I am inclined to think that both that officer and the State Recruiting Committee desire that these men shall bc attached to the branch of the service for which they specially enlisted. If the tactics which have been adopted on this occasion are persisted in they will have a very detrimental effect upon recruiting, especially in the southern part of Tasmania. Indeed, I believe that they will tend to prejudice recruiting throughout Australia. If men, after having enlisted for a special branch of the service, may be told that they must be transferred to general reinforcements, it will indicate to the public that the authorities are merely laying traps to catch them. I think that the men to whose case I am now directing attention are entitled to know what is going to be done with them. </para>

                        <para>. - As a member of the Tasmanian State Recruiting Committee, representations have been made to me in regard to this matter by very reputable men. Whether the whole thing occurred under a misapprehension or was due to a misunderstanding of the rule relating to enlistment I do not know. But undoubtedly there is considerable acerbity of feeling in respect of the matter in Tasmania. In justice to the Minister, however, I must say that whenever I have approached him. concerning men who wished to enlist for special service - as I had occasion to approach him only a few days ago - he has been particularly careful to ask me to impress on the minds of would-be recruits that they must enlist in the Australian Imperial Force unconditionally. But somehow a misunderstanding appears to have arisen under which men have enlisted for a special service, and apparently against their  wishes  have been drafted into the ordinary ranks of the Australian Imperial Force. I regard this sort of thing as one of the evils of the voluntary system. Now that the people have declared against the principle of conscription, in which I believe, and voluntary enlistment remains the order of the day, if a man has enlisted under a misunderstanding it is wrong to conscript him  into  a branch of the service in which he never intended to enlist. The misrepresentation or misunderstanding has doubtless taken place without the. knowledge of the Minister, because I have noted that he was always very careful to impress on me that,, while men might be drafted into services for which they turned out to be specially fitted, they must unconditionally enlist, in the first place, as members of the Australian Imperial Force. I have no doubt that in this special case there was a misunderstanding, which the Minister will do his best to clear up. </para>

                    <para>SenatorMcDOUGALL <inline font-style="italic">(New</inline> South Wales) &#91;3.47&#93;. - The issue raised by senator Guy ie not new. The trouble is that too much power is given to Recruiting Committees and organizers of the Forces. The Minister has for some time been going to consolidate those Forces, and it is nearly time he did so. I was  president  of the League of Wheelmen in&#39; Sydney, and the secretary told me he had permission from the recruiting office to raise a corps of cyclists. He did so iu his own time, travelled throughout New South Wales, got nothing for his services, and enlisted himself; but not one of those men went away in the Cyclists&#39; Corps. Some were well up to 50 years of age, and joined with the full knowledge that they might not be fit to go into the. front firing line, but they were willing to take up the work in the Cyclists&#39; Corps. They enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force, and have all gone away, I have had letters from some of them, and they do not grumble so much now as they did before they went away. They seem better satisfied, and probably have got into some service that has alleviate their feelings in some way or another. The cause of the trouble is that too much power is given to the recruiting officers to send men out to organize corps. They tell men, &#34;You can go away together, and stop together, and be pals.&#34; When the men go into the camp they find, that they are not kept together, nor do they go away with the arm of service to which it was promised they would be attached. Something ought to be done to stop that sort of thing. </para>

                        <para>. - I am afraid these troubles occur very largely through overzealousness on the part of recruiting officers, who are naturally &#34; anxious to get results and recruits. The - indirect evidence is that they frequently &#34; make promises they have no right  to  make. If a man says, &#34;  I  am willing to join if  I  can go into a certain unit,&#34; they say, &#34;I will see that that is fixed up.&#34;  It  has long been laid down that enlistment shall be for general service, and that selection will then he made of those qualified for the different arms. Take the case <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> has mentioned. There is no such thing as a Signal Unit. Signallers are part of an infantry unit.

                    <para>Baine  way it might almost be suggested that we should enlist men as bombers and grenadiers, when the fact is that after enlistment a certain number of men are selected to go through a bombing school. The infantry training is not split up into these various sections. Some time ago  it  was necessary to have a number of schools established throughout the Commonwealth, including Tasmania, to train men as wireless telegraphists. </para>

                            <para>- No. The schools were hold throughout the Commonwealth, so that a certain proportion of infantrymen should be trained as signallers. Alderman Meagher, in Tasmania, very patriotically gave his services honorarily, and did very useful and valuable work, the Department say, in the men he turned out. Wo received information that no more reinforcements of signallers are required, because there is a surplus. Are we, then, to say that, because these infantrymen have been trained as signallers, they must be kept here for months, until signallers are required, when we know that the infantry are short and that battalions have had to be broken up because of the shortage? We cannot do it. </para>

                            <para>- There are signalling units in the Engineering Corps, but the schools I refer to have been held to give instruction in signalling to members of infantry units. As we are advised that there is a surplus of signallers we have discontinued the schools. There were a certain number qualified at the last school, and the problem is what to do with them. It would be simply hypocrisy to send them overseas as signallers, knowing that as soon as they got to the other side they would be absorbed as infantrymen, so we told them honestly that, as we could not absorb them as signallers, they would have to go away as infantrymen. I hope <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> will convey to them the fact that at every school held note is taken of the fact that a man has qualified, and that with the papers that go overseas with each body of reinforcements a notice is sent that so-and-so has qualified as signalman. That information goes to the other side with them. They have yet to go through four or five months&#39; training in England before being sent into the firing line, and if by that time signallers are required, those men will be absorbed; -but if they are not absorbed in that way, they will take their place as infantry reinforcements, which is really what they are. The full details of the matter will be furnished on Wednesday in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy&#39;s</inline> question, hut I am speaking now only from memory. I regret as much as the honorable senator does the dissatisfaction caused by unauthorized promises made by certain people. We have had several instances of the kind, and I regret it very much. </para>
