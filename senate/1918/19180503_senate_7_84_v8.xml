                            <para>- I noticed the report of the interview referred to, and, though it may. read very well, the statements contained in it are not correct. Over twelve months ago the Commonwealth Government endeavoured to do through the Government of India what they are doing to-day, namely, purchase bags direct through them. The Indian. Government then declined, for various good reasons, to do what we desired. It took us twelve months to accomplish what <inline font-weight="bold">Major Purcell</inline> evidently . was able to accomplish in the course of an interview with the press. What he recommends has been done, but I want to say that the </para>

In regard to the suggested exploitation, I investigated the books of one of the largest firms handling cornsacks in Australia, and found that their return last year was 6d. per dozen on cornsacks sold in Australia. I shall, at a later date, make a detailed reply to the statement appearing in the <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline></para>

                            <para>- Arising out of the Minister's reply, I remind him that there are definite statements made in the interview with <inline font-weight="bold">Major Purcell.</inline> One of those definite statements is that the farmers of Australia have to pay an additional amount for their jute goods, owing to the action of the Government in conducting the business through second and third parties, instead of going direct to the jute mills. I hope that the statement promised by the Minister will be complete and in every way satisfactory. It should be recognised that the matter cannot be allowed to rest where it is. </para>

I stated, also, that the Department had been inundated with applications, many of which had been forwarded, as honorable senators were aware, through their hands. Speaking from memory, I think I am justified in saying that the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of this morning says that my statement is to be accepted as an admission that political influence was at work. I wish to deny that absolutely. Nothing that I said was interpreted by honorable senators listening to me as being capable of that construction. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to know from the Vice-President of the Executive Council what was the exact reply he gave yesterday on the subject of the exportation of sugar in soldiers' parcels. In the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of to-day there is another indication, to my mind, of inaccurate press work, as it is stated definitely that the prohibition of sugar in soldiers' parcels was at the behest of the British Government. In the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> the statement is made that there is no prohibition of sugar for export. The confusion caused by these inaccuracies is still continued in the public mind. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> brought the matter up yesterday, and I should be obliged if the Minister in charge of the business would make the position perfectly clear. </para>

                    <para>That this Bill be now read a second time. </para>
                    <para>This measure provides for vesting in the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner land acquired or to be acquired by the Commonwealth from the States of South Australia and West Australia in connexion with the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway. As honorable senators will recollect, prior to the passing of the Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta Railway Bill in 1911, the State Governments of South Australia and Western Australia had agreed to concede a strip of land of a quarter of a mile in width along the route of the railway, or one-eighth of a mile on either side of the line. They were not at the time able to transfer the land to the Commonwealth, because there had been only a flying survey, and it was necessary to survey the line only for a short distance ahead of the actual construction. No plans could, therefore, be prepared showing exactly what lands were to be transferred by the State Governments. Since that time a number of applications have been made for compensation in respect of the land to be transferred.. The lands acquired from Western Australia are a clean gift. There is no compensation to be paid in respect of lands acquired at the Western end of the line, as they are waste, or Crown lands, but in South Australia, for a distance of about 280 miles between Port Augusta and Tarcoola, there were several pastoral leases along the route of the railway, and the holders of those leases have made several claims for compensation. I am not able at this stage to give details of those claims. The purpose of this Bill is by vesting the lands acquired in the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner to give him power in the case of any application for compensation made, within six months after the passing of this measure, to deal with the claim effectively. If a claim is not agreed upon mutually between the leaseholder and the Commissioner, it will be within the power of the Minister for Works and Railways to refer it to a High Court Judge for determination. If a leaseholder desiring to make a claim does not send in his application for compensation within six months, he will lose the right to claim compensation. The Bill will not affect any claims in connexion with which litigation has already been commenced. </para>

                            <para>- I understand that litigation has been commenced in one or two cases. This measure will not affect those cases, but claims that may subsequently be made. If the claimant can come to a mutual agreement with the Railways Commissioner, his claim will be paid. If no agreement has been arrived at within six months, the claim will be referred to a Judge of the High Court. In the event of the Court determining that the benefit conferred upon the claimant by the construction of the railway is in excess of his claim for compensation, he will be liable to compensate the Commonwealth Government to the extent of that excess. The object of this provision is, I suppose, to limit the number of claims for compensation. </para>

                        <para>. - By the courtesy of the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen),</inline> I have had an opportunity of reading portion of the report of his. speech made yesterday; but still I feel it is hardly fair that the Senate should be called upon to debate the Bill with the little preparation that has been afforded honorable senators, and I hope that other honorable senators will be given a further opportunity of considering the measure before they are called upon to discuss it. There are, however, one or two points to which I shall direct attention. ' </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I appreciate to the full the many difficulties that confronted the Minister when he launched this repatriation scheme, because I have been in close touch with one of his highest officers in Melbourne, and I know that the work involved was extremely heavy. I hope that in its administration there will never be any attempt * to' cut down expenditure so far as it relates to the special purposes of the Act, but that every endeavour will be made to fitly repay those men who have suffered as a result of the war. I had intended to say something concerning the applications for appointment in the new Department, but the Minister's explanation this morning has made that unnecessary. </para>
                    <para>On the question of determining what is a living wage, I think some difficulty will be experienced, because what might be a living wage in one part of Australia will not be so regarded in another part of the Commonwealth. Some scheme, should be inaugurated, as has been done in Great Britain, of standardizing certain articles of clothing and necessaries of life for the service of repatriated soldiers and their wives and families, so that they may not suffer at the hands of exploiters. </para>

                            <para>- That is one reason why I object to it. I would prefer that the Department should fix the amount to be regarded as a living wage, and especially that an attempt should be made to standardize the necessaries of life for the benefit of our repatriated soldiers and their families. I noticed from a Canadian paper that the authorities there are entertaining the idea, following the example set by Great Britain; but whether it has been actually put into operation I do not know. I hope that the Minister will give the matter his careful consideration. </para>

                    <para>Another matter that is likely to cause trouble is that of determining the suitability of men for certain work. Who will be the judge? In my opinion, the man himself should judge whether he is fit or not for certain occupations. I know of many men who have tried different jobs and found that none suits them ; and very often a man might appear suitable for a certain work, but actually would be quite unfitted for it ; so I think that he himself would be the best judge as to the suitability of work offered to him. If men are dissatisfied they will have the right of appeal to the State Boards, and, if still dissatisfied, they may appeal to the Commission in Melbourne. That might be all right for a man who has money to keep him while he is making his appeal, but we know what it. would mean for other men. </para>

                    <para>Yesterday, when the Minister was quoting the rates of sustenance to be paid, I asked him why it was proposed to limit the allowance to a soldier with a wife and four children, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> also took up the refrain. The rates proposed are, for a soldier without dependants, £2 2s. per week ; a soldier with a wife, £2 12s.; a soldier with a wife and one child, <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> 15s. ; and thereafter an additional 3s. 6d. per week for each child up to four, so that a soldier  with a wife and four children will be insured a weekly income of £3 6s. I again ask : Why stop at four children <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> Is it suggested that £3 6s. - the allowance for a. wife and four children - is also a living wage for a soldier with a wife and eight children? We all know that it costs almost as much now to "boot" children as it did to keep them twelve months ago, and I draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that the authorities in New Zealand are going one better than Australia, for there they pay allowances up to five children. I noticed a paragraph in the press recently, stating - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>It is officially announced that the allowance to soldiers' children has been increased 6d. per day, making 10s. 6d. weekly. Under the new system a wife with one child will receive her husband's allotment of 3s. per day, her own allowance of 3s., and ls. 6d. for each child, a total of 52s. 6d. weekly. The pay to a wife with two children will be 63s.; three, 73s. 6d.; four,. 84s. ; five, 94s. 6d. </para>

It does not matter where the money comes from. In New Zealand a soldier's wife with five children will get 94s., as against 66s. in Australia for a wife with four children, and I maintain it is not equitable to stop the repatriation allowance at four children. </para>

                            <para>- No; but that is quite beside the question, and I would seriously urge the Minister to consider the advisability of extending the benefits to patriotic men whose families consist of more than four children. I know of a man who left ten children behind him, and there are plenty of such instances throughout Australia. The other day I sent to the Minister a list of twenty-five soldiers' wives, not one of whom had less than seven children. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will consider my sugges-tion. </para>

                            <para>- I heartily indorse the proposals made in this respect. I take it that the wages to be paid are simply to be the amount which employers can rightly pay for the work done by the apprentices, and that the Government are to add the difference. But the trouble will be that many of the returned youths will have even as long as four and five years to make up. It will not be at all easy to have them complete their apprenticeship term. </para>

                            <para>- I know that. I have not seen anything in the statement of the Minister as to providing opportunities for soldiers to become employers of labour themselves. That is, that they may be assisted in tendering for work either of a national or public character. There should be provision whereby half-a-dozen men could get together, and tender for jobs, with some guarantee by the Department that they would be able to carry them out. That which often prevents men from getting a start in life is the lack of proper backing just when they desire to strike out for themselves. Many returned soldiers would gladly avail themselves of assistance in this way, and I trust that the Minister will consider the suggestion. </para>

                    <para>The Minister made reference to providing settlements for soldiers. I advocated that when, a previous Bill was before the Senate, and urged that it should not be left to voluntary organizations which, in a number of the States, are splendidly endeavouring to provide  model settlements. I commend the Minister for his proposal, under the repatriation scheme, to provide model homes for men who are to be employed in factories and the like. </para>
                    <para>Still, another factor which should be looked to is the fostering of industries in which the men are to be employed. Unfortunately, there is too much importation of goods manufactured in foreign countries by cheap labour. In nine cases out of ten, where a private citizen has been enterprising enough to establish any one of those industries, he has met with success. Although the manufacturer has to pay higher wages, he gets better work, and, through systematic effort, he has been able to compete successfully against the cheap importations. In the Senate the other day, I mentioned the matter of enamel required for soldiers' medals. The Minister informed me that the contractor was waiting for the imported article. This enamel can be manufactured here; but the samples submitted to the Department were, according to its experts, not up to the imported product. That being so, it is for the Government to assist in the perfection of that article so that its manufacture might give employment of the requisite light nature to numbers of returned men. There are many such occupations with which the Minister should make himself acquainted. It is not probable that much could be accomplished at first, but it is only a matter of time. In my own trade, we were told not long ago that we could not manufacture locomotives to compete with the work of other countries, with their cheap labour. To-day, however, we are making them better and more cheaply than ever they were imported. It is all a question of system, and in that way we can compete with any part of the world. I recommend that the Department schedule all industries, particularly those requiring light labour, and make special efforts to foster and successfully establish new enterprises. </para>

                            <para>- Well, I have mentioned one, and I ask the Minister to look after it. There are many others, besides. The trouble is that when a matter is brought forward here by honorable senators who may have some slight knowledge of what they are talking about, questions are asked, and that is about the end of it. If one wishes to push the business further, he must persistently prod the Minister. For about two years I was trying to get the Government to manufacture the electric cables which they require. I pointed out that they could save £100,000 every year on that work. The Postmaster-General went into the scheme, and was favorable, but nothing was done. When the Prime Minister went to the Old Country, he, in his zeal to do something for Australia, let a contract for ten years for the very article which we could manufacture easily with light labour, and at a great saving. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid.</inline> - What did the officials say about that saving of £100,000? </para>

The Postmaster-General saw the value of the suggestion, and approved of the work being commenced, but, unfortunately, the Prime Minister was not aware of the position when he made this contract, which, of course, must be honoured. </para>

                        <para>. - We rightly heard from the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> that the problem facing Australia in regard to repatriation is new. There is no precedent for what Australia will attempt to do. The Minister correctly said that Australia leads all the belligerent countries in connexion with the attempted solution of the repatriation problem. He gave an illustration of his difficulties from the commencement. I can quite understand that he felt he was sailing an unfamiliar ship on an uncharted ocean, and without knowing his destination. He must have felt, indeed, like a blind man looking for a black hat in a dark room. Last September, a Repatriation Bill was passed which, after much discussion, and much thought on the part of the Minister in charge, practically meant that that gentleman was given a blank cheque. It was only a skeleton measure, and, in spite of all the oratory and all the amendments proposed in another place, the Bill returned to the Senate in much the same form as it had left us. That was largely because the scheme was merely in skeletonic  form, and it was felt that' it must be left to the Minister and his Department, and to time, to evolve the details. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>To-day our ideas about repatriation are much more concrete than eight months ago. We have jettisoned many false ideas - many views which the people then held to the effect that because a soldier had served abroad he should be provided for, upon his return, by a benevolent public for all time. We have forsaken that, but have kept to the main principle, that no soldier shall suffer as the result of his sacrifice in fighting on our behalf. We have come back also to the fundamental idea that repatriation is not a benevolent institution, but is what the word actually means - the settling back into civilian life of men who have been in military service. I am glad to hear in the statement of the Minister that this is the main plan of the work of his Department. </para>
                    <para>Personally, I have been much puzzled and much confused when I have attempted to reduce the problem with which we are confronted to figures. I noticed particularly that the Minister, in his many explanations regarding this important matter, has never got down to figures of any sort. He has not even told us how many soldiers the Department has so far assisted, how many have returned from abroad- </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator's  statement  is incorrect, if he will pardon me for saying so. No estimate of the cost has ever been officially given. Sixty million pounds was the amount mentioned by me on one occasion as showing what the scheme would cost if present methods of land settlement were continued, and on the assumption that a certain number of soldiers were placed upon the land. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. But no attempt has been made to forecast how much money the whole scheme of repatriation will cost the Commonwealth and how many soldiers the Department will have to deal with. I quite recognise the extent and difficulties of the problem. According to the Minister's statement just now, up to the 31st December last 50,000 soldiers had returned to Australia. As a considerable number have returned during the first four months of the present year, I think that at least one-fifth or one-fourth of the soldiers who have gone overseas have already returned to our shores. Seeing that that is so, we have, I think, some' glimmerings of light to guide us in connexion with the magnitude of this problem. </para>

                    <para>I am pleased to observe from the utterances of the Minister that this problem of repatriation is to be treated on the lines of common sense, so that we shall not have to face in the future such a large problem as we thought would confront us, provided always that reasonable conditions obtain for the development of Australia. There are very many thousands of men who will return to the Commonwealth when the war is over who will ask no help at all. The more facilities we can provide in the way of restoring them to their former civilian employment immediately upon their return the better will it be for the Repatriation Department. But upon this matter I shall have something more bo say upon the Defence Bill, which, I understands will come up for our consideration either to-day or on the next day of sitting. Upon the question of land settlement, however, I desire to say a few words. </para>
                    <para>Honorable senators will doubtless  recollect that some time ago repatriation in connexion with land settlement loomed very largely. I am 'glad to note that the Minister does not stress that aspect of the matter to-day in the way that he did eight months ago, and that there is exhibited a disposition to place upon the States, who own th'e land, the responsibility for the land settlement of our returned soldiers. I hope that no attempt in that direction will be made by the Commonwealth in connexion with the repatriation of our fighting forces. Any effort by the Commonwealth to settle our soldiers on the land is, to my mind, foredoomed to ignominious failure. Indeed, I am not at all sure that any land settlement in connexion with returned soldiers will be successful. As the Minister has observed, repatriation is largely a question of psychology, and, if I know anything about it, the psychology of the soldier is gregarious. He has been accustomed for years to comradeship and to the company of his fellows, and to settle him upon the land a mile away from his neighbour would be to invite failure. I repeat that this question of land settlement is one with which the States should deal, and the Minister will be well advised if he recognises that. </para>
                    <para>The question of repatriation - although it may be largely a question of weekly payments, pensions, &amp;c- - is also one, broadly speaking, of work. I feel strongly that the problem would very* likely be cut in half if the Government would only take their courage in both hands, and deal with the Tariff straightway. It seems to me that we have two alternatives, before us. If plenty of work is available the evils arising from unemployment will be comparatively small. But if we experience bad seasons and distress, the question of repatriation will loom very largely. I was pleased, indeed, to listen to the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall,</inline> who stressed the necessity for the establishment of new industries. <inline font-style="italic">X</inline> ask the Government to carefully consider that aspect of this matter. Such new industries as the manufacture of wire  ropes- </para>

                            <para>- No. His idea, I think, was the establishment of an industry for the manufacture of wire ropes and copper cables for postal and other requirements. If such an industry were established in our midst, it would be worth a good deal to the country, and, though it might involve some waste of revenue, we could at least get some value for the money thus expended. Another industry which might well be considered in connexion with this scheme of repatriation is that of the manufacture of newspaper. There are scores of thousands of tons of precious freight now being utilized in the importation of newspaper from abroad. Yet we have all the raw materials for making it. We have the wood pulp, the vegetable fibre, and the prickly pear, which, I am informed, makes as good newspaper pulp as can be manufactured in any part of the world. Only a few months ago one of the representatives of Tasmania stated on the floor of this chamber that experiments in that State in connexion with the manufacture of paper pulp from timber had been eminently successful, and complained that the Government were not offering a bounty for its manufacture. </para>

                    <para>The Minister has also asked honorable senators to suggest something  in connexion  with soldiers' settlement. He rightly said that he was hesitating as to whether it was wiser to build houses around particular industries in connexion with repatriation - in order that the soldiers might be kept together - or to allow them to live in a scattered way, the same as do other members of the community. I think that the solution of this difficulty depends very largely on the number of soldiers who are to be dealt with. If the .Minister has to deal with only fifty men in a particular industry, it will not be worth while to create a special. settlement for them. But if he has to deal with 500 or 1,000 soldiers in connexion with any industry, he probably can learn a good deal from Port Sunlight- </para>

                    <para>I congratulate the Minister most sincerely upon his very broad vision in connexion with his Department, and on his  careful  and discreet building up of the very complicated scheme of repatriation. The matter has been taken in hand by the Minister with much enthusiasm, and he has given to it much thought, and doubtless many long hours of weary vigil. I wish him success in every way. It is probably the most knotty problem that any , Minister could take up', probably the most thankless job that any man could carry on, and I am sure the Minister has the sympathy of all the members of the Senate in his task. This is not a party question. It is a question towards the solution of -which we can give only a little help, and do no more than indicate our opinions on fundamental issues. I hope the Minister will not forget that it is also a psychological question, one of sympathy and patience towards the. men who have gone through so much for us. I hope also  with other honorable senators that the Department will ultimately be manned entirely by returned soldiers, as  I  believe the spirit of comradeship and mateship existing amongst soldiers will make them sympathetic towards those with whom they are dealing. I congratulate the Minister so far on the success he has achieved, and on the sound fundamental principles he has laid down in connexion with the Department.  I  am sure that one and all of us on both sides will give him all the help and sympathy we can. I trust the problem will not be so big as we now fear it will be.  I  hope that in the future Australia will hum with production and industry, for if that comes to pass, under wise guidance by the Government of the day the problem will rapidly diminish as the years run on. </para>

                        <para>.- I also offer my congratulations to the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> on his explanation of  the  Bill.  I  have had many opportunities of listening to explanations of intricate pieces of legislation, but I have never listened with greater pleasure or advantage to the explanation of any Bill than  I  did to the deliverance of the Minister  yesterday.  It was the most lucid, carefully thought-out, and  Completely  explanatory speech on a most difficult problem that it has ever been my lot to listen to.  I  also listened with much pleasure to the contribution of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall,</inline> from which there was a total absence of carping criticism. Every word he spoke was evidently uttered with a sincere intention to assist the Ministry in taking on this big problem. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>In dealing with the problem, for which there is no precedent' and no experience to guide them, the Ministry, while considering the reasonable interests of the taxpayers and the interests of the genuine, thrifty returned soldier, and while taking every precaution to guard the fund against attempts to exploit it - for there will be amongst the returned men, as there are amongst every body of men, some who will do their utmost to do so - must not consider the economical side of the expenditure on this proposition. Nothing that Australia can do will be too much for the dependants of those who have made the supreme sacrifice, or those who have offered to make it on behalf of Australia. No payment that can be made to these men either during the war or on their return cam adequately compensate them for what they have gone through or what they have offered . to sacrifice. A man who takes up arms in defence of his country looks for his reward in the realization by his countrymen that he has done it for his country's good. To seek to pay such a man by a few shillings a day while away, or by the reward of a few pounds on his return, would be an insult to his manhood. Although we who remain in Australia cannot compensate the returned soldier for what he has done for us, the Government must not consider expense in doing all that is humanly possible to make the lives of these men happy, peaceful, and prosperous in the future. </para>
                    <para>We are conducting our part of the war in this country under the voluntary system, and  I  am strongly opposed to every kind of economic conscription, although  I  am a straight-out conscriptionist, in that  I  would compel every man, rich or poor, to take his fair share of responsibility to defend the nation.  I  am against any system which may force one man to go in consequence of the exigency of the circumstances in which he finds himself, whilst another man is able to resist and remain. Reports have come under my notice showing that a system of that kind has been in operation in Australia.  I  had the opportunity last Sunday of listening to a number of  speeches in the Sydney Domain.  I  had the honour of hearing a speech delivered by Captain Carmichael, when he was asking for the last twelve of the thousand men with whom he went into camp on' Wednesday.  I  also heard a number of other speeches which  I  did not agree with, but the speakers all seemed sincere, and  I  also heard an official letter read from an employing firm in 'Australia stating that it had invited the resignation of one of its employees in order that the eligible men of Australia might be relieved for military purposes-. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator is probably somewhat to blame for it, because he favours the voluntary system of recruiting, which does not represent the true policy of Democracy, inasmuch as it  does not place on every man, who Has a right to a share in governing his country, his share of the responsibility of defending it. However, that matter is in the past, and it is no use talking about it. I am sorry that attempts at economic conscription, such as I have described, are being made, and I shall always resent them. </para>

                            <para>- Without exemption at all. Every man who is eligible to go to the war, and has refused to go under the system adopted by the Commonwealth should certainly be made to pay a considerable amount towards the repatriation and future comfort of the men who have made the sacrifice. Hence I repeat that whatever difficulties there may be in raising the money, and whatever the cost, the Ministry must not consider them, but, while safeguarding the interests of the soldiers and taxpayers, must insist on the people of Australia doing all that is humanly possible to make the conditions of the men who return better in the future. </para>

                    <para>On the subject of vocational training for returned soldiers I agree with every word that has been said as to the desirability of making our returned men self-reliant and. producers of national wealth. While recognising the great services these men have rendered to me and to my fellow citizens, I do not for a moment believe that on their return they should be kept in idleness. Their comfort should undoubtedly be considered, but they should be expected to become producers, and we should instil into their minds the, feeling of, self-reliance, which always tends to make a good citizen. The Minister for Repatriation has made a very explicit statement regarding vocational training, but it appeared to me that, in view of its merits, the honorable senator passed over very lightly, the scheme propounded by  Colonel Fitzpatrick.  This scheme must have cost the author a good deal of study and research. He proposes an agreement between employers in different industries, for which a returned soldier might be prepared in the course of twelve months, the indus-" trial unions connected with those industries, and the Government. He suggests that 33 per cent, of the standard wage in these industries might be provided by the Government. The proportion of this payment should be higher during the first part of the apprenticeship, if I may use that expression, and become gradually less towards the end of the apprenticeship. It seems to me that that is a scheme by which large numbers of our returned men might be trained in different- industries already established in Australia. I am given to understand by the author of the scheme that assistance to give it effect has been offered by employers and unions concerned in different industries. They are prepared to do all they can to train the returned men and to welcome their employment in those industries. I recognise that it is necessary to have some regard to the proportion of returned soldier trainees employed in a particular industry. If the Minister has- not given full consideration to this scheme, which is very clearly set forth in a pamphlet issued by  Colonel Fitzpatrick,  I would recommend him to look into it, as in my view it contains suggestions which would be an improvement upon the Government's scheme. </para>
                    <para>The proposal of the Government to establish industries specially for the vocational training of returned soldiers seems to me to be surrounded by many difficulties. No industry in Australia occurs to me at the present time in which the Government could launch out upon the employment of returned soldiers without coming into direct competition with established industries of the same kind. This has been one of the difficulties always associated with governmental industrial undertakings, <inline font-style="italic">Immediately</inline> a Government starts the manufacture of an article, private citizens engaged in the manufacture of the same article at once create an agitation against  the Government, on the ground that they ire employing their money in common with the money of other taxpayers in the manufacture of something which enters into competition with the articles upon the production of which they depend for a living. </para>

                    </continue><para>One honorable senator advised the Government to have nothing to do with the resumption of land for returned soldiers. I am not of that way of thinking at all. I know a number of farmers' sons and farm labourers who have taken up arms in the defence of Australia who would be glad to have holdings of their own when peace is restored. I realize that because of the Constitutions of the different States it is almost impossible to resume the kind of land best suited for intense culture and occupation by returned soldiers. In my own State of Tasmania we have an Act which enables the Government to compulsorily resume any estate of the unimproved value of £12,000 and over. Under that Act the owner of an estate to be resumed is allowed to retain his homestead and a considerable area around it. In general practice, that means that the kernel is taken out of the nut and the husk or shell left for those who desire to use the resumption for closer, settlement. The party I led at one time in the Tasmanian Parliament made several efforts to reduce the unimproved value of estates which might be compulsorily resumed to £5,000, but the Legislative Council of the State rejects that proposition every time it is made. So that, although there are in places like the Derwent Valley a number of comparatively small estates of an unimproved value of £5,000, £8,000, or £10,000, which would be highly suitable for the settlement of four, five, or a dozen returned soldiers, it is impossible to secure those estates for the purpose. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- They cannot do so because of their Conservative second Chambers. I am of opinion that before we can effectively deal with the settlement of returned soldiers on the land it will be necessary for this Parliament to take to itself the right to resume land for the purpose in any part of Australia. We know that any law passed by this Parliament will override the legislation of the State Parliaments. I believe that in the democratic Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament an Act which would give to the Federal Government the power to resume any land in Australia for this purpose would find favour. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> is, of course, talking " rot," and what he has said is not relevant to the question. I do not admit that there have been many failures in Tasmania. On some resumed properties which did not come under the compulsory sections of the Act, men are, I believe, doing very well; but, generally speaking, the areas have been resumed by the State Governments under their land resumptions Acts, and, consequently, , are unsuited for the use of returned soldiers. In Tasmania we suggested a kind of co-operative scheme by which the Government would arrange for the preparation of holdings prior to their occupation, and I think this pro-' posal is well worthy of consideration by the Minister. In the' case of Crown lands, particularly areas suitable for orcharding-, the men who desired to take up the land would be engaged at standard wages in clearing, preparing the ground, and planting the trees. If twenty, thirty, or fifty . returned soldiers had made up their minds to go upon the land, they would be employed in this way under the group system. </para>

While employed under this group system, the men would be in receipt of the standard wage, and, in some cases, they would be actually clearing what would be their own future home. I see no reason why this scheme should not receive careful consideration by the Repatriation Department. </para>

                            <para>- There is nothing academic or imaginary about this scheme at all. It may be applied' in any State where suitable land is available. Surely the honorable senator realizes that to do the work of clearing land economically and scientifically it is necessary to provide up-to-date machinery, which could not be made available to the individual settler, and which would probably reduce the cost of clearing by quite 40 per cent. </para>

                    </continue><para>Another question which seemed te perplex some honorable senators, notably, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> was the position of apprentices who had enlisted. I have had some experience in this matter in my own State, where it has been equitably adjusted. It is only right, if two apprentices enter, say, Government workshops at the same time, and one, after serving twelve months' apprenticeship, enlists to go to the war, while the other remains behind to complete his term of apprenticeship, thus entitling him to a minimum wage of 10s. a day, that the man who has enlisted should, upon his return, be placed in exactly the same position financially as if he had remained in a workshop, and completed his apprenticeship term. In one case that came under my notice - and I have no doubt that there are many others - we put this scheme into practical operation in the Tasmanian Railway Department, the Commissioner, at the instance of the Government, re-engaged a returned apprentice at journeyman's wages, and while he was completing his term of indenture. This course is absolutely just, and though it may cost the Government a little more; after all it is their contribution to the solution of war problems. Expenditure must not be considered in carrying out the repatriation scheme. We shall have to find whatever amount of money may be necessary, and those who have not otherwise contributed must find a fair proportion of it. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- I repeat that this country cannot compensate fully those men who have gone to the war, but the repatriation scheme launched by the Government will be an evidence of our gratitude to those men who have fought for us. It would be an insult to offer them a few pounds, or a few shillings per day as compensation for what they have done for this country; but it is absolutely impracticable to finance any scheme which would prevent any. man from losing financially by his action in enlisting. I know such a proposal was expounded by a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLeod,</inline> of South Africa. He declared that every man should be conscripted for the war, but that he should receive the same rate of pay as that which he was entitled to prior to the war. That may be all right in theory, but it is impracticable. </para>

If we could only get to the heart of Germany, and ask the people of that country how long they are going to tolerate this world-wide butchery, then we might expect an answer. So long as the people of Germany are in the clutches of the autocracy and the military class, who are now clamouring for world power, so long will the struggle continue. It is humanly impossible to forecast the amount that will be required for this scheme. We know, that large numbers of men will be coming back, and that we must be prepared to receive them, and that, whatever the cost, it must be borne by the people of Australia, so that, no matter how great the numbers to be dealt with, our returned warriors shall have the very best that Australia can give. The Government shall never receive a hostile vote from me in consequence of their over-sympathetic administration of the Repatriation Department; and, in saying that, I feel that I am expressing the feelings of the great majority of honorable senators.

                    <para>. - This and the succeeding clause are really the keys to the Bill. There was no opportunity for a second-reading debate yesterday, owing to some misunderstanding. I trust, therefore, that honorable senators may be given, in the circumstances, a little more latitude in discussing the main principles of the measure than otherwise would be sought. I point out the very grave nature of the Bill. I shall prefer to describe it as one for breaking faith with the soldiers. The very crux of it is dishonouring an obligation under which our men went abroad. </para>

                        <para>- It is quite clear to me that this Bill is going to continue militarism throughout Australia for some indefinite period after the war, that is, if it passes as it is printed. Our soldiers enlisted for the period of the war and four months afterwards. That was the contract - which still stands. I do not dispute that the circumstances which have arisen could not have been foreseen; but, unless the contract is to be a mere scrap of paper, we must very carefully consider this Bill. It provides that, instead of a soldier being able to get his discharge when he returns to Australia, the military authorities, or the Minister for Defence, or the Governor-General - who all amount to the same thing - can by proclamation keep the troops in khaki for an indefinite time after their return. The question of want ing them or not ' depends entirely on what the authorities say, and that will probably rest upon the opinion's expressed by the General Staff. The Minister, in explaining the measure, remarked that circumstances had changed in connexion with the war, and that it was necessary to pass this Bill, because the highest authorities held that it might be a year, if not two, before all our men could be returned. That is a fair statement. It is admitted that it will take a considerable time to repatriate the whole of our soldiers - not forgetting that their transport home will synchronize with the return of the troops of all the other Dominions. </para>

                <para class="block">No member of this Parliament would like to aee  our  soldiers disbanded in England. We would prefer some arrangement whereby they could be kept in their respective  units  until their return to Australia. But if we, through any Act such as this, give power to the military authorities to keep our troops in khaki an hour longer than they desire  after  their return, and after  peace  has been declared, there is bound to be trouble. </para>
