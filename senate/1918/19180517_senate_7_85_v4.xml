                    <para>. - I understand that some promise has been made to the Leichhardt Municipal Council, on behalf of the Commonwealth or State Government, that the money received from the 5 acres of reclaimed land at the proposed site will be made available for the purchase in or near the centre of the municipality of an area for public recreation purposes. If that be so, the Government, in asking the Committee to agree to this measure should supply honorable senators with all the particulars of that undertaking. I should like to say that even if that is done, and quite regardless of the course followed in connexion with the resumption of sites in the past, we should not be afraid to establish the precedent that when lands are being resumed, one, two, or even a greater number of sites should be placed under review by the Public Works Committee. We shall, no doubt, be told that if it is suggested that for any purpose the Government propose to resume land, the immediate effect will be to send up the value of all lands in the vicinity. No doubt that would be so, but I take advantage of this opportunity to point out that that might be very easily circumvented if, during this great war crisis, when we must have additional revenue, the Government made use of the majority they command to carry a measure imposing a flat rate of taxation upon all land values. If they did that, they would have reason to be delighted when they discovered that local land-jobbers were putting up the price of land. </para>

                        <para>- I dare say that I was a little wide of the mark, but I notice the anxiety expressed by honorable senators to discover the remedy for the difficulty to which I have referred. I should have liked to tell them what it was, and will take another opportunity of doing so. It is scandalous that the Government cannot propose to acquire a site anywhere for a public purpose without grave rumours being circulated that some one has acquired land in the vicinity in order to reap something which he has not sown. Such rumours may be entirely without foundation, but it is not too much to ask that the whole proposal with which this Bill deals should be referred to the Public Works Committee for inquiry and report. I regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> should have suggested that the inquiry might be spread over five or six weeks. I feel quite sure that the members of the Public Works Committee could visit the site and obtain all the information required before next Thursday, to enable us to decide whether it is suitable for the purpose of Ordnance Stores or not. As, however, the honorable senator has asked that the matter should be postponed until a later date, no serious consequences are likely to follow. It is a perfectly fair request that nothing more should be done in connexion with the acquisition of this site until it has been reported on by the Public Works Committee. </para>

                    <para>. - I am sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> should have. discussed a matter that has already been dealt with. The new clause I have proposed deals only with the reference of the matter to the Public Works Committee, and that might be done to-morrow. I want to answer the statement of the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> that it is degrading to Parliament to fetch the outside gossip into this chamber. I can quite understand the very dignified attitude assumed. by the honorable senator, but I claim that he was himself responsible for the introduction of outside gossip. He told us that the reason for the hush and secrecy about the purchase of land by the Government is that outside speculators may learn what is proposed. The outside gossip in connexion with this proposal is that outside speculators in the honorable senator&#39;s Department have got in, and he knows that the outside gossip is sure to be reported by disappointed men. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly not. I am not supporting these people or approving of their action or of the circulation of the gossip; but when I see that hundreds of thousands of pounds of public money are to be spent,&#39; I take the risk of letting those responsible for the expenditure of the money know the kind of gossip that is going on. It is better to have Parliament and Governments and Departments free from suspicion, by instituting the fullest and freest investigation before anything is done. </para>

                        <para>- That is the level to which the Minister wants to reduce the matter, so that the Government can come down on that individual possibly with all the force of the War Precautions Act for saying these things. The Minister&#39;s own statements justify my action. He said that secrecy in purchasing land must be maintained, because otherwise speculators will get in when it is known that the Government intend to acquire land. What if we say that speculators may have already got in - that the whole business is that speculators may get in? What harm is there in referring the matter to the Public Works Committee? What is the duty of the Committee if it is not to investigate these matters? </para>

                        <para>- I am not repeating them inside. I am simply letting the Minister know that statements are being made outside that undue influences are at work as to where this huge sum of public money shall be expended. I asked the Minister to submit the question to the Works Committee, but he definitely and deliberately refused. I am therefore compelled to make it clear beyond the shadow of a doubt that this is the particular and peculiar kind of business that should be referred to a standing committee on public works. When he asks me to put my reputation behind the rumours, I tell him I shall do nothing of the kind. I believe that an investigation by the Committee will leave the matter quite free from suspicion, even as regards any one in his Department; The proposal is to have new Ordnance Stores. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly ; the old ones rebuilt or reconstructed on a perfect site would easily fill the bill. The chief purpose of Ordnance Stores is to supply the soldiers with their requirements in the way of arms, munitions, clothing, and equipment. Will it not be better for the factories to deliver to the railways and the railways to deliver to the camp where the soldiers can be supplied direct instead of going out on another branch line? The Minister said the cost of the work would not be &#163;50,000. If it is to be a water frontage, and one of the claims in favour of it is that it is, and if that water frontage is to be of any advantage, a swing-bridge will have to be - constructed to allow vessels of any size to come through. That would mop up the greater part of the &#163;50,000, because these things cannot be done for twopence halfpenny&#39;. Then wharfage frontages will have to be constructed, and land will have to be resumed to construct a railway to link up, because this site is not now linked up with the New South Wales railway system. Then the store will have to be built, and goods will have to be continually sent to and from the particular site which the Minister&#39;s officers have selected. I am not imputing anything against the Minister&#39;s officers as regards their selection. I have no desire to do so, and have never done so. The stores will have to :be continually carried to the Liverpool Camp, where the men are in training, and <inline font-style="italic">vice</inline><inline font-style="italic">versa,</inline> a distance of about 20 miles. Are not these things sufficiently serious ? Is money so plentiful in this country that &#163;250,000 may be expended now without an investigation ? A cost of &#163;11,000 has already been incurred to acquire the private lands already resumed, with the cottages thereon, without Parliament knowing anything about it and without any investigation. </para>

                        <para>- On Circular Quay - an excellent place if water frontage is required. If they are to be shifted they should be established at Liverpool Camp itself, where, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> there is 40,000 acres of land available and a railway running right through it. The old Ordnance Stores have been in the possession of the Government since the Defence Department went over to the Commonwealth, and were used by the State Government for ordnance purposes before that. I am prepared to admit that the buildings are old and out of date, but when it is proposed to establish new Stores the officers of the Department pick a site, which is not a proper, one. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> meant by his interjection to elicit the fact that the present Stores are not at Liverpool Camp. That is so, but the Liverpool land was resumed while the old Ordnance Stores were in use by the Department, and they have never been shifted. Liverpool is a camp where probably from 15,000 to 20,000- men will be in training, not only to-day and to-morrow, but in the future. </para>

                        <para>- I do not question it; but, speaking generally, the supplies for each State are kept in the State concerned. If stores are required for other States, the site on Circular Quay is a very convenient one to ship them from. I am speaking, however, purely in relation to New South Wales, which supplies half the troops sent from Australia, and half the money, and is therefore the chief factor in these matters. If I forget to mention the smaller sections of Australia, it does not mean that I am altogether overlooking them; but I know that Melbourne has its Ordnance Stores, and so has Adelaide. The departmental officers propose to erect new Stores at a spot which it is quite as difficult for the contractors to reach as is the Liverpool Camp. If they had to send to Liverpool, all they would have had to do would be to despatch the goods to the nearest railway station, and the railway runs right through the camp at Liverpool. </para>

                        <para>- Then what I have said has not been in vain, because it is being made clear to honorable senators that this is not an ideal waterside site. We all thought that the Government wanted a site where the goods for other States could be loaded direct into the vessels. I will cut &#163;50,000 out of my estimate for the swing bridge. If the Government are not going to load the goods direct on to the ship, they might as well at once wipe out all pretence that this is a water site. As a matter of fact, it will be no better than a railway site, because, if stores have to. be unloaded from and loaded into lighters, why should not the Government establish the Ordnance Stores at Liverpool Camp, where the stores may be loaded into railway trains. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister Is ill-informed as to the. cost of railway carriage in New South Wales if he says that. Let us consider this matter from a business point of view. Unfortunately, the men who load goods into railway trucks are paid only 10s. a day, whereas other men get 2s. an hour; so, of course, it is more expensive, viewed from that stand-point. But if we are going to construct Ordnance Stores which will cost a huge sum of money - the Minister has already intimated that private land with cottages upon it to the value of &#163;11,000 is to be resumed - why should we&#39; take park lands from the people in what will eventually be a crowded district, while, at the same time, we have Ordnance Stores at Pyrmont, Circular Quay, and ample room at the Liverpool Training Area for the construction of new premises thought to be necessary ? If the Stores are established at Leichhardt, an enormous expenditure will be incurred in the carriage of goods to and from the camps. Blankets, for instance, will be a considerable item. </para>

                <para class="block">These will have to be taken to the camps, and, when not further required, sent back again to the Ordnance Stores; and the carriage will not be by train so much as by motor lorries. At Liverpool the Government have an area comprising thousands of acres, so that there is no necessity whatever for the Minister to look around for more land and to select a site which, in my opinion, is most unsuitable. I am only asking that the Committee should instruct that the whole proposal be submitted to the Public Works Committee before more expenditure is incuired. This is a fair proposal, and if the Minister had accepted it I would not have addressed the Senate further upon the matter. I have been endeavouring to make it clear that the Government proposal means the expenditure of a huge sum of money, when, all the time, they have ample land in. suitable places elsewhere for Ordnance Stores, and we ought to use (hose lands, and make them more valuable. I submit my amendment with no heat or desire to impugn the <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> of any officer or of the Minister. I have mentioned rumours about land transactions, but they are only rumours, and it is possible that some disappointed speculators are largely responsible for them; so an inquiry by the Public Works Committee will give those gentlemen an opportunity of tendering evidence upon oath if they desire to do so. I have no information, and I have never pretended that I had; but I feel it is my duty to lift Parliament, the Government, and the Department above suspicion. We can do that by insisting upon the fullest publicity being given to this particular matter before further expenditure is incurred. If the Minister persists in claiming his right to tie this country down to a huge expenditure before the matter even goes before the Public Works Committee, I ask honorable senators to support my amendment. I know, however, that it will be decided on party lines, which are more tightly drawn among honorable senators opposite than among members on this side of the Senate, and that they must vote as they are told to vote. </para>

                <para class="block">South Wales senators who are opposing the Government proposal have something up their sleeve. He did not use those words exactly, but I understood him to mean that we had some ulterior motive in opposing the Bill. I have not. I have heard none of the rumours about &#34; boodle,&#34; and know nothing about them. I am opposing this Bill on the ground that it means the spoliation of park land, and that the site is not a good one. Only a few years ago Darling Island was selected as a site for Ordnance Stores, and the large buildings put up there should last this country for many years. Those Stores, I understand, are now to be sold by public auction. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that the Darling Island Stores have been valued at &#163;50,000, and the other Stores at &#163;40,000; but I am glad to learn that the Commonwealth does not intend to sell them, because I think the Government should hold all the land they have in the capital cities of the Commonwealth. Now, that removes one of my objections to the Bill ; but my other objection is that the site selected is absolutely unsuitable. There are better sites within a quarter of a mile, and these could be investigated if the Public Works Committee had authority to make inquiries. Land close to the site chosen by the Government has been available for private enterprise for years, but it was not looked at because of an impediment to water carriage, viz., a low-level bridge. The Minister has told us that he got in early, so that the land speculators would not have an opportunity to do anything ; but I point out that speculators will be powerless in this matter, because the Government have a right to acquire any land they need in New South Wales at the value put upon it by the owner himself, because all land in New South Wales comes under the operation of unimproved land values taxation, under which the owner fixes his own valuation, and the Government have the right to take land at that value. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, it does. I have some land that I would like to sell to the Government. There is a tax on it to-day, and I would give it to them for nothing. I protest against the suggestion of the Minister that we are opposing the Bill from ulterior motives. I am objecting to it because it means the spoliation of a park land, and because the site is not a good one. I have heard the Minister himself, when in Opposition, using much the same arguments as have been employed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> - all the &#34; tittle-tattle &#34; he heard in other places - and, when asked, refuse to give the source of his information. </para>

                        <para>- Then I invite the Minister to look up <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and he will find that he did not. I say that the New South Wales senators have no other motive, in their opposition to this Bill, than that of watching the interests of their constituency and the people they represent. I am satisfied the site is not suitable. I was shown over it by  Colonel Sands,  and, while I agree that the railway facilities are not unsatisfactory, it should never have been chosen on the ground that it provides a water front. The Minister said that the local council have offered no objection. I say they did; but they have been consoled by the belief that the Commonwealth Government will take the bodies out of the old burying ground in the heart of Leichardt, and give them that property for a park. If this is not done, I think the Government will meet with opposition from the local council. The Minister also said that he believed the State Government would recompense the people; but, so far as I know, the New South Wales Government have given no such guarantee, the only undertaking being a word-of-mouth promise that somebody would recompense the council by purchasing unoccupied lands in the district and handing them over for parkland purposes. The promise, however, is too indefinite and insecure, and there is no guarantee that it will be given effect to. </para>

                        <para>- I am ready to take the promise of this Government, and I recognise also that they are compelled by Statute law to refer this matter to the Public Works Committee. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall&#39;s</inline> contention is rather on different lines. He has raised strong objection to the alienation of any land suitable for the recreation of the people. That is a position which I have always strongly taken up myself. Were I not convinced by the arguments of the honorable senator himself, and by others who have contributed to the debate, that this small strip of land is altogether unsuitable for a recreation ground or public park, I should be strongly tempted to assist him; but I am convinced that it is not suited to such purpose, and, therefore, that it should be put to the use for which it is suitable, and that other breathing spaces should be provided for the people concerned. </para>

It should be the duty of the municipal authorities concerned, and of the State Government, to provide ample breathing spaces for the people. The Commonwealth Government have already acquired an option over 5 acres of private land. </para>

                        <para>- If honorable senators desire to attack the Government for having taken that step, they should do so in the form of some specific motion, and should base their complaint on the fact of the acquisition of the land before the matter was introduced to the Legislature or submitted to the Public Works Committee. I could understand such an attitude ; but the attempt to prevent the passage of this Bill will not affect the point that the authorities still have that specific piece of land. The passing of this measure will in no wise bear upon that situation; but if the Bill becomes law it will give to the Commonwealth power to acquire another 5 acres adjacent to that over which they at present hold an option. The Government have given the assurance that the whole matter must be submitted to the Public Works Committee. </para>

                    <para>. - I listened very attentively to the speech which has just been delivered  by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle,</inline> who assured us again and again that he had carefully read the Act under which the Public Works Committee was appointed. If he has done so, it is quite evident that he does not understand it. He devoted practically the whole of his remarks to the question of the proposed &#62;site. May I be permitted to quote an extract from the evidence given before the Public Works Committee in connexion with the inquiry into the proposed extension of the Postal Stores buildings in Harbor-street, Sydney ? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edmund</inline> James Young,  Deputy  Postmaster-General of New South Wales, under examination by the <inline font-weight="bold">Chairman, Mr. Riley,</inline> stated - </para>

                    <para>The question of the foundations of such a building does not come within my province. That particular matter will be dealt with by officers of the Home Affairs Department. If they reported a difficulty about getting good foundations, we would not go on with the project. We were primarily responsible for the selection of the locality, and, as I have already said, it would be the duty of the officers of the Home Affairs Department to report on the nature of the foundations. </para>

                        <para>- As a matter of fact, whilst the Public Works Committee was investigating one of the biggest propositions ever placed before any Committee of the kind in Australia - I . refer to the works at the Henderson Naval Base, the estimated cost of which had been set down at something over &#163;5,000,000 - an Order in Council was published under which practically everything connected with those works was cut out of the reference to the Committee. When, therefore, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> reads the Public Works Committee Act, he ought, at least, to endeavour to understand it. In view of my experience as a member of that body in connexion with the extension of the Postal Stores in Harbor-street, Sydney, I think it would be wise if in all cases the site upon which it is proposed to erect buildings should be referred to it. I have conclusively proved that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earles</inline> contention is absolutely wrong. &#34;When he reads the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of this debate he will see that he stated most definitely  that every  work the cost of which will exceed &#163;25,000 must be referred to the Public Works Committee. </para>

If he were convinced that it is, he would hesitate about assisting the Government to take it out of the hands of the residents of Leichhardt. I know the site well, and I consider that it is eminently suitable for a park. It is about 5 acres in extent. The ground is level, and fairly covered with grass, and is about 4 feet above the mean level of the Harbor. It is at the edge of a very closely-settled district, and there is no other park in the vicinity. </para>

                        <para>- It is only persons like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> who could find enjoyment in a cemetery. The ordinary citizen would go elsewhere for recreation. It is incorrect to suggest that a sewer, in the ordinary sense of the term, bounds the site on one side, because the whole of suburban Sydney in this district is connected with the underground sewers, and no offensive matter can reach the storm water channels. This channel has been used exclusively to promptly carry off storm waters. It is fairly wide and deep, and might be made deeper very easily. The prevailing winds are from the north-east, and carry a continuous stream of fresh air over the site. </para>

                        <para>- I have spoken in order to show that the site is an ideal one for a park, and it is the only area in the district suitable for that purpose. The Government have so far not made any definite statement as to the relations which it is suggested should exist between them and the trustees of the cemetery in the centre of the municipality of Leichhardt. I do not see why the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> should not follow the course adopted in another place in this connexion, and take honorable senators into his confidence.&#39; I have spoken to inform <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle,</inline> who does not know the locality, that this site is in every way suitable for a public park, but for a progressive suburb like Leichhardt it might well be ten times its present size. </para>

                    <para>.- I have listened with the closest attention throughout the debate. I know nothing of the locality of the site selected for the proposed Ordnance Stores, but it appears to me that Senators Gardiner and McDougall have made out a very strong case for the reference of the whole proposal to the Public Works Committee. If it is not the duty of that Committee to take into consideration the site upon which many thousand pounds of public money are to be spent, then the Act under which the Committee is constituted should be altered to give it some say in the expenditure of public money upon the purchase of sites for proposed buildings. I agree with the view . that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> has expressed in opposition to the alienation of public recreation grounds. The modern idea everywhere is to enlarge rather than to restrict these lungs of the people. We are told that this site is the only piece of land in the municipality of Leichhardt available for a public park. </para>

                        <para>- In answer to that very pertinent interjection, I must say that it appeared to me extraordinary that the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> in submitting the measure, was unable to refer honorable senators to any official statement showing that the local authorities of Leichhardt favoured the alienation of this land. The most he was able to say was that he understood that that was the case. It occurs to me that he might well have been fortified with an official statement from the local authorities approving of the Government proposal. I have a very strong objection to the alienation of land set apart for the recreation of the public. I can readily understand that a certain class of people do not care a twopenny dump about the alienation of public reserves, because they own land in the neighbourhood of those reserves. They know that if the reserves are alienated, and public factories erected upon them, the result must be a considerable addition to the residents of the locality, and an increased demand for land in the vicinity, which would, consequently, rise in value. The general public do not take that view, and if We took the voice generally of the people of the locality, I make bold to say that the people of Leichhardt would be found pronounced in their objection to the alienation of this site. A proposal of this kind could only be justified if there were no other locality in which the Government might secure a suitable site for the erection of Ordnance Stores. That has not been suggested. I should be prepared to oppose giving the Government power to alienate this land on the ground of my general objection to permitting the alienation of the people&#39;s parks. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has made an extremely . reasonable&#34; request in asking that the whole proposal should be referred to the Public Works Committee. Nothing would be lost if that were done. </para>

                        <para>- Then what is the Minister&#39;s objection to submitting the whole proposal to tie Works Committee now ? Doubts have been expressed as to the suitability of the site, and, taking everything into consideration, it has been suggested that even Liverpool would afford a better site for the erection of Ordnance Stores. It is suggested that the water frontage at this site is of little value, because of the obstruction to navigation in the shape of the Iron Cove Bridge. </para>

It means the transhipping of goods from the vessel to the barge, from the barge to the wharf, and, perhaps, afterwards from the wharf to a train. The damage to goods by all this handling would more than balance the extra cost involved in making provision for transhipping direct from the ship&#39;s slings to a wharf. Lightering everywhere is being reduced. I venture to say that there is not one-tenth- of the lightering done in Melbourne now that used to be done -years ago. </para>

                        <para>- There is a train to Darling Harbor, where more imports are landed than at any other port. I am not saying that it would be better to put the store at Liverpool Camp, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> made out a very fair case. If that question was submitted, with the general question, to the Public Works Committee, and they reported adversely on it, I should he satisfied, and so would the public outside. But if the people get the idea that this proposal is being forced through, in spite of all objections, they will naturally feel suspicious that the Government are doing it for some ulterior purpose. I shall support the amendment because it commends itself to me as the most reasonable and sensible method of solving the problem. </para>

                <para class="block">I led him to believe that the site at Leichhardt was not a suitable place for a park. I called the channel a sewer because it is a storm-water sewer or channel.  It was built to carry off the storm water from the upper lands about Petersham and Lewisham. This place was filled in, and is absolutely suitable for a park, because right alongside it there is a  boatshed  containing 100 or more boats, and the young people come there and hire boats to go out on the bay. They do not go out on the storm-water channel. I only mentioned the .channel to show that the site was useless as a water frontage.  A road runs right round it, .and goods will have to be carted wherever they go; hut I cast no slurs on the land &#39;as a site for a recreation ground. The Public &#34;Works Department of New  South  &#34;Wales have had special punts  built  to go up to this place, because there is only 3 ft. 6 in. of water there ; so the idea of calling it a water frontage is absolutely ridiculous. &#34;Within a quarter pf a mile a water frontage could be got with deep water right up against the rocks, and railway communication. Even if land had to be bought, I would sooner see the Government buy it than take a public park. They could buy the land at the valuation put on it by the owners .themselves for land tax purposes. </para>

If the goods are landed at Circular Quay or Woolloomooloo Bay, Where most of them are, there is no railway at either place to pick them up, and they have to  be  transferred into motor vans or trolleys and carted 3 or 4 miles to the railway. It is ridiculous to suggest placing the Stores at Liverpool. The question is not one for the Public Works Committee or the Accounts Committee. It is a matter for thorough investigation to find out if the proposal is necessary. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so; it is not their work. A Select Committee of the Senate .would be far better than the Public Works Committee to investigate this matter. A Select Committee would have nothing to do with the construction of the buildings or the foundations, but would simply have to find the most suitable site for Ordnance Stores. The Government will be well advised to hold this proposal over. I intend, on the principle I mentioned at the beginning, to vote against the third reading. </para>

                    <para>. - When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was speaking, I asked the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> by interjection, what the effect would be of the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> notice having been published authorizing the acquisition of the land; but I could not get an answer at the time. Will the Minister say if that procedure will necessarily involve any actual payment of money for private lands so acquired? It is a very good thing that the debate on this monstrous proposal has been continued this morning, because we have heard some most important admissions, and important light has been thrown on&#39; the subject. There was first the admission of the Minister for Defence, which would have saved a lot of discussion if he had made it yesterday, that barges would have to be used to take the goods to and from the new Stores. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> said that to land the goods at Circular- Quay wo lid entail 2 or 3 miles carriage by motor or horse lorry. On the other hand, t&#34;ie additional handling in and out of barges would be infinitely more expensive, both from the wages point of view and from the point of view of the detrimental effect on the goods handled. Anybody who has seen the methods employee, at waterside fronts, where cargo has to be handled two or three times, knows what that means to the goods themselves, and&#39; also what it means in expenses. <inline font-weight="bold">&#39;Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> admission that barges would have to be used to reach the proposed site did away with the whole of his contention of yesterday - that the water frontage to the locality was a most important consideration. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> also gave prominence to another important phase of the question. He pointed out that, under the Public &#34;Works Committee Act, the Defence Department ot the Department of the Navy could, at any time after the Committee had begun an inquiry into a naval or military work properly referred to them by Parliament, instigate the issue of an Order in Council by  the Government to bring  about  a cessation of the inquiry. Are we to accept the Minister&#39;s assurance so repeatedly given in this chamber, that thin work will be referred to the Committee, and then find, twenty-four hours afterwards, that an order has been issued by the Governor-General in Council, under the} plea of naval or military necessity - as has been so often done  - abrogating all reference of the proposal to that Committee? The Minister yesterday did not give the Senate full information on this phase of the question. He appeared to keep back full reference to the points with which he was dealing - reference to which, in fairness, honorable senators were entitled. Another most serious aspect was raised this morning by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall,</inline> who said that he had been informed that the sites of the old Ordnance Stores at Darling Harbor and Circular Quay hid undergone valuation for the purpose of being sold by the Defence Department. When the Minister for Defence was asked directly by that honorable senator if that was so, all he could say was &#34;Not to my knowledge.&#34; It is a monstrous situation that a responsible Minister, in an ultra-responsible position, in an ultra-important Department like that of Defence, should not be in a position to say &#34;Yes&#34; or &#34;No&#34; to such a question. </para>

The Minister, as the responsible head of his Department, should be in a position to know what is going on. As the Bill now before the Committee deals with the establishment of another Ordnance Store, the Minister ought to be in a position to say if it is the intention of his Department, or of the Home and Territories Department, to part with the old Ordnance properties. He ought to be able to say &#34; Yes &#34; or &#34; No &#34; to a question like that, irrespective of which Department values the properties. </para>

                        <para>-It is very true. Another phase of the question which honorable senators opposite have attached much importance to is that the area affected by the Bill is hot park lands; but I maintain that any open space in a densely-populated city like Sydney is a requisite, necessary to the population in that locality. It would not be so bad if this resumption were a single and isolated instance; but as was pointed out last night, this filching of the public parks of Australia is apparently the settled policy of the Government, and of the party supporting them. Action in another direction parallel almost with this, has proved what I say. The working classes and poorer people generally suffer by this policy of filching and inroading upon the public parks, for which commercialism is largely responsible, in densely-populated cities, where tenements and small residential terraces are numerous. Concern for the welfare and health of the children of the working classes is not a matter of consideration with this Government, according to their policy as indicated in the Bill, because the same policy is being followed by administrative acts in other portions of Sydney. It matters not who suffer, so long as commercialism may seize, with its rapacious maw, the public parks and other avenues of recreation for the children of the working people in densely-populated areas, where, I may remark, the large families are to be found.Unfortunatelyit is in these centres that the Government are pursuing their outrageous policy. Then we have the contention put forth, to buttress up this proposal, that responsible business men in Sydney have recommended that it would be a very good thing. Of course it would, from their point of view. If they could centralize the whole of the commercial activities of the Commonwealth in Sydney, they would do it, irrespective of what harm may be done to the rest of Australia, or to the citizens of Sydney themselves. From their point of view, anything making for the advancement of commercialism, even should the interest of every other section of the community be sacrificed, would be quite right. These gentry themselves, who make these glowing representations, and urge the Government to rest their crime - speaking in a political sense - of taking away these public parks from the people, do not suffer by the enforcement of this pernicious doctrine. No, I have no doubt that, after the compilation of the report extracts of which the Minister for Defence read so elaborately yesterday, on the second reading of the Bill, they would probably turn into their club at half-past 3, and perhaps at 4 o&#39;clock would be seated in their well -cushioned motor cars, driving home to some suburban residence, where they would not be deprived of the opportunity of breathing fresh air, as the citizens in densely-populated cities like Sydney are, by the policy of this Government. </para>

I agree with the honorable senator that Sydney, comparatively, is richly endowed with parks, but not so richly endowed as it should be, in view of the enormous area of land that was available for these purposes. I think the honorable senator will also agree that Adelaide is well favoured in this respect; but I regret that Brisbane is not. </para>

                        <para>- The contention which honorable senators on this side advance in support of the amendment is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> - and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle,</inline> who followed him - said it was not proposed to do anything except put the Bill through. Indeed, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> yesterday gave strong reasons for delaying this matter until it had. been submitted to the Public Works Committee. The quotations made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> from the Public Works Committee Act nullified any assurance that we have received from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> because the Government, simply by issuing an Order in Council, may authorize that inquiries be not made into matters of this kind. I can assure the Committee that I have no ulterior motive in opposing this proposal and supporting the amendment. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> had not moved it, I would have voted against the Bill, for the reasons stated yesterday, and which have been repeated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> this morning. I would always vote against this policy of filching public parks from the community. It has been said that the site is no; desirable for a public park; but I maintain that any site is desirable as an open space in densely-populated cities like Sydney. Honorable senators opposite, who are going to vote against the amendment, and support the Bill to take away the public parks of the people, should, in justice to the Committee and the people outside, give sound reasons for their action. This is due to the Committee, in answer to the arguments from this side, which appear to me to be irrefutable. </para>

                    <para>. -  I think any honorable senator would be a political neophyte if be could not see through the tactics of honorable senators opposite with regard to this Bill. When it was before another place, the whole debate centred round the fact that it was proposed to take away a public park; but in my second-reading speech in this Chamber I think I so completely cut away any ground for that argument that honorable senators opposite decided that they must find some other reason for opposition to the Bill ; and so, in the desperate effort to reinforce their sadly depleted ranks, they have made an appeal to honorable senators on this side. Thus we find that an amendment has been moved to refer this matter to the Public Works Committee. Is it not strange that such action was not taken in another place by these staunch guardians of public morals and public honesty? Is it not strange that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> who has constituted himself the guardian of the Public Works Committee, did not convey to the  Chairman  of that body, who sits in another place, the intimation that the rights of the Committee were being ignored? Is it not wonderful that when this Bill was being debated in another place with some force for a considerable time, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> did not suggest to honorable members there that the time had come for them to assert themselves, and demand that the Public Works Committee be given an opportunity to save the country from this huge expenditure - from this injustice which was about to be perpetrated? </para>

                <para>As to the point concerning speculators, no speculators could have got in, or can get in, with regard to the land which is the subject of this Bill, for the reason that it is a reserve. It is a question whether the area concerned remains with the State or with the Commonwealth Government. Therefore, there can be no doubt as to speculators. In the matter of the private land, which is not referred to or dealt with in this Bill, that area has been purchased, so far as we can go at present, under the Lands Acquisition Act, and if private speculators have got in - which I deny - this amendment certainly will not help in any way. If we had not purchased that land, however - if we had introduced this Bill first - private speculators would have had plenty of time to get in. The course which has been adopted is the very practice we were bound to follow in order to protect the public purse. We first secured by gazettal the option to purchase that land at its then price. We thus prevented any transfers taking place with added values subsequently, and before the announcement of what the Government proposed to do. Now, we see that the very action deemed necessary to protect the public purse is that with which the Opposition finds fault. </para>

                    seemed to think that the fact that an official had made the selection discounted its value. Suppose the Public Works Committee had to make the selection. Would it discount the advice of experts? Would it say that  Colonel Owen,  Director of Public Works in the Works Department, is not a competent man to advise them? Such officials as that gentleman are the very persons whom the Committee always calls as witnesses; so that even if the selection of the site was a proper question to refer to the Public Works Committee this same argument could well be used against that body in making its selection -
                    <inline font-style="italic">namely,</inline>
                    that it had adopted the advice of expert officials. When the Senate deliberately passes a Public Works Committee Act it does not thereby lay upon that body the right to select sites.

                    <para>I do not think it is necessary for me to detain the Senate at any length, inasmuch as the measure now before us does not introduce any new principle of taxation. It is a machinery measure, and one that is designed to remedy those imperfections which experience has shown to exist in the law already on our statute-book. It is a Bill which can be much more effectually dealt with in Committee. But I should like to indicate briefly the main purposes of, and the chief amendments that are contemplated in, the measure now submitted for the consideration of honorable senators. The main objects of this Bill are (1) to make provision for arrangements being made with the States for a uniform income tax return, and a uniform system of collecting  income tax, and (2) to make various amendments in the principal Act which experience has shown to be desirable in order to facilitate the administration of the Act, to prevent leakages of taxation, and, in one or two cases, to place the incidence of the tax on a more equitable basis. Most of the amendments have been recommended by the Conference of Commonwealth and State Commissioners of Taxation which met in Melbourne in March and April of last year. </para>
                    <para>Dealing with the more important provisions of the measure, I should like, first, to say a word or two in regard to the clauses relating to the exemptions. Provision is made in the Bill for the exemption of war pensions, and of the income of agricultural, horticultural, or other similar societies, not carried on for the purpose of profit or gain. On the other hand, interest on money invested in the War Loan, after the commencement of the Act, will not be exempt unless it is declared to be exempt in the prospectus issued in connexion with the loan. The section exempting the income from personal exertion of persons on active service has been re-cast to make it clear that that section applies only to the income earned by that person whilst on active service, and not to income earned previously. </para>
                    <para>In regard to the sections in the Act relating to income, this Bill contemplates certain alterations. For instance, provision is made to include in income the annual rental value of premises occupied by an employee as a residence in connexion with his employment. Previously he had to include in his return 5 per cent, of the capital value of the premises. </para>

                    <para>SenatorMILLEN. - I do not know whether under the heading of income tax my honorable friend can bring forward his usual panacea. But I am perfectly certain that if there be the slightest opportunity for him to do so, he will avail himself of it. In regard to companies, it is provided in the principal Act that amounts carried forward to a profit and loss account are not to be regarded as accumulated income, but are taxable in the hands of the shareholders. It is proposed in this Bill to legalize the departmental interpretation that this provision includes amounts carried forward to an appropriation account, revenue, and expenses account, or any similar account. Shareholders cannot, therefore, claim refunds of tax already paid on dividends received by them, and paid by companies out of funds standing at any time to the credit of any of the accounts mentioned. Where shares have been transferred to the Public Trustee under the provisions of the War Precautions (Enemy Shareholders) Regulations, the Public Trustee is to pay tax on the incomes from those shares without any deduction. It is proposed to omit from the principal Act section 17a dealing with the liability of fire and marine insurance companies in Australia re-insuring with similar companies outside Australia for tax on the premiums paid to those companies. This section has been found to be unnecessary. </para>
                    <para>With regard to deductions, the measure contains the proposals which follow : - Deductions are to be allowed for all payments made to any patriotic fund and to the Repatriation Department. Previously deductions were only made in the case of payments exceeding &#163;5. Mining syndicates are to be in the same position as mining companies, and a deduction is to be allowed of the whole amount of calls on their shares. In the case of mining companies, amounts appropriated for development or new plant may be deducted, but if any of the money so appropriated is not expended within the year, it is to be liable to taxation. Pay- . ments by husband to wife or wife to husband may be deducted if the Commissioner is satisfied that they were made in the course of business and for services rendered. </para>
                    <para>The Commissioner may allow a deduction for bad debts in any year, if he is satisfied that the taxpayer has in that or any previous years included those debts as income in his return. An amendment is proposed in regard to the deduction by an employer of wages for his children under fifteen years of age. These wages are not to be deducted unless actually paid. It is proposed to allow a deduction in regard to improvements made by lessees who have no tenant rights in the improvements. This deduction is to be ascertained by dividing the value of the  improvements by trie number of years which the lease -has to run. </para>
                    <para>Where income consists of income from property and income from personal exertion, the deductions are to be made from the income to which they relate, except in the case of insurance premiums, contributions to. superannuation funds, &#38;c, gifts to patriotic funds, &#38;c, and deductions in respect of children. These deductions are to be&#39; made from that class of income which is the greater. This amendment was recommended by the recent Taxation Conference. It. is considered that it wil} be more equitable in its operation than is the present provision in the Act. In the case of the special deduction of &#163;156 or &#163;100 provided for in section 19 of the Act, this deduction is to be made in the first place from the income from property. If the deduction exceeds that income, the excess is to be deducted from the income from personal exertion. Under the present law it has. been found that in some cases persons with mixed incomes are entitled to. a deduction much greater than &#163;156, and, in fact, to a greater deduction than persons in receipt of a similar income from personal exertion only. The proposed amendment will remove this anomaly. Where a taxpayer in receipt of income from property carries on one or more businesses and makes a net loss thereon, he may deduct that loss from his income from property. The definition of &#34; business &#34; has been widened to include salary or wages </para>

                    <para>With regard to the collection and payment of the tax, this Bill contemplates a number of alterations. It provides that persons who intend to carry on business for a short time only - that is to say, theatrical artists, for example - may be required to give security that they will furnish a .return and pay tax on the income derived from the business. Provision is also made for the collection of tax due from a taxpayer who dies after furnishing a return or during the financial year. </para>
                    <para>Tax due by an employee may, if the employee makes default in payment, be collected from the employer from moneys due by him to the employee. If the employee has left his employment, the employer ceases to be liable. When a person&#39;s whereabouts are unknown, the Commissioner may require any person making payments to that person to deduct the amount of the tax, and to pay that amount to him. Persons in receipt, control or disposal of money belonging to absentees are required to pay the tax due from the absentee, but are personally liable only to the extent of any moneys of the absentees in their hands, or which may come into their hands, and are indemnified for any payments made in respect of the absentee&#39;s income. Provision is also made for the payment of tax on cash prizes in lotteries at the source. </para>
                    <para>Partnerships, as a whole, are not to be subject to taxation, but each partner is to be separately assessed in respect of his interest in the partnership. A similar provision is to be made with regard to trustees with respect to the interest of each beneficiary. </para>
                    <para>The Bill also contains provision dealing with the administration of the Act. Most of the amendments other than those to which I have referred, will come under that heading. For instance, the definition of &#34; agent &#34; is widened in order that persons outside Australia who receive income from Australia may be more effectually reached. Then there is a provision that no refunds will be paid unless application is made within three years after the payment of the tax, and one or two small amendments have been rendered necessary by the appointment of an assistant Commissioner of Taxation. Further amendments designed to facilitate the administration of the Act, relate to the appointment of the, public officer of a company, the power to obtain information and evidence, the onus of proof in regard to false statements, and the penalties for failure to furnish returns, failure to include assessable income in returns, and for making false statements. Briefly, these are the more important of the amendments which are contemplated in this Bill. As I have already indicated, it is a measure with which we can deal more effectually in Committee, and I need only add that when we reach that stage I shall be only too pleased to make quite clear the whole of its purposes. </para>

                <para class="block">As honorable senators are aware, there is in the existing law a provision requiring the Treasurer to set aside each year a certain amount by way of a sinking fund for the redemption of the public debt of the Commonwealth. The Bill I now submit repeals the provisions of the Inscribed Stock Act, to which I have referred, and proposes to re-enact them with some alterations in a separate or specific measure. One reason for this is that the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act does not cover loans obtained from the Imperial Government for war purposes, and it has been decided in submitting this special measure to make provision in it for all loans, quite apart from those covered by the Inscribed Stock Act. The Bill proposes the re-enactment of the provision requiring the Treasurer to pay into a sinking fund an amount of not less than 10s. per centum per annum on the public debt, and also any balance of loan moneys raised in excess of requirements. The other clauses of the measure are practically those which already appear in the existing law, and it is therefore not necessary that I should specially refer to them. There is a merely formal provision by which the amount already standing to the credit of the sinking fund created under the existing Act shall automatically be transferred to the sinking fund created as the result of the passing of this measure. </para>

                    <para class="block">This is another small measure, which I anticipate will go through without exciting much discussion and still less opposition. As honorable senators are aware, an arrangement was completed between the Treasurer and the banks by which the latter were not only enabled, but encouraged, to make advances to those desirous of investing in the war loans. It is thought not only desirable, but entirely proper, that where banks have done that they should be able to record in the stock register the liens which they hold over stock standing in the names of any of their debtors. Provision is made in this Bill to enable that to be done. Another matter which arises in connexion with our war loans is covered by clause 4 of the Bill. The interest on war savings certificates, which are really Treasury bonds, is payable at the end of three years after the issue of the certificate. The purchaser of a &#163;1 certificate pays 17s. 6d. in cash for it, and at the end of three years the Treasury will redeem the certificate by paying &#163;1 for it. The interest for the whole three years is, therefore, paid at the close of the currency of the bond. The object of clause 4 is to enable the Treasurer to set aside a sum each year for the payment of the interest, so  that no undue burden may fall on the year of the maturity of the bond. </para>
                    <para>The terms of the issue of war savings certificates include a condition that the Treasurer will repurchase them on being satisfied as to the merits of the application by the holder for the money, and provision is made in this Bill to enable the Treasurer to repurchase war savings certificates from the proceeds of any war loans. </para>
                    <para>Under the existing law, war loan securities are not liable to stamp duty or other taxation of the Commonwealth or a State. This Bill continues that provision, except where by the prospectus of a loan the securities are declared to be liable. </para>
                    <para>As the law stands, interest on stock or Treasury bonds is not liable to income tax, and provision is made in this Bill to make this form of income free of income taxation unless it is declared by the prospectus of a loan to be liable to the tax. A similar provision is included in this Bill with regard to State income tax. I anticipate that the provisions of the Bill will secure the ready concurrence of honorable senators. </para>

                    <para>That this Bill be now read a second time. </para>
                    <para>This Bill is intended to provide funds for the purchase of war loan securities in the open market. The intention is to keep up the price of war loans and enable holders to obtain on the sale of their stock or bonds about as much as they paid on their subscriptions to the loan. The need for action such as this has been recognised in Great Britain, where already a law exists corresponding in all essentials with the Bill now submitted to the Senate. </para>
                    <para>The operative clause of the measure is clause 2, under which the Treasurer will be required to pay monthly into the Trust Fund, under the head of the &#34; War Loan Securities Repurchase Account,&#34; a sum equal to one-eighth of 1 per cent. of so much of the public debt as relates to war loans received from lenders other than the Government of the United Kingdom. It is clearly unnecessary that there should be a war loan securities repurchase provision in relation to the money owed by us to Great Britain. </para>
                    <para>When the unexpended balance of the war loans securities repurchase account is equal to the sum of &#163;1,000,000, the payments into the account will cease, and no further payments will be made until the unexpended balance falls below the sum of &#163;900,000. That is to say, payments will be made from time to time into this account to build up a purchasing power of &#163;1,000,000. When that credit is reached, it is considered safe that payments into the fund may cease. If the fund is depleted by purchases - and they will only be made if there is a tendency on the part of the stock to fall below par - and is reduced below &#163;900,000, the payments will again commence to bring the credit of the account up to &#163;1,000,000, which is regarded as the figure at which it should stand. </para>
