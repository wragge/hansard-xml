However, in response to what I regard as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> invitation to refer to the matter to which I think he alludes, though he did not definitely mention it, I am quite willing, with the concurrence of the Senate, to state what I know of the incident. </para>

                            <para>- I presume that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> alludes to the seizure in another place of certain reprints of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> by military authority or by some authority of which I have not been informed. The only knowledge I have of the matter is that some time after 12  o&#39;clock on a Saturday afternoon, the date of which I do not remember, and just as I was leaving the building, I got an urgent telephone call from the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> informing me that he believed that there were 20,000 or 30,000 pamphlet reprints of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> on the House of Representatives side of the building which were not proper reprints. Seeing that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr, Speaker</inline> was not. present at the time, the Minister asked me to issue instructions that these pamphlets should not be allowed to go out of the building until such time as he had obtained an opinion regarding them from the Crown Law authorities. I reminded the Minister that my authority did not extend to the House of Representatives side, but that, in view of the circumstances, which ho assured me were urgent, and which assurance was subsequently confirmed in a letter forwarded immediately, I said that, acting for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> as he and I have always done for each other in urgent cases, I would issue the necessary instructions that the pamphlets should not be allowed to go out of the building until <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> could be communicated with by telegram, when my responsibility would, of course, cease. Before 12 o&#39;clock on the following Monday <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> had arrived. That is all I had to do with the matter, and all that I know about it. </para>

                    <para class="block">I may explain that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> as be has the Ministerial statement in charge, has asked me to move this motion. That is the reason why he, as the Leader of the Senate, is not moving it himself. It is a motion which, I am sure, will find a responsive echo in the hearts of all true Australians. All of us, no matter what our political views may be, have been stirred to the depths by the serious and dramatic events that have been taking place on the bloody fields of France. Not even the least imaginative of us can lose sight of the terrible portent that may be behind those events for the country that we love and to which we belong. It is no exaggeration to say that human liberty and freedom are at this moment trembling in the balance, and that the titanic fight now going on is a fight that will determine the future history of this globe for centuries to come. When we see the enormous hordes that Germany and Austria are able to put into the field, and that, notwithstanding the incomparable bravery of the British andFrench troops, they have been able to overwhelm many of our countrymen and to drive them back into a condition that constitutes  a  strategic danger to the Allied cause, we must all realize how serious the issue is. This Parliament, representing, as it does, the people of Australia, and being, as it is, the guardian of all those countrymen of ours who are at this moment fighting for our liberty, is the body best qualified to speak in the name of this country, and to send oversea to those countrymen of ours, to their British cousins, and to their gallant French and American Allies,  a  message of hope, encouragement, and admiration. In that message I feel sure we can all join. I feel confident that there is no room for a difference of opinion on the matter, and I hope and believe that this motion, moved as it will be in both Houses of this Parliament, will go forward as the unanimous expression of opinion of this country, showing our interest, our sympathy, our trust, and our hope in regard to this great struggle. Because I hope and believe that the motion will be the unanimous expression of opinion of the Australian people, I do not propose to say one word on any other phase of this great issue, except that - and I think I can be permitted to say it without arousing any hostile discussion, or without it. being said that I dragged into the question anything of a controversial nature - if ever there was  a  call for unity of action, if ever there was  a  call for us to forget our party and political and all other differences, and to remember only that we are Britons, and that in this struggle we stand possibly to share a common victory or a common fate, that call is now. That fact should surely enable us to learn the lesson that this great conflict is teaching us, and help us and all sections of the community to draw closer together to render support to our gallant countrymen, and our gallant Allies, who are so sorely pressed at this juncture. </para>

                            <para>. -  I asso iate myself with all that the Minister for Defence has said on the motion. I feel the gravity of the situation, for no one can read what is happening on the battle fronts of Europe without a considerable amount of anxiety ;  but with all the anxiety that the powerful offensive of &#34;the enemy may cause us, we know that it is in battle fronts alone that heroes are made, and Australia and the Empire, and their Allies, have developed quite a large number of heroes, who have in the past done valiantly, fighting, as the Minister has so well worded it, for human liberty and human freedom. There is another wise old saw that &#34;high hopes fulfilled from disappointment spring,&#34; and I venture to say that many of us of a more sanguine nature, who, perhaps, had looked upon the war as more than half won twelve months ago, can still feel that the present disappointment is only a temporary set-back, that the hopes, not only of Australia and the British Empire, but of the civilized world, will be realized, and that the flag of freedom will still fly over a civilized community. I join entirely with the Minister in the submission of the motion, and can join heartily also in his suggestion that the time has passed for personal or party differences. The time has passed for mere words and phrases which pretend to bridge over those differences, and, although I have not consulted the party .1 represent, I think I am speaking the thoughts of that party when I say that we are quite prepared to meet this Government in any sane proposal to assist our soldiers fighting at the Front. I second the motion. </para>

                        <para>At the inquiries conducted by the Inspector of Military Accounts and by the Board of Inquiry referred to in paragraph 2 of this report, it could not then be definitely established that any official in the Pay Office or in any other section of the Defence Department received any direct benefit from the &#34; pay sheet &#34; and other frauds alleged to have been committed by ex-Lieutenant Howell-Price, although in some instances the circumstances were such as to create grave suspicion. Owing to the decision not to proceed with the further charges against the accused, these circumstances could not he followed up. The incident discloses gross. negligence and laxity, and provides a remarkable display of unquestioning credulity. It is inexplicable &#39;that ex-Lieutenant Howell-Price was not prosecuted for embezzlement or for the alleged forage frauds, but was convicted on a charge of forgery only, when it is considered that the amount involved under the two former heads far exceeds the sum in respect of which the forgery charges were laid. In justice to all concerned, and in order that certain suspicion may be removed, we think that proceedings should be taken- </para>

                            <para>-Order! The honorable senator is contravening my ruling, as well as the well-known practice of this Senate, namely, that questions must only be asked for the purpose of obtaining information, and must contain no argument. The honorable senator is reading a long statement from, I presume, a report of a Royal Commission. If other honorable senators were to be allowed the same freedom of discussion, the asking of questions would be endless, and . would lead to very lengthy debate. The honorable senator is only entitled to indicate the passage to which he alludes when asking a question, and must not read a long statement. </para>

                        - Since Parliament rose, as honorable members are doubtless aware, the Treasurer (Lord Forrest) has been obliged by serious indisposition to resign his position m the Government. Honorable senators will, I am sure, join with me in wishing the right honorable gentleman a speedy restoration to health, and in congratulating him upon the signal honour bestowed upon him by  His  Majesty the King in recognition of a long and distinguished public career. The vacancy thus created has been filled by the appointment of the Honorable W. A. Watt, as Treasurer. The Honorable L. E. Groom has assumed the office of Minister for Works and Railways.

                <para>The Senate and the country are aware of the gravity of the present military situation in Europe. Without attempting to arouse undue anxiety, it is plain that the British and Allied Forces are being subjected to a strain hitherto unparalleled in this fearful war. The Empire is now facing a crisis which calls for the utmost effort and sacrifice. In the face of the common danger it is not too much to hope that the people of all parts of the Empire - including this Commonwealth - will present a united and unwavering front. Only in such unity can safety be found. The Government  invites, and will do everything in its power to promote, this vital national solidarity. It will be within the knowledge of honorable members that the British Government has asked representatives of the  Dominions to meet in London at an. early date. The Government feels that at this critical juncture Australia must be represented thereat. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> and the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Joseph Cook)</inline> are to represent the Commonwealth, </para>
                <para>In a Ministerial statement addressed to Parliament shortly before the adjournment, it was intimated that the Government propose to take steps in the near future with a view to strengthening it, and making it more efficient to meet the increasing pressure of war duties and those economic and other conditions arising out of the war. It has been obvious for some considerable time that the pressure upon several Departments caused by the war necessitated such a policy. The difficulty thus felt will be intensified by the absence of two senior Ministers visiting London. The additions to the  strength of the Government to which I have before alluded have been made to meet the situation thus created. In connexion with these new appointments, it &#39; has been deemed advisable to arrange such a re-allotment of Ministerial duties as to secure the most efficient discharge of the public business. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Poynton</inline> will act as Minister for the Navy and will also have charge of shipping and shipbuilding. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wise</inline> will discharge the duties previously undertaken by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Groom,</inline> and will be give,n certain defined lines of administration, among which will be allotments and separation allowances, contracts and supplies until the business board takes these over. Citizen Force administration, rifle club matters, works and certain details of the Australian Imperial Force. ^ It has been arranged that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Orchard&#39;*</inline> shall have complete control of the recruiting movement, and be free, as far as possible, from administrative work. The recruiting staffs will, however, be passed under his control. The Government has reason to believe that its proposals relating to voluntary recruiting will thus be stimulated, and that by the co-operation of all classes in the community the desired reinforcements will be forthcoming. </para>
                <para>A large number of commercial undertakings of considerable magnitude, the direct result of the war, has heretofore been centered in the Prime Minister&#39;s Department. These matters include metals, wool, wheat, butter, and others of a similar character. The control of these will be transferred to the Trade and Customs. Department. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> and Mr.0 Massy. Greene will be associated with the Minister &#39; for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jensen),</inline> and two representatives of the business world will be invited to act in consultation with them. Although Ministerial responsibility will be fully maintained, it is hoped by this to secure the assistance of competent business men, and thus insure the handling of the gigantic undertaking above referred to with national advantage under a minimum of friction. </para>
                <para>Certain financial measures will be presented, including an Income Tax Assessment Bill, Supply Bills covering supplementary estimates for the two past years, and for the necessary provision for the current year, and Bills relating to inscribed stock and to the sinking funds. </para>
                <para>A Bill to amend the Defence Act will be introduced, embodying many of the suggestions made by the recent Royal Commission to inquire into military and naval administration. Provision will also be made for strengthening the Citizen Forces. </para>
                <para>In order to co-ordinate the work of the Defence Department more completely with the other Commonwealth Departments, and with the general policy of the Government, it is proposed to establish a Council of Defence, consisting of the Prime Minister, the Minister for the Navy, the Minister for Defence, representatives of the Navy and Defence Departments, and two members of the recently appointed business Board. </para>
                <para>Honorable senators are familiar with the proposals of the Government with reference to recruiting. The Minister for Defence will deal in detail with this matter later in the debate. </para>
                <para>The Commonwealth ship-building scheme is now definitely established. The Commonwealth Government has taken over from the Victorian Government the State Ship-building Yards at &#34;Williamstown, and two standardized steel ships of 5,500 tons are now under construction. Six others of similar design will be also constructed there. In addition to this a contract has been let with the New South Wales Government for the construction of six similar vessels at Walsh Island, and for two at Devonport, in Tasmania. Negotiations for the construction 6f steel ships in Queensland and South Australia are not yet complete. All the material and- engines for these vessels are being manufactured in Australia. That is, with the exception of the large plates for the first six ships, which were not procurable here, and were ordered from America. This material is now on its way. </para>
                <para>In June, 1917, an order was placed in America for fourteen first-class wooden ships of 3,200 tons, four to be equipped with two full Diesel engines, and ten first-class wooden cargo steamers. Owing to various reasons, mainly to troubles with  shipways,  delivery of material, labour troubles, &#38;c, the delivery of these boats has been delayed. Two vessels have been launched and others will shortly follow. All are expected to arrive in Australia during the year. </para>
                <para>Twenty-two oversea ships have been diverted from the Australian trade, and to further meet the urgent and pressing requirements of the British Government five others under Commonwealth control have been diverted. In addition to this, twenty-six vessels hitherto engaged in the coastal and Eastern trade and eight engaged in New Zealand trade have been released for the use of the British Government. Two contracts for construction by private firms in Australia of wooden ships to be fitted with auxiliary engines have been completed. One is for six ships of 2,600 tons. The second is for six ships of 2,300 tons. </para>

The Government has been met in a broadminded and patriotic spirit by these bodies; and after full discussion the main principles of the scheme have been approved. They involve the complete organization of all industries, primary and secondary, into associations, which will send representatives to a general Council of Commerce and Industry, and the Science and Industry Bureau will be thoroughly equipped and re-staffed to be at the disposal of this organization. The scheme is directed to enable Australian industries to adapt themselves to the new conditions, and to rebuild, on a new basis, the post-war channels of trade and commerce. </para>

Legislation will also be brought forward to remove certain defects of the existing industrial machinery, and to provide more effective methods of dealing with industrial problems. The matter is, in this time of national crisis, of the highest importance for defence; and it is proposed to deal with it by a Bill framed in reliance upon the Defence power - and therefore free from the complicated constitutional limitations of a Commonwealth Arbitration power. The scope of the measure will be limited to certain industries of national importance - for example, transport, base metal mining and metallurgy, coal mining, the manufacture of iron and steel, the handling of wheat, &#38;c, for export, the manufacture of munitions, &#38;c. </para>

It has been found necessary in connexion with this Act to provide for certain amendments to be made. I have given notice to introduce a Bill to achieve that purpose. </para>
                <para>That is the statement which I proposed to put before honorable senators as to the proposals of the Government for the present session, and it embodies information on many matters which are, I think, of very considerable public importance. To enable the Senate, if it wishes, to discuss this statement, I beg to move - </para>

                            <para>A written suggestion was received on8th September, 1917, from the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures that a Board of Surgeons, or surgeons and business men, with executive power, should be appointed to whom inventions that aim for the relief of suffering or maimed soldiers could be submitted. This was replied to on 25th September, 1917, by a communication pointing out that there are in existence in Victoria two Advisory Boards consisting of leading surgeons and physicians respectively, to whom inventions in connexion with surgical appliances are referred for expert advice. </para>

                            <para>Approval was given some time ago for the formation in each State of an Advisory Committee consisting of the best available surgeons and physicians. Much valuable service has been rendered by these committees in connexion with all matters concerning the health and well-being of the troops, and surgical and medical inventions and appliances have been submitted to them for examination and report. In addition to these permanent committees the Department has always been able to obtain the services in an advisory capacity of the best experts in all branches of medical and surgical science. Under the system suggested the proposed Committee would be Federal in character. This modification, if adopted, would involve more disadvantages than advantages. Apart from the difficulty of bringing together from all over Australia the several members of the Committee, it has been found in the past that, owing to local variations in conditions, corresponding variations in the provisions made in the several districts are sometimes advisable. The granting to such a Committee of powers other than advisory is not necessary for the purposes in view and not advisable for other obvious reasons. </para>
