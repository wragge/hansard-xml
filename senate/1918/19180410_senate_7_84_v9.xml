I have gathered from the press reports to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> has referred that the Committee has made, or is making, a recommendation in the terms indicated by the report. The Government has not yet considered that recommendation, but, in view of the question put by the honorable senator, I shall invite the attention of my colleagues to the matter, with a view of getting a Government pronouncement on the suggestion. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps, as I am a member of the Historic Memorials Committee, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle's</inline> question might more properly have been directed to me. First of all, I want to say that the reports which have appeared in the newspapers are not correct. No arrangements whatever have been made for the painting of any portraits. All that has been done has been to make a recommendation that a sketch should bo made of each of the individuals who were referred to in the report, so. that, if it were subsequently deemed advisable, portraits of those individuals might be painted. Honorable senators may be aware that one of the ideas which the Fisher Government had in creating the Historic Memorials Committee was to give some encouragement to Australian artists, as the portraits to be painted were to be entirely the work of Australian artists. Amongst the gentlemen whose portraits it is considered advisable to paint is  His Excellency  the Governor-General, who, in the ordinary course of time, if his term of office is not renewed, will be leaving for England. If no sketch is made of him now, it will be impossible for an Australian artist to paint his portrait, except from a photograph. Another gentleman a sketch of whom it is suggested should be made is the Right Honorable W. M. Hughes, the Prime Minister. It is considered likely that he will depart for the Old Country in the near future, and in these times of danger in travelling it was deemed advisable that a sketch should be made of him before he departs, so that we might have something from which an Australian artist might paint an authentic portrait It is the same in the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Cook. So far as the other gentlemen referred to in the report are concerned, it is only a matter of keeping faith with the artists of Australia. Personally, I have no ambition at all to decorate any canvas, in oils or otherwise. I make this explanation for the information of honorable senators. With regard to the recommendation' to place a sum of Â£100 on the Estimates for the purchase of Australian works of art: It was pointed out to the Historic Memorials Committee by the expert member of the Committee, the Director in charge of the National Art Gallery in Sydney, that if a small sum were placed on the Estimates it might very often foe found possible to pick up in Australia some exceedingly valuable Australian work of art, the purchase of which might, even from a commercial point of view, be highly desirable. That is the reason for proposing that Â£100 should be placed on the Estimates for such a purpose. </para>

It would enlighten the public if the Minister could give one or two typical cases of the detention of pay, and could state whether it is the rule to retain a certain percentage of the deferred pay due to soldiers for a certain period after they have returned. </para>

                        <para>- The rule is that if there are fines, or deductions of that kind, against the soldier overseas they are deducted in the first place from whatever ordinary pay may be due to him, and after that from his deferred pay. The reason for withholding a certain portion of the soldier's pay after his return is that it is necessary to wait until his papers are received from overseas, so that should there be any deductions charged against him overseas they may be deducted, and the balance is then paid to the soldier. </para>

                            <para>. - As certain privileges of Parliament have been recently taken away, I contend that the privilege of placing questions of public interest on the business-paper should not be taken away from senators. No such question should be eliminated from the notice-paper, especially without any information being given to the senator responsible for it. I contend that the question of which I. gave notice is legitimate. It asks for information that I want. I wish to know what the Commonwealth Police Force is doing, and why they are not put on to work that they can do if they are still in existence. My intention in asking the question was to get that information, so that the Commonwealth Police Force should be placed in a position where they could, at all events, earn their money. I have a, legitimate right to ask such questions, and when that right is denied to me one of the privileges of Parliament is taken away from me coming here as I do as one of the representatives of New South Wales. ' Unfortunately you, sir, say that the question contains a statement. It contains the truth at all events, as has been clearly proved recently. Some time ago, in the Senate, I asked the Minister for Defence a question about the Â£10,000 found in a drawer at the Victoria Barracks, Sydney.  His  reply was that it was not a correct statement. It has been proved since that it is correct. If I had been given a proper answer then, there would perhaps have been no need for an outside body to go to the Victoria Barracks and find out the facts. </para>

                            <para>.- Like other honorable senators, I feel that a very serious attack has been made upon the privileges of honorable senators by, your action, sir, in relation to the questions of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall.</inline> This applies more particularly to that regarding the Commonwealth Police Force. You, sir,, have told us that certain words were eliminated by you because you believed that they were not fulfilling the functions of a question under the Standing Orders, namely, to seek information. What were* the' words which you, of your own volition, removed from the question? The Senate is entitled to know what they were before it can be in the best position to judge whether you were acting within the authority conferred upon you by the Standing Orders, when you caused the  Clerk  of the Senate to remove that part of the question which an honorable senator on this  side desired to put to a Minister. As a matter of fact, it is immaterial which side of the chamber the question comes from. The question submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> was one of high public importance, to which the Government of the day ought to give a straight and definite answer. I submit, without making any direct charge, or making any insinuation against yourself, sir, that it would appear as if you, by your action, endeavoured to relieve the Government from some unpleasant position created by the putting of the question. No doubt, you will inform the Senate of the exact words you caused to be excised. </para>

I am offering no specific opinion upon the matter on which you have ruled to-day; but I am taking particular exception to your action in disallowing a question submitted by a member of the Senate on behalf of the public of Australia, seeking information from a responsible Minister. I support the motion, for I cannot conceive of senators being called upon to defend a more sacred right than that now involved. If our questions, which are presented to Ministers" in pursuance of a public duty, are to be censored, so to speak, by you, sir, I want to know where we stand as public representatives. The Senate will be only adopting a course consistent with its own interests and dignity by agreeing to the motion. </para>

                            <para>. - Before dealing with the motion now before the Senate, I should like to direct attention to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long's-,</inline> recent remark, which, in my judgment, is in the nature of a censure upon you, Mr. President, for the action you have taken. I venture to say that you would have been open to censure if you  had not so carried out the Standing Orders, and I invite honorable senators to distinguish  between the advisability or otherwise of the Standing Orders and the obligation placed upon you of interpreting them. Our Standing Orders are definite in the responsibility which they place upon the Presiding Officer to see that questions do not offend, and if they so offend, to prevent their appearing upon the notice-paper. I can quite understand that an honorable 'senator should disagree with the Standing Orders, and think, perhaps, that it would be better if we abolished altogether all restrictions upon the idiosyncrasies of individual members in regard to questions; but I again point out that it is the duty of the Presiding Officer to see that questions do not offend against our Standing Orders. Standing order 99 reads as follows: - </para>

                                <para>-Then I can hope to secure the support of the honorable senator, because I think I shall deal with this question in such a way as to show that the action taken by the  President  interferes with the rights and privileges of the Senate, though it is probable that this may have been due to rather a short-sighted view of the question, for I do not assume that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> deliberately and with malice aforethought, attempted to wipe out <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall's</inline> question. We all know that a certain amount of ridicule is attached to the Commonwealth Police Force. The fact that the police were called into existence is almost a cause for laughter whenever mention is made of the appointment. One cannot mention the Commonwealth Police Force without being greeted with roars of laughter at the nature of the hen hatched from the Warwick egg. The question is, that the police force he put in the position of searching for the mail-bag thieves. Suppose I asked the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> if he would put a sufficient number of men on to home service so that they might be distributed along our coast to watch for the men who have been laying mines, would any one consider that as containing a statement of fact, and that it must, therefore, be ruled out of order? The very essence of this question is a plain statement of fact on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall.</inline> It is to the effect that, seeing that the Commonwealth Police Force, which has been called into existence, and for which, the taxpayers are paying, is not being put to sufficient employment, it should be given employment upon a very necessary work. I appeal to honorable senators to mark the difference in. the two questions - that which the honorable senator has put and that which I have indicated. If any honorable senator were to ask, in view of the fact that mines had been laid along our coast, whether the Minister for Defence would employ a sufficient body of guards to watch out coast line, in order to capture the men who had laid the mines, would the  President  rule that out of order? Would the Senate take that as a question that no honorable senator had a right to ask? Everything in this House, it seems to me, is done nowadays on. a party basis, with party bias. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that this is irony. This Commonwealth Police Force is the most comical thing ever brought into existence, and the only tragedy about it is that just when money is wanted more than ever we should have to pay for its establishment. </para>

                                <para>- I know that at the time I was assisting the Minister I had a great deal to answer for, but there is nothing in my career that will give me more pleasure than that I am able to .say that I can answer in a way that will never bring a blush of shame to my face. If the  President  can rule a question out  when an honorable senator is asking for information - because the Commonwealth Police Force is such a howling farce that every one must laugh at it, and every question about it is ironical, and awkward, and difficult for the Government - then what is going to happen in more serious times? In my earliest political days, when I first entered Parliament, a sage politician instilled into my mind that he had always fought in Parliament for the increasing of our liberties, and never for their curtailment. I refer to the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes. I warn honorable senators not to give increased powers to the  President  to use the Standing Orders to suit what I may call his narrow view. The  President  has no right to assume that an honorable senator is joking, if he is in earnest- that an honorable senator ia ironical, if he maintains that he is serious in asking his question. We have a rule that if an honorable senator denies an imputation we have a right to accept his denial. If honorable senators support the  President  in a ruling which for all time will curtail the powers of honorable senators in asking questions, and we give the  President  the power to strike matter out of a question, as he has done, and without the Senate condemning him, then there are very few questions that might not suffer the same fate. I know that we need not fear that that would be done. In my view the  President  has been misled in dealing with this question in the way he has done. We see the screaming farce of the Commonwealth Government having appointed a police force where there is no work for tha men to do, or, at any rate, not sufficient to be regarded as commensurate with their pay. We should read the standing order carefully. It is as follows: - </para>

                        <para class="block">I recognise the difficulty of inducing honorable senators to vote against any ruling from the Chair, but I seriously ask them to preserve our privileges from the interference of any one man. The  President  is only like other honorable members of the Senate until he is elected to his position, and I say that we have already seen "too much of the curtailment of the privileges of members of Parliament. We have had too many of these little trespasses upon Parliament, which should stand supreme as the one fortress of liberty left. We should be most careful not to permit further infringements upon our rights. I feel that it is impossible to deal seriously with any matter referring to the shrieking farce of the Commonwealth Police Force, but I do appeal to honorable senators, and even to the  President  himself, to read <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall's</inline> question and the standing order dealing with questions, and say whether they really think that the standing order has been infringed. It is not too late now for the  President  to withdraw the ruling he has given, and which I believe was, given because he 'felt that any mention of the Commonwealth Police Force would be a cause of laughter, since there is nothing serious about it, and it is &lt;a fair mark for every one who wishes to gibe at it. This is the place where we should ask for information, and I have not heard yet from any member of the Government the reason why the Commonwealth Police Force was called into existence. Each member of the Senate' must bear in mind that he should be held responsible for the extent to which he assists in curtailing the liberties we possess by any vote that he gives. Honorable senators should not be regarded as a set of school children, or members of a debating club, to be kept in order by a master. I again ask honorable senators to read the question which has been disallowed, and if it can be set aside as something humorous which ought not to be taken in earnest, we may as well bid good-bye to any fair opportunity to ask questions which may embarrass the Government if we happen to have a  President  - and T am not imputing this to you, sir - who may ( desire to assist the Government out of an awkward position. I ask honorable senators not to view the motion as one of offence to the  President,  but from the point of view of whether our liberties and rights should or should not be curtailed. I have heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> say that he asked his questions in good faith. One of our standing orders provides that we must accept the denial of an honorable senator. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> denies that he asked these questions ironically, and we are bound under the Standing Orders to accept that denial. Where serious questions are asked .we should not curtail any privileges which we now possess merely because some of us may. be in a humorous frame of mind. </para>

One of the recognised rules of this and every other House of Parliament is that a member shall remain silent while the  President  is on his feet. I ask Senators de Largie and Needham, who have been pretty nearly equally guilty, to obey that very salutary rule. I repeat that it must be obvious to honorable senators that the elimination of one of the questions which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> desired to put had nothing at all to do with the fact that it related to the Commonwealth Police Force. That is clear, because each of the five questions which have been allowed, and which appear on the business-paper to-day, refer to the Commonwealth Police Force. </para>

                                <para>- I shall come to that. With regard to the charge that I have assumed authority, and infringed the rights of honorable senators in doing so, I point out that that cannot be contended. I have not assumed any authority, but have fulfilled an obligation imposed upon me by the Senate itself in passing the Standing Orders. I should be derelict in my duty if I failed to carry out the desire of the Senate as expressed in the Standing Orders. With regard to any infringement of the privileges of honorable senators, let me say that the more the Standing Orders and the procedure adopted in Parliament are studied the more clearly will it be seen that that procedure and theStanding Orders are devised for the protection of honorable senators. It is for the protection of the privileges of honorable senators that provision should be made to prevent the privilege of asking questions from being abused. It is the obvious purpose of the standing order dealing with the matter to confine questions to their proper purpose in order that the time of the Senate may not be wasted in the asking of questions which do not seek information, but which, on the contrary, make statements of fact and assertions, and include arguments or opinions. There is a proper time for the making of statements of fact and assertions, and for the expression of opinions and the offering of arguments. If honorable senators were permitted to do these things in the form of questions, the Senate would have no time to deal with anything else but questions. </para>

                            <para>The purpose of a question is to obtain information, and not to supply it to the House. A question may not contain statements of facts, unless they be necessary to make the question intelligible, and can be authenticated; nor should a question contain arguments, inferences, imputations, epithets, nor ironical expressions. Nor may a question refer to debates or answers to questions in the current session. </para>

I want to explain to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> that it was not my fault that I did not acquaint him with the decision to disallow his question. The matter was not brought under my notice until late on Thursday evening, and I did not have an opportunity subsequently of seeing the honorable senator, as he left for Sydney the same evening. I looked into the club room twice to-day, but he was not there, or I should have acquainted him with the action I had taken, and my reason for taking it. </para>

I wish to assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> that I anxiously considered for some time how I could alter his question in such a way as to retain its sense, whilst making it comply with our Standing Orders. But I found it impossible to do so, and consequently I omitted it from the . business-paper. Personally, I have no feeling in this matter whatever. If honorable senators think that my ruling is wrong, they will not hurt my feelings by declaring that it is. I have merely acted strictly in accordance with our parliamentary practice, and I am content to. leave the matter entirely in their hands. </para>

In an exchange across the floor of the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> contradicted the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> in regard to a question which he had put before. But when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> previously submitted his question, he stated that it was sovereigns which were found in the official drawers of the Pay Office at the Victoria Barracks, Sydney, by the Commission which inquired into the business side of the Defence Department. As a matter of fact, the word " sovereigns " appears in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of his question. Yet to-day the honorable senator affirmed that it was money in the form of cheques which were found in the drawers of the Pay Office at the Victoria Barracks, Sydney. </para>

Immediately you, sir, were asked by the honorable senator why his questions did not appear upon the business-paper, you replied tha't they had been disallowed because they were not in accordance with our Standing Orders. Had you followed the course that has been pursued on former" occasions by intimating to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> that his question had not been framed in a way that complied with our Standing Orders, and suggested to him the advisableness  of asking it in a different form, the whole difficulty would have been obviated.

                                <para>- Undoubtedly. It has been a common practice either to omit the question entirely from the notice-paper or to ask the  Clerk  to alter it in such a way as 'to make it comply with our Standing Orders. I submit, sir, that you,  as the arbiter of justice in this chamber,  ought to adopt the broadest possible interpretation that can be put upon the Standing Orders, especially in regard to any question relating to a matter of admitted public importance. The words "much-needed Federal work " do contain .an assertion, for it might be arguable whether the work upon which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> says the Federal police might be employed is much needed or not. Many hundreds of thousands of people would probably back the honorable senator up in his opinion, but the Prime Minister, Senators Millen and Pearce, and other members of the Government might all regard the work as not " much needed." </para>

                                <para>- I said at the beginning that that part of the question was so controversial that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> were within your rights if you wished to abide by the strict technical interpretation of standing order 99 down to the point I have read, but I submit that you, sir, have not taken the right course in not assisting the honorable senator, or any other honorable senator, who wishes to ask a question, so far as you possibly could, to submit it in such a way as to bring it within the standing order. With all due deference I think you made a mistake in eliminating the question altogether, so that no reference was made to it at all until <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> asked you about it, and in not asking the  Clerk  to so alter it as to bring it into conformity with the standing order, while still retaining its sense, so that it might elicit the information which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> sought for, and which, I believe, a large number of people would like to get. You said that you tried very hard to .do it, but that it was impossible. That is not at all my estimate of your ability. I cannot believe that the question could not have been put differently under instructions from you, so as to allow it to come within the standing order, and still effect <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall's</inline> purpose. I feel, under the circumstances, that I am quite entitled to put the view that it would have been far better if you had taken a different course. </para>

                            <para>.  - I should not have intruded into this debate but for the. fact that, so far as my memory goes, the exercise of this power by the  President  has never previously been called in question since the Senate was established. Nobody in the Senate would more jealously guard the interests of honorable senators and of the Senate itself in the fullest and freest approach to, and discussion of, any matter within its competence, than I would. No one would oppose more strongly or vehemently any encroachment upon those rights by the  President  or any  other officer, but I fail to detect in this case any such encroachment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> himself does not question your competence to act as you have done, nor does he question the right of your action, but he has ventured to suggest that had you followed another course, the blow, if it may be so called, to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> might have been considerably softened. In those circumstances, I .hardly think that he can support a motion to disagree with your ruling. The whole issue turns upon whether the question itself was, or was not, in compliance with the standing order, which says, " In putting any such question, no argument or opinion shall be offered, nor inference nor imputation made, nor any facts stated except so far as may be necessary to explain such question." There is no doubt that in this question an opinion is offered. The words " much needed " before " Federal work " offer an opinion to the Senate and to the Minister who is called upon to answer the question. An honorable senator is entitled to ask a Minister a question for the purpose of eliciting information, but not for the purpose of offering the Minister an opinion. The use of the words, "much needed" puts this question outside the requirements of the standing order. It has been so ruled on more than one occasion, and, so far as I remember, the Senate has never challenged the right or authority of the  President  in such cases. I have in my mind a case which occurred, at the opening of the sitting on the 31st October, 1913.. Although I was not present at the time, I remember reading of it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> was acting as Honorary Minister in the then Government, and immediately after the commencement of business <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> asked without notice,  ' Has the attention of the Acting Leader of the Senate been called to the scandalous and disgraceful conduct which took place in the city of Melbourne- <inline font-style="italic">V</inline> The then </para>

                            <para>The honorable senator is entitled to ask a question, but he must not make any comment or express' any opinion in doing so, nor must he apply any adjectives  to alleged facts. He must confine himself to asking for information. </para>

                        <para class="block">That set out the practice of the Senate, as I understand it since the commencement. An honorable senator must not use any adjective as qualifying alleged facts. What are the alleged facts here? That there is Federal work for the -Federal police to do. As a matter of fact I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> that there is Federal work for it to do if it is to be maintained, but when he singles out some particular work which he designates as " much - needed Federal work," he is applying to alleged facts an adjective contrary to that ruling, and offering an opinion of the Minister, whom he should be addressing only for the purpose of eliciting information. In all the circumstances it cannot be contended that this question does not deviate from the standing order in that regard. </para>
                        <para>The second part of the standing order says, "and the  President  may direct the  Clerk  to alter any question so as to conform with this order." It will be observed that no obligation is thrown upon the  President  to do it, but an obligation is thrown upon the senator when he hands in his question to see that it conforms with the standing order. If he does not he must take the consequences. He may rely upon the indulgence of the  President,  who has no obligation cast upon him, but who is given authority to have the question put in proper form. But he is not entitled in all the circumstances to claim or expect it. So far as I understand your statement, sir, you sought to have the question put in order, and were unable to communicate with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall.</inline> It is not for myself or' any other honorable senator to judge how far you sought to extend your assistance to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall,</inline> but the fact remains that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> himself in tendering the question did not discharge the obligation of seeing that it conformed with the standing order. So far as your action is concerned I can quite understand that, having seen that, the question did not so conform, you endeavoured to do what has been done by Presidents on so many previous occasions, to have it put into conformity with the standing order. Circumstances, however, were against you. You saw the question at the end of last week and did not see <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> in time to communicate with him before the sitting to-day. In the circumstances I can see nothing for it but to oppose the motion. </para>

Almost any question must contain a statement of fact. For instance, I might put on the notice-paper a question running, " Is the Minister for Defence  aware that John Smith, who is employed in the Defence Department in Brisbane, is an unnaturalized alien?" The words  ' who is employed in the Defence Department in Brisbane " constitute a statement of fact. </para>

                                <para>- As regards <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating's</inline> reference to the matter, if the inclusion of an adjective before a noun is out of place, according to a ruling given by  President  Baker in 1903, that is surely not a warrant for striking out the whole sentence. Surely the adjective, if it conflicts with the precedent established then, although not with the standing order, could be excised by the  Clerk,  at your direction. On this question of statement of fact, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie rather blunderingly drew attention to a question standing in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall's</inline> name on the notice-paper today. What occurred was this : The basic principle of the question is farcical in itself, for any mention of the Commonwealth. Police Force and its creation is almost inseparable from frivolity or flippancy. One cannot hear it referred to in the street in any tone of seriousness. Everybody regards it as a Huge farce, and probably, when you noticed a question dealing with the Commonwealth Police Force, you naturally scanned it closely, looking for what you would . conceive to be frivolity. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating's</inline> contention is correct, that the words " much needed " are the obstacle, your action went far beyond what was necessary. Seeing what has occurred in recent times, Parliament House itself being raided, although the civil Court has now declared that there was no ground for that raiding, and seeing that the military raid in question has been indorsed by another branch of the Legislature, we should be very jealous of any attempt by anybody in authority to whittle away our privileges. The protest lodged here this afternoon will not be without its effect. May I suggest that, if on ' any future occasion there should be an obtrusive adjective in the way, that should not be regarded as a warrant or reason for striking out a whole question. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall's</inline> question dealt with a subject which, if it could be removed by any action of the Government, by criticism or ridicule heaped upon it in debate, by question or in any other way, would be fully justified. I hope that in future a little broader view will he taken of our Standing Orders; but if it is decided to keep to the letter of the Standing Orders, even to the dotting of the "i's," this should be done in every case, so as to avoid any glaring inconsistencies appearing on the business-paper as, by chance,' appears in a notice under the name of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall,</inline> to which . <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has already drawn attention. </para>

I think your ruling, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> is correct, and I do not believe it has anything to do with an attempt to prevent the asking of a question that might in any way harass the Government. When I had been a member of the Senate for only three or four weeks, I asked a question without notice, but had only proceeded to frame it when you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> intervened by saying- </para>

                                Thomas, I know that the Standing Orders do not permit an honorable senator, in asking  a  question, to put forward arguable matter; therefore I ask, sir, that before this question is allowed to appear on the notice-paper, you will censor it, so that there shall be nothing going forward which may not be replied to by somebody else.

I certainly would hesitate to vote against a ruling given by a presiding officer, but I say quite frankly that in this matter I do not regard the position of the  President  so much as the position of the Senate itself, its honour, its functions, and its privileges. </para>

Our Standing Orders may be bad, and I think that in another place I expressed the opinion, on one occasion, that the Standing Orders of the Senate should be like the Standing  Orders of  the House of Lords, where, I understand, there are none, and consequently everybody would have a free hand about anything. But that is not so. We have framed Standing Orders, and as long as they are in force, I take it for granted that it is the duty of the  President  to see that they are carried out. </para>

In this case I think the  President  is right. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> gave an instance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> having been ruled out of order some years ago, and my own question, to which I have just referred, was of more recent date, and was on similar lines to the question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall.</inline></para>

                            <para>. - I am perfectly satisfied, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that you did not attempt to strain the interpretation of our Standing Orders; but 'I thought that, as on previous occasions, an opportunity would have been given to me to amend my question. The very lucid interpretation of the standing order by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> shows that the question could have been amended to comply with the standing order. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> himself has differed from you on this subject ; and when, on such matters as the interpretation of our laws, legal minds differ, those who are directing the law work of the Commonwealth seem to be very much lacking in their knowledge, because every case recently tested has been lost. If my question offended against Standing Orders, all I can say is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle's</inline> question to-day also offended. I always understood, however, that a certain amount of leniency was shown in these matters, and that it was not customary to adhere strictly to the interpretation of , our Standing Orders. I nope now this .will be done in all cases in future. I am satisfied that you had no intention of trying to shield the Government, because I do not know that there was anything to shield them from. I believe now that you merely struck my question out because, in your opinion, it offended against the Standing Orders. </para>

I asked the Minister then if Australia would be represented at the forthcoming Imperial Conference, and, if so, would he give the name of the delegate or delegates, and would this Parliament have an  opportunity  of discussing the questions to be submitted at the Imperial Conference, prior, to the departure of the delegates. </para>

                <para class="block">That is with regard to the calling of witnesses. To make myself clear, I desire to say that during the conduct of the recent referendum public speakers, particularly those of the party to which I belong, found themselves harassed to a degree quite incompatible with any idea of fair play by the fact that any public  speaker  could on the most flimsy pretext be thrown out of the referendum campaign, dragged before a magistrate, and, according to that regulation, on the averment of the prosecutor, be put in the position of having to prove himself innocent. I want honorable senators to dissociate themselves from the fact that we are two parties, fighting each other politically. We are public men whose reputations may be taken to stand high in the eyes of the public, or we would not have been sent into this Chamber to represent them. We suddenly find ourselves, as did <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall,</inline> haled from our country tour to Sydney. ' <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> had to meet a charge which he was able to defend in such a way that the magistrate dismissed it with costs against the Commonwealth. As far as our public contests are concerned, they will be better conducted without regulations of this character, which not only make an offence of an individual saying that which he believes to be true, but can cause him to be put in the position of having to prove the truth of his statement. All these motions deal with the same pernicious regulation. That is the one which has made the greatest inroad yet known upon the rights of public speakers. There has been for centuries in Great Britain a marked respect for the rights of the general public at public meetings;" and, providing that a  speaker  is not trespassing on the rights of any one else, the Courts of England, time out of number, have given very serious regard to the rights of public speakers, and to their rights in public meetings. But here we had a referendum on possibly the most important question the public will ever be asked , to decide. Suddenly regulations are issued, so promptly and viciously that the bearings of the machine turning them out were reported to have got hot. In issuing them - and this part in particular - there was a most serious infringement of the liberties of the persons charged. Take the case of Premier Ryan. - The recent elections in Queensland show that no man stands higher than he. He has conducted the affairs of that State for some years, and is a big, broadminded, loyal Australian. He was told by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> that if he dared to say outside of Parliament what he had said within it he would be dragged before a magistrate. He did so, and he </para>
                <para>Was dragged before a magistrate. Here comes the pernicious part of this section of the regulations. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan</inline> required for his proper defence the attendance of such witnesses' as the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> that gentleman at once "scooted" out of Adelaide for Western Australia. </para>

                            <para>- That tyrannical attack upon a high-minded and public man was one of the riskiest things that has yet been done in this country. I happened to be sitting in the Court while the case was being tried, and here is the picture. A public man, beyond suspicion and beyond reproach, was being cross-examined hour after hour by an opposition lawyer. He was simply put upon his defence. And when he had finished defending himself there was the one result that always follows the decisions of the Crown Prosecutor of this Government - the Government was defeated. There was, however, the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> could keep out of the way for 48 hours, and then there was this amendment, which compelled the magistrate to grant only one adjournment; and it caused this position to be brought about, namely, that the case could last not more than another 24 hours. If we are going to say that men may be dragged before the magistrates of this country, why should we make it impossible for those men, within the period prescribed by the regulation, to secure witnesses to prove their innocence? This regulation practically , says to reputable public men, " Provided that we make a charge against you, upon your shoulders will rest the responsibility of proving your innocence, and if important witnesses choose to hide themselves for forty-eight hours, the case must be concluded." I ask the Senate to express its disapproval of the regulation by disallowing it. If honorable senators opposite uphold it, they will have to share the responsibility which now rests upon the Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> advised those persons who thought that they were entitled to vote at the recent referendum, to go before the Returning Officers, and demand their votes. For so doing, the charge was laid against him that, contrary to the law, he had urged German residents in our midst to vote. Upon that occasion the authorities called a German reporter as a witness against him. The honorable senator proved that he had advised all persons who thought that their names* were upon the Toll to go before the Returning Officers, and demand their votes. What was wrong with that ? Surely that is not an offence in this country? </para>

                            <para>- The proof that the honorable senator had the'se instructions is to be found in' the fact that the magistrate dismissed the case, with costs against the Commonwealth. Then there is the case of ex-Senator Rae. He used figures published by the Commonwealth Statistician, which showed that there were 152,800 single men in this country. He took those figures, and deducted from them the number of single men who had enlisted, and the number who were necessary to keep the primary industries of Australia going, and. thus arrived at the conclusion that there were not more than 60,000 single men in this country available for military service overseas. For so doing he was haled before a magistrate. Yet all he had done was to put, in his own logical way, an argument which any man was entitled to use. Then the Premier of Queensland, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan,</inline> made a statement that somewhere in Britain there were between 80,000 and 100,000 reinforcements.  His  statement was based upon the figures of the Defence Department. Yet he was prosecuted for making it. When the case came on for .hearing the magistrate refused to find that any false statement had been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan,</inline> v and awarded 12 guineas costs against the Commonwealth. It is all very well to say that the Government are entitled to issue regulations of this character. But there is a grave danger in permitting the issue of regulations which interfere with individual liberty. As one who was personally responsible for the introduction of the War Precautions Act, I have no hesitation in saying that I believed that legislation was intended to be used purely for defence purposes and in cases of emergency. But when regulations under that Act are used to deprive people of their individual liberty, I say that its  primary purpose is being flagrantly abused. How could the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan</inline> either help the enemy or injure the Allies ? How could <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall's</inline> statement or ex-Senator Rae's statement have that effect? Consequently, I ask honorable senators to vote against this regulation, and to refuse to uphold the Government in doing something with which in their hearts they do not agree. I know the gentleman who runs the present Ministry. I know that lie is out to win on the merest detail as well as on the greatest principle. But regulations of this kind put reputable public men in an entirely false position. We all know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline> Mathews, a member of the other branch of the Legislature, was prosecuted in Victoria, as was also <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Catts</inline> in New South Wales. </para>

                            <para>- What about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan,</inline> of Queensland, who was deliberately brought before a Police Court because he had crossed the Prime Minister's path in Brisbane, and because he had maintained the rights of his State against an attempted encroachment by the Commonwealth ? Similarly, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Catts</inline> has been malignantly pursued merely because he has been a source of trouble in another place, where he has insisted upon asking questions that the Government did not wish to have asked, and on making speeches of which they did not approve. In his particular case the magistrate said that by no stretch of imagination could <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Catts'</inline> speeches be held to have the effect which was alleged against them. If during a political campaign the governing power can stifle the voice of its opponents, a most serious -position must arise. I am very glad to know that in every prosecution instituted thus far the Government have failed. Surely we are not going to permit a regulation to be enforced which threatens the liberties of the individual, and which provides that the prosecution must finish within a prescribed time, even if within that period it is impossible to secure the attendance of most important witnesses. If the prosecution of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan</inline> were sufficiently serious to warrant proceedings being instituted against him, it was sufficiently serious for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to attend as a witness. Had he given evidence he must have testified that the figures used by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan</inline> had been obtained from the Defence Department. Of course, I am aware that Major-General Legge gave evidence an that occasion as a witness from the Defence Department, but, strange to say, his figures were quite contrary to those supplied by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline></para>

                            <para>- He said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> should have been prosecuted for misleading the electors. Then I would remind honorable senators that when an appeal was made to the Government to put upon their trial persons on the other side who had made wild statements, they refused to listen to it. The Prime Minister was asked to prosecute certain men who had misstated the position, but he declined to do so. I was all through the referendum campaign, and so indignant was I at this regulation that on every platform from which I spoke 1 took the risk of being arrested. The liberty that is enjoyed in other parts of the Empire is such that a man can conduct a parliamentary election campaign as a Sinn Feiner, be returned, and take his seat in the House of Commons. Yet, in Australia, if he dares to call himself a Sinn Feiner he may be arrested. Evidently the strain of conducting the business of this country during the recent troublous times has got upon the nerves of Ministers. As a result, instead of being able to see things in their proper perspective, they approve of a regulation which absolutely imperils the liberties of men who desire to express their opinions upon a public platform. The Government seek to make the laws of the Commonwealth reflect merely the will of the Prime Minister. I understand that it has been found more profitable to give the Crown Solicitor his expenses and a trip to England than to continue to conduct prosecutions in which costs have to be paid by the Commonwealth. That is the position. I appeal to honorable senators to recognise that a halt must be called somewhere. If we are going to allow any Government by means of a regulation of this character to shorten the time allowed for an adjournment of -the proceedings in any prosecution initiated by the Government, and to limit the period within which the accused is able to prove his innocence, I shall be sorry for the future of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>. - I would like to supplement what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator gardiner</inline> has said in regard to the seriousness of the position which was created in Brisbane when the prosecution against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan</inline> was pending. Upon my return to that city I had it impressed upon me by friends that a very high state of tension existed amongst the populace at that particular time. Some persons said, ' ' We had a . pretty stormy time during the continuance of the general strike in 1912. There were angry crowds in the streets on that occasion. The atmosphere was electrical, and anything might have happened, but the tension which then existed was not a circumstance to that experienced during the days when the prosecution of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan</inline> was pending." I say that on such occasions it is a positive danger to the Commonwealth to have regulations of this nature enforced on the impulse of the moment, as they have been during the past eighteen months or two years. The spectacle of a public man being summarily  called upon to answer any imaginary charge which may be launched against him on any edict may create a very troubled atmosphere. I happened to be travelling to Brisbane when <inline font-weight="bold">Major -</inline> General Legge was on his way to that city to lead off the prosecution, and I had it impressed on me then what a domi-nance  the military rule was getting over "the population of Australia even without conscription. Major-General Legge went so far as to ask a returned soldier with whom I was travelling, and myself, to go a bit further along the train, where we could get another smoking carriage. ' I told him I thought that smoking carriage was good enough for us. Apparently, he was taking up that domineering attitude because he knew he had behind him a Government that would support him, right or wrong, but I gave him to understand that although these regulations were in vogue, I knew* just about as much of the conditions operating in Queensland as he did, and was not going to accept direction at his hands. That gentleman and others of his ilk have been buttressed up with the knowledge that drastic regulations of this nature are in force, and liable to be put into operation at any moment. We hear a lot about Prussian militarism, but ever since the agitation for conscription and military dominance in Australia began, I have always taken up the attitude that militarism, whether Prussian or Australian, was the same all over the world. If that is the extent to which they can go here without conscription, what might we expect under actual military rule? </para>

                            <para>- I did not take the trouble to tell him, but I asked him in pretty plain language, "Who the hell, are you?" for I thought it was time to take exception to his attitude. We realize the extent of the menace to the well-being of the Commonwealth created by these regulations and dozens of others of the same nature. They are not put into operation by the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> although nominally they are supposed to be. They are given direction and issue by the military authorities, who, we know, often have to act without the cognisance of the Minister for Defence. The Defence Department is a big concern, . and the Minister cannot be. or does not want to be, or will not be, consulted on every emergency that arises, with the result that these men take it upon themselves to govern the Commonwealth. That is why the Government have shown such anxiety to get into recess as soon as they can. That is why, out of the last thirty-one months, Parliament has been in recess for twenty-four months, and in session . only seven months. In the interval the Commonwealth in a time of war has been governed by regulation only. Some departmental officers who know these regulations are in vogue, sometimes make the paths of those who are representing different parts of the Commonwealth as difficult as possible in the interests of the Government. They realize that the freedom of .the Commonwealth has been grossly invaded, and that while such a state of affairs obtains nothing can be too domineering for them to carry into effect. Can the Minister for Defence offer any justification or reason for the hauling off, at a moment's notice, of public men and others for making statements which the Government in their wisdom or haste construe into being against the order and good government of the Commonwealth? If these regulations are a sample of the Win-the-war policy, will the Minister tell us what effect they have had on the war? Have they been another bomb thrown into the ranks of the Kaiser's soldiers? Has it disturbed the German legions to know that public men in Australia are prosecuted and followed all over the different States? I sincerely trust that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> will push his motion to a division, and let all those people who support the Government take the onus of their action. Not <inline font-style="italic">one</inline> of them, although the Minister will probably attempt it, can justify the imposition, or keeping in force, of drastic regulations of this nature; and if they cannot do that, they have no right to vote for their continuance. </para>

So far as I am able to see, they deal entirely with the question of the referendum. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> very cleverly wove into them some other regulations which he is not moving to repeal. I do not know whether he did that for the purpose of making honorable senators believe that they would be repealing them. For instance, he referred to the regulation by which the averment of the prosecutor is taken to be a fact in the absence of proof to the contrary. Even if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline> motion were carried, it would not repeal that regulation. I do not know whether he is aware of that fact. </para>

                        practically accused the Government of the partial application of these regulations in their administration, and quoted as proof the fact that more persons were prosecuted who happened to be speaking in opposition to the Government's referendum proposals than those who were speaking in support. Anybody who looks back over that contest will see a very good reason for that. It was the people who were opposing the referendum that were making the false statements.

                            <para>- Yes, I am informed that it was. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> does not really wish to repeal these regulations, for ' he does not object to persons being fined who tear down posters issued by the Government Printer, nor does he want to protect the man who goes to a public meeting, and tries to break it up by creating a disturbance. Yet he is moving to repeal a regulation which would punish that gentleman. He is really only moving the motion in order to get an opportunity to resurrect a lot of things that he and those associated with him have been saying from time to time in respect of the last referendum. I do not wish to resurrect all the bad feeling of that time. It would be wise to drop it and forget it. But the honorable senator has made statements here, to which, if I did not reply, he would go out, and say that there was, and could be, no reply. He has dragged up a number of cases in which prosecutions were instituted, some of which failed and some of which succeeded, and says that in all those cases the Government prosecuted solely and wholly because those concerned happened to be members of the Opposition party, and that the Government had no good case. He hopes thereby to raise a debate on the merits or demerits of those cases. He wants all this dirty linen to be again dragged out and washed before the public. Does he think that this is a time to do that? </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator desires to repeal a lot of regulations which have nothing to do with the cases he speaks of. Therefore, it appears that the honorable senator is not aiming so much at the regulation as endeavouring to put into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and send out to the public, his views on the number of prosecutions that has been instituted. I am going to refer to one of those prosecutions. The honorable senator's remarks make it necessary that I should do so, because he referred to one of the most recent prosecutions, namely, that against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Catts,</inline> a member in another place. </para>

                        knows, I am sure, that the German Government does not always put German propaganda forward through German representatives, or by means of German pens. That propaganda is circulated and distributed by many people, who often do it quite innocently.

In all earnestness I say - Would to God that the day had arrived when the whole of the War Precautions Act, the censorship, and everything connected with it could be  swept  away for ever, as I  recognise  that the War Precautions Act and its regulations regarding censorship are repugnant to democratic ideals. </para>

Is a Democracy to be set up in some enemy country that will create dissension among the people, and overthrow an Autocracy, then' German money will be available to insure its success. No matter what form of government or misgovernment is proposed, so long as it will serve Germany's turn, German money and German influence will be there to help it on. In a Democracy such as Australia we have to do such things as are authorized by the War Precautions Act to protect our Democracy and in order to save our life. We have to do things that are repugnant and absolutely opposed to democratic ideals and democratic government in the true sense of the word. In normal times, or even if we had to fight an enemy under a democratic form of government like our own, we could not defend for one moment regulations such as are now in force; but in the present circumstances we would be fools and worse than fools if we shut our eyes to the kind of enemy we are fighting, and refused to recognise that many of our own citizens quite innocently and without any knowledge- are helping Germany by pursuing certain lines of conduct which they believe to be in the interests of their own country, but which unfortunately are being used by German agents to divide and disrupt the country and its Allies. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- The Government have not only to fight Germany with Australian soldiers, but have also, by means of these regulations, to fight Germany within Australia. If we allowed enemy influence free course in Australia, what would happen to us as part of the British Empire? If statements such as have been made were allowed publication throughout the length and breadth of this country, can we assume for a moment that our Ally to whom the statements referred would not make representations and protest? Let us put ourselves in the place of that Ally. What would be our attitude if statements offensive to Australia, throwing doubt on our loyalty to the Allied cause and our determination to help to win this war, were allowed circulation in Allied countries? Would we not in such circumstances feel that any Allied country which allowed such statements to be circulated was not friendly towards us? </para>

                        also referred to incidents connected with the referendum. I am not going into the details of the Ryan and other cases, but I point out that members of the Senate generally know that the issue then was of. the gravest importance to this country. Because of the torrent of misrepresentation and lies which prevented the carrying of the previous referendum the Government desired only that the truth should be placed before the people on the second occasion.

                            <para>- The regulations were framed and were administered with a view only to securing the circulation of the truth. I am not going to say now that every prosecution authorized was justified, because where prosecutions failed it was evidently the opinion of the presiding magistrate that they were not justified. But because a mistake was made in administration, is that a reason why we should repeal the regulations if the regulations themselves are right and just? I say "No," and I put it to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> that this is not the time to take action. So far as the effective regulations of the War Precautions Act are concerned, there is a real necessity for their retention to safeguard the interests of Australia. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> therefore, not to press his amendment, because the regulations do not affect the greater part of what he has been saying, and probably at a later stage the Government will review the whole of the War Service Regulations. At present they are passive, and no action in regard to them is being taken by the Government. </para>

                            <para>- Among the vast number of people who were brought before the Courts, and treated as criminals, did the Government wait for applications to be made by private citizens ? No. They took the step themselves, but they were very slow to proceed in the cases of those whom they knew to be making untrue and unfair statements on the other side. One of the latest instructions issued to the censors is remarkable in a country which believes it is living under a fair and democratic system of government. There have been certain regulations issued only recently, and in connexion with them a notice has been sent to the newspapers that publication will be prohibited of any discussion upon the new. regulations, and that only editorials shall be permitted to be published. Does the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce; uphold that? There has been an instruction issued which refers to a regulation not embraced in those before the Senate, and which I may not, 'therefore, discuss, but which, as a matter of fact, deals with what is known as Sinn Fein. The mouth of every person who may think that that regulation is wrong is closed. One dare not discuss the subject outside of Parliament. I have myself seen- a copy of an instruction to that effect. We have come to a</inline> pretty pass if that is to be permitted and condoned by Parliament. Members of both branches of the Legislature have reached such  a  stage in the conduct of the party machine, and have become so bitter in their partisanship, that they are prepared to lie down and let the Prime Minister and his colleagues walk over them. We have just seen an example of that in another place. All the privileges embraced by our freedom are to be taken away from the people of Australia, and yet .members on the other side are condoning it. . </para>

                    <para>This is a motion of a nature that we have already discussed at some length this afternoon. Upon a previous occasion I endeavoured to move for the disallowance of the regulation in question, but that object was missed in the closing hours of last session. It will be admitted that the establishment of Commonwealth police in Queensland was founded on a blunder. A mistake was made in the initial issue of the regulation authorizing the appointment. It was regulation 64d, signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> as Attorney-General, which had to be deleted by the regulation now before honorable senators; that is Statutory Rule 325, which was signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt,</inline> for the Minister for Defence. Under the first regulation, 64d, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> set out to establish a Commonwealth Police Force in Queensland, which was obviously contrary to the Australian Constitution, making as it did a differentiation between the respective States. When he saw that he had blundered - following on his many blunders - he overcame the difficulty by issuing a further regulation. The establishment of this Commonwealth force was totally unnecessary. I do not think any honorable senator will justify its being brought into existence, much less  the continuance of its inaction. I have endeavoured, in various parts of Queensland where units of the force are situated, to ascertain their duties. At one time I thought that these might have been semi-military in character, but I have not been able to ascertain anything in that regard. The situation which gave <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> the excuse to do what he did arose in an endeavour to cover up his tracks. He saw that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.. Ryan</inline> would badly beat him in the action which he had instituted with respect to raiding the Government Printing Office in Brisbane. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> is endowed with a lot of low cunning or scheming, which for many years he has been able to palm off and masquerade under as ability, but as to which, when it comes to a question of judgment, he is very generally found wanting. He showed evidence of that sort of thing repeatedly in the conscription referenda. And in the latter campaign, when he met a man of superior ability in open conflict, he went off to Warwick with the direct intention of creating some notoriety by the aid of which to cover his tracks. </para>

                            <para>- I have had eggs thrown at me, and I dare say the honorable senator has undergone a similar experience. I do not know that he arranged to run mad, but he undoubtedly and actually did that upon the platform at the Warwick station; and immense expense has been incurred as the result of the Prime Minister's action, after he had been hit with an egg at Warwick. It is wholly unjustifiable. The existence of this body cannot be defended, and I am surprised at the members of the Government not bringing some pressure to bear on the Prime Minister to remove this governmental eyesore which has been established in Queensland. If honorable members on this side of the chamber should hear of any justification for the action taken, it would come as news to them. In these times, when we hear so much about economy, it strikes one as strange that a totally unnecessary duplication of duties should have been established in any one. of the States, just because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> had been hit by an egg. It was suggested, by the way, in some quarters, that it had been proposed by the Defence Department to issue a regulation making it an offence for anybody to keep or be in the possession of or feed fowls within 5 miles of the Warwick post-office. Fortunately, it has not gone to that extent; but we who have had an opportunity of studying this frantic little man, realize that there are no steps which he may not traverse under one of his mental aberrations. I have held the view for a long time that since the conscription question arose in Australia, and on the question of Imperialism generally, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> has been - to put it mildly - not rational. I hope the Government will take the earliest opportunity to remove this eyesore. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> narrowly missed being shot last night with a door key, at the meeting of the " Black Hand Society." If the throwing of an egg at Warwick justified the establishment of a Commonwealth Police Force in Queensland, surely <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton's</inline> experience last night should justify the establishment of a similar body in Victoria. I am surprised that members of the Government generally have tolerated the position so long. I was one of those who had been prepared to make every allowance for the extreme excitement of the Prime Minister at that time, and. I quite realize that perhaps he was not all there in the matter of mental settlement. Will any honorable senator on the other side attempt to justify . the establishment of this force ? Will any of my colleagues from Queensland do that, if they support the continuance of this regulation? On equitable and argumentative grounds I venture to say that it cannot be done. I hope that the Minister will be able to give us some information as to what the members of this body are doing for the money which the taxpayers are paying them. Men from the Southern States do not go up to Queensland, even to put in time, for nothing, because putting in time is very hard work. I have no doubt that it is an extremely difficult task for the members of the Commonwealth police to put in time. Presumably they are being paid for doing nothing, and they are being paid a good wage. This may be a matter of hilarity to some honorable senators opposite, but I want to ask them how this Win-the-war Government has effected any economy by the establishment of the Commonwealth Police Force. </para>

                            <para>-We read in the newspapers at the time of the Warwick incident that when the Prime Minister emerged from the crowd blood was flowing from one of his hands. We now know that what was seen was not blood, but merely the colour of the egg which struck him. Yet because one egg was thrown at the right honorable gentleman, the Commonwealth Police Force was established in Queensland. I wish to know whether it is the intention of the Government to continue the existence of that body, and, if so, upon what grounds it can justify its action. It is only fair that the public should be enlightened on this matter. If it be a good thing for Queensland to have a body of Commonwealth police there, it must be an equally good thing for the other States to be similarly circumstanced. For the sake of consistence, therefore, the system should be extended to the other States, or the Commonwealth Police Force should be abolished. </para>

                            <para>-I do not think that the citizens of Queensland will be jealous if the Commonwealth Police Force there is abolished. Practically the whole of the people of that State, when the time for the departure of the Commonwealth police arrives, will be prepared to wish them a happy farewell. They have not taken a very active part in the affairs of the different towns. Very frequently they are not even 'known there. But it does seem an overwhelming farce that the expense of maintaining this body should be continued when we hear so much about economy. That is the ground of my protest. I trust that honorable senators will vote against this regulation. If they do not, it will be incumbent upon them to justify their attitude towards it. </para>

                    <para>I wish specially to direct the attention of honorable senators to the words "until the Parliament otherwise provides." Parliament has not otherwise provided. It has not provided that those citizens of Australia who are abroad upon active service shall practically be placed in the category of non-citizens of the State in which they enlisted. The refusal of the Commonwealth to pay to the States 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> in respect of those citizens is a direct contravention of the Act. The true test of citizenship in any country is the franchise. Now, our soldier citizens, thank God, have not been disfranchised.

                            <para>- That objection would apply with equal force to those citizens within a State who did not vote. It is passing strange that while our citizen soldiers have not been deprived of their citizen rights, the States in which they enlisted have been deprived of the benefit of section 4 of the Surplus Revenue Act. When I inquired into this matter a little while ago, I was informed that the view of the Crown Law authorities was that, because these soldier citizens were not resident in their respective States on the 31st December, the Treasurer was quite justified in refusing to pay to those States 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> in respect of them. I am not here to pit my humble opinion against that of the Solicitor-General, a man experienced in constitutional law, but I do not think the Surplus Revenue Act of 1910 gave the Commonwealth Treasurer or anybody else the right to take away this amount from the States in any circumstances. That Act says, "until the Parliament otherwise provides." </para>

                    <para>I admit that section 7 provides that the people for whom the 25s. per head is to be paid must be resident within the State, but I contend that, to all intents and purposes, our citizen soldiers are resident within their respective . States. They have gone forward to do battle for the nation. The State from which they go is contributing through, its revenue for their maintenance. It might be said that the Commonwealth Government is paying the whole of the cost of their keep, training, equipment,, and transportation, but the Commonwealth Government gets at least portion of 'that money from the Customs revenue, in which the States are equally concerned with the Commonwealth. After all, reducing the' matter down to the finest point, we are all the same people in this regard, and the action of the Commonwealth Treasurer in refusing to continue the payment to the respective States of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> amount on account of the citizen' soldiers is not only a breach of the Surplus Revenue Act, but an unfriendly action, although perhaps unintentional, to the States.. I ask leave to continue my remarks at a future sitting. </para>

                    <para>. - I take this opportunity to say, particularly . to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and to the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen),</inline> that there appears to be some idea in their minds that this side of the Senate is anxious to attack them. I say, as Leader of this party, that if they have any definite proposals to put before this side of the Chamber, which will get over party differences, we are prepared to consider them. If they think they will get over party differences by uttering pious expressions of opinion that this is not the time for showing fight in this chamber, and then by speeches inferring that we are either the dupes of the Germans, or pro-Germans, they are very much mistaken. If Germany is as clever as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> seems to think it is, and if dividing our people is the work of Germany, then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and his Prime Minister deserve well at its hands. There is nothing bitter in what I am saying. </para>
