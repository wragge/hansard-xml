Why, then, has this Government used the cover .of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> to style itself first the Commonwealth War Administration, and then the Australian National War Government? / </para>

                        <para>. - Before proceeding to make a few remarks, which I am sure from their conciliatory character, will lead to a better state of affairs, I would like to place on record the opinion that has been expressed by an authority upon constitutional matters, regarding the action of the Governor-General in connexion with the recent crisis. I know that we are debarred from adversely criticising the action of His Excellency, but certain references to it are permissible, and, indeed, have already been made. When in some future crisis the constitutional action of His Majesty&#39;s representative may be called into question, it might be of interest to have a record of an opinion on the action taken by the Governor-General in. the present instance. </para>

                        <para>The action of the Governor-General has been freely criticised. Many who claim to be constitutional authorities assert that his proper course was to send for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor</inline> as the Leader of the Opposition, directly the Government resigned, and to commission <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor</inline> to form a new Administration if he would take that responsibility. Others declare that the Governor-General had every right to assume that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor</inline> would be defeated immediately he met the House; that it would then be an alternative between a dissolution and&#39; a resurrection of the old Ministry; and that  His Excellency  was justified in re-commissioning <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> to avoid a dissolution, and because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> had been elected as Leader of the National party. It is admitted that  His Excellency  was confronted with a unique position - for which he could find no parallel - and, in the absence of any advice from his responsible advisers, was thrown entirely on to his own judgment. Thus the right to question his judgment must exist. So far as our library shows - </para>

                    <para class="block">That is, our Parliamentary library -  there appears to be no parallel case to guide him, and I suppose we have authorities as full and as late as His Excellency. Todd&#39;s work on &#34;Parliamentary Government in the British Colonies,&#34; covering about 900 pages, deals with many crises and resultant actions taken by the Governor of the time, but there is no case really similar to this.

                    <para>If that is so, and the Governor-General had only to follow the dictates of his own judgment, surely the safer course would have been to stick to the simple principle, which has permeated and shaped responsible government in this country up to the present- the principle that Ministers having made themselves responsible for a policy, and put that policy to the people, shall retire if the people refuse to accept such policy. The declaration of Ministers that they would not continue to govern unless their policy was indorsed made this contest more than a referendum - that declaration made the appeal to electors exactly the same as the appeal in May last - Ministers by their own pronouncement made the issue clear and simple, and it was this - a &#34; Yes &#34; majority and a National Government; or a &#34;No &#34; majority and a Labour Government. The answer was emphatic enough. Just as the people in May last said they wanted the Hughes Government, so they said on 20th December, they wanted a Labour Government. </para>

Nearly every member can see that, as the Prime Minister, according to his own statement, gave no advice to  His Excellency,  the Governor-General was thrown back on his own judgment, and that, consequently, common sense would dictate his course of action. In ordinary circumstances,  His  Majesty&#39;s representative has the advantage of advice from his responsible Ministers, but on the present occasion -no advice was tendered to him. </para>

                            <para>- Because we have, had a statement to that effect from the Prime Minister, and, as the Governor-General had to exercise his own judgment, one would imagine that he would, to some extent at least, be guided by parliamentary practice in Australia, and that, as no crisis exactly similar to this had occurred before, he would be guided by the constitutional authorities I have mentioned. I refer, of course, to Todd and Berriedale Keith. These authorities may be read from cover to cover without any reference being found to an exactly parallel case. An honorable senator might, of course, &#39;find an isolated paragraph indicating that the Governor-General&#39;s action waS wrong, and on another page another paragraph to show that his action was right. There was really nothing to guide the Governor-General, who, in such circumstances, would rely upon his own common sense; and the practice as we know it in Australia is for a Government to resign when a policy to which they pinned their faith has been turned down by the people. </para>

The first is that the action of the Government in determining, without consulting Parliament, to submit this question for a second time to a referendum was absolutely in contravention of the rights of the people. The Government had no right to go behind the back of Parliament. It is a well recognised principle that those who are elected to represent the people are entitled to a voice in determining in Parliament the actions of the Government. </para>

                            <para>- Not at all. There were attached to the referendum proposals conditions which would not have been allowed if, as on the first occasion, a Referendum Bill had been submitted to Parliament. I am satisfied that honorable senators on this side, and many members of another place would never have consented to, at least, three of the conditions attached to the referendum. Their sense of fair play would have induced them to demand a departure from three of the most vital principles attaching to the referendum. The first of these was that while youths of twenty, or under, who had been fighting at the Front, should be allowed to vote, no one under twenty-one who had not been fighting should be permitted to do so, although power was being sought to conscript youths of twenty years of age, and to send them oversea against their will. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. As an after-thought, however, when public feeling had been aroused against the unfairness of this proposal, the Government said that youths of twenty who were conscripted would not be sent out of Australia until they had reached the age of twenty-one years. The fact remains that power was sought to conscript youths of twenty and over, whether they wanted to go out of Australia or not, while at the same time they were not allowed to vote upon the question. If the proposal had been embodied in a Bill, and submitted to Parliament, I am satisfied that an amendment would have been moved to do away with such a manifest unfairness. Parliament was not sitting at the time, although it should have been called together to consider such a vitally important question. Action of this kind should not be taken by the Government while the doors of Parliament are closed. Ministers should not creep- into recess, and take it upon themselves to deal with such highly important questions behind the back of Parliament. All these matters should be dealt with in the full light of day. Had the referendum proposals been submitted to Parliament I do not believe that even a majority of those supporting the Government would have agreed to power being sought to , conscript youths of twenty, while at the same time they were refused the right to vote upon the question. </para>

                            <para>- That is quite irrelevant. The provision to which the honorable senator refers deals with the training of lads of fourteen years of age and upwards. Who would think of comparing boys of fourteen with youths of twenty? My point is that while youths of twenty were considered to be physically fit to be sent out of Australia as conscripts, they were not thought to be strong enough mentally to have a voice in determining whether or not they should be so conscripted. A second feature of the referendum which I believe would not have been permitted by Parliament relates to the closing of the supplementary rolls. Within x a day or two after the date of the referendum had been  announced the supplementary rolls were closed, so that men and women who had moved from one place to another, and whose names had been removed from the rolls for the division in which they formerly resided had no opportunity to secure enrolment. Speaking _ from memory, I do not think such action had ever previously been taken in connexion with any Federal election or referendum. It has always been the practice to allow some time to elapse between the announcement of the date of an election or referendum and the closing of the supplementary rolls, so that those who have to move from one place to another in the ordinary course of their employment may get on the rolls in respect of  their  new places of residence. As the result of the action taken on this occasion there was absolutely no chance for men so situated to secure enrolment. I do not think there was ever an instance of the kind before. </para>

                            <para>-  I have it on the authority of a leading electoral officer that ( it has always been the practice to allow * not less than three weeks to elapse between the announcement of the date of an election and the closing of the supplementary rolls. I cannot help thinking that the almost immediate closing of the supplementary rolls, after the date of the referendum had been announced, was part of a general scheme. There axe tens of thousands of workers whose occupations render it necessary for them to move from one place to another, and it was believed, rightly or wrongly, that the majority of them voted &#34; No &#34; at the first referendum. It is also known that the great industrial upheaval which occurred a few months ago led to a number of people having to shift, and it was believed that a great majority of those who had been affected by that upheaval would vote &#34; No.&#34; </para>

                            <para>-  I freely admit that quite a number of men who cannot be described as manual workers were amongst those who voted &#34;No.&#34; The third point I wish to make is that if the proposal had come before Parliament I do not believe a majority would have been found prepared to support the submission of the question in the form in which  it was put. In effect the electors were asked, &#34; Axe you in favour of the proposals of the Commonwealth Government for the reinforcement of the troops oversea ? &#34; The words &#34; by conscription &#34; should have been, but were not, added to the question. It was intended that the reinforcements should be obtained by conscription; and that being so, why were the Government afraid to . add those words? If the referendum proposal had been submitted to Parliament that question would have- had to run the gauntlet of opposition in both Houses, and I believe that if an amendment had been moved to add the words &#34;by conscription,&#34; the sense of fair play on the part of all honorable members would have led them t&#39;o vote for it. </para>

                    <para>The regulations for the conduct of the referendum made political criminals of thousands, and tens of thousands, of men and women in Australia whose only fault was that, a century or half a century ago, their parents were born in an enemy country. Those parents might have been brought out to Australia as infants,, have been educated here, and thoroughly imbued with Australian sentiments, and have passed these on to their children; and yet all such people were, as I say,, made political criminals, while, if I am not mistaken, a naturalized Chinaman or any, other naturalized person, not of enemy origin, had the right to vote. There would have been some consistency in this proposal if it had not been intended to take the power to send such men of enemy origin to the Front ito fight. If there was the power to use them in the fighting line, they ought to have  been&#39;  allowed to vote ; but evidently the Government were prepared to trust these men to carry rifles, but not to handle ballot-papers - a truly remark-able stand .to take. </para>

                            <para>- The danger of incitement of the public mind arose from the terrible fuss which the Prime Minister made over the incident at Warwick station, in regard to which we have so many conflicting statements. However, what I desire particularly to refer to is the action of the Prime Minister in seizing the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> records of the Queensland Parliament. That in itself was quite enough to start civil war - to ignite a spark in Queensland that would have spread  a  conflagration all over Australia. When the news of that seizure came south, I was addressing a campaign meeting in Tasmania, and I expressed the opinion that the Prime Minister was the most dangerous man at large  in Australia, whose actions were calculated to plunge the country into civil war. It is a wonder that I was not prosecuted for that statement under the War Precautions Regulations. Fortunately, the Premier of Queensland is a cool, calm, level-headed man, not at all of the impulsive temperament of the Prime Minister, and no very serious results followed the seizure of copies of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>

                    <para>The Prime Minister could not visit Tasmania, but sent a  deputy  in the person of the then Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jensen),</inline> who conducted his campaign in a most remarkable way. For instance, with a view to win votes for his side, he made a statement which was about the greatest piece of political bluff that could be put up by any Minister. As reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Hobart Mercury</inline> of, I think, 7th December - a newspaper that supports the Government - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jensen</inline> said that the Labour party objected to conscription for military service overseas, although under the Defence Act passed in 1903 there was power to conscript every man in Australia for naval service, and that to this the party had never objected. Such- si statement from a responsible Minister, to whom the public look for facts, was worse than bluff; indeed, it is very hard to find a parliamentary term to describe it. The honorable gentleman knows as well as anybody does that when a man or a boy joins the Australian Navy, with a full knowledge of the conditions, he may, by reason of his occupation, be taken oversea. He also knew, though the people to whom he was talking did not know, that there is no power under the Defence Act of 1903 to compel any man or boy to join the Navy. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jensen</inline> did not know these facts, he was more ignorant than a Minister ought to be, but I assume he did know, in which case his statement was a most impudent one for any Minister to make Then, speaking at Queenstown, the same gentleman made a statement which certainly was not) calculated to throw oil on the troubled waters, or to allay the bitterness of the fight. At the finish of his speech, on this occasion, he said, &#34; I am going to say something now which probably a number of the audience w&#39;ill not like, but all those who are advocating and supporting a &#34;No&#34; vote ought, if the referendum is lost, to go to Germany the next day.&#34; It would seem that this gentleman proposed to send over a million of the freedom-loving people of Australia, both men and women, to Germany, simply because they did not agree with him. He also said that all those young men and others, who had been making disturbances at the meetings, were nothing but slackers and shirkers. My own experience was that it was not the advocates and supporters of the &#34; No &#34; vote in Tasmania .who made these disturb.ances, but that, generally speaking, those on the other side were responsible. </para>

                            <para>- I suppose so. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> at a meeting in Tasmania, asked who. would be to blame if the joy-bells were ringing in Germany over the result) of the referendum if it should prove to be in the negative, as no doubt they would be ringing in such an event. My own opinion is that it was the Prime Minister and his supporters who, by their action in telling the people of Germany what a &#34;No&#34; vote would mean, were the friends of Germany, and &#39; ought to have been interned. These were the men who said that a &#34; No &#34; vote would mean that Australia had pulled out of the war, that she was tired of the fight, and that the majority of the people were disloyal to the Empire, and were quite satisfied to desert their boys in the trenches. Do honorable senators opposite subscribe to those sentiments? </para>

                            <para>- I do not accept the result of the referendum as an indication that Australians are disloyal to the Empire. After the first referendum the Prime Minister said in effect, &#34; It has been stated that the result of the referendum has shown that Australia is tired of the war, but the fact of Australia  turning  down conscription means only that the majority of the people do not agree with the compulsory method of obtaining soldiers.&#34; I regard the result of the second referendum in the same light. By that statement the Prime Minister admitted the inaccuracy of all the vile charges he had made against those who were opposing him during the first referendum campaign, and conceded that the majority of people were favorable to obtaining reinforcements by the voluntary system.  His  admission was made before there was any talk of holding a second referendum, but immediately we were plunged into the vortex of the second appeal to the people .the same old charges were made against the advocates of the negative side by the Prime Minister and those supporting him. The Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jensen)</inline> called those who were advocating the &#34; No &#34; vote enemies of the Empire, and he would send to Germany the day after a &#34; No &#34; majority was recorded many fathers and mothers of the boys who, for the last three years, have been engaged in the present terrible struggle. </para>

                            <para>- No; he said they ought to go to Germany the day after a &#34;  No  &#34; majority was recorded by the people, and that was tantamount to saying that if he had his way he would send them to Germany. The same gentleman, at the conclusion of an address at Burnie, was asked by the  chairman  if he would answer questions, and he replied, &#34; No ; I have given the facts ; there is no necessity to answer questions.&#34; He further said that a number of unauthorized persons were going about the State and speaking against the Government proposals. If he had his way they would not be allowed to speak. .He is a nice sample of a fair minded Minister ! It is all very well for pocket patriots like the present Ministers who, on the plea of patriotism, insist upon hanging on to their positions, to talk about the people&#39;s duty in this war, but when the true history of these times is written, the true patriots will be shown to have been those men who encouraged their sons to go to the Front, but only as free men, and the women who, though their pillows were wet with tears because of the fear of what might happen to their sons, brothers, and husbands, yet consented to their going. The future historian, writing &#39; with his judgment undimmed by the clouds of sectarian hate and bitter political partisanship, will adjudge as true patriotism the attitude of the men and women who said to their sons, &#34; Go, lad, if you think it your duty to do something in this fight; we are getting old and toil weary, and we should like to keep you with us, but if you wish to go, do so, and our blessing will be with you.&#34; They, and not men like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jensen,</inline> are the true Australian patriots in these times. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine, the accepted leader of the conscriptionists, stands before the people today a burst bubble or a pricked bladder.. He attached a lot of importance to the Prime Minister&#39;s statements that if the people did not do their duty Parliament would make them do it. He said that the Government had accepted its Ministerial responsibility, which was the only thing a body of honorable men could do, and was determined to carry conscription - that if the&#39; Government&#39;s proposals were not sanctioned the people would still have conscription imposed upon them. I wonder&#39; whether <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> and others who talked in this way&#34;, attempting to bluff the people, imagined that all of the people were fools. Certainly many voters were foolish enough to be bluffed by this kind of talk, but all of the people were not fools. Many realized that, although <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine might forget the existence of  His  Majesty King George or the Governor-General, if the people of Australia turned down conscription, and a Ministry, even one with the majority that the present Government have behind them in both Houses, succeeded in passing a Bill to enforce conscription on Australia against the will of the people, that measure would not receive the&#39; assent of the Governor-General, because he would know that in giving his assent to it he would be signing a verdict for civil war in Australia. It was realized also that, even if the Governor-General took the responsibility of assenting to such a Bill, petitions would be forwarded to the House of Commons asking  His  Majesty&#39;s Imperial advisers to advise the King to exercise his veto in regard to it. Does any one imagine that  His  Majesty&#39;s advisers in the Imperial Parliament would allow any Government  to force . conscription on the people of Australia once they had turned it down? The Imperial Government have already enough trouble on their hands without permitting internal trouble to arise in an important portion of the Dominions. </para>

                    <para>The final speeches by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir &#34;William</inline> Irvine and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and others were to this effect : The people of Australia had the right to decide the important question of whether conscription should be imposed, and accordingly the &#39;Government had submitted it to them. If the people would vote with the Government it would be all right, but if they voted &#34; No,&#34; then, figuratively speaking, the Government would spit in their faces ; the people were not capable of knowing anything about the matter, and, as they would not have done what the Government desired, conscription .would be forced upon them. That was the bluff we had from such anarchists as the Prime Minister and- <inline font-weight="bold">Sir &#34;William</inline> Irvine. They put the people of Australia in the position of the unfortunate criminal who is &#39;in the prisoner&#39;,s dock -on trial for his .life. After all the- evidence is given, .after the Judge has summed up in such a way that ,the jury has practically no alternative but to bring in a verdict of guilty, after the jury has decided on the prisoner&#39;s  guilt, and after the foreman, in answer to the question put by the Judge, says &#34; Guilty.&#34; the prisoner is asked whether he has anything to say why sentence of dea.th should not be passed on him, though the Judge knows full well that, although the prisoner may -talk for twenty-four hours, sentence of death must still be recorded against him. The people of Australia were put in the same position by the Prime Minister and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine and others who talked as they did . They were asked whether they had anything to say &#34;why the sentence of conscription should not be passed on them. Those &#34;who asked the .question had said in advance that whatever the answer of the .people might be, sentence of conscription would be passed upon them. But it was only bluff after all, because our friends- opposite knew that if a Bill to impose conscription were passed and received the assent of the Governor-General it would never receive the assent of the Imperial- Parliament, since that Parliament would know -that to assent to it would mean the plunging of Australia into civil war. </para>

I say that if such a Bill were assented to here it would be vetoed by the Imperial authorities. Will honorable senators opposite say that the Imperial authorities could not veto such a measure? .If the Governor-General gave his assent to .such a .Bill against the decision of the majority of the electors of Australia the Imperial Parliament would veto .the measure, and no Government in Australia would dare to enforce it. Until I see such a Bill presented to .this Parliament I will not believe that either <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine .meant what they said on this subject. I will continue <inline font-style="italic">bo</inline> believe that they were .only attempting to bluff the .people. After what they said the only honorable course for the &#39;Government was to withdraw the referendum. It would appear that immediately before the vote was taken -some -members of the Government must have sent wires to the Prime Minister to induce him to review what he had said, because, according to the press reports of the speech he delivered in Sydney on the night before the vote was taken, he said - </para>

He said that conscription would be forced upon the people of Australia, and it would be interesting to know, in the face of the referendum vote, what the honorable gentleman intends to do. Probably to-day the people of Australia are assessing him at his true value and know that he also was only bluffing in the statements he made. </para>

We must assume that Ministers believe in conscription or they would not have submitted the question to a referendum a second time. They say. that it is necessary to save the Empire and to save Australia. </para>

We further say that Australia would have done a great deal more under the voluntary system if the conscription proposal had not been thrown as a bone of contention-  amongst  the people. Some very funny arguments in support of conscription were urged during the campaign. At meetings which I held persons interjected to suggest that! we must have conscription, because it is necessary to hold the enemy on the Western Front, and to keep the enemy from over-running Italy. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> indorses that statement. I wonder whether he has ever given any consideration to the fact that men going from Australia after the referendum was taken, whether enlisted under conscription or a voluntary system, could not reach either the Western Front or the Italian Front until long after it would be possible for the Americans to be there. In view of this fact the honorable senator must recognise that the argument to which I have referred falls to the ground. </para>

                            <para>- The American Forces in large numbers are already in training, and they could get to the fighting front in one-sixth or one-seventh of the time it would take Australians to get there. Any men going out of Australia from &#34;to-day onward, whether conscripted or enlisted under the voluntary system, could not possibly arrive at&#39; the fighting fronts until some months after the American Forces might be landed there. That is my answer to the contention to which 1 have referred. </para>

Where, then, does his argument come in ? Surely it was not intended under conscription to send Australians into the field without a proper course of training. I cannot believe that that was ever intended. The argument I have referred to seemed to me to be one of the weakest arguments that any responsible man ever put up. </para>

A good deal has also been said in contradiction of our statement that conscription meant practically economic and social ruin in Australia. When some of our speakers stated that conscription in New Zealand had brought that country face to face with the very serious problem of the shortage of farm labour, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> characterized the statement as a &#34;foul and infamous lie.&#34; We have frequently heard that sort of phrase from his lips. He used that one at Tamworth, but one has only to read the reports of the National Efficiency Board of New Zealand, especially the parts headed, &#34; Strain on Industries,&#34; &#34; Shortage of Farm Labour,&#34; &#34;Assistance from School Boys,&#34; &#34; Last Male Worker on Farm,&#34; to see that what we stated was -true.

This means that weaklings and women could not do the work on those mountain lands. Quite a number of other statements could be quoted to show that conscription 1 has brought New Zealand to a very dangerous state economically and socially. The effect of conscription in Bulgaria is well shown by the following extract from a recent article on &#34; Conscription,&#34; by John Reed, war correspondent for the <inline font-style="italic">Metropolitan Magazine</inline> (New York): - &#34; I happened to be in Bulgaria in the summer of 1915, when Bulgaria joined the Teutonic Allies in the war; and Bulgaria would never have gone to war had there not been conscription.&#34; </para>

                    <para>An offer, made by the Prime Minister and indorsed by the Minister for the Navy, has &#34;been spoken of as the holding out .of the olive branch to the Labour party, .but that offer, as it appears in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> is worded differently from -the offer actually uttered by the Prime Minister and telegraphed throughout the Commonwealth by the experienced pressmen who reported his speech. In revising the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> interpolated words which changed the whole character of the  offer. His offer .was &#34;to &#34; get out,&#34; if &#39;his being Prime Minister stood in the way of a reconciliation, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Cook made a similar offer. . But on revising the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.. Hughes</inline> interpolated the condition, &#34;If the Labour party is willing to agree to a policy acceptable to the National Government.&#34; That action has been characterized . by the reporters as a trick. The newspapers published to the .country the original offer, and said it was declined. The offer contained in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard&#39;</inline> is something quite different. Had we accepted the offer in the first place we should have been told subsequently that we were bound, not by .the terms- of it appearing in the newspaper report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes&#39;</inline> speech, but by the terms in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report, and we should &#39;therefore &#39;have been  taken to have consented to be swallowed by the Liberal party. Speaking of the original offer the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> said that there could be no better recommendation to the &#39; people than to forget feud and forgive foes; to strive nobly for victory over the common enemy. But what about the other side showing a little of this forgiving spirit, and undoing what was wrongly done during the past few months? Let them restore to their original positions the unions that they have deregistered, not by legislation, but by regulation. If Ministers wish to proceed with their win the war policy, they can do so without our assistance, and, indeed, in spite of the Opposition, because in the House of Representatives there are only twenty-two Oppositionists, and in this Chamber only twelve. It is a farce to Say they are waiting for us to form a coalition with them. It would be impossible for this party to form a coalition with the Nationalist party, but we would be likely to support all genuine war measures proposed by a National Government whose members were not covered with the political dishonour which covers the present Ministers.  The .first and indispensable condition of unity is, so far as I am concerned, that the present Ministers must leave office and allow others to take their places. Those who condone the actions of the Government are condoning something that has brought parliamentary doings down to the lowest level. Notwithstanding attempts to gloss over what has been done, the fact remains that Ministers have not fulfilled their promise, and are clinging to office in defiance of the requirements of political decency. Our political history furnishes no parallel with their conduct. They went to the country declaring that they would not continue to govern unless certain powers were given to them, and it has been the practice of responsible Governments, when the country has turned down their policy, to resign office. The referendum vote in itself need not have caused Ministers to resign, but the Government said that it would resign if the vote went in the negative. Ministers said that they would not continue to govern without the power for which they asked, but) they, are continuing to govern. </para>

Ministers have made a laughing stock of responsible government. What opinion must the people have of Parliament when a pledge like that of the Prime Minister is not honoured ? Can. it be wondered that Parliament falls into disrepute ? </para>

                    <para class="block">This party, without entering into a coalition with another party, could work with it if a policy were brought forward to put the resources of Australia into a condition which . would enable us to meet our liabilities better. There might be an energetic shipbuilding programme - shipbuilding that should have been started twelve months ago. Recruiting will never be a success under this Government; but I suggest that the Director-General of  Recruiting should be given a free hand. He should be able to go into the Defence Department, to throw out a lot of the information that has come from the other side, making a fresh start. The present Director, or some other Director having no connexion with party conflicts, should be given a free hand to get information from the Imperial authorities. They ought to&#39; tell us plainly the requirements in men, food, and material, and the order in which they are required. We should be frankly informed as to the lowest number of men that the military authorities say are necessary to provide adequate reinforcements. Since the Government have been in office we have had so many conflicting statements under this heading that we do not know where we stand. Before the Labour party can have anything whatever to do with the so-called National Government, we require some vital alteration in the censorship. I wonder if the Minister ,for Expatriation will stand for this sort of thing: Seven prosecutions against the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Post,</inline> Hobart, and seven withdrawals. These are the matters in which the censorship has shown its absolute partiality. </para>

                        <para class="block">Court on two separate summonses to answer charges of prejudicing recruiting by publication of &#34;The Lottery of Death&#34; in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Post,</inline> on 29th November. Both charges were withdrawn. On 15th December the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Post</inline> received two summonses to attend the Police Court to answer charges that they printed in the newspaper certain matter which it was alleged should have been submitted to the censor. Both these charges were withdrawn, On 17th December the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Post</inline> received three summonses to attend the Police Court on charges of printing leaflets without prior , submission to the censor. Yesterday those three charges were withdrawn. The Attorney-General, who is also the Prime Minister, is congratulated upon his powers of prosecution, and also upon his marvellous powers of withdrawal. Seven prosecutions and seven withdrawals in a month; that is surely an Australian record. Will it be believed that the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Post</inline> is mulcted in heavy costs for the lot, on the ground that withdrawals are not quite dismissals? Those who offended against the law in other quarters were not hauled up before a Court to answer charges, which are scarcely formulated before they are withdrawn. </para>
                        <para>Certain &#34; instructions &#34; were sent to newspapers in reference to leaflets on 28th November. All the leaflet &#34; offences &#34; allegedly committed by the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Post</inline> were committed (if committed at all before that date. The Crown relied on a &#34; regulation &#34; six months old, which their own reminder indicated they scarcely considered sufficient. On several grounds, had the case proceeded, the Crown ran an excellent chance of leaving the Court badly worsted. The <inline font-style="italic">Daily Post</inline> carried out the instructions, once received, to the very letter. </para>
                        <para>If any offence was committed by the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Post</inline> in reference to the issue of leaflets (which is extremely doubtful), it was purely technical. The censor would have been bound under his instructions to pass every one of the leaflets forthwith. No objection was taken to the matter in the leaflets. &#34;Hughes Denounces Conscription,&#34; &#34; The Blood Vote,&#34; and &#34;Has Voluntarism Failed?&#34; had all appeared in the Australian <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> (though the last-named appears to have been adapted by the <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> from a prior publication headed &#34; A Startling Disclosure,&#34; in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Post,</inline> of 24th November). &#34;The Blood Vote&#34; was not published in the columns of the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Post.</inline> &#34;Has Voluntarism Failed?&#34; contained nothing that was not in the matter published in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Post</inline> on a prior date, under&#39; the heading, &#34;Startling Disclosures.&#34; &#34; Hughes denounces conscription,&#34; was printed in the <inline font-style="italic">Worker,</inline> reproduced from the <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Post,</inline> and then issued as a leaflet. Everything in the <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> has to be &#34;submitted,&#34; nor was that rule relaxed during the referendum campaign. The printed matter actually contained in all three leaflets was submitted and approved by the Sydney censor, and counsel for the defence yesterday produced in Court the original proofs, with the Sydney censor&#39;s seal attached. Nevertheless, the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Post</inline> has to pay the heavy costs incidental to all litigation on the withdrawal of all charges. </para>

                            <para>- Yes there is. The censor himself admitted that the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Post</inline> had been under stricter supervision than had any other newspaper. But enough has been said to show the absolute partisan way in which the censor-  ship is exercised. Then there are certain other War Precaution Regulations which require to be repealed before any fair-minded men can have anything to do with the Government which issued them. Take the interference of the Defence Department in small matters, but in matters which were very irritating. In the belief that there was too much racing in Australia, and that it interfered with recruiting, the Minister for Defence issued a regulation to the Military Commandants in each State to cut down race meetings. Now, in Tasmania,  the Legislature had only a little time previously curtailed the number of racing fixtures by one-half. Then the Military Commandant cut them down still further, so that a few trotting events  which were previously run at Eight Hours sports meetings cannot be run to-day. Representations were made on this subject to the Military Commandant, and a new regulation was issued. This regulation shows the utter want -of knowledge on the part of the Minister for Defence on the subject with which he was dealing. It provides that such gatherings as Eight Hours sports, church picnics, and charitable gatherings shall be allowed to run such races, provided that the prize offered in connexion with any event is limited to ?10. The Minister was asked. to increase the amount to ?20, but he refused to do so. Evidently, if the prize be limited to ?10, the event will help t&#39;o win the war, but if it be fixed at ?20, it will not do so. These are the sort of irritating things that have been done by regulation under the War Precautions Act. &#34;Unfortunately, there is so much to complain of that it is impossible for one to enumerate all causes of complaint in the .brief  period  of a couple of hours. However, 1 do not propose to occupy the time of the Senate any longer. In conclusion, I wish to say that I listened attentively to the reading by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> the other evening of a statement which, in reality, was a Ministerial statement. The honorable senator may have assisted in its compilation, he may even have dictated shorthand notes of it to a typewriter; but the statement which he read was practically a defence of Ministerial acts and of Ministers remaining in office. He was engaged for nearly an hour in reading that statement  which will appear in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> in the form of a speech. Consequently, it will read very well. I do not object to what was done on that occasion, but when, in the future, an honorable senator upon this side of -the chamber wishes, for propaganda purposes, to get a written statement into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> in the form of s&#62;speech, I trust that he will not be prevented from doing so. I am aware, sir, that you were not in the chair at -the time of which I speak. Your place was being filled by the  Deputy President,  who gave a ruling which, to my mind, was a most peculiar one. He held that as our Standing Orders had been suspended, the Senate was in a sort of &#34; go-as-you-please &#34; state. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle,</inline> I think, must have been reading Lord George Hamilton, who, in speaking of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone,</inline> said that his friends believed he was a super-man. </para>

I might add that State Parliaments had also dealt with this matter, and I submit they are the proper authorities. In my own State the local Parliament, in February last, cut down the number of race meetings to about half the number previously allowed, and then on top of that, authority has since been given to the Military Commandant to still further limit the number of fixtures. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know, but I think it is absurd that the military authorities should intervene on the plea that race meetings interfere with recruiting. As a matter of fact, many small country places where only one race meeting is held each year have given the largest number of recruits in proportion to population, and probably could furnish no more under any circumstances. It is utterly absurd that this regulation should be applied to such organizations as the Eight Hours Celebration Committee or picnic racing associations, which hold picnic race events, say, once a year. As a. concrete instance I may quote the Eight Hours Association in Hobart. It was only after a considerable amount of trouble that a special permit was obtained for the inclusion of a few trotting events at the annual gathering under the auspices of that body, and subsequently the Eight Hours Associations at Launceston and Queenstown asked for the same privileges. The Minister for Defence may still be a believer in the objects of an eight hours gathering, but if he is, all I can say is that his method of showing his belief is very peculiar. </para>

                            <para>- Well, his methods are peculiar. The Launceston associations referred to asked me to come over specially to interview the Minister for Defence, and see if they would be allowed to include two or three trotting events in their annual gatherings, as had been done previously, . because, as a rule, they rely upon these events to bring in revenue and thus help to provide the prize money for the athletic fixtures. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Spence</inline> was with me at the time, as he had also been asked by the Queenstown people to interest himself in the matter, but the Minister absolutely refused to grant an interview, which, as a matter of courtesy, I had every right to expect. I assured the Minister that we would not occupy his time for more than about two minutes, and that in a short interview we would be able to give him more facts than could have been furnished by lengthy correspondence. Still he refused. &#34; I have not the time, as the matter is not of sufficient importance,&#34; he said; and then he asked me to submit the matter in writing, as he had a number of similar requests from other parts of Australia, and would deal with them all under one regulation. I did so by writing him, and to-day, during the luncheon adjournment, I have received a copy of the regulation from the Defence Department, which reads as follows: - &#39; </para>

Originally, the Minister said that trotting events would only be allowed for trophies of the value of &#163;10. Then, when I pointed out that he might as well shut down on the unregistered race meetings altogether, because bodies like the Eight Hours Association could not expect to get entries from horse-owners to race for trophies under such circumstances, as they wanted the prize-money to pay the riding fees and provide fodder for the horses, he admitted he was wrong by saying, &#34; Well, after all, what do you want?&#34; Subsequently, he consented to allow cash prizes to the value of &#163;10 to be offered, but definitely refused a request to allow a cash prize to the value of &#163;20 to be offered. The idiotic regulations I have already quoted are the outcome of our representations. </para>
                    <para>I have nothing further to say except that until such absurd regulations as have been issued by this Government under the War Precautions Act are swept away, and we get back to common-sense administration, the Government cannot expect men of common sense to join with them, or give that assistance which our party will be prepared to give to any Government that will do the decent thing by them. When they keep the pledges they made to the people of this country, then it will be time for them to hold out what they call the olive branch to members of the Opposition. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not intend to occupy the attention of the Senate for more than a few minutes. The debate so far has been, in my opinion, a very laboured one, and with the exception of two speeches everything else may be boiled down to nothing. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle&#39;s</inline> speech was undoubtedly a creditable utterance; and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> took infinitely higher ground in regard to the present position than any other  speaker  who has contributed to this debate. I did not intend to speak at all, but for some remarks that fell from the lips of the Leader of the Opposition, and I am sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is not present, because he and I have been connected with the Labour movement in Australia for a very long time, and I wanted to mention certain matters referred to by him. However, as he is not present, I will defer my remarks until some future date. </para>

                    <para>I join with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> in his tribute to the Prime Minister. Notwithstanding the abuse that has been hurled at the head of the Leader of the Government by the various speakers during the debate on this Bill, I contend that the Prime Minister stands out as the one supreme figure in the Labour movement of Australia. </para>

I am simply indorsing the tribute already paid to a man with whom I have been personally acquainted for the past thirty years ; a man whose giant intellect organized and made the Labour movement what it is to-day. Notwithstanding all that the Prime Minister has done for Labour, his opponents of to-day are making every possible effort to kill him politically. They are endeavouring to put out of public life the most useful and the brainiest man that has ever been connected with the Labour movement. </para>

Surely the honorable senator will recognise that since Tasmania, as a settled community, is more than three times the age of Western Australia, she would have been able to (contribute to the Liberty Loan three times the amount raised in my State. Not only is Western Australia a very young State, but she has few citizens who can be termed &#34; wealthy &#34; in the full sense of the word. The actual subscriptions made by Western Australians to the Liberty Loan floated by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest are not truly reflected in the figures quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham.</inline> &#39; </para>

                            <para>- Certainly not. If the honorable senator had said that the amount subscribed in Western Australia was only one-half that mentioned by him, I should not have disputed the figures. What I do dispute is the conclusion which he drew from those figures. The wealthy men of Western Australia can be counted on the fingers of one hand, and their investments are made through various companies in which they are interested, and whose head offices, with the exception of the Western Australian Bank, are not located in that State. Whenever a Commonwealth loan is placed on the market, the insurance companies, whose head offices are situated in Melbourne or Sydney, subscribe largely to it. And so with shipping companies, who make large earnings in the trade between the eastern States and Western Australia. Their central offices are here. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. That being so, money which is invested through these companies by the few wealthy men of Western Australia, is credited to Victoria or New South Wales, although actually found by citizens of Western Australia. I venture to say that the amount mentioned yesterday by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> as having been subscribed in Western Australia to the Liberty Loan represents entirely the contributions . of the working men and also the school children of that State, who, to my own knowledge, contributed their pence and their shillings to that very loan. </para>

                        <para>. - I shall not speak at any length, nor shall I repeat statements that have already been made during this debate. I desire to talk very plainly of one or two matters relating to the action of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes).</inline> If a Nationalist Government is to continue bo control the affairs of this country, then I would rather the present Administration remained in office than that it should be succeeded by any other that might be formed from the same party. I say this, notwithstanding that I have nothing to thank the Prime Minister for in connexion with the recent referendum campaign. As a matter of fact, he tried to disgrace me by dragging me before a magistrate for an offence that I never committed. The Prime Minister attempted to disgrace me in that he sought to connect me with the German vote, and to show that I was endeavouring to stir up feeling on the part of disfranchised Germans against the regulation under which they had been disfranchised. That is a deliberate untruth. No one is more strongly opposed to that section of the community than I am, and if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> had done what I and my union did twenty years ago there would not have been so many Germans in Australia to-day. My union at that time refused to work with Germans and if the Prime Minister&#39;s union, which comprised thousands of foreigners, had taken up the same attitude the position to-day would have been very different. We pointed out then what would happen to Australia as the result of the influx of Germans to this country. The press at that time, however, hounded us down, because, as they declared, we dared to insult citizens of a friendly nation. We refused absolutely to work with Germans, and yet the Prime Minister has tried to connect me with the German vote. He brought from Albury, at the expense of the Government, a German in the pay of the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> with the object of securing a conviction against me. He brought forward a German to try to &#34; pot &#34; an Australian. Although ho has done all these things, however, I believe I should prefer to see him in the position he now occupies rather than some of those who are trying to take his place. </para>

                        often hurls the word &#34; German &#34; at the heads of honorable senators on this side of the Senate. I have only to say that he is one of the members of the Nationalist party who tried to capture the German vote on 5 th May last. He was one of the Nationalist party who, on the occasion of the last general election, advertised for votes in a German newspaper published in South Australia. In view of that fact, it is difficult to understand how he dares to fling the word &#34; German &#34; at us. I have here a copy of the advertisement. Fancy South Australia, with a German newspaper, and South Australian National candidates for the Federal Parliament advertising in it for votes !

                    <para>Soldiers of Australia. &#34; On the eve of this momentous election in the history of your country, I ask you to support the party that puts the &#39;war&#39; first and has subordinated all other things in order that Australia may stand unitedly behind you, and back up your great efforts for the cause of liberty against military despotism. </para>
                    <para class="block">I could agree with that myself - &#34;The Caucus party treats the war as a side issue, and is supported by every disloyalist, wild extremists, peace-at-any-price, and shirker in the country. Those men care nothing about the war. They sneer at the Empire: they say we should be just as well off under German rule; and they are now openly gloating over the fact that recruiting has fallen off. . &#34; These men, who pretend to speak for labour, but who never did anything for labour but live on it, are now trying to use it to serve their own selfish purposes, and are carrying on a campaign of deliberate misrepresentation in order to deceive the electors.&#34; </para>
                    <para class="block">That appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Glasgow Record</inline> on the 1st May, 1917 ; and a member of my union, who was working there, wrote a letter regarding it to the Glasgow newspaper, but it was refused publication. Can I be expected to have any respect for a man who tries to make me out to be a loafer on unionism? I was a unionist in Sydney long before the Prime Minister left the white cliffs of England, and never in my lifetime have I earned my bread and butter as an official of a union. For fifteen years, while I was the secretary of my union, I worked at my trade, and when it was decided to appoint a permanent secretary, I did not take the position. But the Prime Minister himself has loafed on Labour ever since I knew him. I am not saying anything derogatory of his ability or energy, because he has done wonders for the Labour movement; but he is one who has been guilty of the very thing of which he accuses me in that statement. I know the Prime Minister as well as any man could know him. For forty-three years I have been in the union movement in Sydney, and I was there when he came to Australia. He was given a job in connexion with the Australian Workers Union, taken up by the Wharf Labourers Union, and subsequently organized the Trolley and Draymen&#39;s Union. Yet that man writes 12,000 miles across the seas to tell the members of my union there that I am loafing on unionism to-day. How can I have any respect for a man like that ? As I say, I recognise his ability, and would rather see him in the position he occupies than any one else on that side, but this is the first opportunity I have had of resenting his treatment and I avail myself of it. He is a man who has never taken a. case into Court that he has not lost. He has had the conduct of many law cases; and yet he had not the sense or foresight to see that I was not offending against the laws of my country - that I was not offending against his regulation in what I did at the request of the returning officer. I have never pandered to Germans in any shape or form, and I refuse to tolerate the attempt, by means of a German employed by the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> to have me disgraced by means of fine or imprisonment. </para>
                    <para>There was only one proper thing for the Government to do when the result of the referendum became known. They ought to have resigned unconditionally; and then it was the duty of the good old Scotch gentleman, who was so very accommodating, to send for the Leader of the Opposition and ask him to form a Government. Had that been done, the Leader of the Opposition, with his Government, could have introduced his policy, and the Nationalist party could have ousted him at any time they liked. Then, of course, a Nationalist Government could have taken up the reins; but the party chose to adopt a course which must discredit them in the eyes of all right-thinking men. </para>
                    <para>Many wonder why the &#34; No &#34; vote was increased at the recent referendum. </para>
                    <para class="block">So far as New South Wales is concerned, the increase was due to the action of the employer class and profiteering patriots during the late strike. There was the &#34; sooling &#34; of the Premier of New South Wales to fight the workmen to the bitter end, the starvation of the men and their wives and families into submission to the employers, the mean victimization of the men - which is still going on - and the de-registration of the unions. Many thousands of good unionists who were fighting in France found that the rights and privileges for which they had long fought, and had hardly earned, were being filched from them by means of the de-registration of their unions. Who faced the Turkish bullets on Gallipoli? Who faced the German bullets at Bullecourt and&#39; the machine guns at Pozieres and in other parts of France? The 89,000 trade unionists who voted &#34; No.&#34; Had it not been for those unionists, Australia could never have put an army into the field; and yet they, and thousands more who have returned to Australia, voted &#34;No.&#34; When these men enlisted, they were given a solemn pledge that, while they were away, their rights would be preserved.. How has the Government preserved those rights? By smashing the unions ; and the Government have stood by and seen the wharf lumpers and &#34;coalies&#34; suffer. A pledge as solemn as the marriage vow was given that the rights of the men who went to the Front would be preserved for them when they returned; and that pledge has not been kept, for the unions are being de-registered. It is the bounden duty of the Government, if they expect the sympathy and good-will of the unionists of this country, to see that these unions are restored to the position they occupied before the men went to fight for the old flag. Can we wonder why people voted &#34; No &#34; ? Can we wonder that they feel so bitter against the Government, and that, on all occasions, they seek to fight the National movement ? I have nothing to say against the good old British flag, or the ruling power in Australia. What I resent is the paltry and mean treatment the men have received from the Government, who ought to have stood loyally to their promise to keep intact those rights for which the men of the unions fought and suffered for so many years. </para>
                    <para>I had no sympathy with the late industrial upheaval, and tried to prevent its spread. However, there were those who thought differently, and they have fought and been beaten ; and the Germans themselves, if they were here, would give better treatment than many of those men are receiving to-day. They are being hounded out of their homes, which are owned by the Government, and their goods and chattels turned into the street, although the Government could have settled the strike in one day, had they so chosen. The Government have power, under the War Precautions Act, to seize State property, and could have taken action, in so far as the strike was interfering with the prosecution of the war. But they stood back, and looked on with a grim smile while the unions were being smashed. I have nothing to say against honorable senators opposite, with whom I have been fighting in fair fight for many years; but, as to crossing the floor to join them, I can only say I would feel more comfortable going to bed with a black snake. I am a unionist pure and simple, nothing else. As I say, I did not believe in that strike, because I regarded it as an unjust strike ; but if I had been with my union, I should have been on strike with them. That is the spirit that animates all unionists; an injury to one is an injury to all. The Government ought to step in now and see that these unions are registered, as they were before our young men were asked to go to fight for King and country. I have nothing to say against the defence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and his Government put up by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> the other night: but what that gentleman said does not touch the matter. We have Judges in the Courts insulting trade unionists at every turn. That is something that unionists have never deserved. They ought to have better treatment, for, had it not been for them, as I said before, we should never have had an army in the field. </para>
                    <para>I should now like to say a few words about the treatment of the unfortunate returned soldiers. In hundreds of cases, these men are not getting the treatment to which they are entitled. Tradesmen who have come back minus an arm or a hand, and absolutely incompetent to carry on  their trades were given a paltry pittance of a pension. No man should be turned off the pay-roll until he is fit to fight the battle of life as he did before he enlisted. </para>

                            <para>- I know that recommendation was made. Outside the Commonwealth Offices in Sydney one may see a physical wreck proudly displaying the medals he won on the battlefield, and he is earning a living by selling roast peanuts. Motor cars pull up, and the rich step from them into the Commonwealth Bank for their monthly dividend, and go off to spend it in riotous living. Do they feel the war? Not at all. But the poor, unfortunate returned soldier has to sell peanuts. Every day men are calling at suburban houses and trying to make a living by selling small articles. The Government must do something to prevent hardships of that character before they will get the sympathy of the working classes, and to govern the community they must have that sympathy. </para>

                    <para>The newspapers recently took up the case of a returned soldier named Nelson, who was formerly a carter. He has a wife and three children, and has been given a pension of 16s. a week. The doctors assess a maimed man as half, or quarter, or an eighth, of a whole man. If a soldier who was a carter in civil life returns minus an arm or a leg, he is assessed as half a carter, and gets a pension at half rates. I say that returned soldiers should continue to receive their pay until they are able to earn a proper living. Of course, the cry is raised, &#34; Where is the money to come from with which to increase the soldiers&#39; pay ?&#34; There is plenty of money in this country for that purpose. On the racecourse every Saturday, and in the clubs, there is no lack of money. We can at any time see riotous living amongst certain sections of the community. But the stadiums in every State have been closed. Why? Because the boxers and those who patronized the stadiums have gone abroad to fight a greater battle - for the flag. But the rich can get as much money as they want and spend it how they choose. It is from them that the money should be obtained to give the soldiers more pay, and insure their dependants a decent living. The Repatriation scheme is still in the clouds, but I hope to see it soon lowered to earth, so that something may be done to assist the returned men. There is much talk about putting returned soldiers on the land, but 90 per cent. of them are not fit to go there. Before enlisting, they followed other avocations, and a man who expects to make a success on the land in Australia must serve his time and learn his occupation like any other skilled worker. As far as possible men must be returned to their former positions in society. There are many hard cases to deal with, I know ; but the case I have mentioned was not a difficult one to provide for, and I could mention many more of a like character. My suggestion for getting more recruits is to offer better conditions to the men who enlist, and to their dependants. The Joint Parliamentary Recruiting Committee recommended to the Government that the pay of our soldiers and sailors should be &#34;re-adjusted to meet the increased cost of living, so that its purchasing power shall be maintained at the 21st July, 1914, level.&#34; Since the date mentioned, the cost of living has increased by 33 per cent. One needs to enter the dwellings of the families of some of our soldiers to realize the starvation living they get. They have scarcely enough food to eat, they have no boots, and very little clothes. One newspaper in Sydney has stated distinctly that there are in New South Wales 1,600 families of soldiers who are in need of food and clothes. </para>

                            G. Potter, secretary of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers&#39; Imperial League of Australia, has supplied us with the following: - &#34; In response to a statement from our acting
                            <inline font-weight="bold">president, Dr. 1?.</inline>
                            W. Kane, which appeared in last Sunday&#39;s issue of
                            <inline font-style="italic">The Sun,</inline>
                            we have had close on sixty appeals for assistance from the dependants of soldiers now serving at the Front, many of whom have apparently left families of six and eight children behind them. &#34; Our investigations show that all cases are receiving assistance from the Lord Mayor&#39;s Fund, but we can definitely state that, though the separation allowance to the dependants of Australian troops compares more than favor: ably with that of all allied countries, and the allowance from the Lord Mayor&#39;s Fund is in all cases received, the present cost of living, especially in the purchase of clothing and boots, disqualifies these apparent advantages. &#34; Our inquiries show that very many cases are, regrettably, under heavy liabilities in connexion with time-payment furniture, but the very real and apparent need is clothing and boots for children of all ages up to sixteen years. I am assured by mothers of families from six to eight children that they can manage to provide food, but are absolutely unable to keep the children properly clothed or in boots. As one mother of eight, children stated to me yesterday, every week she either had to buy a pair of boots or have one or two pairs repaired for the children, and the strain was more than her limited income would allow. &#34; I am now appealing to the generous people  of this State, who are less unfortunately placed than these dependants of our brave men on service, who are fighting for the Empire, to forward donations of clothing and boots suitable for children to the New South Wales branch of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers&#39; Imperial League, who will insure such donations reaching the most needy cases.&#34;

                    <para>Honorable senators will see that an appeal is being made to charity for boots and clothing for the families of soldiers. The Minister says that he does not know of these cases, but there is one such case of distress in the house next to my own - the family of a sailor on the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane.</inline> They have had to appeal to charity. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Potter&#39;s</inline> statement continues - &#34; One other case in which assistance is needed is that of a soldier&#39;s wife who has eight children to support. She is shortly to undergo an operation, and, of course, here military allowance, which is supplemented by assistance from the Lord Mayor&#39;s Fund, is insufficient for her to pay a woman to come in and look after her children while she is in hospital. Might I now appeal to some patriotic ladies to offer practical assistance in this very genuine and needy case? &#34; </para>

                            <para>- The voluntary system has nothing to do with the matter. I met a soldier friend of mine in France, an old boxer, who had left behind ten children. I am merely pointing out that these cases do exist, and, of course, the cry immediately comes from senators opposite, &#34; How much do they get?&#34; That is always the cry. How much do the poor get? Never enough. How much do the workmen get? If they go to an Arbitration Court they must tell how much they get, and how they spend it - how much on tobacco and beer, and amusements. But the employer is never asked how . much he spends in that direction. I invite all honorable senators who doubt the truth of the statements I have made to write to A. G. Potter, secretary of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League, Macdonnell House, Pitt-street, Sydney. The men who make these statements are not anti-conscriptionists, but belong to the organization of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colonel Rowell</inline> is a member. There is further matter that I could read, but I think I have quoted sufficient to show that I am justified in saying that the soldiers and their dependants do not get the treatment to which they are entitled. </para>

                <para class="block">I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Rivett</inline> spends the whole of his time among the poor of Sydney, and that he publishes a paper written by himself, and paid for by himself, which he distributes among the poor. A man who does that must be a good man. Very few of our paid patriots who stand in the pulpit and cry out against the Labour party would do that kind of thing: I am ashamed of many of my co-religionists  who have used names in their pulpits that should never have come from clergymen. There are a dozen of clergymen in Sydney who signed a certain &#34; No &#34; manifesto, but they were all workers among the poor, and depend upon copper offerings for their living. Those who describe the Labour movement as everything that is bad gaze from their pulpits across congregations  beringed  with diamonds. One class preaches the gospel of Christ, the other the gospel of gold. </para>
                <para>Now I wish to say a word or two in regard to shipbuilding. I am an iron shipbuilder by trade, and I have had many years&#39; experience in this country. When I went to Great Britain as a Commissioner for the War Chest Fund, I took the opportunity of visiting some of the largest dock-yards in England and Scotland. I did not have the opportunity to visit one of the largest dock-yards in Belfast, but, nevertheless, I had the pleasure of seeing work going on in the construction of war vessels. The building of all merchant vessels was then hung up. The hulls were simply left as they were when the war started ; some of them ribbed, some of them plated, but none of them finished. 1 have looked in vain for the appointment of some master-hand who would tackle a scheme of shipbuilding in Australia. I have the pleasure  of knowing one Australian who has the ability and energy - and he has proved it - to undertake a shipbuilding scheme, but he has been overlooked; and here I enter my protest against the importation of any one from the Old Country to carry out this work. </para>
                <para class="block">I condemned the Labour Government which I supported for sending to England for a man to print bank-notes. When a man was needed to print stamps they sent to England for him. I produced a bank-note printed by a firm in Sydney, which was pronounced by an expert, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vardon,</inline> to be as good a not&#169; as had ever been printed. This Government has sent to America for men to make artificial limbs, though Australians can manufacture them just as well as can the people of any other country. One gentleman established a business for manufacturing artificial limbs at Harefield, in England, and sent to South Melbourne for a foreman and his staff. They perfected the work so well that an offer was made to supply the military authorities with limbs at &#163;12 10s. each, but these gentlemen would rather send away to America for limbs, and pay the Yankees &#163;25 each for them. They refused the offer. The men who were making these limbs weirs Australians who received their training in Australia. They have now returned to Australia, and the factory at Harefield is dismantled. It shows that men in this country are able to carry on any class of work as well as those who may be imported. </para>
                <para>We are in our  infancy  in regard to shipbuilding. Men we may bring from th&#171; Old Country can only commence shipbuilding on the lines to which they have been accustomed there. We do not want to make a start in a huge fashion with an army of clerks and typists.- We need only to mair&#169; a start on the sea shore with a few practical men. Nine months ago an offer was made to the Commonwealth Government to build composite vessels, but the suggestion was turned down. I am not sure whether that was a wise step, but I was staggered when a little later on we were informed that the Prime Minister had made a contract for wooden vessels to be built in America. We have the men here, frames ban be rolled here, angle irons can be turned out here, as can also the plates. They have already been rolled in Australia. In my opinion, the Government should have taken over the means of producing steel plates, and should have commenced- the work without asking  any  one&#39;s permission. Now we find that work in America has been delayed by strikes, though we thought strikes were hindering the construction of vessels in Australia only. The next information we get is that the work is delayed because the contractors are awaiting timber from Australia. Good heavens ! ls America getting timber from Australia to build Australian ships? That is something for the Australian native to think about. He is told that he can do nothing. Men have to go into the Australian forests and hew Australian timber in order to send it to America, where it will be used in building ships for Australia. We heard the other&#39; day that His Majesty the King was shown an improved method of plating a vessel, but that improved method was perfected in Australia seven years ago, and was employed in building the trawler <inline font-style="italic">Endeavour.</inline> That vessel was launched within six weeks from the day on which the keel was laid. Every straight plate in her side, and every frame was ready to hang up in its place before the keel was laid. </para>
                <para>There is in Australia a man in charge of works who can make a model of a ship and build it, and finish it. An order was sent to England for a vessel which would carry 300 tons of silt, with a draught of not more than 3 ft. 6 in. When the vessel arrived it was found that it could not hold more than 250 tons, and it had a draught of 4 ft. 6 in. The gentleman to whom I was referring was asked whether he could build one of the dimensions and capacity required, and he said, &#34;Yes.&#34; The vessel he built carried 300 tons of silt, and had a. draught of 2 inches less than was specified. There is no need to bring out men for this work. When they come here they have to learn Australian conditions. In England ships are built in a scientific way. We have to grow up to that method. In England a man does one part of the work on the vessel, and nothing else, all his lifetime. In Australia we have not sufficient work of the kind to attempt to carry out that system. We must employ men who can do every Class of work on a vessel, and we have them here. I am told that this gentleman who is to control our shipbuilding is bringing out his .own workmen. I do not know whether the statement is true or not. but the next step required would be to have a huge building in which to house the staff. Let the man in control go down to the sea shore where a start is to be made with building these vessels, and let him put up a humpy there. It will be quite good enough. </para>
                <para>I say that the Government are not sincere in their shipbuilding proposals. They are asking the workmen who are to be engaged in the industry to give away privileges which they have jealously guarded for years. I have been a member of my union for forty-three years, and during the whole of that time the employers of this country have attempted to introduce piecework and the dilution of labour into the shipbuilding trade. We have always resisted those attempts, and have always won. I am not saying that the piecework system may not be an equitable and just way of securing that a man shall earn what he is paid, but it is the abuse of the system resulting in speeding up and sweating that we wish to prevent in this country. We do not desire that these industrial evils shall find a place in Australia. However, the men engaged in the trade are prepared to give up the privileges which they won and have maintained for a long time in order that the Government may proceed with their shipbuilding scheme. The men are under the impression that the piecework system and the dilution of labour in the industry will continue only during the war, but once the speeding-up system is established it will never in my opinion be got rid of. In this country a lad serves an apprenticeship to the shipbuilding trade, but where dilution of labour is conceded a man who has been at some entirely different business until he is twenty-one to twenty-five years of age may be brought into a trade and so be the means of preventing the employment of a young man who has served an apprenticeship in it. The members of my union have given in on these matters, and are prepared to carry out the proposals of the Government. I hope that in the circumstances the Government will proceed as quickly as possible with the work of shipbuilding. I should like very much to see some tribunal appointed by&#39; this Parliament to control the business and insure that it shall be carried out in an Australian way. </para>
                <para>There is only one other matter upon which I wish to say a word, and that is with reference to the financial obligations of the Commonwealth. I do not for a moment  pretend to be a financial expert, but I have listened to and have read the opinions of men who are admitted to be financial experts. I remind honorable senators that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Grice has given a timely warning to the people and Parliaments of Australia of what is likely to happen if we do not put our finances on a proper footing. He says definitely that the burden of taxation must fall upon the producing class. He has pointed out that it is possible for very wealthy men to obtain a return as high as <inline font-style="italic">1\</inline> and even 10 per cent, from investment in the war loans. It is easy to see that if men can secure such a profit from that investment, they will not be encouraged to put their money into the development of any business or trade. The financial expert of the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> has dwelt times out of number upon the reckless extravagance of every Government in Australia. He has pointed out that &#163;9,000,000 will be required in a very short period to pay interest on our loans, and we have to ask ourselves where that money is to come from. </para>
                <para>During the coming recess the Government must tackle the financial question, and if they handle it in an equitable way, and make the burden of taxation fall upon those best able to bear it, they will have my &#39;hearty support. The financial institutions all over Australia are amalgamating to-day in order to save expense. All the banks are cutting down expenses because they can see that in this country, unless we are careful, we may be faced with financial chaos after, even if not before, the close of the war. Recently I saw some works completed, and the money spent on them might just as well have been thrown into the sea. Our financial difficulties should have been anticipated&#39; earlier, and there should not have been the pandering to the States which we have witnessed. There has been pandering to the States in connexion with the shipbuilding scheme. It is suggested that one ship shall be built in one State, and another in some other State j whilst, if all were built at the one place, the cost of construction might be very materially reduced. </para>

I think it is a suicidal policy, and it would merely be throwing money away to insist that some of the ships shall be built in one State and some, in another. Every intelligent man can see that it must add greatly to the cost of shipbuilding in Australia if the work is to be carried out in several different establishments in the different States, rather than in one establishment. </para>

                    <para>In my view, there is only one way out of the financial difficulties with which we are faced, and that is the unification of Australia under one great National Government. Under the existing condition of things, with separate Governments in each of the States, in addition to the Federal Government, every man, woman, and child in Australia is being asked to pay 3s. a week more towards the government of the country than it should cost. I strike out at once for a unified Australia, and I say that is the only remedy to meet the financial obligations we are incurring on account of the war. </para>

I repeat that I have no wish to be unfair to the Government. I believe they had no right to be where they are until they had followed the constitutional practice of defeating the man who should have been sent for by the Governor-Gen er,al. They are in power, however, and I cannot help it. There is, at the present juncture, nothing for me to do but to assist them in every way I can with a Win-the-war policy. So long as they are prepared to impose the burden of taxation upon those best fitted to bear it, to start the building of ships for the transport of our products oversea, and other works of that description, they will have my hearty support. I say, however that, up to the present, the Government shipbuilding scheme has been nothing but a farce. They are asking the shipbuilders to give away privileges that are dear to them. The workers have consented to do so, in the hope of assisting the Mother Country, and because those engaged in the shipbuilding trade desire to see the scheme properly started, since many of them are at present out of work and starving. I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate to use his brains and induce the Government to get to work quickly with the shipbuilding scheme, and to submit equitable proposals for meeting our financial obligations. If the Government will do this, they will have no stronger supporter than myself. </para>

                        <para>. - We need not make any apology for debating the subjects which may be considered on the motion for the first reading of a Supply Bill. There is good reason for the scope of the debate in the peculiar position in which parties in this Parliament are at present placed. We have, in the past, lived along very peaceful lines, and so long as security endured it did not matter very much at any time which political party happened to be in power. At the present time, so far as I am concerned, the Government of the country may be formed from the party on the right or on the left of the Chair, so long as it is in deadly earnest on one matter and one alone, and that is the mustering of the whole of the energies and resources of the country for the purpose of aiding the Allied nations to win the war. A few years ago I made a statement to the same effect in my own State. I said that for me at this time there was only one party, that it should have only one platform containing only one plank and that the winning of the war. It mattered not to me which party was in power so long as the Government conformed as nearly as possible to my views as to the way in which they should acquit themselves at this fateful if not fatal hour in our country&#39;s history. </para>

                    <para>I was pleased to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> refer to the shipbuilding industry. I wish to impress upon the honorable senator that, while spurring up the Government and galvanizing a party into activity may be very necessary, something more requires to be done to make the establishment of the shipbuilding or of any other industry a success. One other important essential is the sym pathetic co-operation of the whole of the employees engaged in the industry. I might, in this connexion, refer honorable senators to what has happened in connexion with the construction of the cruiser <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane.</inline> I believe that it furnishes a very sorry example of the way in which an effort made for the establishment of an industry may not meet with the success it deserves. Subject to correction, I am given to understand that the building of the cruiser <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> cost this country nearly double what was paid for the cruisers <inline font-style="italic">Sydney</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Melbourne&#39;.</inline> I am not quite sure of my figures, but I will say that, while the people of Australia are quite content to give encouragement for the establishment of new industries to the extent of30 per cent. and 40 per cent., when it comes to paying 100 per cent. more for the building of a warship than its construction should reasonably cost another issue is raised. The people of Australia are likely to pause before they undertake work in this country which can be done for half the money elsewhere. </para>

                            <para>- I do not attach so much importance to an increase in the time required for the performance of the work, but I protest against the unwillingness of men in the position of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall,</inline> and others belonging to the same party, who are always insisting upon the rights of the employees, to be equally insistent with respect to their duties and responsibilities. That is a charge which cannot be laid against me. I have said that I care not from which side the Government is formed at the present juncture, so long as it is actuated by the one desire to insure the safety of the country. I must say that while I was still a member of the United Labour party, and while, so far as the essentials of the Labour platform are concerned, I am yet more closely wedded to them than are those who have &#34; Labour&#34; always on their lips - before I was politically beheaded, and told to walk the plank, I was, especially at election times, always insistent that employees who, when they got a fair day&#39;s wage, did not give a fair day&#39;s work for it, were the enemies of Labour, no matter what they might say of themselves. I hope that my words will not fall upon barren ground, but that they will be the means of inducing <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> and others to urge those who are to be employed in -shipbuilding, or in any other industry, that if they are given fair conditions and fair wages they must, in their turn, do their bit if there is to be any chance for the successful establishment of the industry. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. I have as much to do with the grievances1 of returned soldiers as any man in the Senate, and I always find when I take a grievance to the proper quarter and have the rights and wrongs of it inquired into, that I never fail to get redress, and, therefore, I never come to this chamber to ventilate a hollow grievance, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> has been doing to-day. When asked for figures he failed to give them. When asked to- come down from the clouds and give specific instances of hardship and injury to returned men, he failed to do so. That sort of thing is not just to the Senate or to the returned soldiers, nor is it playing the game as a member of the Senate. If an answer were wanted, what more crushing and effective reply could we have than the systematic help given to the Government by the Returned Soldiers Association, which is a body organized first and foremost with the avowed object of looking after the grievances of its members. Yet, men like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> and others - and I do not exempt even some members of this party in the past - have resorted to a recital of imaginary grievances with only one result in prospect, that is, to add to the other causes operating to discourage recruiting. Every member of the Senate whose heart is in the right place and desires to see recruiting a success will agree with what I say, and in particular I adjure* honorable senators on your left, if they want to see their professed policy a success, to abstain from indulging in the recital of grievances that have no foundation or justification in fact. </para>

                    <para>I referred incidentally to the opportunity &#39;which this debate gave us to deal with subjects of first importance. There is one subject that, to my mind. bulks more largely than all the others put together&#34;, that is, how this country is going to fare now that our very fate may be decided on the battlefields of Europe. So completely has that thought seized upon my mind and directed my course of conduct in the past, that I have been for long like a voice crying in the wilderness. I mapped out a course of conduct for myself which I thought would succeed ultimately in getting Australia to take her proper share of the burden at last, and stand four-square under it- before it- was too late. To-day, while we are sitting on- easy seats, playing at the parliamentary game- in every State, and talking about inconsequential nothings, every shot fired may be bringing . us closer&#39; to the day when fate will write the destiny of this country, and, perhaps, not in our favour. Even members on your left have admitted that that is so. Why do w&#169; trouble about what the Censor does, about unimportant trifles - matters that have been magnified beyond all warrant or justification during the debate - when the one thing that should concern us is the safety and liberty of Australia? If to-night, where those grim forces are opposed to. each other at that point near Cambrai, the Germans broke through, and to-morrow morning when we woke up we read that disastrous news in our paper for the first time, what would it matter to us what happened in our local politics, what thought would seize the mind of the man with the most sluggish imagination, what thought would be foremost in the mind of the men who recently led the agitation for the recording of the &#34; No &#34; vote? While the war is on we have no guarantee that such a shock is not in store for us. &#34; The race is not always to the swift, nor the battle to the strong,&#34; and while, the Allied nations are fighting for their lives, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George puts it, we are wasting time indulging in a kind of play that does us as custodians of the welfare of the nation little or nov credit, for this country equally with the rest of the Empire is fighting for its life to-day. If we read that the German forces had broken through, what would it matter to us if every statute law piled up, sir, behind your chair, from the very first word to the last, went up in smoke ? What would it matter even if in this and every other Parliament House in the States not one brick was left standing upon another, if on some fateful morning we read either of the defeat * of the Allies or of a drawn battle&#39;? What would it matter in that event if we enacted a law and scratched it off the statute-book again the next moment? What is the value of all those laws that we have so laboriously built up, when our very right to make a law at all is staked on the hazard ? The present position is so serious that I cannot, even with the present opportunity offering, devote .my time to dwelling upon those things which either singly or in the mass trouble mo not at all compared with the vital paramount subject of what we should do to assist the Allies to win the war. We have put up a fair .record in this country as records go, but from the first day that Australia resolved to share in the struggle standards have been constantly altering. When we sent the first 20,000 men we thought we had done very well; when the next 30,000 went we thought we had done still better, and when finally the voluntary system was in the heyday of its vigour and we reached the 100,000 mark, we thought . we had exceeded all the expectations of the most sanguine amongst us. But the standard has been changing from year to year, and even &#39; from month to month, aye, even from week to week, during the progress of the war, so that the standard which justified us in thinking we had done very well to send the first contingent does not apply to-day. The standard has altered in proportion to the necessities of the hour, and the necessity of the hour to-day is to win. When we sent the first 20,000 men we did not think that would win the war, but had in our minds the thought that we would need to send more, and still more. Men must, therefore, put nut of their minds the foolish notion, which seems to have taken possession of a good many, that we have done very well, or, as some think, too well. We shall not have done too well, or even, well, until we have done our utmost, and until, as- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor</inline> put it, the last man that is fit and able to fight takes his place in the ranks.

                    <para>In order that we may do our best and overcome the disadvantages created by the defeat of conscription, we must seek some form of co-operation, and try to discover the source of the difference that separates the members of this Parliament. I realize that that is very difficult, for the split is almost as hard to heal as an old sore. A kind &#39;of factional sore has broken out in this Parliament, which I am sorry to say is the only one I know of in the English-speaking section of the, Allied Parliaments where bitterness and discord are rampant. I have tried to discover what influence is at work to produce this sore, and T long for the time when some expert will come on the scene and tell us the true source and nature of the difference that separates us to-day. He would, indeed, be a public benefactor if he could expose to the public gaze the real secret cause of the trouble. It is true that members on both sides try to make their own can&#171;e the best, but the country is looking&#39; on. The electors are not deaf, but are listening all the while, trying to grope their way through the very serious puzzle why members of this Parliament do not pull together to see the country  through  its troubles. I am reminded of Benjamin Franklin&#39;s remark when he signed &#39;h? Declaration of Independence. Somebody said to him, &#34; I suppose, Franklin, wo shall have to hang together,&#34; and he replied, &#34; If we do not hang together we shall hang separately.&#34; I am afraid that, there is just a chance, so far as Australia&#39;s contribution to this world-wide effort is concerned, that we may paralyze our powers and cut a sorry figure as a result. If we do not pull together now and  henceforth, Australia will certainly be placed in a most disadvantageous position. My advice is that each party should get down to a clear and  honest  expression oi its aims and frank indulgence in plain speech. Plain speech is the great curative agency that is needed on  the  present occasion. This does not necessarily mean smooth words or eloquent phrases. The truth needs no adornment. Its beauty shines from its own face. No eloquence can improve it. We cannot gild refined gold. What is needed is for senators to frankly recognise the facts and causes which have brought about the existing disruption and discord. I propose to indulge in plainness of speech. It is often necessary to be cruel to be kind. The festering sore must often be cauterized before it will heal, and there is no burning iron like plainness of speech for the purification of political sores such as that which we have to cure. Plain speaking in the end leads to good. Any one who has studied human relations will admit that when two persons have been estranged, whether for a short or for a long time, plain, honest talk is the necessary prelude to reconciliation and future harmony. At this time there is greater warrant for the application of the searing iron to the malignant political sore than we have ever had before. I shall not take up time by referring to the mannerisms of this or that honorable senator, or to the indiscretions and blunders of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes.</inline> My duty  now is to apply myself to the consideration of the aims or goal of the two political parties. A party that is judged by its objects cannot complain of .unjust treatment. I am prepared to stand by the aims of the Nationalist  party  i hope that honorable senators opposite are equally prepared to be judged by the aim - or, to be correct, the many aims - of their party. It is better to devote attention to discovering whether the aim or policy of a party is the correct one than to waste time and cause headaches to listeners by inconsequential references to what this one or that has done. Mv chief concern is, Where are we going? The voyager on a rough and stormy sea, and in the neighbourhood of shoals and reefs, is concerned only with his destination. So with the wayfarer in life. Men must be judged by their collective aims, and it is by such a judgment that I propose to compare the relative merits of the two political parties. We need not concern ourselves now whether this one or that has been guilty of indiscretion, or whether for a moment the true line of national policy has been temporarily deviated from. In human affairs, allowance must always be made for deviation. Even the mariner&#39;s compass, that simple little piece of mechanism, a piece, of steel poised on a delicate point, which guides the ship over the darkest and stormiest ocean, is subject to variations caused by magnetic influence. Such variations will sometimes, if not  watched  and allowed for, bring trouble. But. as a rule, the needle points unerringly to the magnetic pole, and despite its variations, the compass has for centuries been the mariner&#39;s safety. The destination of the ship is to be determined, not by what the captain or the steward mav  have  said, or by some inconsequential happening on board, but by the compass. The essential question is, How is the vessel heading ? </para>
                    <para>Before putting the two political parties into the scale, let us briefly consider the present position in Australia. This country, comparatively speaking, has been a recent discovery. Her political history is well within the memory of some of us ; but, owing to her peculiar geographical  position, many of her people have become neglectful and negligent of her true relations to other peoples, and of their responsibilities to the world at large. Distance is a bad stimulator of the imagination, and so, too, is absence. The fact that we are far removed from the scene of warfare is mainly responsible for the unfortunate position in which Australia now finds itself. If, instead of being 12,000 miles from the fighting a,eas, our population were living in the neighbourhood of the Mediterranean, and within earshot of the 15-in. Austrian guns, would there have been the huge &#34; No &#34; vote that was recently cast against conscription ? If those who voted &#34; No &#34; could have visualized the sufferings of the men in the trenches, if they could have seen what was passing there, and could have known the superhuman sacrifices which were being borne there, the vote would have been different. If our people could have witnessed the. .scenes of violence in </para>
                    <para>Europe, if they had had a better opportunity to size up for themselves what our gallant men are doing, the result of the referendum would have been more pleasing to real patriots. Is our national attitude, then, a mere geographical result, or the fruit of a low grade imagination ? </para>
                    <para>We, in Australia, have been at once fortunate and unfortunate in having had the protection of the Navy. It has been said that it would have been a good thing had the German Fleet swept down  our coast from the Chinese seas, and fired a few shots into bur coastal towns ; that our spirit and attitude towards the war would then have been vastly different from what it is to-  day. The report of Admiral Patey shows that the <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> sent her jackals out to round up her prey, but that the German Fleet - the <inline font-style="italic">Scharnhorst, Gneisenau,</inline> and the others - knew what she was doing, and would not be driven within range of her guns. The German commanders knew the calibre and power of the <inline font-style="italic">Australia&#39;s</inline> equipment. Had she had 6-in. instead of 12-in. guns, the position of this country would have been very different. The Germans would have given battle, and would not have hesitated to come down along our coast. Had they laid waste part of Sydney and Adelaide, and such other coastal towns as they could reach, the patriotism of the sleepiest Australian would have been awakened, and we should now stand in a better light in the eyes of the Empire and the Allies. Our trouble has been caused by the fact the the guns of the <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> at sea were <inline font-style="italic">taa</inline> big, and the minds of too many Australians on land were too little. It has been said that Australia has done well, and I do not decry what this country has done. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> referred to it as &#34;my country.&#34; I am content to call it &#34; our country.&#34; I somewhat resent the tendency of honorable senators who are Australian-born to reflect on those whose birth-place is elsewhere. </para>

                            <para>- Quite true. I have nothing against Australian natives. I have lived in this country twice as long as in any other, and love and respect it for all that it means to me&#39; and mine. Having heard the sentiments of which. I complain expressed in another place, and also in this chamber, I would be inclined to pass them by as merely the base emanations of a huckster&#39; a mind, but for the fact that they come from men who occupy responsible positions in this country. What have these men done? Have they looked abroad in the world ? Have they read history as Emerson says, with their prejudices, and not with their eyes? Have not they recalled the fact -that men did&#34; not need to be natives of other countries, as these men are natives of Australia by accident, to prove themselves the foremost and towering champions of those  coun-&#62;  tries? Take, for example, Alexander-. Hamilton, who was born outside the United States, and who was the very father of its financial system. Take Edmund Burke, who was &#34;born outside Great Britain, and yet was one of the fathers of the House of Commons. Was he less true a Britisher because he was born in Ireland ? Take Thomas Paine, who was recognised as one of the foremost champions of the new spirit of liberty which was at the time being born in; America. He went to France, but was he any the less ardent spirit for the emancipation of the people there than were men who had been bom there? Take Lord Byron, who breathed into the dead soul of Greece some of the living fire of patriotism. These are examples which might with advantage be re- &#39; called by men who are  contemptible  Lilliputians in mind, and who have only the narrowest mental horizon. If they could be influenced by reflection they would be broadminded men, but they are men possessed of only local minds, not even of decent municipal minds if their qualifications be accurately appraised. Look at the long line of big men who do not owe their nativity to -this country, but who were residents of&#39; Australia from choice. I have no hesitation in affirming that if it comes to a question of striking a balance between many men&#39; who are natives of this country by accident, and myself, that balance will be in my favour. I wish to say frankly that this country is in my debt. I have been resident in it for over thirty years, and if my sojourn here-were placed on a cash basis, Australia would be greatly in my debt. But of all countries I know, there is none so dear to me as is this, the land of my adoption. It will be seen, too, that the foremost men who have fought for Australian independence were not necessarily born here. Take William Charles Wentworth, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Parkes, and the long line of sturdy Democrats that breathed into the infantile mind of Australia the fire of democratic feeling, and patriotic ambition - such men as Higinbotham, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Graham</inline> Berry, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Grey. They towered among their contemporaries, and were certainly none the worse for having been born outside Australia, while Australia is all the better for these men having come here and fought for her liberties. Then there is <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Josiah</inline> Symon, who was born in Scotland, but who put up one of the sturdiest fights ever fought for the judicial independence of this country. Surely his career compares more than favorably with the careers of men who are natives of this country by accident and not from choice. </para>

                    <para>I come now to the permanent bone of contention - the&#34; pledge which was given by the Government to the electors. I frankly confess that the Prime Minister did pledge himself that he would not continue; to ad-minister the affairs of this country if the* power to- conscript men for military service overseas was withheld. That power has&#39; been withheld by the electors,, and yet we find tha* he and his colleagues, still occupy the Treasury benches. But it has been well said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> waited upon the Governor-General and tendered his resignation unconditionally.  His Excellency,  after having exhausted the resources of this Parliament, ultimately commissioned &#62; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> again to&#187; form another Government. So that technically, perhaps, the Prime Minister&#39;s pledge has been broken. But the question of conscription having been subtracted from the situation, members of this Parliament now find themselves in exactly the position that they occupied on the night of the 5th May last. By an overwhelming majority the electors of this country had then directed them to occupy the Treasury benches. So that &#34;there is not. very much to be alarmed abouti </para>
                    <para>I am quite content te- shoulder my share of the responsibility of supporting the Government on the present occasion, under the circumstances which confront us to-day. I am perfectly willing to justify my position on any platform. It is significant that those gentlemen who are so very keen in recording all the shortcomings of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> conveniently forget one of the memorable pledges or threats of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher.</inline> On one occasion that gentleman said that if certain proposals were not accepted, the electors would get something which would make them &#34; fall down with fright.&#34; If that was not a pledge I do not know what it was. Yet these men who find fault with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> for having made statements with much the same import, failed to utter a word of condemnation about the unfulfilled . threat or pledge by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher.</inline></para>
                    <para>So far as pledges go, we know that they assume different forms. It is true that the pledge given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was framed in definite words. But we can recall other instances during the course of the present war when men took up an attitude which- in essence amounted to a pledge, and subsequently found themselves compelled to abandon that attitude by reason of the pressure of circumstances. What did  President  Wilson say on one- occasion? He said that his. policy was peace&#39; without victory. The people of the United States of America are- quite1 entitled to look back and say to- him, &#34; There is your public declaration. Why are yos going to war now?&#34; As a matter of fact, some of them were,, and are, saying such things.  President  Wilson has completely altered the attitude which he previously assumed, because he now says that we &#34; must have victory before we can have peace.&#34; That is the attitude which is to-day assumed by the mouthpiece of a. powerful nation which is now actively engaged in the struggle. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> is obliged to change his attitude in similar circumstances, why should he be condemned if we have no censure for  President  Wilson? Of course, all this criticism of the Prime Minister is traceable to the terrible hatred of him to- which I shall refer at a later stage. In the meantime, I wish to tell honorable senators why I still adhere to the Nationalist party, and have no- intention whatever of attaching- myself to the party opposite. </para>
                    <para>My reason is that the Nationalist party have a definite aim towards the accomplishment of which its members are united. They have sunk all their political and personal differences for the purpose of inducing this country to put forth its utmost energy towards the successful prosecution of the war. But when we come to examine the political party opposite, what kind of a situation confronts us? The members of that party are standing at opposite poles on matters affecting the successful prosecution of the war. One member declares himself in favour of a certain policy and another member says that he is in favour of an opposite policy. One man declares for action and another for inaction. How can I become an adherent of such a party when I find so many different counsels offered at such a fateful hour as the present? Let me recall what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor</inline> says as an example. Speaking at Richmond he said - </para>

                    <para class="block">That is how he should have spoken, and I honour him for it. But when we come to his lieutenants, what do we find is their attitude? With  the  exception of one or two individuals, including <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Page,</inline> I have never heard any member of that party so emphatic upon the point that every fit and able man should enlist as is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor.</inline> Take the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> as an example. Did he say anything like that ? The Senate was entitled to a declaration of equal strength from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> the responsible Leader of the Official Labour party in this chamber. And when we get down to the rank and file of the party, what do we find? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Page</inline> declared himself against conscription, but side by side with his statement was the declaration that he would do all he could, short of advocating conscription, to obtain recruits and help this country to stand firmly to its declared policy of carrying on till victory is achieved. All honour to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Page</inline> for his declaration. If the other members of the party opposite had spoken as emphatically, there would have been a happy prospect of re-union of the parties in this Parliament. But we have to turn from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Page&#39;s</inline> declaration and look at the other side of the picture. We have to take account of what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Considine,</inline> who comes from Broken Hill, has had to say on this subject. Has he given any such expression of opinion? I am afraid not, and we could say the same of the stand taken by many other members of the Official Labour party. Has <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks,</inline> for instance, either inside or outside of this chamber, ever said a kindly word for the system of voluntary recruiting which he professes to support? v </para>

I might inform the Senate that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin,</inline> the editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Worker,</inline> a paper representing the -Official Labour party for the time being, went to the gold-fields and spoke during the election campaign. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin,</inline> I may add, came from Victoria, and on occasions I have heard him, speaking on the Yarra-bank, where it has often been declared that this war was a capitalists&#39; war, and that the profiteers stood to make money out of it. So far as I have been able to ascertain, he never said a word about Australia&#39;s interests being vitally bound up in the conflict. I warned him it would not do to tell the people on the gold-fields the tarra.diddles he was accustomed to utter on the Yarra-bank, because there he would be amongst a number of men who had travelled and were keen students of human affairs. What did he tell the people on the fields? It is on record. He said that the freedom of Australia to-day was being fought for in Europe. But I remind the Senate that when he made that statement his purpose was not to help forward any efforts Australia was making to win her freedom in Europe by getting men to go to the Front; but, if I may put it the other way, he was asking the people of this country not to compel those who were able to fight to leave these shores and fight for the freedom he said was in danger. </para>
                    <para>As I have already said, the Babel of tongues and the varying opinions held by the party opposite on this vital question of our country&#39;s safety made it difficult for any citizen who had considered well the perilous position we occupy to follow them. Having, therefore, no alternative, I am here to-day, and without any .apology, speaking in support of the Government, the members of whom are charged with breaking pledges and other political crimes. I say the stern necessities of the hour are such that every man should throw aside predilections for any particular party or personality, and give his adhesion to a National &#39;policy which will enable Australia to do her full share in this conflict. If we do not do this, the day will inevitably come when Australia will have to stand alone, stripped of every ,power, every national friendship, and without a single prospect of a friendly hand. In the light of the recent referendum vote, how can we expect help from the Allied countries, seeing that by our vote we have deliberately declared we are tired of the war? We have, indeed, arrived at this position : We are in the war just so long as men who are willing to fight will come forward; if they do not come forward, then we are out of the war. If Australia declares herself to be prematurely tired of the struggle, then, when the time comes that this country will be obliged to stand by itself, we cannot expect, by all the rules of the game, that other countries will rally to our assistance. Consideration of this future possibility prompted me to become a strong advocate of a &#34;Yes&#34; vote during the recent referendum campaign, . and&#39; from  the beginning ; so that, by facing our obligations now, we might, with all confidence, rely upon assistance when, in the future, either our policy or our geographical situation might involve us in entanglements with any other country. Unfortunately, Australia, by the recent vote, has almost cut herself off&#34; from all chance of assistance. We cannot have it both ways, and I remind honorable senators that a member of the French Chamber of Deputies said the other day that if Australia was to acquire possessions, she would surely have to pay. That was a most significant declaration, and one that should not be forgotten. So far as I can see, the position is anything &#39; but rosy. Some people may call the referendum vote a democratic victory. I regard it as a national calamity - nothing short of it - a calamity of such dimensions that Australians must hang their heads in shame whenever they come in contact with the representatives of those other nations with whom to-day we are standing side by side in this grim struggle. But a short time ago, we could hold our heads aloft and say to our Allies, &#34; We have done as well as you.&#34; But now, unfortunately, this country of ours is in a cruel position. But a short time ago, we were raised to the highest altitude of national pride by the exploits and heroic sacrifices of our men ; to-day we are in the depths of humiliation, not by anything which the Anzacs have done, but by something which the stay-at-homes have not done; by the attitude of the low-grade quality of manhood remaining here in safety; in safety, too, because our fighting manhood responded so nobly to the call. </para>
                    <para>I said just now that I had attached myself to the Ministerial party in preference to the Official Labour party. One would imagine, from the recent charges of pledge-breaking that honorable senators opposite were all George  Washingtons  men who had never told a lie, or otherwise disgraced or dishonoured themselves politically. But they may be judged by the papers that support them, and I am sorrowfully obliged to adopt this course. They talk about honour, and pledges, and high resolves; and by implication hurl charges against men who have been for long in the political and industrial firing line, and whose reputations are as stainless as theirs, if not more so. Honorable senators on this side, according to our opponents, have been guilty of pledge-breaking, acts of dishonour, and all forms of unworthy practices. I do not propose to say anything myself, but I will put members of the party opposite in the box, and allow them to be judged by their own official organs. I have by me a few extracts from Labour papers which will throw an interesting light on members of the party opposite; those men who are so jealous of honour, pledges, dignity, and good name. I intend to show how members of that party square their words with actions, and the test I am going to apply to show whether they have squared their public conduct with their professions in this Chamber, is furnished by their own press. I hope they will listen attentively. Time was when members of that party had some sense of honour, but the day has arrived when they have become devoid of that quality. This is what was said by the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> of 5th April, 1917: - </para>

                    <para class="block">This statement throws a flood of light upon the spirit sought to be created in the Official Labour party by its press organs, which exercise the greatest influence upon it. I do not speak of the Labour party as &#39; &#39; a party of dirt. &#39; &#39; One of its own papers has so described it. I am not calling it &#34; a party of poison,&#34; nor am I calling it &#34; a party of mud.&#34; Its own papers do that. I am simply repeating what those two newspapers, the <inline font-style="italic">Workers,</inline> printed in Sydney -and Brisbane, said should be done by members of the very party who to-day are holding their hands aloft and disclaiming any intention of  violating  their honour or of breaking their word. I shall leave the matter at that. If such a castigation is not severe enough, I do- not know what would satisfy my honorable friends. </para>
                    <para>In determining the collective mind of a party, it is very necessary to ascertain what is in the mind of the power that stands behind it. &#39;So far as the Nationalist party is concerned, there is no power intervening between  it  and those who returned it to this Parliament) there is uo power intervening between the Treasury bench and the people; there is no intermediary of any kind which directs, controls, or in any way influences our policy or actions, individually or collectively, from the time w&#171; ?,re elected until we again seek election. That, how- ever, cannot be said of the Official Labour party. The real source of power, so far as the Official Labour party is concerned, does not consist in the number of its members who attend here, but is centred in intermediary bodies over which the electors have no control, and to which honorable senators opposite must always be subject. I refer to those Labour executives which have expelled honorable senators from the Official Labour movement. I refer to those executives that have said to a number of honorable senators, behind the backs of the electors,  &#39; Your membership of this party ceases from this date.&#34; I was subjected to thats treatment, and so was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie. A number of members of the Senate were so dealt with by these interloping intermediary bodies. With them the opinion of the electors goes for nothing ; it is they alone who count. These executives constitute what is known as the &#34; junta.&#34; </para>

His  only&#39; sin in the eyes of that all-powerful body was -that he sought*, to give effect to the principle of the referendum - a principle so long embodied&#34; in the policy of the party that any man here could shut) his eyes and straightway put his finger on it in the printed platform. Because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes&#39;</inline> attempted to put&#39; into operation a deliberately chosen plank of the Labour platform he was expelled by this intermediate interloping body to which honorable senators opposite must bend the knee. </para>

                    <para>When seeking to locate the seat of the Labour party&#39;s energy we must look, as in all other cases, hot at what appears on the surface alone, but at the power behind. We must search for the seat of effort. The views expressed by honorable senators of the Official Labour party by no means always represent tile opinions of the power behind them. The noise and  duty  in which honorable senators opposite indulge in this chamber does not disclose the unseen power behind the Official Labour party to-day. If one of our great  grandfathers were to watch a  circular saw cutting through a log he might at first sight imagine that it was in the saw itself, spinning through the log, that the power responsible for the cutting rested. But if he inquired he would find that he was mistaken. He would find that he could substitute for it a saw made of any other metal, and that it would probably do the work just as well. If he went still further and examined the engine working the saw, he would find that that engine, made perhaps of cast iron, could be replaced by an engine, made of steel or any of the precious or baser metals, or even of brass, which would do the work just as well. He would learn that neither the saw, nor the engine, nor the belting, was indispensable to the cutting of the log. He would learn that each could be changed, without affecting the result. If he went back to the fluid steam itself, as it flowed from the boiler, he would discover that it could be dispensed with, and that it was in the energy stored up in the coal that the real power rested.. That is the one thing that could not be exchanged. It is constant, unvarying, and indispensable. He could even do away with the boiler and the steam pipes - he could combust the coal internally - and in that way secure another source of power. The latent power stored in the coal is the source of energy driving all the whirling wheels of industry, and responsible for the output of our factories to-day. And so, in order to discover the real power operating the Labour party, we have not to look at the speeches, presence, or organization of honorable senators belonging to that party nor at the actions of the electors supporting them. We. have rather to go back to the seat of power which has been established by a few men standing to-day between the Labour party and the electors who support them. There we find the true power operating the whole party. That is where the high command of Official Labour resides. Those members of the party who find their way into this Parliament know they dare not say a word likely to displease the Labour executives. To do so would be to put an end to their political existence. If they dared to disobey the dicta of these executives, which arrogate to themselves the right from time to time to define the policy of the party, it would be more than their political lives  were worth. </para>
                    <para>Having said so much by way of locating *\ the real power behind the Official Labour party, having shown that it is the Labour executives in the different States to&#39; which these honorable senators must be amenable if their political existence is not to end, I propose now to show what is the attitude of the Official Labour party&#39;s seat of power on the vital question of prosecuting the war. Members of the party hold varying opinions on the question. On the one hand we have men who, like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor,</inline> say, &#34; I consider that every fit and able man should be in the ranks &#34; ; on the other, there are members of the party who, if not in so many words, at least by their very silence show that they hold the opposite view. We find in the party men who say, &#34; I have never been guilty of going on a recruiting platform.&#34; These are the men of whom <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Tudor has said, &#34; We are as anxious to win the war as the so-called Win-the-war party.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- Had <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maughan</inline> been here earlier he would know that I said there were some odd exceptions to this attitude of hostility towards  recruiting. The honorable senator may have advocated recruiting outside - I accept his statement that he has - but I have not heard him do so in the Senate. I repeat that whilst certain members of the Official Labour party who, in my opinion, are in the minority, have taken a proper stand on the question of recruiting, an overwhelming number have either totally ignored the question or by their silence have shown their hostility to it. That is the point I wish to emphasize. When we are asked, therefore, to accept the statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Tudor that the Official Labour party is just as anxious to win the war as is the Nationalist party, I am entitled to show what has been done by the Labour executives - the men whom the Official Labour party must obey, and without whose approval <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Tudor could not retain the leadership of the party. The attitude of these Labour executives is  of two kinds. They are either against recruiting or against the war altogether. </para>

                            <para>- As a fact, they are. We must always keep in mind the fact that these Labour executives deal with the in embers of the Official Labour party with an iron hand. The members of the Official Labour party shiver with apprehension at every trifling political development. They have to be careful at all times to ascertain how the executives regard their actions. They always have their ears to the ground or to the wind, or to the keyhole of every Trades Hall in* Australia&#39; to find out how the executives view the latest political development in this &#39;Parliament. We know how much they are at the mercy of these Labour executives, which have knocked off the political, head of many an ardent worker in the Labour cause. Men who, right down the years, did all the heavy lifting, all the Clydesdale work of building up the movement, are to-day being dealt with by these executives in the most unjust way. They have been deprived of every status they enjoyed in the ranks of the party, and deprived of them mostly by new-comers in the Labour movement, who, never in their lives, sacrificed anything to advocate the cause that has suddenly lifted them to positions of opulence. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. These men who sat, in judgment on men like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Spence</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> have not done - to use a seafaring term - so much as a dog watch in the Labour movement. Yet they have been endowed with extraordinary power. They were endowed with the power to sacrifice those grand old battlers who created the very movement which they have now entered, cuckoo-like, to enjoy the very best that it offers. Some of the old veterans of the Labour movement expelled by these executives had, in the old days, been on a decent &#34;spree &#34; or drunk for a longer period than those who sat in judgment on thb ... have been m lae <inline font-style="italic">* ......</inline> agreement altogether. These, then, are the men who sit in judgment on veterans of the Labour movement who have  given  of their best to it; who denied themselves all the advantages and comforts of home life, who have gone into debt, or kept themselves dog poor, and went up and down the country in their unceasing efforts to advance and promote their one object of raising their fellow-workers to a higher s&#39;ocial level. The Labour executives, and their component parts, throughout the country have shown themselves antagonistic to recruiting, or antagonistic to the war, or both. When, therefore, we hear members of the party declaring that they are as anxious to win the war as we are, we have to liberally discount their utterances and ask them, &#34; What do your bosses say - what do the men say who sit in the seats of the mighty, and who are prepared to eject you the moment you offend?&#34; </para>

                            <para>- We cannot carry on the war without men, and we cannot get men under our present obsolete system without a continuous, industrious, and systematic policy of recruiting, involving the expenditure of a great deal of personal effort, time and money. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maughan</inline> apparently approves of that sentiment, and agrees that we cannot get recruits without the expenditure of much effort. That being so, I remind the honorable senator that when the Brisbane Labour executive was asked, in the early part of last year, to co-operate with the State. Recruiting Committee, they sent a reply to the military authorities refusing to take any share. The reasons given were but a repetition of some we have heard here and on the Yarra bank; and from that day to this, so far as I am aware, that Labour executive of Queensland has never been associated -with any recruiting effort. </para>

                            <para>- It is quite plain from the records that&#39; the circumstances were as I have stated. The reply given by the Labour bodies appeared in a July issue of the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Standard,</inline> and it is clearly set out that, when they are asked to co-operate, they refused to do so on various grounds, the principal one being that the industries of this country would suffer if the recruiting effort was carried much further - that we could not afford to lose more men. From that time to this the Executive of Queensland has kept rigidly apart from any effort to put their chosen policy of recruiting into effect. Now, that is not playing the game. We have Labour executives and the power behind them, saying what has been said elsewhere over and over again, that the voluntary system has not failed. On every platform they have declared that the voluntary system is their policy and their political faith by which they are prepared to stand or fall. And yet, when they are asked to put one foot before another, and co-operate in order to make that policy a success, they refuse to do so. They cannot have it both ways. The best proof of a man&#39;s faith is when he makes some sacrifice to put that faith to the proof. That is what the Labour men in the early days did, when they were prepared to risk much for the principles they advocated. There were also the Socialists of those days - and all praise to those men who then tried to make Socialism the success it partially proved - who gave much to advance their cause. There are now men amongst us who, down the years, have pub the faith in them to the proof, and made many sacrifices in order to bring about the accomplishment of their ideals. When the Official Labour party says, &#34; Voluntarism is our 1 ism &#39; - our policy,&#34; I ask, &#34;What have you done to make it a success?&#34; The answer comes back in cold print, in every journal of every State, that they have, with foul deliberation, done nothing, and, perhaps,  in isolated cases, have done something to prevent it being a success. </para>

This shows that Victoria had fallen into line with Queensland and New South Wales in rigidly withholding support from their own chosen policy of voluntarism. In South Australia, as honorable senators from that State know, when similar proposals were made to the Labour bodies, , they were turned down unanimously. </para>

In Western Australia, before that State became infected with virus from this side of the continent, there was a healthy Labour movement in step and in tune with every Labour body in every Allied country in the world except the so-called Labour bodies in Australia. We held a congress, and by an overwhelming majority arrived at a decision that if the Federal Government, which was then the Hughes Government, said there should be conscription, we in Western Australia would say, &#34; ditto,&#34; and that if the Government advocated any other policy we would follow them. That was when Labour was in a healthy state, before it was inoculated with the poison of those so-called Labourites who visited Western Australia and got it to swing out of the high and righteous course. Since then, another congress has been held, of which the following is an account: - </para>

                    <para class="block">The effect of that amendment is that the Labour party in Western Australia, as represented by that latter-day congress, by fifty -four votes to ten, passed a resolution that the war was not to be pressed to a victorious end. Labour in Western Australia had sunk so low as to arrive at a decision by an overwhelming majority that the war was to be stopped. But those who supported that decision got their deserts later on. They put their men in the field, and challenged the position throughout the State. We met them face to face; and the result was that they did not get a single man returned - and no wonder. This was because they had arrived at a decision, either to stop the war or not to push it to a victorious end - we can take our choice. If we are not to press the war to a victorious end, why should we send another man or fire another shot? Why waste the lives of the men who have already gone? We had war manifestos from&#39; the Labour party, and we heard <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher&#39;s</inline> word about the &#34; last man and the last shilling &#34; - we had a united Labour party saying that nothing but the fullest possible effort would be of any use - and, in spite of all, the party, as now constituted, attempts to misrepresent the great and worthy Labour movement. Of the Labour party I am a member still and will be as long as I live. It has now, however, been brought to the low level of telling the men at the Front that they are to be left to perish and rot - that they are to. receive no more support - because it does not wish to continue its efforts a single day. No. It is not the Labour party which is doing that. It is being done by those men who have arrogated to themselves the right to speak on behalf of Labour - who have put words into Labour&#39;s mouth which, for the first time, have made Labour&#39;s voice ring hollow. These men went before the Democracy, with the result that, in the case of the State election in Western Australia, their numbers were reduced to zero, while they did not succeed in returning a single man to the Federal Parliament. The last quotation I shall make as having a bearing upon what those who constitute the real power in the Labour movement mean in reference to the war is from the peace resolution passed by the Political Labour Conference in Sydney, and referred to in another place. After the preamble the resolution continues - </para>
                    <para>We  are of opinion that a complete military victory  by  the Allies over the Central European Powers, if possible, can only  be  accomplished  by  the further sacrifice of millions of human lives; the infliction of incalculable misery and suffering upon the survivors; the creation of an intolerable burden of debt to the further impoverishment of the workers who must bear such burdens, and the practical destruction of civilization among the white races of the world. </para>
                    <para>We,  therefore, urge that immediate negotiations be initiated for an International Conference, for the purpose of arranging equitable terms of peace, on which Conference the working class organizations shall have adequate representation, and the inclusion of women delegates, and we further urge that the British self-governing Dominions, and Ireland, shall be granted separate representation thereon. </para>
                    <para>Now comes the essence of the whole resolution - </para>
                    <para>That prior to the disbandment of the combatant armies and the merchant navies employed in the war, they shall be utilized by an organized system of volunteer service for restoring the devastated territories at the expense of the invading powers, which shall also compensate the widows and dependants of all non-combatants, including seamen, who have lost their lives as a result of hostilities. I raise my hat to the Sydney Conference because of the latter part of the resolution, but I do not admire their intelligence when they propose to negotiate with a Power which has scouted every advance made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George and  President  Wilson, to hold out the olive branch to Germany, which is still strong in the saddle, and to ask for things which cannot be got until the long, sinuous, and thorny path to victory has been trodden, and until we are sure of beating and crushing to the earth that Power which has destroyed for the time being the peace and security of the world. If they stand fast by that resolution we must still fight on. Compare that resolution with what has been done in the Western State. While the Labour organizations through their blind leaders, the executives, hold aloof from finding a single soldier; while they as a corporate body put forth no endeavour to make a success of the system in which they profess to believe, we must unmask their make-believe - I must call it blaring, blazing hypocrisy. If I believe in voluntarism, as I believe in my religion and in the Labour movement,. I must do something to make that religion, or that movement, a success. But the men who say that voluntarism is their policy have allowed others who have no faith in that system, who know that it is unjust and unsound, to go about the country wasting their substance in advocating it, while the real sponsors of voluntarism remain at home doing nothing but reviling us. That attitude cannot be allowed to continue. Fair play is bonny play, and the party which will not play the game will sooner or later be stripped of its mask, and exposed in its ugly, natural self. If those men were to come out into the open and state candidly that they were against recruiting, I should respect them. But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor</inline> has stated his belief that every fit and able man should be in the Army. We cannot get men into the Army unless we resort to recruiting expedients, miserable though some of them may be, but when we ask the anti-conscriptionists to share in the common endeavour to get recruits, they recoil within themselves, keep to their rooms in the Trades Hall, and throw upon men who do not believe in the voluntary system the responsibility of making it produce results. The time is coming when we shall have a clearing up of all these matters. </para>
                    <para>I am not here to indulge in idle words, I said at the outset of. my remarks that I would &#39; speak plainly, and I ask again why the members of the Official Labour party have not stood to their  guns  and put to the test the faith that is in them by using every power at their command to make a success of their own cherished policy for getting reinforcements. Upon them rests the responsibility for the failure or triumph of voluntarism, and I verily believe that had they only shown a moderate energy and desire to bring their own policy to fruition, we should not have the difficulty that confronts us to-day. It is for that reason I have taken the opportunity to-day of pointing out the wide and impassable gulf that divides the Labour party from the National party, having regard to what we have done to make the voluntary enlistment policy fruitful, and what our opponents have neglected to do in that regard. </para>

                    <para>I referred incidentally to that extraordinary development in the political life&#39; of this country - the tyranny that has been exercised ever since the war began over men whose only crime in life is that they claim to exercise their judgment and follow the dictates of their conscience. I do not know for what a tongue is given to me if it be not to enable me to express my thoughts. It is quite true that Gladstone said that language was given to some men in order that they might conceal their thoughts; but it seems to me, when I look about this chamber and recall what has been said outside by false advocates of the voluntary system, that language has been given to other men to enable them to falsify their thoughts. For what is conscience given to a man? To be locked up and stifled by any political power? Not at all. The very essence of Democracy is freedom of thought ; the reverse of freedom is Autocracy, Tyranny. </para>
                    <para>We have heard much said about the tyrannical and dictatorial methods of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes.</inline> The men who hurl those charges are practising the blackest arts of tyranny that were ever conceived.. I, personally, have suffered because I stood for putting to the proof the Labour policy of conscription. Honorable senators opposite draw a fine distinction between compulsion for service overseas and compulsion for service within Australia. That is only a subterfuge. If I may again remind honorable senators who were absent, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin,</inline> who went from Victoria to edit the Kalgoorlie <inline font-style="italic">Worker,</inline> told the people of the gold-fields that the freedom of Australia is being fought for in Europe. The very fact of our having 300,000 Australian soldiers in Europe proves that contention; otherwise, why are they in Europe? That being so, when the freedom of the country is trembling like an aspen leaf, does it matter whether the attack is made on Australian shores or in Europe? In either case, the consequence, if the attack succeeds, must be the same. If a man is to be the victim of a murderous attack, is there any essential difference between his assailant climbing over his fence and  doing  him to death at rInSe  quarters  -&#34;nd standing off at 1,000 yards and killing his victim with a bullet? </para>

In fact, until recently we lived in a fools&#39; paradise; we believed that nothing could happen, and that we were safe under the guardianship of the British Navy. Thus questions of national defence were always subordinated to those more immediate social and industrial problems that always crowded the agenda-paper of the Labour Conferences. </para>

                            <para>- I will not quibble over that. But it is quite plain to any person who is acquainted with even the rudiments of history that a country&#39;s freedom is more often fought for outside its own boundaries than within them. We cannot deny that the freedom of Australia is very intimately bound up with the success of the Allies. That fact confronts me at every angle from which I regard the situation. Therefore, I again ask why we are haggling over the manner in which we shall preserve our own freedom, and by our internecine strife placing Australia in an ignominious position in the eyes of the world? </para>

                    <para>The Leader of the Opposition said that there were barely 60,000 eligible men left in Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> reduced that number to 45,000. But it is quite clear that those eligibles,  whatever their number may be, are receiving more sympathy, support, and commiseration from the men of the Official Labour party than the men who have boldly gone forward and bled for their country. Why do honorable members opposite throw the mantle of their protection over the 45,000 or 60,000  eligibles  who remain in Australia, and utterly neglect the other 300,000 men who are abroad, and who day after day are forced back to the firing line white they are still unfit? </para>

                            <para>- Why men do not adjust their attitude to altered circumstances is a puzzle to me. They stand rigidly by a time-worn shibboleth, and by their adhesion to it place this country in a most ignominious light in the eyes of our Allies. The eyes of France are upon us, and we cannot ignore the significance of the silence of the British press and the comment of the Canadian press on the result of the referendum. , I deplore the fact that some men cannot get outside themselves or away from the prejudices of their great grandfathers. The Labour party decided that men should be conscripted for the defence of Australia, and a leading exponent of the Labour movement on the Western Australian gold-fields has said that the fight for Australian liberty is being fought in Europe. Still we have the old delusion that we can best preserve the liberty of this country by adhering to the motheaten shibboleth of voluntarism. </para>

                    <para>As I said earlier, I will speak as plainly as my time will allow, and adhere to the language of truth all the time. To those men who call <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> a tyrant and a czar, and apply other choice names to him, I say that by their actions and by the actions of the party with which they are associated, they, themselves, every day in the week practise a tyranny deplorable in the extreme and compared with which his attempts to deal with the censorship and other instruments of government pale into insignificance. If one dares to advocate conscription the cry is, &#34;Down and out with him.&#34; He is branded for ever; he is anathema; he is ostracised. That is the freedom they give. In Queensland, when a member of the State Parliament, an honest man, was asked by an honorable senator of this Parliament why he was on the anti-conscriptionist side, he said, &#34; Do you know that I have lost my blithering, blighted manhood?&#34;&#39; That is how the Official Labour party&#39;s policy has worked out - making1 a man of manly parts acknowledge that under the operation of tyranny practised by the party, he, for the sake of winning bread, had lost his &#34;blithering, blighted manhood&#34;; that is the effect of the tyranny exercised by those who heaped taunts on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes.</inline> Are they not ashamed of themselves? In the other Chamber, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anstey,</inline> speaking of the Labour party, said, &#34;This party has no argument against conscription.&#34; Yet he went out and argued against it. Other honorable gentlemen of the Official Labour party who could not get the Government to enact conscription fast enough1 for them afterwards went out also to fight and argue against it. What did they do when they got their orders from the Trades Hall, from that interloping body to whose words they listen with ears bent to to the keyhole straining to catch ;very s syllable? They quickly found that it was more than their political life was worth to say &#34;No.&#34; </para>
                    <para>In Western Australia, there are men who were at one time in their careers strong enough to respond to the call of conscience, and had stood on the platform and advocated conscription, prominent men in the Labour party - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Angwin, Mr. Drew, Mr. Holman,</inline> and others. What did they do when the edict went forth, when the Western party became inoculated with the virus from the Eastern party, that decrepit body which was out of step with every other Labour party throughout the world? Tyranny happens on the scene and these men dared not open their mouths, dared not breathe heavily, dared not even sneeze because, if they did, it would be more than their miserable political lives were worth. That is the manner in which these exponents and champions of &#34; freedom &#34; dispose of those who dare to differ from them . I know very well that some of these men had regard for their positions in Parliament. Their situation is so desperate that if they lose their seats in Parliament they feel they might as well cut their throats. Therefore, they are stifling their consciences in order to keep their places. They are not like us. We are free. That is the difference between &#34; East and West,&#34; between the right and the left, between the Labour party that was tolerant, and indulgent, and ready to concede to every man the right of conscience, and the Labour party of to-day which denies the right of any man to be master of his own mind. Those men who taunt <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> with1 being a tyrant stand fast to their own form of tyranny, and there they are still, bringing a glorious movement down to the mud by virtue of a  policy which every day is getting its quietus at the hands of the people. When I think of those men who are not allowed to open their mouths, I atm reminded of the words of Tacitus of old,&#39; when he described an unworthy Roman by saying, &#39; &#39; He earned his bread by crime.&#34; &#39;When I say that these men live by lying I am not far wrong. The frank but unfortunate man in Queensland admitted that he had lost his manhood. Could not his case be multiplied manifold owing to the reign of terror that prevails? Others dare -not speak. What has become of manhood, independence, and conscience in this country ? To what a state has this unspeakable form of Democracy, otherwise known as the Official Labour party, brought things. &#34; Speak, and out you go.&#34; That is how independence is treated. Thank God, we have some who were manly enough to say, &#34; Go and get work, the lot of you.&#34; Already many have gone looking for work, and if we had another election a lot more would be out with axes looking for jobs. </para>

                    <para>Here is. another illustration of what has been done, but it is  a. very old story, as old as the hills, as old as history itself - the story <inline font-style="italic">of&#39;</inline> the mam who is &#34; downed.&#34; For more than twenty-five years I have known Mr: Hughes, the man whose matchless brain has been at the disposal of every person in the Official&#39; Labour party, and in large way by virtue of whose indefatigable efforts the Labour movement from the moment he entered it, putting all his heart into it, has been lifted from a lowly position to one in which it has become a dominant political factor in this country. Mainly by his efforts has this been brought about, yet now he is &#34; out,&#34; hounded, and &#34; down.&#34; But he merely suffers what men of his type all over the world have suffered before. I knew him, as I say, twenty-five years ago, when he went about with boots broken, and clothes thread-bare, and when he suffered all the pangs of hunger that come to a man in desperate straits. He was able and fit to earn- his livelihood:; he had the talents - no one can deny him those - and had he offered them to the highest bidder, as some of his wretched critics and  revilers  would have done, he would not have been in dependent circumstances all those years. But he would not do that. He chose to hang to. the cause he had espoused and the cause he loved, and the proof of his sincerity to that cause was to be found in the sacrifices that he freely made during, a quarter of a century. But now he is &#34; down and out&#34; and anathematized. Not a fault was found with him until less than two years ago. And what- is that fault ? What is his crime ? What is the head and front of his offending ? Only that he has put to the test of operation a leading plank in the platform of the Labour party - the referendum. That and that alone is his offence. And those men who have sheltered under his wing and made progress under his able and guiding leadership - because when he was in the Labour party he was no cypher in shaping its destiny ; often was the party, pulled out of a hole by the intellectual power that he brought to bear upon the task - because he has dared to say that this country was rooking on its foundation, and that he would put his country before his party, as every labourite the world over has done, and is doing, except . here, the cry goes up from these1 unutterably contemptible, small-minded men), &#34; Out with you ; you are- a traitor, a-  twister, a renegade,&#34; and all the rest of the  cata-logue  of epithets. Do they cai! it fair play? Never will I subscribe to a- form of bastard&#39; Democracy which would dare* to &#34; down &#34; a, man whose great sacrifices&#39; in Labour&#39;s cause have been so strongly exemplified during- the- last twenty-five years, and if others seek to do it they will only do it over my body - political and physical. I stand up for this man. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> stood up in the very spot where he is now sitting, while yet. he was a friend of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> and recognised that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was wrongly done by; and- he used a word which did not find its way into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I can best express it in this way: An owner of a dog was too kind to kill it. He had no food to give to it, and no one would take it from him. Some one asked what its pedigree was. His reply was that it was  gratuitously  assorted. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> referred to the critics of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> as &#34; gratuitously assorted samples&#39; of society,&#34; otherwise mongrels. Where is that senator now that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> is condemned, ds &#34; down and out,&#34; and branded with the red-hot brand of the derision of the so-called Labour party? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long,</inline> who was loud in his championship of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> is now as mild as mother&#39;s milk, and dare not&#39; breathe heavily, or sneeze, for fear h&#171; will have to &#34;get out&#34; the same as the rest. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> is &#34; on deck&#34; to-day, and that is the trouble of our friends opposite. He has been subjected to abuse, but that is one of the leading marks and characteristics of an able man. In human affairs we always find that when a man is severely abused, there is something behind it. There is always some one afraid of him. Those who abuse a man are afraid of his strength. We never see abuse heaped on a cypher. A cypher does not count for anything, not even for the amount of thought that might be expended in estimating its worth. The man of merit, the man who has made progress on the uphill road of advance in the Democratic or Labour field, who has made a number 10 mark on the sands of Time as a champion of his fellows, is the man invariably in every age and clime who has had the same barking critics at his heels that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> has had. This has been the case right through the ages. Of the Gracchi brothers, whose names are held in grateful memory by every land reformer of the centuries, one fell to the dagger and the other had to flee for his life from the fury of the Roman mob. Belisarius, who relieved Rome from the vandals under Totila,  had t&#176; search for food among the pariah dogs at the gate of Rome when he returned to the Eternal City. Danton, that towering figure who brought the French Revolution to a head, was turned on by the mob, and went to his death under the signature of Robespierre, another man who, in order to save his skin, met a fate which he deserved; because then it was a case of the Revolution being carried over the rightful point where it should be stopped. He met the fate that meets all men who stand to save themselves at the expense of their compeers. </para>

                    <para class="block">When Danton went to his death, he said, &#34;It is better to be a fisherman than to meddle in the art of governing men.&#34; What was Washington&#39;s reward? While the struggle against England was yet confined to the political arena in the Thirteen Colonies, &#39; he was bitterly assailed in the same way. A clergyman named  Ordell,  a poet of standing, called him a perjurer and a liar, which shows the temper of the time, and what a man of stainless honour had to suffer for the cause he had at heart at the hands of small-minded, petty, scornful creatures. Take the case of my own native country, Ireland. We know that Henry Grattan was tackled by the mob in the streets of Dublin, and that they made the blood of the Irish patriot flow. With Parnell the same story was repeated. Above all, let us consider the way in which Lincoln was treated . Let honorable senators remember that historic figure, and what he had to suffer. He had to bear in his time, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> has had to bear to-day, the cruel taunts and scorn of factionists  and midget-minded men whose types are now represented in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Lincoln&#39;s character in history is unassailable.- He is now regarded as the &#34; Great Liberator,&#34; &#34; The Emancipator,&#34; and by the &#39;coloured population of the United States of America, as the &#34;second Messiah.&#34; When the dark clouds of adversity had gathered, and the tenacity, courage, and mettle of men were tested, Lincoln found himself assailed by the small men, who applied to him every kind of opprobrious epithet. He was denounced by the peace-at-any-price party. We have the same party in Australia today - the men who talk of their country- but will not fight for it, even at a time when, as at present, we are being hurried into the danger zone and will get there unless we stand fast, shoulder our burden, and make the influence of Australia felt in the war. Lincoln had to suffer the taunts and opposition of these people, and also of&#39; the &#34; Copper-heads,&#34; who were so called because they were secret, scheming, designing enemies who were within the ranks of the Federalists, but whose sympathies were entirely with the Southern States Confederation. They were called &#34; Copperheads &#34; because of the close resemblance it was felt that they bore to a species of American serpent, that prefers the dark, and carries a sting in its tail as well as in its fangs. These people were a source of trouble to the great Abraham Lincoln. </para>

He is at present editor of the Western Australian <inline font-style="italic">Worker.</inline> It was quite unnecessary for such a man to go to Western Australia to tell the workers there that the liberty of this country was being fought for in Europe. He came from a State in which there is no enlightenment, whilst  Western Australia is to-day the only enlightened quarter of the continent. In that State he learned the truth for the first time. It was further unnecessary for him to make such a statement, because the very fact that over 300,000 of the flower of the manhood of Australia are in Europe to-day should be sufficient to satisfy the dullest imagination that our liberties are at stake, and are being fought for in Europe, otherwise why should those men be there. </para>

                    <para>Turning again to the experience of Lincoln, from his various &#34;Lives,&#34; we learn he was called a &#34; blood-thirsty despot,&#34; which sounds like an echo of the accusation against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes.</inline> He was also called &#34; King Abraham the First,&#34; a &#34;usurping tyrant,&#34; &#38;c. When the draft was finally approved by Lincoln, and put into operation, the officials got into serious trouble in New York, bub this true Democrat was not afraid to use the strong hand of force to maintain the true principles of Democracy, with the result that the Union was preserved, slavery was wiped out, and. the man who was called a &#34; blood-thirsty despot&#34; and a &#34;tyrant&#34; is idolized to-day as the champion of Democracy and liberty throughout the world. So the time will come when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> who is to-day denounced as a &#34; tyrant,&#34; a &#34; despot,&#34; and a &#34; czar,&#34; &#38;c, by these small-minded insects, will be referred to in terms of praise as was the great Lincoln, &#34;The Liberator,&#34; and the man whom the negroes call the &#34; second Messiah.&#34; The members of the party opposite cannot keep <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> down. I am reminded , by their puny efforts of the explanation given by the cannibal chief during a feast on a great scientist and explorer, and the sickness he experienced in the middle of it.  His  explanation was, &#39; You can&#39;t keep a good man down.&#39;.&#39; If ever an attempt at political cannibalism was perpetrated on this continent, it was when a number of political cannibals organized to make a feast of their former friend and champion, William Morris Hughes. The feast, however, did not come off. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> is still &#34; on deck,&#34; and- will foe &#34;on deck&#34; when these insects have had the insect powder scattered over them at the elections, and will have become a decayed and harmless organism of the past. Bead Brown- ing&#39;s  &#34;Songs of a Patriot,&#34; and you will find an exact reproduction of conditions obtaining here. These people were loud in their praise of all that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> had done for the Labour movement during twenty-five years, but now, because he has said that to-day, when there is danger lest she should be robbed of her liberty, he puts his country first, they cast him aside and they call out for &#39;Barabbas, as did the mob of old. The mob to-day are crying for blood and for Barabbas, and they are dishonouring the name of Labour. What have these men who to-day talk of Labour ever done for Labour? As 1 have already said, some of the pioneers of the Labour movement have been longer drunk than some of these people have been in the movement altogether. A glorious movement has been brought to ruin by the men now in charge, of its destinies, and who are dishonouring and disgracing the name of Labour because they do not know even the rudiments of Democracy and liberty. These men have been lifted high on the shoulders of men who devoted their lives and energies to the movement, and they look to enjoy the fruits of the labours of its pioneers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> who is deservedly called the Samuel Plimsoll of Australia, and whom I knew twenty-six years ago in the Labour movement, is the man who is responsible for civilizing the conditions of the seamen on our coast, but this man&#39;s head has been lopped off and thrown into&#34; the sawdust basket in the Trades Hall at Adelaide. When I was earning my living at sea I watched the honorable senator&#39;s labours on behalf, of the seamen, and saw him struggling to the top of the movement, but those now controlling it have sat in judgment upon this benefactor of the seamen. This is the work of these cuckoos who never made a <inline font-style="italic">nest or laid an egg in their</inline> lives. What about grand old man Spence ? One  has only  to look into his countenance to recognise the nobility of his character. I have seen that man fighting for the liberty of the workers when some of the men who are denouncing him to-day were in short clothes - I was going to say before they shed their swaddling drapery, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Spence</inline> was fighting for Labour when some of these men had not reached the adolescent stage. I saw this man fighting for Labour twenty-six years ago, but his head is also in the- sawdust at the Trades Hall in Sydney. The same may be said of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes, Mr. Christian</inline> Watson, and of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, who also suffered for the Labour movement before it was known to many of the gentlemen whom I have referred to as the Johnny-come-latelies,  who look to enjoy the fruits of the labours and sacrifices of the pioneers of the movement. Do honorable senators call this fair play? Never! Thank God there is still in this country some regard for fair play, and some determination to see that no injustice is done, and sooner or later the people will turn and rend these upstarts and demagogues who have brought a great movement down. I am reminded by what has taken place of a quotation from Aristotle, which goes to show how demagogues have in all ages been the instruments that have wrecked glorious causes, including Democracy itself. The representatives of Labour on this side have ever sought the advancement of the majority of the people. We do not tout for votes. We have never crawled in our life time. </para>

                            <para>- One cannot repeat a good thing too .often, and I said at the start that plain speaking between people is the way to a better understanding. I never knew of two people strange to each other who were brought together without the necessary prelude of plain speaking. That is the way in which hearts are brought together that were at one time sundered. That is-why I am trying to make honorable senators opposite realize the position which they should occupy as the mouthpieces of a great movement which, in spite of anything they may do, is destined to succeed. When the war is over we can take up the special requirements of Labour. Honorable senators opposite should try to understand that the Germans neither know nor care whether we are Liberal or Labour; all that Germany wants is to secure possession of this country. The trouble is that honorable senators opposite do not recognise this. I suppose it is really not their fault. If the stuff is not in their heads it is impossible to get it into them, even with a hypodermic syringe. The present unfortunate split in the Labour movement is due, to put it in plain language, to a combination of cowardice and stupidity. It is, to put it in another way, the result of great mental vacuity and the absence of bravery. I do not stoop to the language of the <inline font-style="italic">Worker.</inline> But we know that the <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> advised our friends opposite to use mud and dirt on all&#39; occasions. Justice can only be secured, they say, by a continuous resort to Billingsgate. What) a sad inversion of all morality and philosophy! I would not think of saying such a thing, but the editors, who are supported by honorable senators opposite, are saying . it, and have advised them to put a daub of mud on their standard, and march under that. That is what the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> and the Queensland <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> have advised the so-called Official Labour party to do. </para>

                    <para>The unfortunate position in which Labour is at present placed has been brought about by the fact that men charged with the destinies of the movement had not the courage to tell of the things they saw. Those men being unable to see the danger to their country could not be blamed for it. One cannot blame the sea captain who- has no power to see the danger through the mist, or to divine the shoals threatening his ship if they are uncharted; but the man who sees the danger ahead of his nation and has not the pluck to warn the nation <inline font-style="italic">bf iti,</inline> is fit only for unutterable contempt and acorn. The man who is so intellectually barren that he cannot see the danger has my sympathy; but the man who sees the danger and has the courage to say so. even to- risk the loss of his seat in Parliament for telling the people so, is the man that is the salt of the human race to-day. He is the man who says, &#34; Hang the  consequences  ; there is the danger as I see it. Make the best of me for ill or well.&#34; On this side are to be found the men who- saw the danger and had the courage to tell the people what they saw; but on the other we find the men who saw the danger, but, cowards in their hearts as they are, and anxious to- hold their seats in Parliament, and to earn their bread by lying, as some of them have shown by their actions, had not the pluck to tell the people. The man who says, &#34; There is no argument against conscription,&#34; and then goes out to argue against it, must be earning his bread by lying. I can understand the frame of mind of that man in the northern State who said he had lost his manhood - peace to his ashes, for he has gone. There is a man in this chamber who said to him, &#34; Why are you now against conscription <inline font-style="italic">V</inline> And, to show tlx* depths of degradation&#39; that politics have reached in this co&#62;untry,. making men stifle conscience, which is one of God&#39;s  choicest  gifts, he replied, &#34;I am advocating anti-conscription now. I have lost my blighted, blithering manhood.&#34; There are many others who could say the same thing. For the sake of saving their seats they strangled their conscience. We do not care if we lose 100 seats. We are here for what we are worth, and have never crawled to the electors. The man or woman that I have crawled to, or have ever asked for a vote, is yet to be born. I have ploughed a lonely furrow for long, and am glad to see so many trusted comrades come across to join that party that puts country first, and to help to steer our country through the troubled waters in which it finds itself for the first time. </para>
                    <para>Of course, there are no demagogues in this country! A demagogue is a factious leader who will put the interests of a faction before everything else. Aristotle, one of the master-minds of the early days of the world, wrote thus about the ruin of Democracies1 - </para>

                        <para>The insolence of demagogues- is generally the cause of the ruin of Democracies. Sometimes they raise the upper and middle classes against them by seizing on private property, or the public revenue, and dividing the proceeds in various forms of. bribery and corruption. Sometimes they attack the rich by process of law, that they may have their property to apply to the support of their Government. Now, since oratory has been so much cultivated, men who are able speakers are the great demagogues. </para>
                        <para>The great instrument by which they accomplish their ends is the. confidence of the people, and thus they win by the hatred they display against the rich. Changes occur also from the old form of Democracy to one still more democratic, in which no- qualification is required either from electors or elected. In such cases demagogues, aiming at power through flattery of the people, bring matters to the pass that the populace become masters of the laws&#39;, and govern as they please., </para>

                    <para class="block">That last sentence brings me to the necessity of emphasizing my earlier remark, that the very men who to-day are prating loudly about Labour and Democracy always, when wooing the electors, lay great stress on their rights, but say not a word about their duties and responsibilities. They insist on the people&#39;s rights, with a big R, but at the same time they falter, and fag, and fail to impress upon the people, &#34; duty, duty, and responsibility.&#34; I have told the electors, and have even told my colleagues at different times, that if men got a fair day&#39;s wage, and did not give a fair day&#39;s work in return for it, they were the enemies of the Labour party. I could never get a man to re-echo that on this side of the continent; but the leading men in the Labour party in the West told it to the people as I did, which is the reason why we in the West are, in a political and national sense, so sturdy, and hefty, and wholesome.. The public leaders over there were men who stood in independent relationship to the electors. They did not debase themselves, and say, &#34; Your rights are everything,&#34; but they told them, &#34;You have duties and responsibilities as well as rights.&#34; Aristotle wrote what I have quoted long before the birth of Christ, for he was born in 384 b.c., and died in 322 b.c. ; but right down through the ages we can read the history of Democracies.

We shall be a lonely island here if we do not look well to it. The portents are already appearing on the political horizon, and our lot will be miserable indeed if we do not make good that national calamity that lately occurred as the result of the &#34; No &#34; majority. There is the writing on the wall already in the statement made in the French Chamber of Deputies, showing how France will regard our claim to retain the German colonies&#39; in the Pacific, for it was well said there, &#34; He who acquires must pay.&#34; That means that France will give no helping hand to us in any of our political or national enterprises here. What can we expect from the United States of America? I have been reading the journals that have come to hand from that country to see if there was any truth in the statements1 made by the anti-conscriptionists here, that martial law had been proclaimed in the Western States of America, which were in rebellion. I have gone through the list of those States, and find from <inline font-style="italic">The World&#39;s Work</inline> that the men who registered there represented over 100 per cent. of the maximum registration expected in those Western States. That statement, therefore, was another of the many unworthy utterances resorted to during the campaign to delude the people into voting &#34;No.&#34; It appears that the United States authorities worked upon a registration of 10,000,000 men, and in those central States the number registered was in excess of the estimate. Do honorable senators think that America will conscript her free citizens to fight Australia&#39;s battles without reflecting upon our latest policy of inaction? When we get into trouble over the White Australia policy, or over any other legislation involving international interests, we can expect no assistance from that country, for we have not laid up a stock of friendship by our actions. America will refuse to help us, and rightly so. If I were a Britisher I would say, &#34; I will measure my friendship for Australia by the efforts1 Australia has made to help me when I was fighting for my national life.&#34; </para>

He&#39; is honest in his convictions, because he does not believe in the war, and thinks this country can stand alone and fight its own battles. But I ask him does he remember how we invited the American Fleet here, and expended &#163;100,000 in feting it and extending international courtesies to it? What was in the mind of the rulers of Australia when they extended that invitation and expended that money? Was it all for fun? Was it for an idle purpose? </para>

                            <para>- It is deplorable that the name of  His Excellency  &#34;the Governor-General has been dragged into this controversy by honorable senators opposite. Although on previous occasions the clash of parties has been violent, and there has been perhaps even more excuse for heated talk, both branches of the Legi&#39;sla&#39; are have, to their honour, hitherto abstained from unjustifiable references &#34;to that high official. I am sorry for much that has been said during this debate by members  of the Labour party regarding the actions of  His  Excellency; but such criticism as I complain of is completely answered by the avowal of a member of the party, the honorable member for Batman&#39; <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline> Brennan).  that he believes that the Governor-General has discharged his duties in accordance with the highest traditions of his office. </para>

                    <para>A remark was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> with which T would deal at greater length if the honorable senator were now in his place, but I cannot, in any case, allow it to pass without notice. The frankness of the honorable senator has always commended itself to me. He has left no doubt as to his attitude towards .recruiting. Unlike many other honorable senators of his party, he has not traded upon a false profession in regard to it, but has declared that he would never stand on a recruiting platform nor ask a man to go to the Front. But he has gone further, and has declared that this country is in no danger from foreign foe, and that, if it were menaced, it could defend itself against an enemy. T do not  know the facts on which the honorable senator base? so extraordinary a belief. It must be remembered that, including New Guinea and the adjacent islands, which, from the defence point of view, are as important as the mainland, the Commonwealth has a coastline of something like 12 000 miles to defend. If we were left to our own  resources.  we could not afford to leave a mile of that coastline undefended, because, bv doing so, we should create a gap through which an enemy could enter to take cover, or which it contd use as a  gateway  for the invasion of the country. Now. 12.000 miles i&#171; a very big distance, and its defence would be no mean task for a very strong nation, letting alone the small nation that we are in point of population : it is a distance nearly as great as that from Australia to the Old  Country. If  you were to measure from the north of Norway along the west coast of Europe through the  Mediterranean,  down the Red Sea across the southern coast of Asia tn Calcutta, and then well on towards Australia, you would not. in all that distance, cover more than 12 000 miles. I ask how would it b* possible for us to defend such a length of coastline without the help of the British Navy? It is a grotesquely impossible task. In the event of a drawn battle,  or  a partial victory for the enemy, the British Navy wo71 d have to be kept in the North Sea for the protection of the Hand home which is the heart of the Empire; not a ship would be free for the defence of Australia. It is time that we realized the seriousness of our responsibilities. Cast back on our own resources, &#187;e could not. with a population of less than 5,000,000, defend our vast territory. The mere handful of p:0  people  who are settled within the Commonwealth could no: say to -the forces of the world, &#34; Come on; we are ready to meet you all.&#34; The defeat of conscription at the recent referendum was, to my mind, a national calamity, and must have caused displeasure in the Mother Country, W.here we must always look for support and succour in the hour of peril. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes,</inline> and those who think with him, why the American Navy was invited a few years ago to visit Australia ? What was in the mind of Australian political leaders and the people was this : That though we would have the British Navy as a first line of defence, and 50,000 troops, as Lord Kitchener said, could hold this country, yet it would be a prudent thing to have also the help of the American Navy, and the support of the American people. </para>
                    <para>Let me now shortly refer to the so-called arguments that were used during the referendum campaign by the opponents of conscription. These arguments were mutually- destructive. They combated each other most unmercifully. Each one was mutilated by its successor. Take, for instance, the statement of the Official Labour party that a compulsory monthly draft of 7,000 men for reinforcements would denude our industries of man power and cause stagnation. It was left to their hearers to suppose that; if 7,000 men were to volunteer each month, instead of the miserable 3,000 that is now being recruited, the industries of the country would not be prejudiced. They did not explain, however, how this could be, nor could they exp&#39;ain how 7,000 men going as volunteers would not affect our industries while the same number going under compulsion would ruin our industries. Furthermore, in using this argument, the members of the party adopted what was for them an extraordinary attitude towards our industries. </para>
                    <para>It was the first occasion on which I have known them to express solicitude for those engaged in primary or in secondary production. For men like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anstey, Senator Ferricks,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> to say there should not be conscription lest the producers of the country might be handicapped was for them to contradict the professions of their whole political life. Hitherto, they, and other members of the Official Labour party, have taunted those on this side, both Liberals and Conservatives, with having won their way into Parliament by championing and defending propertied interests. During the referendum campaign, however, they themselves assumed the <inline font-style="italic">role</inline> of defenders,;^ property. For a man like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anstey</inline> to tell the squatters that their sheep would not be shorn, that their wool would not be carted to market, and that their industry would be in a parlous state if conscription were adopted, because labour would then be lacking, was inconsistent with his usual attitude towards those following pastoral pursuits. These gentlemen manifested during the campaign similar concern for the farming industry, although previously they had never shown any palpitating desire to assist the farmers. This eleventh-hour solicitude for the rural producers by men who have hitherto done little for them, and have taunted their political opponents with their readiness to defend the rights of property, is too obviously hypocritical to pass muster with men of impartial mind. </para>

                    <para>I come now to the conscription of wealth. If we talk about the conscription of human life, we are told by our opponents that we should also conscript wealth. That is a clear and definite announcement of policy by the Official Labour party. By inference, its members declare that, if human life is not conscripted, then there is no need to con- scribe wealth. That is .the position of the party to-day. Moreover, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor,</inline> in another place, has said - </para>
                    <para>It is not the intention of the Labour party to make a levy upon wealth for any purpose. </para>
                    <para class="block">That was his announcement. But during the successive referendum campaigns the bogus cry was raised that the&#39; National party was determined to &#34; conscript human life&#34; and leave wealth untouched. This hunk of false preten&#39;ce gained them tens of thousands of votes. During the recent referendum it was the means of obtaining by false pretences tens of thousands of votes throughout the Commonwealth. We have been told by honorable senators opposite that there are only 60,000 eligible men in Australia to conscript. Another authority <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ferricks)</inline> has reduced the number to 45,000. But the Official Labour party refuses to conscript wealth for the sake of these 60,000 or 45,000 men. lt pays no heed to the 304,000 men who have gone overseas to fight the Empire&#39;s battles - 30,000 of whom have made the supreme sacrifice - it loudly proclaims that it will not touch wealth in any. shape or form in the interests of those men, but that, if the remaining 60,000 are to&#39; be conscripted, then wealth must be conscribed. That is the position taken up by the so-called champions of human life in this State. Obviously, it involves a contradiction, but it is only one of the many self-annihilating bogies which have been put forward by our opponents. </para>
                    <para>Another of these bogies is the increased cost of living. It has been made to do service for many a long month. When we asked for an affirmative vote during the recent referendum, we were met with the cry, &#34; Look how the cost of living has mounted.&#34; It is .quite true that the cost of living has increased by reason of the war, but it has increased imperceptibly in Australia as compared with other countries. I have been through the figures carefully, and I propose to give honorable senators the results of my inquiries. To begin with, I propose to quote from the <inline font-style="italic">Labour .Gazette,</inline> an official publication in the Old Country, which shows that for the month of October last year the cost of living had increased by 85 per cent, since the beginning of the war. How are we faring in Australia ? Here is the position on the authority of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs.</inline></para>
                    <para class="block">Honorable senators are familiar with the system which he has adopted in the compilation of the statistics set out in the following table : - </para>
                    <para class="block">
                        <graphic href="084332191801244_55_0.jpg" />
                    </para>
                    <para class="block">That is a fair comparison. What does <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> show? He shows that in Hew South Wales the weighted average of five towns during the quarter preceding the declaration of war was 1,190&#39;, and that it increased to 1,406 during the second quarter of last year. The percentage increase for the period of the war has been as follows :- New South Wales,. 18.2; Victoria, 15.6 ; Queensland, 20.5&#39;;. South Australia; 5.5; Western Australia, 8.3; and Tasmania, 20.2. It is. clear, therefore, that throughout the Commonwealth the average increase in the cost of living has been 15.4 per cent., as against 85 per cent, in the Old Country. Queensland, it will be noted, stands at the top. of the list and South Australia at the bottom. Now, in Queensland we have a Labour Government, with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan</inline> at their head. He has at his disposal all the means to make the cost of living in his- State reasonable. Yet Queensland shows the maximum increase in the cost of living since the war began. Further, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan-</inline> has a House of Assembly through which he can pass any measure for the rectification of this wrong, and also a Legislative Council which cannot baulk his aims. No Premier of any other State occupies so favorable a position to give effect to his own views as he does. In the other States, the Legislative Councils, which form the bulwark of the .propertied class: would probably prove an obstacle in the way of the passing of progressive legislation. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan</inline> has, therefore, been in a position to reduce the cost of living had he felt so in,clined. Yet we -aVid that in Queensland the increased cost of living has amounted to- 20.5 per cent., as against 5.5 per cent, in South Australia, where a National- Government are in charge of affairs. This circumstance gives rise to some very curious speculations. We know that when the authority of the latter must prevail, a conflict of authority may occur as between a State and the Commonwealth. We know, too, that within the ambit of its own functions each of these authorities is supreme. But where a State and Federal law are inconsistent, to the extent of that inconsistency the State law is <inline font-style="italic">invalid.</inline> The Arbitration Court case, in which the powers of the two authorities were tested, clearly showed that, whilst the Federal authority could fix the rate of wages at a certain minimum, a State could&#39; step in and say that that minimum should be higher, although it could not be Tower. Conversely, after the price of foodstuffs has been fixed by the Federal authority at a certain maximum, a State authority has power to step in and reduce that price should it feel disposed to do so. There are States in the Commonwealth which are not ruled by Labour Governments, but which are, nevertheless, governed by men who are exercising a more salutary influence in keeping the cost of living within reasonable bounds than are the Ryan Labour Government to-day.. From the figures I have quoted it appears that the profiteer and the Ryan Government are lying down together, after the fashion of the lion and the lamb. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan</inline> has said that the cost of living is rising. My reply is that he should use his. power to reduce it, and thus square his words with action. I repeat that in Queensland the Labour Government have been in office and have stood idly by while the cost of living has mounted. During the recent campaign it was argued that the cost of living would not permit people to cast an affirmative vote. But the men who advanced- that argument were not troubled about the cost of living. They were more concerned about the cost of dying for &#34;this- &#39; country. The figures I have quoted speak eloquently. They show that the cost of living- has gone up slightly throughout </para>
                    <para class="block">Australia, and that if the one Government in Australia that had it within their power to do so had lived up to their professions, the cost of living in that State could have been brought within reasonable bounds. I deplore the fact that a Government so situated should not have taken advantage of their opportunities. </para>
                    <para>We have been told that the referendum vote was a victory for Labour. Far from it, because during the recent campaign there was a conjunction of forces never before seen in the history of the Labour party. Constituencies which hitherto had never had an association with Labour on this occasion gave majorities of 5,000, 6,000, and 7,000 votes against the policy of the Government. They made common cause with the representatives of the Trades Hall, the Industrial Workers of the World, and every disloyal element in the country, and, in that way, there was a union of opposite forces which had the effect of bringing about the national calamity to which 1 have referred. And this is the party that has emblazoned on its banner - &#34; Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity !&#34; Equality! Where is the equality? Is there any equality in a system which, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> pointed out, has made it possible for a man to volunteer and leave behind him seven, eight, and ten children ;  a system that permits able-bodied sons to remain behind while married men enlist in our fighting forces; which sends the widow&#39;s son and sometimes even allows those who remain behind to jeer at men who go? Equality!&#39; Damn such equality, I say, if that is what it represents. This is the wretched voluntary system which drains this country of its stripling youths, just approaching manhood, and of its married men, thus heaping an intolerable burden upon coming generations. This is the system which they call equality! And they have inscribed on their banners the motto - &#34;Equality, Liberty, and Fraternity !&#34; Fraternity ! With Australia&#39;s flesh and blood buried in the blood-stained trenches - from which we have been told it sometimes takes three men to drag another out - while eligible men are here lying in ease and comfort in their beds. Take it away from me ; I will have none of it or of the party that supports such hypocritical policy; that stands idly by and does not attempt to reach a more just appreciation of its responsibilities. </para>
                    <para>I speak in this strain because I feel strongly. I do not forget that at the present time a terrible struggle is in progress in the European arena between the forces of freedom and the forces of autocracy. I could quote from one of the leading publicists of Germany, who said, plainly enough, that the eyes of Germany were upon Australia, and that soon they would establish themselves here. I could give other quotations showing that public men of that country, both in their capacity as members of the Reichstag and in semi-official positions, have mentioned Australia as. the promised land. These are expressions of opinion made, not by the chosen representatives of the people, but by the representatives of an autocracy that is propped up by the bayonets of its war-trained armies, by the representatives of the last remnant of the most powerful autocracy in the history of the world, which is now engaged in a death struggle with the free nations of the earth. Australia, being one of the free nations of the world, is vitally concerned in this struggle, but she is not extended to the utmost limits of her power. We need to be up and doing while the war is on, in order to write our good name on the pages of history in this fight for liberty. </para>
                    <para>For my part, I am prepared to do my best. I have taken risks before, and I am going to take them again: I will take no orders from anybody, executive or otherwise; no orders from any except those who have the right to send me here, namely, the electors of Western Australia. I will not allow any intermediary to come between me and my duty to. Australia. I will support the National Government during the currency of this war ; but nothing will prevent me from following a free and independent course, even to the extent of supporting the party opposite, if by some metamorphosis they change their opinions and regain the pristine character of the Labour party, entitling them to stand as the true representatives of Australian Democracy. In the meantime, I shall support the Government, so that the safety of our nation may be assured. </para>

Speeches like that to which we have just listened are not calculated to do any more than widen the breach; and while I extend to every man the right of &#34;his  opinion,  so long as he is sincere, 1 hope the same right will be extended to me. I believe <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> is perfectly sincere in his advocacy of conscription, and 1 ask honorable senators to take my assurance I am just as sincere in my opposition to the system. </para>

                    <para>Referring to recent political events, I cannot help thinking that they&#34; have degraded Australia in the eyes of the world, because what may be regarded as almost sacred pledges given to the people certainly have been violated. The wording of some of the pledges was as plain as it is possible to make them. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.- Hughes),</inline> for instance, said at Bendigo - </para>
                    <para>I tell you plainly that the Government must have thiB power, lt cannot govern the country without it, and will not attempt to do so. </para>
                    <para class="block">Simply resigning and resuming office immediately afterwards will not satisfy an intelligent and honest people. I could quote almost every leader on the other, side and show that all the pledges were as emphatic as that given by the Prime Minister. Pledges were given by the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cook),</inline> the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen),</inline> the Minister for Works ana Railways <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> the Minister for Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jensen), Sir William</inline> Irvine, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Massey</inline> Greene. The statements made by these gentlemen were just about as emphatic as it was possible to make them; and I am satisfied that a great number of members in the National party, if not the majority, are. not satisfied with the action of the Government in this respect. Personally, I have a good opinion of the majority of members of that party, and I feel satisfied they do not approve, of what was really a repudiation of the pledge - the resignation of the Government and their immediate resumption of office. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and his colleagues had said during the campaign, &#34; If you do not give us this power we will resign, but will immediately resume office,&#34; would not the people have regarded it as a farce? And yet that is exactly what has happened. In my travels through Australia, I met people of all shades of political opinion, and, from what I have heard, have no hesitation in saying that the great mass of the people are dissatisfied with the action of the Government. They feel that politics in Australia have been degraded by the breaking of this pledge. The time will come, and before very long, when the electors will show their resentment of .such conduct on the part of the Government, and will take care that at least every man returned to this Parliament is a man who can be trusted and who will keep his word. </para>

In almost every instance, the answer I received to my inquiry as to how the men in the trenches would vote was, &#34; Nine to one against conscription.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> this afternoon was, emphatic in reflecting upon the people of Australia who had voted &#34;No,&#34; and I repeat that every reflection that he cast upon them applies with equal force to the lads in the trenches who voted &#34; No.&#34; The honorable senator occupied much time in endeavouring to show that honorable senators on this side are under the control of an outside authority. Is it not singular that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> was for years a member of our party, working under the very platform that we have to-day ? It is only of recent date that he has discovered that the Labour party is everything that is bad, and that no good can come out of it. </para>

                    <para>I rose more particularly, however, to refer to one or two incidents associated with the recent conscription campaign. During that campaign opportunities arose for giving our returned soldiers some recognition. I cannot exactly say what was done throughout Australia, but I do not know of one returned soldier who was appointed to any position in a polling-booth in Tasmania on the day of the referendum vote. I have here a letter from a resident of the north-west coast of Tasmania, complaining very bitterly of the treatment meted out to a returned soldier, a very capable young man, who could not get an appointment as a poll clerk or presiding officer. </para>

The council clerk was also engaged in the booth, and was seen going to and from the council chamber during the day. There was no chance, however, for a returned soldier to get a job. Incidents of this kind stick in the minds of people. Let me quote a few lines from this letter, which was written to me in reply to an inquiry I had made - </para>

                        <para>I saw the returned soldier, Ira Naylor, today. He tells me he never had a chance to be a poll clerk or a presiding officer. He spoke to the A.R.O., E. D. Atkinson, and found that he always had the positions docketed. Private Ira Naylor was a son of the late Captain Winston Naylor, a retired Indian officer, who, after a residence in this district for thirty years, died just after the war broke out in 1914- nearly ninety years of age. Six of his sons early enlisted. I find two have made the supreme sacrifice - Quartermaster Winston Naylor and his brother, Private Ben. Naylor. Three are still at the Front, somewhere in France. Ira Naylor was at Gallipoli, and was in a shell explosion, and was wounded. After some months in the hospital he was invalided home, and came back just before the Hay election, where he voted, and .voted on Thursday last. The Naylor family of boys and girls were liberally educated. One of whom was an officer in the Commercial Bank when he decided to enlist. I asked Private Ira Naylor if he would have taken a position of presiding officer or a poll clerk? His reply was, &#34;Bather! I cannot get the chance.&#34; The A.R.O., Atkinson, took good care to find a position for his nephew - Colin&#39; Groom - and twelve or thirteen others who never served their country like the brave volunteers - like Naylor Brothers. I tell you again that it is a mockery on the part of the Government and their hypocrites of Federal officers to talk about returned soldiers&#39; settlement on the land and finding employment congenial to the qualifications and fitness of our noble returned lads. They take good care who gets the &#34;bun.&#34; </para>

                    <para class="block">I hope that the Minister leading the Senate will make a note of this matter. Returned soldiers, who - have done their duty, and are unfortunate enough to have been invalided and returned home, ought not to be denied the opportunity of earning a shilling or two, and steps should be taken to prevent such cases as I have described. </para>
                    <para>I should like to refer to the regulation relating to voters of enemy origin, for it seems to me that it might afford opportunity for most undesirable practices. In one case, a young man, named Edgar Gear, whom I know, on going to a polling booth in the Bass constituency, waa treated in a manner indicating that the presiding officer there certainly overstepped his duty.. So far as I can see, the regulation provides for questions on only two points, namely, the nationality of the voter and that of his father. In the case to which I refer the presiding officer - whether on his own account or in consequence of a suggestion by some one else - asked, not only the young man&#39;s nationality and that of his father, but that of his grandfather. To the first question the young man replied that he was a native of Tasmania; to the second, that his father was a native of the United States of America, and to the third, that, so far as he knew, his grandfather was a Scotchman. There is no power under that regulation, from beginning to end, to ask any person who desires to vote the nationality of a grandfather. And it has to be remembered that the mere asking of the questions makes it necessary for the person to vote under section 25. In any case, the result of the referendum was declared before these votes were counted ; indeed, I do not know that they have been counted yet. It may be that there were similar occurrences throughout Australia; and, if so, it means that many electors suffered great indignity. The interpretation of the words of the regulation puts great power into the hands of any unscrupulous man, especially if he happens to be a partisan. An opposing scrutineer has only to interrogate an intending elector in this way in order to insure that the vote will be given under section 25; and, though I do not say the suspicion is justified, there is a great deal of suspicion that these votes were not counted on the last occasIon. I ought to say that, in replying to this young man&#39;s letter, I told him not to be afraid, because, according to my knowledge of the District Returning Officer for Bass, he was as fair a man as ever breathed, and would see that no injustice was done. However that may be, there is, as I say, widespread suspicion in regard to these votes. I made some inquiry at the head office for the Bass electorate just before the result of the referendum was announced, and I discovered that those particular votes had not been counted then; and the poll was declared before they were counted, if they have been counted at all. I shall not go into the whole question involved in the regulation; but I hope that never at another election in Australia will such indignities be heaped on the people. I ought to add that neither this young, man&#39;s father nor any of his brothers were asked questions under the regulation. I hope the few remarks I have made on this point will bear some fruit, because it is deeply  regrettable  that people should be insulted in this way. One man who has suffered has told me that, although he has lived in Tasmania all his life, and has always been a reputable citizen, he intends, at the first opportunity, to leave the country; but my advice to him was to take no notice of what had occurred. </para>

Since <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Grice made the speech to which I refer, many people throughout Australia have begun to realize, as never before, that we have made a great blunder in this connexion; and it is certain that, if -we continue to eliminate such incomes from taxation in the future, we shall, in the long run, have very few .incomes to tax. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Grice pointed out that, on an income of &#163;30,000 from War Loan investment, the interest amounts really to 7 per cent. - that it is only on the smaller incomes that it amounts to 4^ per cent. It would be much preferable, when we float another loan, to give a higher rate of interest, with no exemption. </para>

                    <para>I rose principally to speak of the unjust treatment received by the returned soldiers in connexion with referendum employment. Positions as Assistant Returning Officers may require the possession of certain qualifications, but it is not very difficult for a man to undertake the duties of poll clerk. Many returned soldiers were capable men, but they were never given a chance. I do not blame a Divisional Returning Officer for appointing a wholly new staff, but I think he might occasionally, when opportunity offers, engage a returned soldier as a poll clerk, and not, as was done at Penguin, on tie North Coast, docket the friends of the Presiding Officer and keep bank clerks and council clerks marching backwards and forwards between the polling booth and their offices, attempting to do two jobs and draw two salaries, while returned soldiers could get no employment at all. I hope we shall not have a repetition of that experience. </para>

                        <para>.- The debate has been prolonged and tedious, and in some respects disappointing, for, despite the fact that we are passing through a great crisis, in which civilization is fighting for its existence, no suggestion for a successful conduct of the war has come from the Opposition. We have heard nothing but small criticisms and a great) deal of abuse of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes).</inline></para>

                    <para>My main purpose in rising is to refer to one question in which I take a very deep interest. Several speakers have referred in warning tones to the Eastern menace, and some honorable senators spoke of Japan in anything but respectful language. Even one honorable senator on this side of the chamber said that the bazaars of the East were filled with whispers about this large, desirable, and unpopulated country of Australia, and he warned us that if something were not done to increase our population the consequence might be serious. I have never been one of those who feared the Asiatic bogy. Australia has every reason to be proud of and gratified with the honorable way in which Japan has, during this war, kept her compact with the Mother Country. If Japan nad broken her treaty with Great Britain as the Germans broke the treaty regarding the neutrality of Belgium, Australia would have been at her mercy. I think we ought to recognise Japan&#39;s strict observance of her treaty obligations. I take the view that the safety of Australia lies in its being an integral part of the Empire, and that, from my knowledge of the Australian people, I do not think there is any likelihood of our breaking the existing ties with the Old Land. There is not that extent of disloyalty which some people seem to think. Honorable senators opposite vent a great deal of their enmity and bitterness upon the Prime Minister, but one great thing I admire about him is his Imperial outlook. Many of the big things he has done have been lost sight of owing to small mistakes he has made, and his short-sighted opponents see only the mistakes and ignore the greater things. To me, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> stands as the representative of Imperial thought in Australia. </para>
                    <para>I regard the Empire as having a mission, not only to the people of Australia, but also to the people of the East, and from my point of view, by becoming a live part in the Empire and doing our best in this war, we shall be assuring our own safety and future against Japan or any other menace that may arise in the East. If Britain, in her wisdom, will recognise the grievances of India, there will be no danger to Australia in future, because India is a part of the Empire that we cannot do without, and that cannot do without us. Despite all the mistakes that have been made, British rule has been for India&#39;s benefit. There are  317,000,000 Indian subjects of the British Empire, and at the present time their leaders are asking in very earnest tones for self-government. I am anxious that when the war is over Australia shall be represented at the Imperial Conference that must necessarily follow to devise a policy for the future development and consolidation of the Empire, and I think that a man with the knowledge that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> possesses would ably represent the Commonwealth. As the Empire is desirous of establishing self-government in all small countries, I trust that those who meet at the Imperial Conference table will see that India receives her share of self-government and 1/he right to work out her own salvation as part of the Em| pire. If that privilege is granted to her, and she enters into the councils of the Empire, there will be no menace to Australia from the East, because India is strong enough to dominate Asia. Of course, some will say that Australia does not wish to be beholden to a coloured race for its independence, but India is as much an integral part of the Empire as is Australia, and if the Empire is to grow we must, despite any prejudices we may have as Britishers, have regard to the future solidarity of&#34; the Empire, because it stands for peace, progress, liberty, and self-government among its own people in a way that no other nation or race has done. We stand before the world as an example of those who have been able to settle Colonies and create self-governments. The Commonwealth is one of the examples to the world. In this chamber, we have heard a great deal about the liberty of Australians, and so forth. Where did we get it ? We have inherited it from those who built the Old Country. It is not particularly a part of the soil of Australia; it is in the blood of the British race. It was brought here by those who came here. Our Constitution is the result of what Britain has built up in the past, and we can keep it only because we belong to the race and to the British Empire. We are all anxious to see the war brought to an end. We dd not know when it is going to end ; but, if the Secretary for India in the Home Government would see his way to granting India self-government, there would be no need for the Empire to fear Germany or any Allies which it might get in Europe; because India could supply millions of men if they were required. No conscription would be necessary; the men would be supplied willingly, so long as India was recognised as an integral part of the Empire. This is a thought that has &#39; been in my mind all through the war, though I have never mentioned it before in this chamber. </para>
                    <para>I am a strong conscriptionist. I hold that, in a democratic country like this, where we all have an equal voice in the making of laws, and equal liberties, all should be able and willing to fight for these liberties to the last man and the last shilling. But that policy is not being carried out, though the Empire is in very straitened circumstances owing to the submarine menace and the lack of man power. As Britain is producing all the munitions for the Empire, she may require outside help. Notwithstanding the part that America may play, I feel that the British Empire, with all its might and strength, is the one Power that will work for the future settlement of disputes and the maintenance of peace. But it can only be done by welding all parts of the Empire. Let India be brought in as an equal with the rest of us. From the point of view of winning the war, in which all our liberties are at stake, if India could come to the rescue, it could supply millions of men, some of them the best soldiers we could ever have. It must not be forgotten that the vast majority of the inhabitants of India belong to the Aryan race, as we do. Thousands of them have skins just as white as ours. We are merely a branch of the old Aryan family that went to Europe- thousands of years ago. </para>

When the war is over, the British Empire will have a strong part to play in maintaining peace, in bringing about liberty and progress, and in establishing Governments where they should be established, allowing each race to work out its own salvation.

                        O&#39;LOGHLIN (South Australia) &#91;9.38&#93;.- It is nob very pleasing for any one who has the honour of Australia or the interests of responsible government at heart to contemplate the events of the last eighteen months, beginning with the first conscription referendum, going .on. to the Ready- Watson-Earle scandal in the Senate - in regard to which inquiry was denied, although the Prime Minister
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline>
                        said, on oath, in another place, &#34; If they want an inquiry they can have it&#34; - and then passing on to the last referendum where Parliament, the people, and the laws of the country were flouted. Never in the history of Australia has patriotism been so prostituted or responsible government so dragged in the mire as during that period. When the Prime Minister was still connected with the Labour party, there was. a show of decency in regard to the conduct of the first referendum. There were some abuses, I understand, in the way of censorship - I was not here at the time - but the people&#39;s representatives were consulted and a Bill was passed through both branches of the Legislature to authorize the holding of the referendum. These steps were dispensed with on the recent occasion. What happened after the different referenda? After the first,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline>
                        then Leader of the Labour party, held a&#39; meeting of that party, but refused to abide by its decision, or, at any rate, refused to allow it to come to a decision, for as soon as he found that a proposal was hostile, though it might not have been carried, he and certain of his followers walked out. After the last referendum, when he, as leader of a combined party or series of parties, which he had led into a greater mess than that into which he had led the Labour party, found that he and his party were in a hole, he called his supporters together and submitted his case to them, saying that it was for the party to decide. On- the first occasion the Conservative press applauded the Prime Minister for saying that he was nob going to be influenced by Caucus, and that he proposed to take an independent course; they said that he was quite right in trying to flout his party and in leaving them. On this occasion, when he took the opposite course, he still did the right thing according to the press. Apparently, whatever he does is right. He did the right thing in consulting his party. Let us look at the farce of that consultation. Ministers and their Whips and the other officials of the party constitute a very considerable portion of the Ministerial Caucus. Each Minister has a little influence with his immediate supporters. Ministers and their Whips so arranged the motions that were to be submitted to the Caucus and so arranged matters beforehand in the Ministerial room that they were sure they would have the majority of the party with. them. Then, having passed resolutions expressing confidence in
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline>
                        and declaring that they would have no other leader, the meeting adjourned till the next day, in order to see how its actions would be taken by the public. Finding that the people were waiting for further information, and that they did not object very much to what had been proposed, another meeting was held and a further resolution was agreed to saying that no other party, that is, the Opposition, was to be permitted to carry on the government of the country. Then the Prime Minister, entrenched by resolutions in front and behind, rendering it impossible for any one else to carry on the government of the country, went bravely to the Governor-General and submitted his resignation unconditionally. The Governor-General, although he is a Scotchman, seems to have a little sense of humour, for he entered into the humour of these proceedings, and after consulting several members of Parliament, just as every one wlm waa watching the little manoeuvre expected, he asked
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline>
                        to take  un  office again.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline>
                        came back to office after all this white-washing, but with the same promise made to the people still unfulfilled, and with the same pledge to the country still broken. The pledge was not that Ministers would resign, but that they would absolutely refuse to carry on the government of the country unless the people gave them the powers that they asked for.
                    </para>
                    <para>I am a fairly old political campaigner, but I have never had an easier case to deal with on the platform than that put up by the conscriptionists on the last referendum campaign. It was only necessary to quote their statements, one against the other. One lot of figures which they put before the public was immediately contradicted by another. Statistics as to recruits and casualties given on the  one day were sure to be followed on the next day by an explanation pointing out that errors bad been made. It was necessary only to quote what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> said at Sydney against what the Prime Minister said at Bendigo, and then make a reference to some message from General Birdwood, and the confusion in which the public were placed became so apparent that very little argument was required to show how hollow and absurd were the claims&#39; which the Government were making. At the first referendum, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> assured the public that, in order to save Australia and the Empire, and to preserve our boys at the Front from utter annihilation, it was absolutely essential that 16,500 men should be sent across the seas every month, and that in the first month double that number should be sent away. A few months later, after being defeated at the first referendum, and before the last general election, in May, when the Nationalist party desired to keep conscription in the background, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> confessed, in his speech at Bendigo, that the estimate previously given him by his military advisers of the number of men required was not correct, since the number of casualties that actually took place showed that one-fifth of the first estimate, or 3,500 men per month, would have been quite sufficient for reinforcements during the period when the people of Australia were told that it was absolutely essential that 16,500 per month should be sent away. Mr: Hughes gave two explanations of this discrepancy. The first explanation was that the calculations of the military advisers were upset because there was a winter in Europe. It would appear that it was considered rather an unusual thing to have a winter in Europe. The Prime Minister&#39;s military advisers, when they made their original estimate, apparently did not know that there would be a winter in Europe, when, as there would be less strenuous operations at the Front, there would be a smaller number of casualties than might be expected during the spring and summer months, when the great offensives take place. When the last referendum campaign was started, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> gave another explanation. He said, &#34; You will &#39; ask why, when I told you- some months ago that 16,500 men per month would be required, I now say that less than half that number will be sufficient for reinforcements. The reason is that, owing to the improved method of attack, by which an artillery barrage clears the way for our troops, they are able to attain their objectives &#39; with less than half the casualties they previously suffered in an attack.&#34; When the second referendum was launched we were nearing the winter time in Europe, and the improved method of attack was in operation. When both these reasons were operating to reduce the number of casualties, how is it explained that, whilst 3,500 would have been sufficient to make good the actual casualties at the time the first referendum was taken, it was necessary to send double that number of men to make good deficiencies due to casualties when both the reasons for reducing the number of casualties were in operation? That has never been explained. Those who, even without military experience have some knowledge of history, must know that the first proposal was utterly preposterous.. It really meant that the whole of our Forces at the Front would be killed or disabled twice over every year, because 16,500 every month for twelve months would represent 200,000 men. It was clearly preposterous to say that 200,000 men were required every year for the reinforcement of five divisions. If we take the last estimate of 7,500 per month that would represent 84,000 in a year, and the inference is that every year five-sixths of our fighting force at the Front would be required to make good our casualties. If the first estimate were correct, there would not be a fighting man left in Europe in two years&#39; time. The whole of the fighting front would be one vast cemetery, and the battlefields a scene of carnage which would stagger humanity. No experience in connexion with this war or with any other has shown that it is necessary to keep a fighting force at the Front to provide for a casualty list of 75 per cent, every year, as was estimated in the last proposal which the Prime Minister put before the country. </para>
                    <para>I desire to go over as little of the ground traversed by other speakers as possible; but it has been mentioned that the people were told by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> other Ministers, and other speakers on the same side, that every man and woman who voted against the Government&#39;s proposals were disloyalists and pro-Germans. </para>

                            <para>.- Does not that imply that every one voting &#34;No&#34; at the referendum was against the Empire ? Surely if a person is against the Empire he is disloyal. The test of loyalty during the last referendum campaign, apparently, was not loyalty to King George V., but loyalty to &#34; Kaiser &#34; Hughes. Every one who did not believe as he did, and vote as he wished, was disloyal and a pro-German. </para>

It was said that they were up to their necks in mud and slush, and that, in the trenches, they were required to do double and treble work because reinforcements were not sent to relieve them.

                            <para>N- I do not know whether  Colonel Bolton  was in London at the time, but I do not think that any one will dispute what I am going to say. I was in London on last Christmas day twelve months, and was present at the great dinner given to Australians in London, and presided over by the High Commissioner, our old leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> at the Hotel Cecil, in one of the largest rooms in London. Australian soldiers then in England were brought there and given a good time, and were afterwards taken to the theatres. The point I am coming to is that only a few weeks ago it was stated in the cablegrams received here that the proposal to entertain the Australian&#39;s in London at Christmas time this year had to be abandoned. Do honorable senators know why ? It was because there was such an immense number of Australian boys on furlough in England and London at the time that no hall could be found big enough to hold them. Consequently the proposal was abandoned. I met in London hundreds of the men who were sent overseas in the transport of which I had charge. I do not wish it to be inferred from my statement that our boys are having a picnic. The work they have to do at the Front is strenuous enough without people here attempting to harass the feelings of their friends and relatives by making out that their condition is worse than it is. It is not possible to keep men in the trenches in such strenuous times without giving them ample holidays and recreation. </para>

                            <para>- All honour to them. I have myself known men who were wounded two or three times, and went back to the trenches, and were glad to go back. On many occasions. I have seen Australian soldiers who, after being wounded or through illness in the trenches, were condemned by a Medical Board as not being fit for further service in the trenches, and I never saw men more disappointed - all honour to them for it - because they were not permitted to go back to the Front. I mention my own experience, the wires received from General Birdwood, and the sending of battalions to Italy, in order to show that our boys have had ample reinforcements. We had a statement, from the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> on the&#39; subject in Sydney which he cannot go back upon. The Government - had not decided upon conscription at that time, and were boosting the voluntary system, and the Minister for Defence said that there was no time since the war started at which the Australian divisions were not &#39;at their full strength, or were short of reinforcements. A few weeks later., when the Government desired to bolster up their demand for conscription, it was said that some of the battalions were not at half their strength, and the men were called upon to do double work in the trenches. </para>

                    <para>Another scare that was raised by the conscriptionists was that we were in absolute danger of invasion. We were invited to believe that if the conscription proposal of the Government was not carried the Germans would be here next day, and we could almost hear their guns booming in the Gulf. The suggestion that a bankrupt and war-worn Germany had any idea of coming to molest us in Australia was simply ridiculous. I have never heard an argument that would hang a dog to show that Germany ever had any serious designs upon Australia. If honorable  senators opposite do not agree with that, I hope they will produce some evidence in support of their contention. </para>

                    <para>A day or two before the referendum was taken the Prime Minister painted the state of things on the Western Front in the most gloomy colours. He said, &#34; Our Allies are . contending there . against overwhelming odds; the position is imminent, urgent, and desperate&#34;; the implication being that if conscription was not carried in Australia something dreadful would happen. That was the statement of the Prime Minister of Australia, 12,000 miles away from the scene of operations. Within a day or two after he made it, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George - the Prime Minister of Great Britain - after stating that we had great difficulties to &#39; contend with on the Western Front, said, &#34; There is no occasion for panic. Notwithstanding the defection of Russia, there is a vast superiority of the Allies on the Western Front over the forces opposed to them.&#34; That was the statement of the man on the spot. </para>

                        O&#39;LOGHLIN.At any rate, of the two, I prefer to believe the man on the spot. I have here a speech - which I do not think any one else has quoted - delivered by the Prime Minister in Brisbane. &#39; Like Louis XIV., he seems to think he is the State, there are so many &#34;I&#39;s&#34; in his speech. Somebody calculated the number of &#34; I&#39;s &#34; in a three column report of his speech at Bendigo, and found there were 111 - more even than
                        <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline>
                        had, and he was reputed to have 100. That was the famous occasion on which he said that if he liked he could  have led a united party, meaning that his party merely echoed his views. That is the opinion that- he seems to entertain of his followers - that they follow him personally, and not because of their own convictions, because he said distinctly, &#34;If I went against conscription I could have led a united party; they would have all followed me.&#34; He repeated that at Brisbane, saying that nothing stood between this country and conscription ex*cept his word, and that if he chose, by proclamation, to have conscription, it would be carried. Apparently, his colleagues do not count for anything. He said -
                    </para>
                    <para>There has not been a day since the 5th of May when I could not have done anything I liked in this country! It is only my pledge which stands between this country and conscription. But without that power I shall not hold office. Without it it will be impossible to govern the country. It is only my pledge that is standing between these gentlemen and - conscription, my word, and nothing else. Just my bare word and nothing else. My word now alone stands between them and conscription by regulation or otherwise! </para>
                    <para> There is the almighty &#34; I.&#34; It was as much as to say, &#34; There is no Ministry, no Parliament, nothing but myself, and what I say is law.&#34; If we take from the Prime Minister&#39;s speeches the in- _sinuations and innuendoes against every one who differs from him, and a little windy rhetoric and abuse of those opposed to him, there is very little solid left. His statements are a combination of <inline font-style="italic">ego</inline> and Iago. Outside those two prominent factors, there is very little in them. </para>
                    <para>I never had a higher opinion of the intelligence of the people of Australia than I have to-day. When I contemplated the tremendous forces arrayed against us in the fight - although I had every encouragement in conducting the campaign in my own State, and felt that we were on the right side, and had the majority with us - I could not help having misgivings. Practically the whole of the Parliament, the whole of the . press, and all the parsons were arrayed in one solid body against the forces that were fighting against conscription. They chose to slander the country they belonged to by saying that Australia disgraced itself in the referendum vote, although it has put up a record that no other country has ever done. I feel proud of Australia when I think that, in spite of our distance from the scene of conflict, over 300,000 men have gone voluntarily to fight the battles of the Empire and our own. I feel proud of being an Australian, and felt especially proud of it in London, where the word &#34;Australia&#34; on the shoulder strap, and the Australian hat, which is the chief characteristic of our troops, were enough to cause a man to be regarded practically as . a hero. The British people have the greatest regard for all the Dominions, but particularly for Australia and New Zealand, because they recognise the distance from which they sent their troops, and the pecuniary sacrifices, much greater than those of any other country, which they have had to make. </para>
                    <para>At <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor&#39;s</inline> meeting in the Exhibition Building, Adelaide, I stated that Australia had more men on the Western Front than Canada and New Zealand combined. Next day, the Prime Minister, in an inspired paragraph in the press, said my figures were altogether wrong, and quoted some figures of his own to show that Canada had sent more men than Australia. He quoted the number sent from Canada, but what I said had reference to those on the fighting front. He made the astounding statement that New Zealand was then sending reinforcements to the Front at the rate of 5,000 per month, a statement which had afterwards to be contradicted by the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> who explained that it was based on some misconception of a telegram from General Birdwood. We have since been told officially that New Zealand has reduced the number of her reinforcements because she finds she is not able to keep up the number she did before. The authority for my statement was Major-General Maurice, the Director of Operations on the Western Front.  His  figures, as published in a cablegram on the 10th November, were that on the Western Front, in the fighting line, there were 82 per cent. British, 9 per cent. Australian, 7 per cent. Canadian, and 2 per cent. New Zealand. That was a magnificent record for Australia, showing that she had as many men in the firing line on the Western Front as New Zealand and Canada combined. </para>

                        O&#39;LOGHLIN.Perhaps the honorable senator thinks all these things are faked, to assist the &#34; No &#34; side in the campaign. . The honorable senator&#39;s party gets all the publicity, because it has the whole of the press on its side. If anything has been faked, it has not been in support of our side. The Canadian war expenditure is at the rate of about &#163;45,000,000 per year. I am sure our Treasurer would be very glad if our war expenditure was no more. According to these official figures, Australia had as many men in the firing line as Canada and New Zealand combined, and it is to be remembered that Canada has to transport men only one-fourth of the distance that we have to transport men, and has a population 70 per cent, greater than ours. Yet recreant Australians have said that the country has disgraced itself, arid this though our record&#39; is the admiration of the world, and has not been paralleled. My blood boils when men who live in Australia asperse the patriotism of her people in this way.

                    <para>During the debate, we had appeals for unity. Was the campaign of slander in connexion with the two referendums likely to draw people together? Has it  not  had the contrary effect? Those responsible for this include the Prime Minister and other Ministers, upon whom, above all others, it devolved to set an example. When a great question is submitted to the people, there should be no party wrangling and recrimination. Having abused their opponents in every way, having liberated this poison gas, now that they find themselves beaten, they hold up the whits flag, and say, &#34;  Kamerad,  come and join us.&#34; I trust that never again will Australia be dragged in the mire by responsible politicians as she has been during the past eighteen months. We should endeavour to forget what has happened. I wonder what example this Ministry, which has come back to office whitswashed, and with its sins forgiven, will set; and &#39;what it is going to do with the recommendations of its appointed Committee in regard to the amelioration of the condition of the soldiers. </para>

                        O&#39;LOGHLIN.They had not their genesis in that Committee. Most of them were discussed in this chamber in connexion with various Defence measures before being brought before the Committee. If Ministers wish to encourage recruiting, they must drop this abuse of the Labour party. Are not the recruits drawn from the ranks of labour ? It is the constituencies which voted &#34; No,&#34; some by majorities of two and three to one, that are supplying the largest number of recruits? The charge has been made against the Labour party that it has not joined in the recruiting campaign; but in Victoria our leader, who was  chairman  of the State Recruiting Committee, was hooted and hissed, and could hardly get out of a hall in safety when he attempted to address a big recruiting meeting.

                            <para>- I have on many occasions taken part in recruiting meetings, and am willing to do so again, but many of these meetings were really -conscription meetings, at which the presence of a Labour member was embarrassing. On one occasion, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Shannon</inline> was present, two gentlemen, for whom I make every excuse, because one of them had two sons fighting, and the other had lost a son at the war, made several statements against which I felt called upon to protest. One of them said that he had written to the Premier of .the State arranging a coalition with the Nationalists. Then he read a letter from a soldier at the Front, denouncing most bitterly and abusively all who at the previous referendum had voted &#34;No,&#39;1&#39; stigmatizing them as shirkers and a disgrace to their country. The other gentleman repeated the statement which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Heydon had to withdraw, and for which he had to apologize, namely, that the torpedoing  of the <inline font-style="italic">Ballarat</inline> was owing to the fact that the coal lumpers of New South Wales would not supply coal at the proper time, or the proper sort of coal. He said that those who lost their lives in connexion with the sinking of that vessel had been murdered by the Labour party. At two or three other meetings I found that the presence of a Labour man on the platform was embarrassing. At each of them conscription was urged, and the speakers threatened the audience that young men who did not go would be sent. If we are to encourage recruiting, we must drop all that. To make voluntarism a success we must work hard for it. Under the voluntary system we, sent away 47,000 last year, notwithstanding the big strike and the referendum campaign, which reduced the enlistments by one-half. Without these- interferences we should have had over 50,000 recruits, aud if we continue to send away that number each year w&#169; shall be doing a fair thing, and shall be meeting &#39; as many casualties as any army in Europe is suffering. We shall be doing all that can be reasonably expected of Australia. The reservoir from which we must draw our recruits is being exhausted, and, consequently, we cannot expect to obtain the same number of reinforcements that we were able to secure in the early stages of the war. But I believe that we can secure reinforcements to the extent of 50,000 per annum, and that, I believe, represents all that can be expected from us in justice to ourselves and to the production of this country, which must be maintained if we are to be in a position to meet the huge liabilities&#39; that we are incurring in connexion with the war. </para>

                        <para>. - Apparently, it is only now that we are beginning to realize that, great as were some of the men whose lives are recorded in the pages of history, there is in Australia a still greater man who has spoken from the floor of this chamber tonight. One can but envy the feeling which must be in the breast of an individual who has done all his fighting on the carpet of a floor, and who ventures to pit his knowledge against tha&#163; of a man who has spent almost a lifetime upon the battlefield. Yet that is practically the position which this gentleman has assumed this evening. He has called into question the statements made by General Birdwood, has affirmed that the telegrams from that officer were &#34; faked,- that the reinforcements sought were not necessary, and has declared, in effect, that his own statements must be  regarded as more authoritative. He has told us that we are not to believe certain things; that no danger is to be apprehended; that if we only keep our heads this war will be won ; that Germany has never had any designs upon Australia, and that she did not desire to go to war with England ; that she practically begged the Old Country not to be drawn into the struggle ; and that she has kept her word right through the piece. These statements evidence that the honorable senator who has been &#34; barracking &#34; for Germany has never read anything outside the pages pf a novel, otherwise he would know that Germany has had distinct ideas in regard to Australia. If the honorable senator will refer to the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of only two days ago he will find in the cables, , upon which he laid so much stress, how this country was to be parcelled out by Germany - how Australia was to be the prize in this war. </para>

                            <para>- I am quoting the authority which was cited by the honorable senator himself. But if he doubts that authority, I refer him to the leading German writers, and to numerous American writers, who show that Germany has spent no less a sum than &#163;90,000,000 in propaganda work in the United States of America. As a matter of fact, Canada has to keep one-third of her military forces occupied in preventing the bridges between the Dominion and the United States of America being blown up. </para>

                    <para>With the knowledge that he must possess, I cannot understand how <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Loghlin</inline> could utter the statements which he did. Let me examine the figures quoted by him. He affirmed that if General Birdwood sent telegrams to Australia announcing that 16,500 reinforcements per month were required, and if that officer now says that 7,000 will be sufficient, he did not know his business. I dispute the deduction of the honorable senator entirely. I ask him whether Great Britain has not revised her estimates in regard to this war? Has she&#39; not had to withdraw pledges which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George made to the working men in England in order that the Man-Power Bill might be proceeded with? We all know that, in the course of a protracted war, it frequently becomes necessary to revise the position. But, apparently, there is one man in this chamber with all-sufficient wisdom, who is the superior of General Haig, of General Birdwood, and of all those who are controlling the soldiers at the Front. Seeing that he has trodden the deck of a transport, surely he is the man, and all wisdom will die with him. Coming to the statement that 16,500 reinforcements per month were required, what do we find? We find that that statement was made immediately after the attack on Verdun, when France Had lost in two weeks 90,000 men, and Australia had suffered severely. Basing his calculation on such casualties, I hold that General Birdwood was justified in the statement which he made. </para>

                            <para>- On the authority of history, the honorable senator might as well compare the casualties of the battle of Waterloo with the casualties of to-day. Does he not realize that when things are different they are not the same? Because the casualties during a fortnight numbered so many, they were taken by the authorities as the basis of the casualties for a period - of twelve months. As the fighting in the immediate future is expected to be more severe than it has ever been, it is only reasonable to ask for a still greater supply of reinforcements. </para>

                            <para>- I want to take another of the honorable senator&#39;s statements and examine it. He said that the soldiers could not be entertained in London last Christmas because there was no hall large enough to hold them, and yet immediately afterwards he told us that the number at the Front was greater than those representing Canada and New Zealand put together. I have never yet heard that a man could be in two places at one and the same time, yet by some process of logic the honorable senator proves to demonstration, apparently, that our men could be in London -because he said there was no hall large enough to hold them at Christmas time - and also at the Front. This statement is on a parallel with the statement made during the previous referendum campaign that there were tens of thousands of our troops on Salisbury Plain; that we were in the last days, and even in the last minutes, of the war, which would be over before Australian reinforcements could get there. Our opponents, it appears, advance the argument that because at a given time and in a given engagement there was a certain percentage of Australians in the firing line, they were there all the time, and because of that fact they should be there always. On these premises they might even argue that our soldiers never suffered any casualties, and that therefore Australia had all the men she wanted there. I should not wonder even if they advanced one step further in the argument, and tried to persuade us that nobody had been killed. </para>

                        tried to make out that because Canada&#39;s expenditure totalled only &#163;35,000,000, that Dominion had not as many men at the Front as Australia. But the argument is absolutely fallacious, because we must remember that Great Britain transported Canada&#39;s troops at her own expense, and also clothed, fed, and paid them. Moreover, the distance from Canada is much less than from Australia, and consequently the total charges must be a great deal less.

                            <para>- Yes, that is so. If the foundation of an argument is insecure the argument itself cannot be maintained, and, as I have &#39;shown that Canada&#39;s cost per man is much less than Australia&#39;s, it is reasonable to suppose that the Dominion&#39;s forces at the Front are equal, if not greater, than those from Australia. And I have conclusive evidence on this point in the shape of an official list giving the number of troops sent forward by both Canada and Australia. These figures are absolutely incontrovertible. </para>

                            <para>- Well, I do not rely upon the daily papers for this information. The official figures show that Canada has sent abroad 344,422 men, and Australia 315,853. We know that at a given time Canada had fewer men at the Front than Australia, but then, on the other hand, there was a period in the history of the war when &#34;Australia had less men than Canada in the firing line, so that the statement that Australia had a greater proportion of men at the Front than Canada and New Zealand put together only applied for a limited time, and during one particular engagement. </para>

                        also had something to say with regard to equality of sacrifice, and in this connexion I would point out that we cannot compare things that are incomparable. We cannot compare, for instance, any sacrifice of money as against sacrifice of human life or human suffering; but it is reasonable to compare the sacrifice of a soldier - the man who has offered himself - with the sacrifice of an eligible who remains at home; of the men who are here when it is their duty to be with their comrades at the Front. We can compare the sacrifice such men 1 are making for the benefit of those who remain behind, but we cannot compare the sacrifice of money with the sacrifice that a soldier makes on the battlefield. The two things are not comparable. I never attempt to compare them, but I regret to say that we frequently hear such a comparison being made.

                    <para>In connexion with this war it is very often said, and said unthinkingly, that the wealthy men of Australia are doing nothing. Again and again in the Senate we have been told that the Nationalist party are doing nothing - &#39;that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> is doing nothing - but as against that statement we know how much has&#39; actually been done by the party and its leader. It is in exactly the same spirit that the statement is so . often made that the wealthy&#34; men of Australia have done nothing in this war. </para>

                    <para>Let me commend to the consideration of my honorable friends opposite a few . figures bearing on this point. Since the commencement of the war the Commonwealth Parliament has passed into law measures which involve the payment of additional taxation sufficient to meet not only the interest on our war indebtedness, but sinking fund, war pensions, and the cost of repatriation up to the end of the present financial year. Such taxation must be very largely a burden upon the wealthy men of Australia. This extra taxation, levied since the war began, will yield revenue sufficient to cover the four items of expenditure to which I have referred. The estimated cost of the war up to 3rd June of this year is &#163;148,000,000. Interest at 4^ per cent, on that amount is &#163;5,760,000; a sinking fund of \ per cent, represents &#163;711,000; the estimated cost of war pensions is &#163;2,500,000, and the cost of repatriation up to 30th June next is estimated to be about &#163;1,000,000. These are all the charges that can be made in the shape of our commitments for war purposes up to the present, and they represent a total of &#163;9,971,000. To meet these charges there has been imposed since the commencement of the war an increase of the Federal land tax, which in its highest stages reaches 9d. in the &#163;1. We have also provided for an income tax with an exemption of &#163;156 for a married person, plus &#163;26 for each child under the age of sixteen years. This tax proceeds on graduated increases from about 3|d. in the &#163;1 on the lower grade until it arrives at the maximum of 6s 3d. in the &#163;1. There is also a flat rate of &#163;1 for single persons who are in receipt of a salary or income of &#163;100 per  annum.  Then we have the bachelors tax, which was imposed last year, but which has not yet come into operation. We have in addition to that imposed probate and succession duties, and a war-time profits tax. From all these sources the estimated revenue expected to be obtained during the present financial year is about &#163;10,250,000, as against war commitments up to the 30th June next, estimated at &#163;9,971,000. I commend these figures to the consideration of honorable senators opposite in view of the fact that they are constantly declaring that nothing has been done to meet our war expenditure. They will not say that the increases made in the land tax and the income tax will touch the poor man nor that the war-time profits tax will do so. </para>

                            <para>- I would refer the honorable senator to the reports of two large companies carrying on operations in Australia which show the extent to which they expect to be hit by the wartime profits tax. In the last report of the Mount Lyell Company it  is stated that they have set aside &#163;368,600 to meet the Commonwealth war-time profits taxation for 1915-16 and 1916-17, Then, again, the Broken Hill Sulphide Company have, according to their latest balance-sheet, set aside &#163;369,000 to meet Commonwealth taxation for the two years just mentioned. It will thus be seen that the total taxation which these two companies expect to be called upon to bear for the two years period is &#163;737,600. And yet honorable senators say that the burden of the war rests on the poor man. </para>

                    <para class="block"> I recognise that, on the. whole, it is impossible to prevent an increase of prices, but, side by side with that fact, I invite the Opposition to recollect that to-day we are receiving from Great Britain and distributing in Australia more money for our produce than we have ever received before. What would be the position in Australia to-day if the large sum mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> last night as having been paid by Great Britain for the purchase of our products had not been circulated in the Commonwealth? What, would have been the position if our wheat had been lying in the fields or rotting on the wharfs, or if our minerals which have proved so valuable an asset to England had not been purchased by her? What would have been the position if Great Britain, instead of taking our minerals, had obtained such requirements elsewhere, as she could have done? If she had nob purchased from us these and various other commodities at a cost equivalent to- more than &#163;2,000-000 per week, what should we have done ? If that vast sum had not been distributed in Australia our fields would have been untilled, our mines would have been unworked,  our factories would have closed down, the shutting down of businesses would have followed, and we should have had want and poverty on every side - destitution such as Australia has never known. We should then have known what the evil fires of war were doing to us. To-day, however, we remain 1 unscathed. No other land enjoys such privileges as are purs. </para>
                    <para> I deeply regret that we are not all united in facing an enemy common to humanity. We find division, and acrimony, and, in this debate, not criticism, but statements that are almost slanderous in regard to the man who has done more than any other has ever done to secure prosperity and freedom for Australia. We talk of liberty, but what would our liberty be worth if the Germans came here? What would all that we have gained in the past be to us if to-day we were like Belgium ? Do honorable senators think that it is impossible we should come to such a pass? What Germany has done to Belgium and Servia she could do to Australia if, we dared to oppose her. Our liberties are  wrapped up in the safety of the Old Land, whose flag some of- us are glad to be under. As Australians we should not rest satisfied, but should use every ounce of our power, and every man that can be spared, to fight the battles, not only of England, but of Australia. I hope there will be an end to all acrimony, and that, on both sides of the Senate, there will arise a determination to unite. Now that the public have said that they will not have conscription, politicians, at any rate, may join and determine to do their best to induce men to enlist. A Tasmanian senator contended that the Labour party, as a party, had taken their full part in recruiting. Surely it is well known that the Labour party in South Australia were invited to send a representative to the State Recruiting Committee, and, through their secretary,- declined to do so. It is also well - known that the Trades and Labour Council of South Australia received a similar invitation, and also refused. I do not say that individual members of the Labour party have not taken part ; but it stands to the eternal disgrace of Labour in this country that, .while its supporters will not have conscription, they, with the same voice, declare that they will not have recruiting. We ought to feel that there is a common danger and responsibility resting on every man, and that, until every man has done his duty, we shall not Have done enough. </para>

                        <para>.- So far in this debate we have not heard much criticism of the Supply Bill, the discussion having been mainly confined to the question of recruiting. A number of honorable senators have devoted much time in an endeavour to prove that the manhood of this country has not taken its fair share in the war, while others have gone further and declared that Australians, as a people, are everlastingly disgraced because they have twice turned down conscription. Many of the previous speakers have quoted figures showing the  number of men Australia has sent to the Front, and I think those figures compare favorably, and more than favorably, with those relating to most of the other countries engaged in the war. Of course, there are various reasons why the number of men now coming forward is not so large as formerly. When 300,000 men out of a population of 5,000,000 have left the country, we cannot expect to see the same number offering as was the case before there was any talk of conscription. Before conscription was mooted, the voluntary system- had provided men more quickly than the Government could provide vessels to take them overseas, coming forward, as they did, at the rate of 9,000 or- 10,000 a month. Then the Prime Minister returned from Great Britain and declared that we were not sending enough, and, in support of his contention, quoted figures which were afterwards proved to be wrong. However, he initiated a system that was repugnant to the people of the country, and  they,  rightly or wrongly, felt that he, as head of the Government, was trying to impose something which they would not tolerate, and believed he was not putting the case fairly. The people were of the opinion, and the figures bore them out, that the men were, enlisting fast enough. After the talk of conscription arose, recruiting continued at the same rate for some months, and then suddenly fell to. about half of what it had been before, and has remained at that ever since. It has been shown here, time after time, that the voluntary system has provided sufficient &#34;numbers to fill every gap, and more than every gap, in the firing line up to the present. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>There is much discussion as to the number of divisions at the Front. During the campaign I took the statement of the Government, namely, that there are five divisions,  and,  on their own figures, proved that they were wron&#187; in their contention. I had accompanying me a returned soldier, who, at a public meeting, put it to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that there were not five, but seven, divisions at the Front when he left England in the previous May. He pointed out that there were five divisions in France, and that he saw a sixth division reviewed on Salisbury Plain by the King, whilst the Seventh Light Horse Division was in Palestine. Honorable senators can take that statement for what it is worth; but, for myself, I argued on the basis of five divisions as good enough for my case. </para>
                    <para>In 1916 the policy of conscription was forced on by the Prime Minister. I have no quarrel with the people who supported the right honorable gentleman, because they believed him to be right. He was trying to lead the people to believe that he was doing the best possible thing; but they thought there was some object beyond the mere reinforcement of the troops behind his proposal. And when conscription was defeated, the Government themselves proved that supposition up to the hilt. They were not content to accept the verdict of the people ; they immediately commenced to plot and plan for some other method of fooling the people. Sizing up the situation, they concluded that what had defeated conscription in 1916 was the force of organized Labour. That was the lion in the path, and it must be destroyed by some means or other. &#39; Nobody knew better than the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> what organized Labour would do under certain provocation, and a number of his supporters shared his knowledge. I say, and most people in the country believe, that the Commonwealth Government, in conjunction with the State Government of New South Wales, set about destroying the strength of organized Labour, and the means adopted to achieve that end was the introduction of the Taylor card system in New South Wales. They knew that the men would fight the system, and that organized Labour would not tolerate this innovation unless starved into it; that Labour would fight to the last ditch, would exhaust its financial resources, and lose its organization. Then when Labour was down and out, the Government, with the force of money at their disposal, and the support of the capitalistic press, would be able to impose conscription on Australia. Whether that view of the situation be right or wrong, it is what the bulk of the people believe. </para>

Although they were breaking the agreement with the Government, the same spirit actuated them as actuated Great Britain when she intervened on behalf of Belgium and other small nations.

                            first step was to place an intelligent, college-educated man . in charge of progress in this line. This man had not before handled this class of labour, although he understood managing workmen. He was not familiar with the methods pursued by the writer, but was soon taught the art of determining how much work a first-class man can do in a day. This was done by timing with a stop-watch a first-class man while he was working fast. The best way to do this, in fact, almost the only way in which the timing can be done with certainty, is to divide the man&#39;s work into its elements, and time each clement separately. For example, in the case of a man loading pig- iron on to a car, the elements should be: - Picking up the pig-iron from the ground or pile (time in hundredths of a minute) ; walking with it on a level (time per foot &#39;walked) ; walking with it up an incline to car (time per foot walked) ; throwing the pig-iron down (time in hundredths of a minute); or laying it on a pile (time in hundredths of a minute) ; walking back empty to get a load (time per foot walked).

                            Have you tried the incisive plan of centering on one man instead of going at the whole shooting match at once. I think failure is due to a -lack of patient persistence on the part of the employers, and then to a lack of centering right on to a single man. No workman can long resist the help and persuasion of five foremen over him. He will either do the work as he is told to or leave.

                        <para>The recent report of the House Committee on Labour upon the Taylor system of shop management emphasizes the physical effects of &#34; speeding up.&#34; Persistent efforts to have this system introduced into the War Department have resulted in its partial installation in the Watertown and Rock Island arsenals. Those establishing this system have concerned themselves principally with &#34;speeding up&#34; the workmen. </para>
                        <para>The report divides the system under three headings - standardization, systematization, and stimulation. The expense incurred for the first and second purposes of the system falls upon the operators; the costs of the third, stimulation, are paid by the workers in their physical health. This the House Committee&#39;s report recognises: - </para>
                        <para>The Taylor system regards the workman as a machine to be &#34; speeded up &#34; to its maximum capacity.- When this human machine fails to function to the satisfaction of the management it is to be cast aside to make room for the new machine fresh workman. The authors of the system do not appear to have concerned themselves about the ultimate fate of the human derelicts who may be compelled to drop out because they cannot stand the pare. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Taylor</inline> boasts that when he installed his system in the Bethlehem steel works he purposely made the tasks so hard that not more than one out of five labourers, perhaps even a smaller percentage than this, could keep up. . . . </para>

                        <para>The Taylor system endeavours to work men up to the very edge of a breaking strain. Stopwatch observations are used as a basis for setting a pace for workers. Upon the effectiveness of this method the House Committee on Labour quotes from a report made to the Sixty-second Congress. &#39; Two members of the present Cabinet) Secretaries  Redfield  and Wilson, were members of the Committee making the report, which said in part - </para>

A machine is an inanimate thing - it has no life, no brain, no sentiment, and no place in the social order. With a workman it is different. He is a living, moving, sentient, social being; he is entitled to all the rights, privileges, opportunities, and respectful &#39; consideration given to other men. </para>

                    <para class="block">The men of America, organized Labour, and the Government of that country have seen the iniquity of the Taylor card system, and by the laws of Parliament have absolutely prohibited its introduction. Yet this is what is endeavoured to be instituted in Australia, the freest country on earth; and the men who fought against it, knowing something of its effect in America, the land of its birth, are called disloyalists. This is the plot which was brought about by the National Government in conspiracy with the State Government to break down organized Labour in this country, so that they would be enabled to inflict on it in its weakened condition conscription that they could not enforce in any other circumstances. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator might be quite innocent in regard to the matter, but I tell him frankly that there is a very small minority of people in Australia who believe that there was not a conspiracy between the Federal Government and the State Government to destroy Labour in Australia. That is why Labour has no faith in honorable senators opposite ; that is why it can have no sympathy with them, and will not believe them. Labour has ample evidence of what was sought to be- inflicted upon it, and believes that when the strike was brought about it was a deliberate plot to destroy the workmen of this country. </para>

I do not believe that he would be a party to this kind of thing, but there are many tilings done under the present Government which he and others on the opposite side know nothing about. There are a number of honorable senators who have gone away from the Labour party and are now on the side of the so-called Win-the-war Government. They are constant in their recriminations against, honorable senators on this side; but while they claim to be still &#34; Simon Pures &#34; of Labour, they stand behind the Government who have been guilty of this thing. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator may say what he pleases, but I do not think he will get many people in this country to believe what he has said. Before the strike there was a card system in vogue in the Randwick  work-shops,  as there is in almost every, business place in Australia. That system is intended only to enable a person to find out definitely what it will cost&#39; to produce a certain article in connexion with any kind of business. But that was not the object of the introduction of the new system. Its object was to get the limit of the capacity of the manhood employed at the workshops out of the workers. That is  why  they fought it. Organized Labour recognised the fairness of the costing system in operation previously in connexion wit! every business in the country. But th&#60; workers fought the system introduced in New South Wales, because, whether they were justified or <inline font-style="italic">not, they</inline> believed  that it was the Taylor system that was t&#60; be imposed upon them. They went  fairly  to work in making known their  objec-tions  to <inline font-style="italic">it.</inline> . Surely they made a  fair  offer to the Government when they said &#34; We are prepared to fight this thing, i necessary, but we do not want to fight Permit a Judge to - investigate the pre posed system. Hold up your order fo one week for that purpose, and if he <inline font-style="italic">dfcides</inline> against us, we will accept the ne1 system during the term of the war.&#39; What could have been fairer than that? </para>

                            <para>- I am not admitting it, but even suppose they did go on strike first, what was wrong with that&#39;* Surely it would not be the first time that organized Labour, or other bodies in this country, made a mistake. The Government were responsible for holding up the business of the country at the time of that strike. Supposing it is admitted that the men did go out on strike, was that a sufficient warrant for throwing this country into the great trouble that we had at that time? Anything would have been better than that. If the suggestion of the workers had been accepted, the commerce of the country could have been carried on properly. The Federal Government would not have exercised any great magnanimity if they had used their war powers, as they did in connexion with many far more insignificant matters, and had at that time said to the New South Wales Government, &#34; We are running Australia; the trade of this country must be gone on with.&#34; They might have said to Holman, or to Beeby, or to whoever else was standing in the way, &#34; Get out of the road; we are going to appoint a Judge to deal with this matter. We intend to investigate the cause of the trouble.&#34; They might have settled that matter as they. . have settled many other things in Australia. It did not take them long to pass a regulation to deal with persons who, according to them with telling lies, or to stop racing in this . country, which if it went on for 500 years would not do as much harm to the country as the strike did in one month. They refused to put their powers into operation to continue the industries of the country, and yet they expect the men of the working class to come crawling on their knees to the recruiting  depots  and say, &#34;Yes, we will go and fight for these people who are trying to crucify us.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- They decided to commandeer all rabbit skins.  Rabbiters  were compelled to send all skins to the Government, and sell them to them at a certain price. They had no option to do anything else, and in nine months, from April last year until December last year, the Government made a profit of &#163;230,000 on the skins commandeered from the  rabbiters.  Surely that is a plain enough statement. </para>

                            <para>- I am contrasting the methods adopted by the Government in wringing the last copper out of the poorer sections of the community and letting those who are well able to pay go practically free. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline>  has the reputation of being a fair-dealing man, and I believe that he deserves that reputation. If he does he should not object to the people who in this country are best able to bear taxation doing their share of paying for the cost of the war. I should imagine that he would be one of the last to object to that. I am not growling about the price wool-growers are getting for their wool, but. objecting that a Government professing to be the friends of the people should allow this kind of thin? to go on, and then expect the workers to believe all they are told, to throw themselves into their arms and let the Government do as they like to them. The Government have bought all the wheat of the country, and have promised farmers 4s. per bushel for this year&#39;s crop, and when the strike was on they organized, with the help of some members of the Senate, a bogus union which is now in operation. I have here a set of the rules of this bogus union, one or two of which I propose to inflict upon the Senate. </para>

What have you to say to that, you people who know something about organized Labour ; something of its methods and achievements- in Australia during the last quarter of a century? Here is another white-slave business put upon the worker.

I want to show honorable senators the sort of thing that is growing up under the protecting wing of the Win-the-war Government, and to see how much evidence there is in support of the claim of certain honorable senators opposite that they are still as loyal to Labour, and as able to safeguard its interests as they ever were.

These are the men who are doing their best under the protection of the Government to disorganize the Labour forces. We were told by the daily press, when the fight was on, that 6,000 men were doing the work on the Sydney wharfs that the strikers had refused to do. We were told that they were magnificent specimens of manhood, physically splendid fellows, able to handle bags of wheat and wool like an ordinary man would handle a tin of sardines. They were called the loyalists of Australia, and were camped in some park near the Zoological Gardens in Sydney. When the strike was over, the New South Wales Recruiting Committee, backed by the Government, sent their most eloquent and powerful speakers to address them. They did it in these terms : &#34; You have rendered magnificent service to Australia doing the work on the wharfs while the disloyalists and traitors refused to do it. You have done it splendidly. There are 6,000 of you here now, The strike is over, and we have no further use for you at that kind of work, but we offer you now plenty of opportunities where you can give free play to your manly propensities at the Front. How many will go?&#34; Out of these 6,000 loyalists - the saviours of the country, camped in that park - they got six. The men who have been filling the gaps in the trenches have come from the trade unions in the various States, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Donald</inline> Mackinnon the Director-General of Recruiting, in rebuking some one who said that the unionists were not doing their share in the fight, said that Newcastle and Broken Hill, the two places where industrial troubles occur most frequently, had given the greatest number of recruits per head of population. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. I give every man who has gone there to fight all the credit to which he is entitled. No one can do anything but respect and admire the man who goes to lay down his life for what he believes to be right. But when it is said that organized Labour is doing its best to stop the war, and to keep men from going into the firing line, I strongly resent it. The records of the trade unions show, without any possibility of refutation, that it is the trade unionists who are the backbone of the fight. I know that any number of men have done gallant deeds there who never knew what a Trades Hall was, and never supported Labour. Perhaps they did their best to crush it. They are doing their bit in the war, and I have no fault to find with them for that. But, in reply to those who say that organized Labour has not done its share, let me repeat that my own union has over 30,000 members fighting, which is no small contribution to the fighting forces of Australia. </para>

                    <para>It has been said - I think wrongly - that the gaps in our fighting forces have hot been filled as fast as was desirable. I hold that, under the voluntary system, as many recruits were being obtained as were needed. Yesterday, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> was speaking, I asked what was being done with the 6,500,000 men that Great Britain has in , her Army, and was told that she had not that number of soldiers. But, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Auckland</inline> Geddes, whose speech on the introduction of the Man -Power Bill recently appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> the Allies are still substantially superior to the enemy, even after the defection of Russia and Roumania. He says that the Empire has up to date raised 7,500,000 men. Then <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith,</inline> when attacking <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.- Lloyd</inline> George about his Paris speech a couple of months ago, said that the Government had brought the British Army up to seventy divisions, that is, 1,400,000 men. If it be true that there are 1,400,000 men in the trenches on the various fronts, and 7,500,000 have been raised altogether, there must be 6,100,000 who are not fighting. They are being used, I suppose, to support and to furnish the relief. Roughly, there are four men who are not fighting behind every man in the firing line. A number of persons in Australia have said that if we do not send reinforcements faster our men will have to be withdrawn from the trenches. Well, if they had to be withdrawn, if Australia said, &#34; Our manhood is exhausted; we cannot send more men, and our five divisions must have a rest,&#34; could not these 100,000 men be relieved by some of the 6,500,000 who are not fighting? I am not saying that I want this to happen. </para>

                            <para>- I have talked with a number of men whose wounds are evidence of their activity at the Front. They have told me what is happening there. Some of the things are calculated to make one open his eyes. Whether we can keep five divisions reinforced must depend on the duration of the war. We have kept them reinforced until now, but we could not go on reinforcing them were the war to last five years. I think that the figures show that there is not a large reserve of eligibles in the country, and the compulsory draft of 7,000 per month would have exhausted that reserve in a very short time. If you take up the newspapers you will find that in the Town Hall, in Melbourne, where recruits are offering every day, perhaps eight will be accepted out of thirty volunteers, the&#39; rest being rejected as medically unfit. That has been going on for about three years, so that by this time the great bulk of our manhood must have been through the recruiting offices. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. Like most Australians, they are very willing, but the figures seem to prove that there are not the number of  eligibles  that the Government say are required. On the occasion of the first referendum we were told that the Government wanted 32,000 men for une first month aud 16,500 for every succeeding month. They have admitted that they were wrong in asking for so many, and I believe that later they will admit they were wrong in asking for 7,000 a month at the last referendum. The Labour party had to surmount tremendous obstacles during the last campaign, and put up the hardest and most splendid fight in its history. </para>

                            <para>- We were well financed, but not, as it was said, with German gold. The money came from individuals who are as loyal as any in the country, but who considered it so important to the welfare of Australia to keep Australia free that they contributed all that they could afford to that end. They helped Labour to get the victory that stands to its credit to-day. The only way in which the Government can get the country to make its fullest effort is by conduct the reverse of that of the last few months. It has made no secret of its hostility to organized Labour, which it&#39; has done its best to crush. In that it has not succeeded until now. Notwithstanding the defections of gentlemen who assume the credit of having placed the coping stone on the Labour movement, we have been very much better without them than with them, and will continue to do more effective work. Even if those now in the party drop out, the movement itself will continue. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable senator wishes to hear my grand speeches, he must remain in the chamber. To my mind, Labour will never again have any faith in the men who have, gone from its ranks. It would be too much to expect that the men and women all over Australia who had reposed great confidence in them, and who were largely responsible for putting those men into the positions which they occupied in the political life of this country, will ever have faith in them again. We know that a Labour  representative  has to submit to the will of a majority of his colleagues. I say that organized Labour made no mistake in regard to the question of conscription. It spoke upon that question unmistakably long before any member of this Chamber, with the exception of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> myself, and a few others, had declared himself upon it. I regret that there were in the ranks- of Labour so many men who owed more to the movement with which they were associated than it ever owed to them, and who were willing to sacrifice it on such a miserable issue. I am sorry that they refused to be persuaded on that memorable occasion, and were thus prevented from doing the best for the movement to which they belonged. </para>

There are thousands of them doing their duty to the Empire on the battlefields of Europe today.

The Government stated that they would adopt a certain course if the electors did not vote in the way that they desired, but they failed to respect their promise. In such circumstances, how can they expect the people to have confidence in them? Had they done what honorable men would have done in similar circumstances, they would have got out. They might have been back in their positions in a comparatively brief - period, but the people would have realized that they had respected their pledge.

                            <para>- I assume that the persons who give the public of this country information&#39; relating to unemployment investigate the position for themselves. Probably the unemployed register their names at the Labour Bureau. That being so, they must be credited with a desire to obtain employment, but they cannot make jobs for themselves. Surely it is the duty of the Government to do something in that direction, particularly at this time of the year, when there is usually more employment offering than there is at any other season. If there are unemployed in our midst now, the position will be much worse before the winter is over. It is a nice thing to learn that there are 500 returned soldiers out of work. That circumstance will cause eligible men, who might otherwise feel disposed to enlist, to ask what would happen to themselves if, after their service abroad, they were fortunate enough to return to Australia. It could not be expected that recruiting would go on satisfactorily under these handicaps, and it is nearly time that the Government did something to remedy the position. I sympathize with the Minister in charge of the Senate^, for I recognise that his hands are pretty full; but I do not think the Government &#34;will meet &#34;with any opposition from any member o&#39;f this Parliament if they will come forward with a reasonable proposition that- </para>

                            <para>- We on this side of the Senate are not supposed to have anything to do with the policy. This responsibility rests upon the Government and their supporters, as they are in occupation of the Treasury benches. Had we been given the opportunity in the recent crisis, we would have had a policy. &#34; It might have been an unsatisfactory one from the point of view ,of honorable senators opposite; but, at all events, we would have had a policy, and have been prepared to give legislative effect to it.- The people now expect a definite policy from the Government, not that Parliament shall be summoned to meet for nine days, and then adjourn for a couple of months, so that this country may be governed by regulations;- without any parliamentary discussion at all - approved by two or three men meeting in Cabinet, where the business, I believe, is controlled principally by one man. The sooner the Government alter their methods, and achieve something of a practical character, the sooner will they have the confidence of the people of this country restored to  them. </para>

                            <para>- -Before the sitting was suspended I made a reference to the somewhat adverse circumstances in which I was called upon to reply to this debate. I must say, however, that the brief interlude which we have enjoyed enables me to face the prospect with a somewhat lighter heart. I shall endeavour to detain honorable senators for as brief a period as possible, but I feel that there are some statements which have been made in the course of this debate that justify me, even at this late hour, in trespassing upon their time and patience. Complaint was made by more than one  speaker  that I introduced this Bill in the very briefest of terms without any statement coming from the Government. I was surprised to hear criticism of that character, for I knew of no subject upon which I should have been called at that stage to speak. The Government, through me,, was asking the Senate for Supply. The motion for the first reading df such a Bill, as honorable senators are aware, presents an opportunity for any one to speak, and the speeches made on such a motion are generally in the nature of complaints. I had no complaint to make. It is not to be supposed  that I could anticipate any cause of complaint on the part of others; still less is it to be supposed that I was1 to enter upon a defence of the Government before it had been attacked. Any one but an amateur in politics would know that not&#39; only was there no necessity for me to speak at that stage,&#34; but that had I done so I should have departed from a time-honoured precedent. </para>

                    <para>I regret that I am unable to compliment the Senate on the character of the debate that we are just closing. In view of the serious issues involved, remembering that this country is part of .the Empire, and that its fate is still trembling in the balance, one might reasonably have hoped for something more than a re-echo of the noise and din,- the charges and counter-charges, which marked the recent campaign, and which surely might have been kept outside this chamber on an occasion of this kind. </para>
                    <para>I desire, first of all, to refer to some comments by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline> 1 make no complaint of any criticisms of the Government. This was the proper time for those who were disposed to make them to deliver themselves. But I feel I am entitled to ask. the Senate to enter its judgment as to whether those complaints were prompted by a desire to point to some better alternative, to direct attention to a more satisfactory handling of public business, or whether they were made rather as a means of opening the vials of wrath upon this Government, and particularly upon its leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> . </para>
                    <para>Let me remind the Senate of some of the statements that have been made. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> commenced by deprecating the efforts which he said had been made to stir up strife. That sentiment was re-echoed by those of his party who followed him. But complaint of that character surely came very strangely from those who immediately proceeded to indulge in . the most vitriolic of party accusations. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> gave an example of them only  a few minutes ago. </para>

                        at the time, and I invite him now, to produce the slightest tittle of evidence that justifies that charge. Not only was the Commonwealth Government as innocent of the origin of that strike as an unborn babe, but there was in the minds of the State Government, and expressed by the press of Sydney, a very considerable fear lest the Federal Government should interfere and take any part in the struggle. That fear was expressed in the leading columns of the Sydney journals. The way in which they pleaded that the Federal Government should stand outside the ring was, at times, almost pathetic.

                    <para>What caused that strike? We are told that it was the introduction of the card system. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes,</inline> in the most reckless way, attacked the State Government, declaring that there  was an attempt to introduce the Taylor card system. The offer was made to the men that if they would go back to their work there should be an inquiry into the working of that system. They declined that offer, and we know what followed. It is greatly to be regretted that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner, Senator Barnes,</inline> and others did not at that time endeavour to reason with those who look to them for leadership. Instead of doing so, they spurred them on, and stimulated them by every utterance they made in this chamber and outside to do all they could - as far as wor43 could effect that object - to extend the  strike from one end of the country to the other. Having put themselves forward as the promoters of that strike they now seek to blame this Government for having caused it. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly, he was. What is the position to-day? The three months have elapsed; the State Government have appointed a Judge to conduct the promised inquiry, and those who are  afraid of it are the men themselves. They shrink from that inquiry because they know that, in the searchlight of experience, the introduction of the card system is not only going to justify itself, but demonstrate that no injury has been done them. They not only decline to take part in the inquiry, but, following a somewhat ancient expedients- they now impugn the honour and integrity of a Judge to whom has been handed the commission of inquiry. </para>

                    <para>There was another statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> to which I take the strongest exception. I allude to it now, not only because I take exception to it, but as an evidence of the attitude of my honorable friends opposite, who, while they talk about the desirableness of bringing about unity, are doing all they can to create strife. I refer to the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> as to this Government &#34; continuing &#34; to conscript men. This Government have never yet conscripted a man. Dwelling on the phrase &#34; continuing to conscript,&#34; the honorable senator had. but one purpose - that of creating in the minds of the people the idea that, in some, malign way, by some unfair scheme, some method of getting behind the backs of the people, the Government  might venture to intro-&#39; duce the system of conscription which the people had turned down. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> does not believe that the Government would have done anything of the kind, because, had that, been the desire, it could have been effected before the referendum. The Government have honoured its pledge in that regard, and will continue  to do so. The result leaves us exactly where we were on the 5th May, and the people can rest assured that the Government will continue to keep its word to the end. </para>

                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline>
                        made an offer intended to still further create the impression that, if there is not union between the two parties, the Opposition&#34; is not responsible; and he asked whether the Government would accept a proposition, the first clause of which involved the resignation of the Government. I feel certain that, so far as
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline>
                        is concerned, he would feel satisfied if that were also the last clause; that is, indeed, all that he, and those for whom he speaks, desire. The honorable gentleman suggested a Ministry, the names of which I need not run over; but I direct attention to a &#34;.peculiar fact&#39;..
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline>
                        did not fill all the positions, but left one vacant. May I assume that it was his modesty that caused him to refrain from suggesting a name? He is not likely to overlook the number of portfolios, for no man knows it better than he does; and I can only conclude that he thought the members of the Chamber, and the people outside, would instantly supply the missing name. What is the proposition? I will apply a simple test to it. Is it genuine or not ?

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has not ventured to say that it has. I shall see that  to-morrow the honorable senator is made aware of the intimation I am now giving, and I invite him to say whether he is speaking for the official organization and his party. In addition, I wish to ask, as the honorable gentleman has included Labour names, whether, in making this offer, fie Official Labour party is content to waive that provision in  their  .constitution which forbids its members from joining members of other parties. If the answer be in the affirmative, I shall be entitled to submit the offer to my colleagues; but otherwise I can only regard it as what I believe it to be, a species of cheap kite-flying. There is no need for honorable senators to create fantastic Ministries of the; kind. The Prime Minister .has already  stated that, so far as he is concerned, he is quite open to consider any <inline font-style="italic">rapprochement</inline> of my honorable friends. That offer was made, and we are now waiting an answer. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know what the honorable member means by &#34; outside control,&#34; because I regard it as very much &#34;inside&#34; control - the &#34; inside &#34; machine. The rule is known to everybody; indeed, the. members of the National party were taunted with having made an insincere offer, inasmuch .as they knew its acceptance was impossible. The first thing, to ascertain is - whether my friends: opposite are disposed to overlook or set aside that prohibition on their freedom. If not, it <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> idle to continue these suggestions, and create in the public mind an idea that they are anxious for united effort, while all the time keeping up the barrier which renders such effort impossible. Statements have been made here, and in another room not far away, which show that some senators are talking in a way. to suggest they would not be averse to co-operative action with us; but there are others who, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes,</inline> make no secret of the fact that union is impossible for them. I respect those who take up the latter attitude, because we know where &#62;they are; they are as candid here as they are outside. I want the party opposite, as a whole, speaking through its official mouthpiece, either to take up some definite attitude or to cease suggesting what they know to be impossible. </para>

                    <para>I should now like to give my own view. There has been a lot of talk in the press, and in public about the desirability of all parties getting together. Nobody recognises more than I do what a valuable asset such a union would be to Australia, if it were possible. But it is not a question of party; I am not concerned about parties, but about aims. A party is merely a number of people organized for the purpose of giving effect to some object they hold in common. If that is the usual purpose of party, as it ought to be, it is idle to bring men together whose aims and objects are different. There is no value in associating myself with a man whose desire is to go south if my desire is to go north; we might as well talk of unity between right and wrong, or between good and evil, as talk about com.bining men of entirely different aims. 1 </para>

                            <para>- The party on this side has been formed because its members are united on those things they regard as of major importance, and because they are content for the time being to put aside those things which, at this juncture, are of little or no account. What are the aims of the two parties which not only keep them apart, but must do so until there is a modification on one side or the other? The party on this side has been formed for one purpose. When the war broke out, I believe that the people approved of our participating with a clear conception of what was aimed at. When, a little later, it was seen that the Empire&#39;s task was more serious and of greater magnitude, and made a heavier demand on our sacrifices and resources than had been anticipated, it was recognised that we required to make a special effort, and the party on this side was formed to give expression to that view. If I- may reduce the position to a few words, this party &#34;believed that we could not, or ought not, to withdraw from the war until the Empire and its Allies had. secured that for which they went to war; and that) is the belief of this party to-day. </para>

                            <para>- If so, then there is- nothing to prevent union at once. This party was formed with the belief in the minds of its individual members that Australia, or the Empire, could not safely withdraw from the war until it had secured that for which it had entered it. And what was that? It was not a peace founded on an agreement with Germany, because we knew we could not trust such an agreement; we were not open to some more or less fictitious or fanciful repetition of The Hague Convention. Australia, with the Empire, realized that the only peace we could rely on would be one secured when Germany had been rendered impotent for further evil . That was the aim for which this party was formed., and the aim which animates it to-day. Let me supplement that by pointing out that at the present moment there are, speaking from memory, fifteen out of every seventeen people in the world engaged directly or indirectly in this war, and there are twenty-seven nations leagued against the Central Powers. </para>

                    <para class="block">Surely a serious position will confront us if in this contest we fail to secure that for which we entered it. If we cannot succeed now - and by succeeding I mean &#62; relieving ourselves for all time of the standing menace of German militarism - when twenty-seven Powers are allied with us, what chance shall we have in the future, when, perhaps, in less happy circumstances, we are called upon to renew the war on our own account? </para>
                    <para>I have stated what the war aims of the National party are. Let us now see what are the war aims of honorable senators opposite. Of course, it is difficult to get them to speak in more than, the most general terms in regard to what their war aims are. I know that they are not entitled to speak for themselves; they owe allegiance to outside organizations that speak for them, and, therefore, I am entitled to see what those organizations are saying on this point. It is quite true that the Labour members of this Parliament are directly responsible to the Federal organizations, and that the Federal Labour Conference has not yet been held. But the Conferences of the Labour party in the two most populous States - New South Wales and Victoria - have been held, and have set out officially their war aims. The memorandum of the New South Wales Labour Conference commences by saying - </para>

                    <para>Whether the struggle is to be disastrous to us or not I do not know ; but I do say that this official document is a plea to withdraw from the war, whilst we on this side say that we ought to continue to put forward every effort until we secure victory. </para>

On the one hand are the people, and I stand with them, who say, &#34; When we are at war, and the national safety is jeopardized, we ought to make every effort to-day, and leave nought to chance.&#34; On the other hand, is another party which says, &#34; Everything will be all right. Don&#39;t bother ; wait till the trouble strikes you before you make a move.&#34; All through this war Australia has been suffering from this . fatal Macawber-like habit of deferring- action until another day. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> reminds &#39;me of what is being done in Austria, and I wish to range the honorable gentleman&#39;s optimism in that regard alongside the congratulations to the Russian revolutionists,, the hopes of the Labour delegates that similar results will extend elsewhere, and the pathetic hopes that are entertained by the framers of the resolution as to what will happen if we enter into negotiations with the Germans now. Negotiations between the Russian revolutionists and the Germans have opened, and what has been the result? It is given officially in tonight&#39;s paper - </para>

                    <para>There is a Labour Conference sitting in London now, and it is cheering to turn from the statements made here by those who attempt to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds,  who,  while professing with their lips their willingness to prosecute the war, are doing all they can to see the Allies pulled up by something they call a peace - it is, I repeat, cheering and refreshing to turn to what is taking- place in London, and see w,hat a more robust party is doing in England, a party that is just as anxious for peace as we are, and with greater justice. In spite of the fact &#39; that they are nearer to the firing line, where they have had brought home to them the real loss, sacrifice, and misery that war means, as compared with us here, where none of us lose a meal, or a bed, or an opportunity to visit the picture show, they are true to their breed, and are showing a tenacity of purpose which I commend to my honorable friends opposite.

                        <para>Will the German Democracy define its war aims and face its Government as we have faced our Government? The way is open to Germany if the German people and Government sincerely desire a just peace, but it must be a peace leaving no germ for future wars. The military party in Germany to-day is in the ascendant, and a peace agreement under present conditions would mean the fastening of militarism more strongly on the people of Germany, the peoples of the British Empire, and peoples all over the world. Such a peace would only be a draw. We must have a clean peace, and, if it is only obtainable by fighting, then we must go on fighting to the end. </para>

                    <para class="block">If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes/even</inline> with his skilful pen, had been asked to set out -the objective, the aims, and the fervent desire of those following his leadership to-day, he could not have expressed them better than in those words. Until my friends opposite can reconcile what they put forward as their war aim - seeking peace anyhow - without waiting until Germany is destroyed, not as a nation, but as a menace ; until they can withdraw the document to which I have referred, until we can reconcile bodies of darkness with messengers of light, there can be no coalition between us. There can be no coalition between myself and those who seek to go in the opposite direction to that which I conceive to be my duty to the Empire. </para>
                    <para>Let me remind my friends opposite of another thing. Can it be said that the party - speaking of the party, there are individual exceptions, and many of them - is prepared to throw itself loyally into the efforts to obtain recruits ? Can <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> say that he is a fervent believer in the voluntary system ? He cannot say it when he has declared publicly that he will not even invite a man to become a volunteer. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> has said the same thing. Passing- from individuals, there was the resolution passed at the Melbourne Trades Hall practically prohibiting members of the Labour party from going on the recruiting platform. There was a good deal of side-stepping on the part of those responsible for that motion. There was some difficulty in finding out who had moved it, who had seconded it, and who was the  chairman  of the meeting. That the motion was put and passed is a fact that has never been disputed ; and as a motion cannot be put and passed unless there is a meeting, and presumably a  chairman,  and some one to move it, there must have been some officials connected with the Trades Hall who did it. If the party &#39;disclaim any liability in regard to it,&#39; there is a simple way of proving it. Let those connected with the Melbourne Trades Hall pass another motion recalling it. Then we can assume, officially, at any rate, &#39;that Labour places  no prohibition on the freedom of its members to aid in the effort to obtain recruits. I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> and others that when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mackinnon,</inline> on taking charge of the recruiting campaign, asked the Trades Halls in the different capitals to send delegates to confer with him, there was a flat refusal, so far as Melbourne, Sydney, and Adelaide were concerned. I do not know what happened in Brisbane, Hobart, or Perth. </para>

These things stand as a bar sinister on the claim of my friends that as an official party they are sincere and are desirous of promoting the voluntary system. If &#91; am misjudging them, if there is any mistake about the motions that have been carried, if they were agreed to under a misapprehension, it is the easiest thing in the world for that misapprehension to be removed. Let the bodies who have acted in this way publicly renounce the course they took, and say that they are prepared to work together with us in this movement to obtain recruits. </para>

                    <para>In this war it seems to me that we have reached the stage now when it is not so much a question of one army against another as a question of one national temper as against the temper of the opposing nation. It is, in other words, a question of the fibre of the races. That nation which will show the most tenacity, which can hang on longest as a nation, is going to win. A cartoon appeared in a French paper recently which appeared to me to illustrate this point. It represented two soldiers in the trenches under heavy fire. One said to the other, &#39;&#39;I&#39; hope they will hang out.&#34;  His  comrade said, &#34;Whom do you mean?&#34; And the reply was &#34;Why, the civilians. of course.&#34; There was no suggestion that the army would not hang out; but there was some little doubt as to what the nation at home was doing. That is the point. A modern war is not won by an army alone. The army that goes into the field unsupported by the full moral and material strength of the nation to which it belongs goes to its doom. We are trying by the action we have taken, in contradistinction to that of our friends opposite, to let our Allies know that we are nob consenting to a premature make-believe peace, but are willing to go on as far as we are able, not to the bitter end, but- to a victorious end that will give us the things for which we drew the sword. </para>
                    <para>Let me pass from that and deal with some other matters. I think it is very unfortunate, though a little characteristic, that some of our honorable friends opposite should have made the references they did to the action of the Governor-General. I have no plea to put forward on behalf of the Government. They must stand criticism&#39; at all times, and are quite prepared to do so. But I do say there are limits within which honorable senators should, in decency, confine themselves in their references to  His Excellency.  It is an unusual tiling for a Governor-General to send down to Parliament a memorandum setting forth the steps he has taken in calling to his aid a new set of advisers.  His Excellency,  however, did so, and no man can read that document, with an unbiased mind, without coming to the conclusion that, step by step,  His Excellency  has therein set out the reasons which prompted him to invite <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> to accept another commission. Knowing, as honorable senators on this side do, the various events which led up to that, I want to say that there was no possibility in this Parliament of forming a Government with any prospect of continued existence except under the leadership of the Right Honorable William Morris Hughes. Something was said about a precedent for what took place. I do not know whether my honorable friends opposite have brief memories, whether they purposely ignore these things, or pass through life in ignorance of what is happening around them. How long ago is it since, in New South Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman</inline> handed in his resignation and that of his Government, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade</inline> was sent for, and twenty-four hours later <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman</inline> was asked to continue in office. Was it two years ago? I am not sure; it may have been three years ago. That incident occurred to my mind when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> declared that the Labour party could never hope for a fair deal until the position of Governor-General is filled by an Australian. In the particular case to which I have referred, the Lieutenant-Governor, at that time, of New South Wales, was an Australian, and yet he followed exactly the same course that was followed on this occasion by a representative of the King who comes to this country from oversea. </para>

                    <para>It must have been somewhat of a surprise to those who had not read the paragraph to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap&#39;s</inline> statement last night of how the great democratic republic of America treats disloyalists. For declaring that conscription was slavery, some one there &#34;was both heavily fined and imprisoned. One thing about the American is that he does things &#39;properly. When I &#39;hear about that incident, and think of the lamentations and denunciations of my honorable  friends opposite, it strikes me that we have not learnt the A B C of censorship yet. Obviously, with the censors scattered over the continent, acting individually, and not under central control as to details, it -was inevitable, human beings being frail, that many mistakes should occur ; but let me give an instance of the stuff uttered in&#62; the recent campaign. My honorable friends have brought up cases where the censor may have acted precipitately or unwisely ; but quite recently, at the Paddington Police Court, a man named James Breen was proceeded against for using these words at a campaign meeting on the anti-conscription side - </para>
                    <para>Twenty thousand British women were behind the firing line in Prance, doing service work and acting as concubines to the British officers. </para>
                    <para>Should any man be free to make .a statement like that at such a time as this? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> talked about &#34; pimps &#34; going to public meetings, and taking down what is said there; but the man who made a statement of that kind ought never to have been given the option of a fine, as this man was. That case is not singular, for innumerable statements of the kind have been uttered, and are on record, but my honorable friends opposite did nothing to show their disapproval of them. In that case the defendant tendered no evidence, and was fined &#163;5. If I had been the judge, and the law had allowed me, I should have given him an opportunity of ruminating in silence over the true significance of the words he had used. Do my honorable friends who talk about free speech want freedom for that sort of thing? ls that the stuff they would allow when this country is fighting for its very life, when we are struggling to get even dribbles of recruits ? When we were asking the people, and particularly women, for their votes on the question, ought their minds to have been poisoned with stuff of that kind, which was a deliberately &#39; manufactured lie? We are at war. My honorable friends will recognise that things which might be tolerated in peace, and left to the good sense of the community to&#39; be frowned down, cannot be so dealt with at a time like this. . While I freely admit that there has been mistakes, all this nonsense about the censorship is a plea, not for liberty, but for licence. </para>

                    <para>Let me give evidence of what I regard as the rankest hypocrisy. Honorable senators opposite have said that we should give the soldiers higher pay if we want to get recruits. How long is it since they have made that discovery? They argue that the cost of living has gone up, and that the pay which was sufficient three and a half years ago is not sufficient&#39; now. That is perfectly true, but was not the proper time to raise that question on the eve of the first referendum? We had been at war. for two and a half years then, but the Opposition did not suggest that alternative, and the reason was that, whether they believed in the purpose of the referendum or not, they were still under <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes&#39;</inline> banner and still part of the Government party. They did not care a hang then how much &#39;the cost of living had gone up. They did not give it a single thought, but now, when there&#39; is another Government in office, they bring the matter forward, thinking that it gives them an opportunity to embarrass that Government. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator again refers to the Recruiting Committee. That was composed of an equal number of members of both sides, and met on the understanding that its deliberations were to be secret. Every member of it was pledged on his honour to observe that understanding. When I interjected that that pledge had been broken, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Loghlin</inline> said he had read in the newspapers that the same proposals had been discussed elsewhere. I do not dispute it, but that is quite a different thing from giving to them the authority of the name of that Committee, and trying to create in the public mind the impression that that official body &#60; had considered them and put them to the Government and the Government had turned them down. When proposals coming from outside bodies were published in the press, honorable senators were free to talk about them, but when they brought in the name of the Committee, they were guilty, individually and collectively, of a breach of honour. </para>

                    <para>Here is another piece&#39; of hypocrisy?Honorable senators opposite condemn the failure of this Government to levy on 1 wealth). During the conscription campaign the official organ of their party continually declared that this Government are the champions of the wealthy classes, and -it talked of what the Official Labour party would do were it in power, But what did it do when, in May last, it sought the suffrages of the people? As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> has pointed out, it could not then run away from the wealth levy proposal fast enough. Honorable senators of the Opposition threw the proposal overboard then. In the words of their leader&#39;s manifesto, they decided,  &#39; on further consideration &#39; &#39; to abandon it. Apparently now, on still further consideration, they have  decided, for political purposes, to revive the talk about it. The Government which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Loghlin</inline> supported raised less than &#163;2,000,000 in 1914-15 by taxing wealth. He and his party try now to make the people believe that the present Government are not calling on the wealthy to contribute towards the expenses of the war. That is more hypocrisy. In 1914-15 less than &#163;2,000,000 was raised by direct taxation, and in 1915-16, when the members of the present Official Labour party were supporting <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> and afterwards <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> the amount raised by direct taxation was just a little over &#163;6,500,000. But in 1916-17, when they had turned against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> the revenue from direct taxation was only a little under &#163;9,000,000, and this year it will be about &#163;10,650,000. If this Government are shrinking from the taxation of wealth,  what can be said of those who held their tongues on the subject when supporting Governments which raised the insignificant amounts obtained from direct taxation in the early years of the war ? </para>

They are attacking under this Government the things of which they approved when they were supporting a Government. Take the terms of the War Loan. Every one knows my attitude in regard to- that&#39; matter; but not until they went into Opposition did honorable senators opposite find fault with the proposal to exempt War Loan interest from- taxation. They supported that proposal, although invited to vote against it. But, now that they are in opposition to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> they see in the arrangement a dangerous device for fattening the wealthy man. Why did not they discover that before? Either they were stupid then, or they are animated now with a desire, not to do the right thing, but to make political capital at the expense of the man whom -they deserted. </para>

                        brought up the question of the insufficiency of the pay-&#39; ments made to the wives and children of soldiers. I do not want to be misunderstood on this matter. I know that thousands of these women are not as well off as we should like them to be.  There are cases, too, in which, because of special circumstances? many are hard put to it to maintain themselves. But, speaking generally, it is not a fair thing to say that Australia has been neglectful of the interests of these people. We have heard of the maligning of Australia. That has&#39; been spoken of by the very senators who have insulted the country in the most deadly way possible by saying that, having invited soldiers to  fight for us, and having promised to look after their loved ones in their absence, we have failed to do so. Let me give the scale of payments. % The only one for which I feel disposed to make an apology is the first that I shall read. I ask honorable senators to recall what is the basis of the living wage in Australia,- It is assumed that, on the living wage, it is possible for a man with - an ordinary family to live in decency and comfort. Now, it takes something to maintain a husband,- even in his own home. There is his food and his clothing. I do not know what Honorable senators are disposed to allow for that, but I ask them to add something on that score to the allowances that I shall read. In the absence of her soldier husband, a wife receives
                        <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline>
                        10s. lid. per week. If she has one child: she is paid
                        <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline>
                        19s. 9d. per week; if two children, &#163;2 4s. lid. ; and so on UP to
                        <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline>
                        19s. Adding to those sums the amount necessary to maintain a. husband at home, it will be seen that the vast majority of these women are as well off financially as if their bread-winner were home. As an  honorable  senator interjects, some of them are better off.
                    </para>
                    <para>Yes. But, taking the average, and the claim of honorable senators opposite that our soldiers have gone chiefly from the ranks of the workers, it is plain that, making an allowance for the cost of maintenance of the husband, these women have as big an income to Spend when their husbands are away as they would be likely to have if they were home. Let me now deal with another class - the class of women whose husbands are here, either in camp, or after their return from service abroad. In Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria a soldier, after enlistment, and before he embarks, and also after his return and before his discharge, receives 50s. per week, a man and his wife receive 65s. per week,, in addition to 5s. a week for- the first two children under sixteen years of age; and 2s. 6d. per week for every additional child. Can anybody say that that is an allowance- of which Australia need be ashamed ? . It is true that in South Australia the committee have not seen their way to adopt the higher scale. In Western Australia and Tasmania the assistance granted is- not based on a definite scale, but is determined, by the necessities of each case. In addition to this scale of allowances, the committees in Sydney and Melbourne, and I believe in the other States, make special allowances under special circumstances. For instance, where there is sickness or death in a family, special allowances are granted. </para>

The authorities in Sydney tell me that they frequently experience a deal of trouble with, women who outspend their incomes. But it is safe to say that under the auspices of the committees to which I am referring, the great majority of these women are being carefully looked after, and are able to live comfortably. </para>

                    <para>There is just one other statement which has been made during the course of this debate, and which I take the opportunity of denying. I refer to the suggestion that France is charging Great Britain for the occupation by British troops of a portion of French soil. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> and others have talked about paying rent for the dug-outs. I feel sure that no serious-minded man would ever credit such a suggestion. But by constant reiteration, of this libel, there is a danger that somebody outside may be led to believe it. What is happening in France is this: No charge is made for the occupation of land for purely military purposes, but where our troops are- billeted, on. the French inhabitants the British authorities pay for them on the same scale as would be paid by the French Government for French troops. Similarly, when a; building; is: taken over for, say, hospital purposes, we pay rent for it. The French Government does likewise. But that is a totally different thing from the implied charge that France is acting as a rack-renting landlord by charging our soldiers rent for&#39; the dug-outs in which they are fighting. </para>
                    <para>I have nothing more to say except to tender an apology to honorable senators for having trespassed so long on their time at this hour of the morning. However, I felt that certain things had been said during the course of this debate which I could not pass unnoticed. I have already referred to the fact, as a reminder to those who so constantly attack the Prime Minister, that I and my colleagues accept our full share of responsibility for what has been done regarding the pledge of which we- have heard so much. Consequently, if there be any odium attaching to .him, it equally applies to us. There is no colleague of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> to-day who does not share with&#39; him the opinion that the feeling which underlies the criticism of which I speak has been engendered, not so much by any anxiety to see him redeem his pledge, as by the desire to see him led out as a scapegoat into the political wilderness. Not only shall we be no parties to any such attempt against him, but we shall do our utmost to de-, feat it. </para>

                    <para class="block">I wish to set out its scope and purpose. The Bill is intended to cover the requirements of the Government for the months of February and March, and makes provision for a total appropriation of &#163;2,284,037. On the 10th January a Supply Bill was introduced in- another place covering a period of three months, and providing for a total expenditure in excess of &#163;3,000,000. By arrangement, that Bill was reduced in amount to cover  requirements of one month, and the Allotment for that month was deducted from the total I have just mentioned, leaving the amount of the Bill before the Senate at &#163;2,284,037. From 1st January, 1918, the system of actual fortnightly payments of salaries has been instituted in place of that of bi-monthly payments, which has been in. force hitherto, and the result is an extra pay-day falls due on the 5th April. The provision required on this account, &#163;45,000, is set out in the Bill. No provision is made for any services not previously authorized by Parliament; but provision is made for increases of salaries under the Public Service Act and arbitration awards. In other words, the Bill merely makes provision for the ordinary public services upon the lines of the Supply Bill previously approved. </para>

                            <para>- It does not matter whether the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> publishes it or not; it is a fact. But, of course, there has been uo &#34; sponging &#34; on the public funds either by the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> or by any member of this Parliament. I may point out that the audit is made on 30th June, which is the end of our financial year ; and the monthly accounts are not sent out until the following day, so that of the &#163;152 shown to be due to the refreshment-rooms on 30th June, the amount remaining unpaid at the end of the succeeding month would be a very moderate sum indeed. Our refreshment rooms are not like any other business. They are not conducted on an absolutely cash basis. Every member has the right to run monthly accounts; and Ministers, accustomed to entertain visitors from other States, ,also enjoy this privilege. This course must necessarily be followed, because it is impossible to&#39; state exactly what will be the cost of meals&#39; immediately they are supplied; and, as I have already said, the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> both run monthly accounts with respect to refreshments supplied to their reporters engaged on journalistic work in-&#39; this Senate. It is a convenience all round, and I wish to inform the Senate and the country that, ever since the refreshment  rooms have  been established, we have not lost a single farthing by way of bad debts. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps that is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas&#39;</inline> view with regard to liquors; but I have no doubt he protested considerably against the increase in other items.- I want to point out, also, that, up to the date of audit, the increases could not possibly have affected last year&#39;s accounts, because they were made at a date subsequent to the audit. Further than that, I desire to say I have compared the cost of our parliamentary refreshment rooms with the cost of similar rooms in the different State Parliaments, and I can say frankly, without fear of successful contradiction, that the cost of our rooms and the service provided compare very favorably indeed with any others. The reason why there must inevitably be a loss here is that these rooms are run for the convenience of members of Parliament, a convenience which is shared to the full by the Press representatives engaged here, and in order to carry on the business of Parliament at the most convenient hours of the day. Parliamentary sittings mostly take place in the evenings, and frequently extend into the late hours of the night, as on the present occasion, and, in order that honorable members &#39; can conveniently and without undue hardship fulfil their duties on such occasions, the refreshment rooms axe. necessary. Ministers have to attend to their departmental work during the day, and it is more convenient for Parliament to sit in the evening. That being so, we must have refreshment rooms in the buildings, otherwise Ministers would not be able to remain constantly in attendance and to give to &#39;the discharge of their duty that attention which is naturally expected of them. Because of this, and because of the uncertainty as to the extent of the demands that will be made on the refreshment rooms, and the intermittent character of the service required, a loss must inevitably occur. When both Houses are sitting, and a full attendance of members is expected at dinner, provision may be made for, perhaps, 250. As the result of an unexpected development, however, the sittings may be suspended, perhaps, at 4 p.m., the mem  bers  disperse, and the whole of the preparation made for serving dinner for 250 is practically wasted. These are the causes that make it inevitable that we  should.  have a loss. Instead of this continual vomiting of abuse upon the refreshment rooms, and every other institution of Parliament, these newspapers would do well to make themselves a little better acquainted with the facts, and to be a little more fair -and just in their criticism. </para>

                        <para>. - Under the heading of &#34;Public Service Commissioner&#34; provision is made for salaries amounting to &#163;2,123. I should like to draw the attention of the Minister for Repatriation to the fact that we have still only an acting Public Service Commissioner. This is one of the most important offices under * the Government, and I fail to understand why we should have had an acting commissioner for nearly two years. Either a permanent appointment should at  once  be made, or reasons should be given for the delay. I take it that an officer who is merely acting head of a Department has not the same prestige and control over his staff as he would have if his appointment were permanent. I believe a special Act of Parliament was passed some  two  years ago to provide for the appointment of an acting commissioner, but I think that this is a very long period for such a position to remain unfilled by a permanent appointment. </para>

                        <para>. - In connexion with the provision made for the Attorney-General&#39;s Department, I wish to ask the Leader of the Senate if it is the intention of the Government to add to the Commonwealth police force, and, if, not, whether they intend to abolish it. I presume the control of the force is vested, in the Attorney-General&#39;s Department since the Attorney-General himself created it. </para>

This Government has only recently been formed, and it is not unfair, I think, to ask my honorable friend to be as generous in his treatment of it as he has been in the treatment of previous Administrations. Speaking for myself, I should say that the force will be added to if additions are shown to be necessary, but not otherwise. </para>

I understand that when  some time  ago the question of reducing racing was under consideration, it was decided that various racing institutions should have a reduced number of days allotted to them. Under that arrangement the race-courses controlled by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wren</inline> were allotted a certain  number of racing days in Queensland - I think twelve. After a while, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wren</inline> approached the Minister for Defence with a request that he might be allowed to forgo his right to eight meetings in consideration of being allowed to hold three extra ones in Brisbane. Pot reasons that) the Minister for Defence thought good, that arrangement was approved. / </para>

                        with regard to the pay of men in the Ordnance Department. The only answer . that I received was that the matter was receiving consideration. It has been under consideration for over twelve months, and I know that there is a good deal of dissatisfaction in the Department. The pay of some of the foremen is less than that of the ordinary hands, and there has been no promotion for a considerable time. The Government should give some attention to this matter and furnish a more definite answer than I have been able to get so far.

As a recently elected senator, I have no knowledge of any report having been made available since the war began on any matter connected with the Defence Department. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline> Chalmers, a well-known business man in Sydney, is at present formulating and completing a report on the business dealings of the De fence Department. When that report has been considered by Cabinet will it be available for honorable senators? We are told from time to time that business men are investigating and recommending in this direction and that direction, but we are never told anything about their conclusions. Their reports may be acted upon or they may not. The veil of secrecy should be lifted to some extent from the Defence Department, which is admitted to be spending &#163;60,000,000 or &#163;70,000,000per annum. Unless these reports are made available to honorable senators we can only come to the conclusion that the Minister dare not let us see them. </para>

Even if it were necessary to hold a secret session of the Senate, I should be very glad if the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> would take us completely into his confidence. We must always bear in mind that the Defence Department is spending probably two or . three times as much as the whole of the other Departments put together, and a very tight rein on it should be kept. I have mentioned in debate that there are round pegs in square holes and square pegs in round holes, and there are few military officers as such fit for many of the civilian positions they are occupying now. </para>

                        <para>. - Before Parliament went into recess I raised a question on the last Supply Bill concerning the double charges for the use of trunk line telephones on Sundays. I received no reply from the Post and Telegraph Department. I have since then seen the Minister representing the Postmaster-General, and, as a result, I have been furnished with a reply. I think we should have some definite reasons given for the charging of double rates on trunk lines on Sundays. We ought to know why the double charge does not apply equally to metropolitan areas as well as to the country. </para>

                            <para>- I think they are; but that applies all round, and not merely to those in charge of trunk line telephones. I should be glad to assist the Government to do away with unnecessary work on Sundays, but if telephonists are at) work on the Sunday I can see no reason why an extra charge should be made for the use of trunk line telephones on that day. . I asked for a return of the revenue from  the  trunk lines on Sundays for three months previous to  the  increase of the rate and for three months subsequent to that increase. I received a reply that the preparation of such a return would be rather expensive. I was surprised to learn that it would take time and would be a costly matter to prepare such a return because we have a very good accountant and staff in the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department, and I was in hopes that since the initiation of the new system of keeping the accounts of the Post Office <inline font-style="italic">iti</inline> would not be difficult to get the information I sought. I later asked for a return&#39; of the revenue from the Sydney and Melbourne trunk lines for the Sundays for three months prior to the increase and three months subsequent to that increase. I have been informed that the revenue for the first three months was &#163;114. and for the period during which the charge was raised from 5a. ito 10s. the revenue was &#163;139. An increase is shown, but it is not anything like double the revenue derived at the lower rate. If no greater work is thrown upon the telephonists, and there is no material, increase in the revenue as the result of the increased charge, I think it would be better to revert to the lower rate in order that an increased number of persons might be able to take advantage of the trunk line telephone. In the reply furnished to me the statement is made - </para>

                    <para>The retention or otherwise of the present practice is not dependent upon the revenue question so far as this particular class of the Department&#39;s .work is concerned, hut on the policy of the Department generally. </para>
                    <para>I direct attention to that statement. I want to know what is the general policy referred to. If the change which has been made does not depend on the revenue question on what does it depend? I can quite understand that the Department is not run entirely as a commercial institution, though there should be&#62; a decent effort made to square the ledger. Services, such as country mail services and telephone services in country districts, are granted for which the Department does not obtain full value, which is quite right, but it seems strange to me that the doubling of the trunk line telephone rates on Sundays should be said to be due to the general policy of the Department. There is one other point to which I should like to refer. I should like to know how much of the revenue from trunk line telephones, and especially from the Sydney and Melbourne line, is received from the public and how much upon O.S. messages. I am told that I cannot, get that information, and the statement of revenue supplied to me covers the revenue from, both classes of messages. If that is the way the books are kept in the Department, I have not so high an opinion of the system as I had previously. </para>

                            <para>- I did, and thought I had done something for the Post Office and the country. The staff is still there, and I still have a very high opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Haldane,</inline> the Chief Accountant; but if the Department does not know what the revenue is for On Service work and what from the general public, it is about time it did. I recognise that no Department should do work for any other without getting credit for it. I was surprised to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> say that the rate for Sunday work for telephonists was time and a half. I thought they were paid double rates. The Department may argue that as it has to pay extra for Sunday labour, it is necessary to charge more for the service rendered; but, if it is so, why is not the extra charge applied to the metropolis? When telephones are established in country districts, they might as well be used on Sunday for social messages as much as possible. I asked a question to ascertain the number of telephonists employed before and after the increased charge, to see whether the double rate was devised in order to lessen the work on Sundays, but found it had not affected the amount of labour employed, as only one telephonist had been used at each end. If the Government says it is not a matter of revenue, but of general policy, to charge double rates to the people in the country on Sundays, will the Minister during the adjournment inform me what the Government policy is, and why double rates are being charged on Sundays for telephone calls in the country and not in the city? </para>

Probably he is no better informed now, though it is a remarkable thing that, when a Bill to provide two months&#39; Supply for the services of the Commonwealth is introduced, no information should be available to Parliament on a subject like this. The Minister probably realizes that he occupies a very absurd position. </para>

Therefore, the honorable senator is not now in order in speaking about a matter which he had full opportunity to deal with when the Supply Bill was in Committee, and I rule his remarks out of order. </para>

We have been sitting only a couple of weeks, and so cannot be considered hard-worked, and there is no reason why we should not meet next week to discuss these motions. The regulations under the War Precautions Act which the honorable senator wishes to have disallowed were passed by the last Government, and the Minister who represents the Government here has reminded us that this is an entirely new Administration. We should have an opportunity to place before this new Government reasons for disallowing the regulations.

Hitherto, as I have already pointed out, a Government has been known by the name of the Minister at the head of it. We have never yet had a Government calling itself the Protectionist Government, the Free-trade Government, the Labour Government, or assuming any similar title. From the 22nd October, 1915, until the 14th November, 1916, the Government was known as the Hughes Administration. Then, for some reason, Ministers christened it the Commonwealth War Administration, bub, since the 17th February, . 1917, they have assumed the title of the Australian National War Administration, and that name appears on the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> cover.I think it is a disgraceful thing for the Government to have done this. The Minister for Repatriation said the other day that Ministers were not responsible for the name appearing in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard;</inline> but my in- information is that they are responsible. </para>

In the same way the Government, owing to their inactivity, find it necessary to use an official publication by this Parliament to intimate to its readers that they are the Win-the-war Government. </para>

                            <para>- But that will preclude me from again alluding to it in this chamber until we reassemble after the adjournment. I thought it might be advisable, after my inquiry had been answered, to refer to the matter again. I cannot say more at this juncture. I hope that to-morrow I shall get the figures which I seek, so that it will not be necessary for me to revive the question. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> has put three definite questions to me. He wishes to know the Department, the fund, and the source from which the money necessary to pay the &#39;Commonwealth police comes. My answers are - Department, Attorney-General;Fund, Treasurer&#39;s Advance; source, the Treasury. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Loghlin</inline> has mentioned certain motions standing on the business-paper in the name of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner..</inline> I do not wish it to be thought that the action taken in connexion with the proposed adjournment of this Chamber was taken with a view to delaying discussion upon those motions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> had full knowledge that the Senate was about to go into recess, and left for Sydney this afternoon with a thorough appreciation of the position. Consequently no complaint on that score can be laid against the Government. In regard to the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes,</inline> I apologize for having said that the Government was not responsible for the Ministry&#39;s title which appears on the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> cover. I have since learned, owing to an intimation received from the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff, that my statement was incorrect, and that the Government are entitled to select their own description of themselves. </para>

                            <para>- I presume that it is thought they are best qualified to select their own name. I am not sure that it is not owing to lack of imagination that the practice has not been adopted in the past. I repeat that I erred unintentionally when I made the statement which I did earlier in the day. My colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell,</inline> has already informed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> that the information which he seeks in reference to the jam contracts will be in his hand some time today. </para>
