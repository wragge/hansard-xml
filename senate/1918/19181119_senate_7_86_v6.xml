In this hour of joy and thanksgiving  His  Majesty desires to express his sincere gratitude to the Government of the Commonwealth, which has so staunchly supported the Empire throughout these anxious years; to the people of Australia, who, conscious of the menace to all civilization, have borne with steadfast determination the long burden of a distant war; and not least to the brave sailors and soldiers of Australia, who by their imperishable deeds have won for themselves undying fame&#39; in assisting to bring our enemies to defeat. And especially in this hour  His  Majesty bears in mind the relatives of those Australian heroes who in Gallipoli and many hard fought fields laid down their lives in the common cause. Those glorious dead the Empire will not forget; and it is His Majesty&#39;s earnest conviction that their sacrifice has not been in vain, but that in dying they have helped to win for the free nations of the earth a peace and ordered security which shall live. </para>

The machine, which ha; just been completed, belongs to a squadron . that was specially designed to bomb Berlin. Some of the machines were actually in readiness to visit Berlin on Monday night, but the flight was abandoned in consequence of the signing of the armistice. The machines are capable of flying over 1,000 miles without  a  stop. Their weight is <inline font-style="italic">7</inline> tons, and they can carry 8 tons. </para>

I point out again, as I have frequently done before, that it is contrary to the Standing Orders for an honorable senator to make a statement in asking a question. No one outside Parliament can have a greater right than a member of the Senate in this regard, and to give permission to the honorable senator to read the statement he has referred to, would give the newspaper correspondent that greater right. </para>

                                <para>- I am sorry to have to take this course to ventilate this grievance. I waited all last week for an opportunity to do so. The question brooks no delay, and calls for consideration by the Legislature and by the Government, both here and in another place. Our Standing Orders permit private members to ventilate grievances of this kind only on the motion for the adjournment of the Senate, or by moving a special adjournment motion themselves. There is something happening at present which ought to be seen to as quickly as possible. I do not want any man to return to Australia thinking that this country has forgotten that he has fought, or what he has fought for; but, unfortunately, if something is not done to remedy the present state of affairs, we shall have a repetition of what occurred after the South African war. The transport of our soldiers from the Old Country should be under civil, and not military, control. I do not want to see our soldiers placed in the position in which some of the soldiers&#39;  wives found themselves on being brought across the water to Australia. One of these women waited on me in Sydney and explained her case to me. I wanted her to bring forward some corroboration of her story, but apparently she went to the Sydney newspapers. The <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Times,</inline> of 10th November, took the case up. That is a widely circulating journal, which has gone throughout Australia, and the Australian public will be misled if the facts, as stated in that issue, are not correct.The article is headed, &#34;The Pathetic Tragedy called Open Berths.&#34; &#34;Anzac&#39;s English Wife paints an Awful Picture of how Soldiers&#39; Wives and Children fared on Shipboard,&#34; and is as follows: - </para>

                            <para>Mercifully, few women know just what an open berth means. On this ship, it meant about 360 women and children packed in bunks round the ship&#39;s hold. In the middle were the tables at which they ate and forms on which they sat. It meant, too, that, unless the weather was fine, these 360 people ate and slept and lived for nearly nine weeks in almost the same spot. It meant an open hatch, tarpaulin covered and airless in bad weather. It meant indescribable noise and dirt, and confusion always going on round mothers nursing their babies, and women waiting to be confined. </para>

                        </para>
                        <para>There were births and deaths on this floating Babylon. Five babies were born before Sydney was reached, and eight children died. </para>
                        <para>There were two hospitals, but one had to be kept for the males, who occupied the forward part of the ship, and so all the cases from the women&#39;s quarters went into the other. Babies were born and died here. A little girl of eight years, operated on for appendicitis immediately after the evening meal, died in this hospital next day. </para>
                        <para>Although it was obviously certain that some births must take place on the voyage, the ship was not supplied with one single midwifery nurse. The matron in charge of the women and the Army nurses did what they could, but they were certainly hampered by want of knowledge. The nurses, too, were to be pitied, as they were journeying home oft leave, and it was hard to expect them to turn to and nurse medical cases. </para>
                        <para>The little wife who tells the story lost her baby soon after the voyage began. The ship&#39;s food was utterly unfitted for women who were feeding their infants, and it required a hardy child to thrive. </para>
                        <para>In the berth next to this mother was another woman with her baby. Both children were removed to the hospital on the same day, and both died shortly afterwards. Incidentally, the ship&#39;s doctor left at Wellington. </para>

                        </para>
                        <para>To say that the food was bad on the ship is, this Anzac bride says, to let it off lightly. The women lived principally on army biscuits and stew. The stew was boiled in big pots, and the tea was made in the same vessels, and served with a thick coating of grease floating upon each cup. </para>
                        <para>Passing through the Panama Canal, the ship received quantities of presents in the form of bananas, cases of tinned milk, and other provisions. These things were intended for the women and children: What they really received was one banana each, and one tin of milk to every four passengers. </para>
                        <para>It must be remembered, too, the passages had been paid for by most of these people. Some of them, indeed, had laid out as much as &#163;30 for this accommodation. </para>
                        <para>As has already been said, the weather was consistently bad. The open berths were quite often swamped by the sea. In such conditions meals were an absolute nightmare, although at times the poor passengers had to laugh at some of the accidents that occurred. &#34; I never want to see another moving picture,&#34; said the passenger who told the story. &#34; We lived in a Charlie Chaplin atmosphere at our meals for weeks. We would get the tables laid and sit down, and the stew would be served out. Then the ship would start rolling. Over would go nearly everything. A child . would fall off one of the forms, and his plate of stew would go over and on top of him; and all the time the noise of crockery falling, children screaming, and people being seasick, would be beyond description. Then we went to sleep beside that. About our meals, too, I should like to say that we mothers received no food from about 5.30 or 6 o&#39;clock at night until 8. o&#39;clock next morning.&#34; </para>

                        <para>Briefly, a few of the troubles suffered by these women were dysentery (caused by bad water), awful overcrowding, general noise and squalor, absence of proper bathing facilities (there were two bathrooms for the 360 people), bad food, total lack of privacy, and a plentiful supply of vermin. Add to these sea sickness and dirt, and some idea of an open berth will be gained. </para>
                        <para>There is just one more detail that might be mentioned. Nine days after the ship berthed in Sydney, the passengers were still awaiting the delivery of their luggage. </para>

                            <para>A story of shipboard conditions even &#39;more harrowing than the one published in the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Times</inline> last week, has been told us by a non-commissioned officer, who says he was on  hospital duty on the ship referred to. He amplifies what was said in the previous article  under the heading &#34; The Tragedy Called Open Berths,&#34; and paints a picture of huddled misery that is almost unbelievable. &#34; The food,&#34; our informant says, &#34; was bad, and also scarce, and it was a very hard job for the women to get a second slice of bread. Thewomen&#39;s quarters were a perfect disgrace, and the smell from them was awful. The food was mostly stew, which was badly cooked, and the porridge was very seldom cooked either. &#34; Biscuits, when procurable from ship&#39;s stores, were 3s. a lb., and common ones at that. From ls. to 2s. 6d. was charged for a slice of dry toast. &#34; On the way out, wo had, roughly speaking, three good days, when the hatches could be opened with safety. What with noise, filth, want of good food for the children, and confusion and inconvenience, the women&#39;s hold was a regular bedlam. &#34; Lavatories, of which there were two on the women&#39;s deck, were vile, and things were made worse by some people putting things down them which they had no right to do. There were some under the poop deck blocked up,- near which some of the women slept, or tried to. &#34; The water on the boat was as good as could be expected, but at times it was very dirty. </para>

                                <inline font-style="italic">Shocking Hospital Conditions.</inline>
                                &#34; There were two hospitals. In one were both men and women, and the goings on at times were disgraceful.
                            </para>
                            <para> One hospital was badly fitted up. There was no water of any kind, and the lavatory and bathroom pipes were connected together, so that when the lavatory was blocked up,, which was often, the overflow would come out on the floor and run down the deck, and backwards and forwards into the bath, which could not be used as there was no water, although there were two taps. You would have to climb the steps to get into it to turn the water on, as the tap was at the far end. The connecting pipe was eventually cut, but the bath was never fixed up so that it could be used. &#34; At one port, some people came aboard, and when they saw the women&#39;s quarters, they said they would not keep pigs there. They treated us wonderfully well, and from them we received 240 tins of milk, boxes of chocolates, 100 sandwiches and cakes for the hospital, which- they never received. &#34; As regards the issue of milk to the women, I myself gave out, unopened, 600 tins during the voyage, including the 240 tins given by the American Rod Cross. </para>

                                <inline font-style="italic">Good Work by Army Sisters.</inline>
                                &#34; The Army Sisters did all in their power for the women in hospital; but they were greatly handicapped through, inadequate conveniences. Everything that was possible was done for the babies that died by the nurses and military doctors. &#34;One little girl was operated on in the evening within three hours of having had midday meal, comprising fish and potatoes, and a good helping of tapioca pudding, which I gave the mother to give her, little dreaming that the child was to be operated on so soon. Otherwise, she would never have got it from me, as I have been connected with hospital work for seven years, and I have never known a person to be operated on for appendicitis with a full stomach, of which the doctor had knowledge. &#34; The ship was not supplied with any nurses, so, therefore, the work fell upon the Army Sisters, one of whom had some knowledge of midwifery,&#39; and did all she possibly could, with the aid of the others, for the benefit of the new-born and the mothers.

                                <inline font-style="italic">Food not from the Ship&#39;s Stores.</inline>
                                &#34; There was ample food of sorts for the hospital, mostly supplied by the mothers and the American Red Cross, who are to be thanked for their kindness. &#34; I myself, whilst in charge of the hospital, gave and . distributed in various ways: Milk, 600 tins; malted milk, about 40 lbs.; arrowroot, 30 lbs.; and various patent foods for children in great quantities. And very little of this came from the ship&#39;s stores. . &#34; In one storm in the Atlantic, a lifeboat and the women&#39;s cook-house were smashed, and the water just went down the hatchway in tons, where there was nothing but noise and confusion caused .by the floating backwards and forwards of boxes, trunks, bags, &#38;c, and a lot of women in hysterics. &#34; I and a night orderly found a young woman (single) half-dressed in a .fit, with a lot of semi-nude women around her. &#39; The young lady in question w.as weak and exhausted through insufficient food.

                                &#34; I am a single man, and I may say that I was in close attendance at all deaths and births, and I hope to God that I never have another voyage like it. &#34; Our bathroom and lavatories were all smashed, and for some days we had to use a part of the women&#39;s lavatories. Our bathroom was never replaced, and the temporary lavatory which was fixed up was a perfect disgrace. &#34; We left the vessel towards the end of last month, and I myself met some of the women in Sydney on the 7th inst. who were still waiting for their luggage. &#34; There ire several little incidents that I have left out; but these are a few of the main facts, to which I was, an eye-witness - not news conveyed to me by others.&#34;

                <para class="block">It is unthinkable and unbelievable that treatment like this could be meted out to those warmhearted people. Any one who has visited the Old Country will bear me out when I say the people of England, from the highest to the lowest, are very kind to Australian soldiers. They showed us every kindness possible when we were in England as Australian representatives. English girls who are brought out here under such conditions will land here with anything but a good opinion, either of Australia or its Government. Personally, I have had experience in travelling on troopships, both inwards and outwards, and, while the need existed for sending military reinforcements to our boys at the Front, I always adopted the attitude that inconveniences must be suffered. But now that the war is over and our troops are returning, there is no need for their wives to be treated in the way that I have outlined. In my opinion, the curse of military control is alone responsible for that treatment. . In the troopship on which I voyaged to the Old Country, no complaint could be urged against the treatment of the men on board. </para>

It may be that they are under the control of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> or of some of his officers. But my own opinion is that they are under naval control. Something should certainly be done to prevent a repetition of the occurrences to which I have referred. No honorable senator can have the slightest sympathy with the treatment which was meted out to these unfortunate girls. I have been asked by the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> whether there were any military on board this vessel.

                    <para class="block">Nobody can utter a word in justification of the condition of affairs set out in the newspaper report quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall,</inline> assuming, of course, that that report be true. As soon as those statements came under the notice of the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen),</inline> who has to make arrangements from time to time for the return to Australia of the female relatives of soldiers who are to be discharged here, he at once cabled to England to insure that there should be no repetition of the conditions narrated upon any ship on which the people with whom he is concerned will come to this country. We &#34; agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> that if such conditions do exist they should not be tolerated for a single moment. The Government would not shelter anybody who was responsible for permitting such conditions to obtain on any vessel. The Minister for Repatriation, 1 repeat, has already cabled on this matter, and he will follow .up that cable with action which will insure that the people with whom his Department is concerned, shall be brought to Australia under proper conditions. We have on many occasions, as I have told the Senate before, firmly objected to. certain ships being used for this service. Certain ships that are suitable for short voyages are absolutely unsuitable for the .long voyage to Australia. The Navy Department is to-day keeping a strict eye on ships, used for this service, to see that they are such as can be properly  fitted up. and particularly that they have sufficient refrigerating apparatus and space. That is the secret of the whole food problem on these vessels. In nine cases. out of. ten the reason for the complaints about the food can be traced to the lack of proper refrigerating apparatus and space. The Government are taking steps to see that the vessels used in bringing o.ur soldiers to Australia shall be properly fitted in this respect. </para>
                    <para>I do not know that I can add any more. I repeat that the Government do not in any way excuse the kind of thing which has been complained of, and do not tolerate it. I say that in this particular case we disclaim all responsibility. The responsibility is not ours. We shall endeavour to see that, so far as the ships for which we are responsible, and the immigrants . coming out to Australia for whom we are responsible, .are concerned, the condition of affairs referred to, if correct, shall not be tolerated in respect to them. </para>

                        <para>. - So far as the Minister&#39;s reply went, it was all very well, but to  my mind he missed the real point. He will accept- no responsibility in connexion with this matter. I do not wish to hold him responsible. But I do say that this is a matter in connexion with which the Government should make some provision, even if it be necessary to hastily pass a law by the suspension even of the Standing Orders to secure that if the owners of vessels bring people to this country under the conditions which have been referred to, their action will not be ignored because the Federal Government disclaim responsibility for it. I take it that outrages of this kind should be resented and punished. Are we to be told that the Commonwealth Government under the law are powerless in the matter ? If they are, the sooner we take to ourselves the power to punish such outrages, and the sooner the Government realize that we must have this power, and that the owners or officers of any ship bringing into our ports passengers who have been so ill-treated must be punished, the better. We should take the power to ourselves to deal with such people, even though it should bring about international complications. </para>

                    <para>I was very pleased to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> express his disapproval of the conditions under which these unfortunate people were brought to this country. But I was not pleased to hear that the Commonwealth Government would not shoulder any of the responsibility. I am very glad that this has not occurred under the military authorities. I have never made complaints about those authorities. I have defended the military authorities from complaints made in this Chamber that they tried to ride roughshod over the civil authorities. I have gone out of my way to defend them against such complaints. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> does not meet the case by saying that this was a private vessel, that the Government are Sorry for what occurred, and disapprove of it, but do not take any responsibility for it. I say that we should punish the ship-owners or the officers of that ship if the statements which have been published are true. If there is no law under which we can punish them, the sooner the law is amended to enable us to deal with such brutality, cruelty, and infamy as was committed on board this vessel, the better.. These outrages were committed on board a British ship, and the sooner people realize that we will not permit any ships to trade with Australia in which passengers are carried in that manner, the better. I am not satisfied with the statement of the Minister for Defence. I am sure that no supporter of the Government will say that the Minister has gone far enough when he says that this was a private vessel, and the Government were not responsible for it. </para>

                        did not submit his motion, nor do I support if, with a view to put the blame for what occurred in connexion with this vessel upon the Government, but every member of the Senate will agree that when our own press is permitted to publish statements of this kind, it is the duty of every representative man in Australia to raise his voice and see that&#39; statements of that kind shall be investigated to the&#39; utmost. If cruelty unheard of and unthinkable has been inflicted upon women coming from Great Britain to Australia, and the Government, are powerless to interfere, it is about time that we assumed the necessary power.

No  man can defend it, because it is not defensible. Inquiries have been made, and the Government say that steps have been taken to prevent the recurrence of such a condition of things. So far so good, and I am in hearty agreement with that. But if the inquiries have convinced the Government that the statements which have been published are so well founded that it is necessary to take steps to prevent their recurrence, it would appear that the statements made are correct. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad that the Government have gone that far. In view of this blood-curdling report, which describes the most wicked condition of things about which I have yet read, though I am not a bloodthirsty . man, and we have had a period of four years of bloodshed, I do think .that I could stand by aud watch the most drastic punishment of the people responsible for the treatment of these women in the way described without shuddering, and would say that it served them right. I repeat that if our laws do not give us the power to deal with ships coming to this country on which passengers are treated in the way described, the sooner we take to ourselves that power, and announce to the world that those responsible for any ship coming into our harbor under similar conditions will be liable to the most drastic and severe penalties, the better. I should like the Government to realize the true position. </para>

                    <para>I think that the motion is wide enough to enable me to refer to the fact that our Australian soldiers will be returning from the Front, and I should like to impress upon the Minister for Defence the importance of not permitting the overcrowding of the vessels by which they will be returned. I have received a statement from one wounded man who has  returned that on the vessel by which he returned there were twice the number of men for which the carrying capacity of the ship provided. I have had no means of checking that statement, but I want to suggest to the Government that in bringing the men back, if they are to be catered for by contract at 2s.- Id., 2s. 3d., 2s. 6d. or whatever the amount may be, it would be well to contract for an additional meal for each man. They should take into consideration the fact that strong, lusty men may not be satisfied with the food supplied by a caterer under&#39; contract. I know that it has, on occasions, been punishment to me to have to travel as a saloon passenger on board a ship. </para>

                            <para>- The war is over, but I wish to say that in the trenches our officers- and privates wallowed together in the same mud, and I hope that on their return the same baths will be made available for them on the vessels by which they return. I hope that we shall not have the best part of the ship set apart for bathing accommodation for a few officers and the worst part left for the accommodation of the soldiers generally. Now that the men are returning to become citizens again, I hold that, from the day on which they embarked until they have reached the shores of Australia, their trip should be made so pleasant that not one disagreeable thought could enter their minds. To pack a thousand men on board one ship would be, I think, under the best of conditions, intolerable. I know that even a saloon passage is intolerable to me. </para>

                        <para>. - I am glad to know that the Government are investigating the subject. There have been some charges made which certainly should be investigated, and the parties responsible prosecuted. One of the most serious of those is with respect to the stealing of the men&#39;s food, and selling it back to them on board. I know that that has occurred. On the vessel on which I returned from England, the men had to pay 3d. each for a cup of tea and a scone in the morning. Complaints were lodged, and the captain ordered all concerned to appear before him, when the charge was repeated in front of three members of the crew, whereupon he told them that if it happened again, they would be prosecuted upon their arrival in Australia. After that, the men got their cup of tea and scone for nothing. I could make public one or two other very discreditable and disgraceful occurrences. At Harefield Park Hospital, I was present at the bedside of Corporal Hitchen, who was prominent in the inauguration of the recruiting march of the Gilgandra &#34; Cooees.&#34; I saw him on his death bed in that hospital. Shortly before his death, I took down, at his request, the most harrowing statement of cruelty that could have been perpetrated upon a man. He was not able to sign it. He was too far gone. Upon my return, I saw his brother and sister, and told them that the deceased soldier wanted the facts made public, and I asked whether I should take steps in that direction. The brother and sister preferred to leave it to me. I thought better of it, after consideration. It seemed to me that I should not make such information public during the war. But now is the time when one may speak; and, if one knows of anything in the nature of cruelties and injustices having been perpetrated, it is right and proper that he should speak. For myself, I shall do so upon every occasion. Recently, in the Senate, I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> asking for information with respect to the transport of a prize bull on board a ship which was bringing some of our soldiers back to Australia, and which animal was occupying room that should have been devoted to the recreation of the invalided men. The Minister replied to the effect that such a thing would not occur again, but I am given to understand that it - was done again. </para>

I told him that I contemplated mentioning it upon the adjournment, hut that if he did not want the information made public, I would not do so. The Minister raised no objection; and, so, having been &#34;cut out&#34; by sessional orders on the adjournment last Friday, I have taken the present opportunity. I desire to make nothing out of this matter, but will endeavour to see justice done. There is no justification for women and children having to wait for nine days about the streets of Sydney for their luggage. I am not complaining of the Commonwealth Government at all, but I desire that they should take action to see that there is no repetition of it. </para>

                            <para>-No ; if it is true, the perpetrators should be punished. It was lack of proper attendance that caused the deaths of some of those children. Is not that a charge that should be sheeted home? Does it not indicate incompetency on the part of officials responsible for sending the vessel on its, voyage without the proper authorities to look after those unfortunate people in their trouble? I do not care who was responsible in the Old Country. He, or they, should be punished, and should stand a trial just the same as if it had been in respect to a breach of civil law. </para>

                        <para>In view of a recently cabled statement made in London by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> at the Dominions press gathering, viz.: - &#34; He had never been able to understand the working of the press censor&#39;s mind. (Cheers.) Perhaps when posterity came impartially to recall the history of these days, it would furnish reasons why the censor of the press had acted as he had done. For his <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes&#39;)</inline> part; he would welcome the day when need for a censor no longer existed &#34; - will the Minister inform the Senate whether, in view of the cessation of hostilities, the Government contemplate the immediate abolition of censorship throughout Australia? </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable senator previously put a question that was quite proper for him to submit to the Government - whether it was possible for the Government to indicate some stages of progress that they thought should be made with the measure. Without referring to the remaining stages through which we have to carry the Bill, seeing that it is a consolidating measure, and with the exception of two portions constitutes a mere repetition of what is already operative law, under which elections have been held, the Government think it is not unreasonable to invite the Senate to join in passing it through this week. </para>

                        <para>- I hope I make myself clear on that point. The honorable senator quoted me as saying, away in the dim, distant, hoary past, that other people besides the Government had rights, and indorsed the view I expressed then, that the Opposition had its rights. I cordially agree, but so has the majority in this Chamber its rights, and so long as the Opposition is given a reasonable opportunity to exercise its rights, it must not complain if the majority claims similar rights and liberties under the Standing Orders. There being only two matters in the Bill which are at all new, it is not unreasonable or unfair to ask the Chamber to dispose of them during the sittings arranged for this week. That is the intention and desire of the Government. </para>

                        should not allow it to go to a vote without the courtesy of a reply. As the clause stands, the Government will be left free at their own sweet will to proclaim any part of it as the law of the land. If one part of it is calculated to injure the Government at Corangamite they can postpone it until after the election. If another part is calculated to benefit them there, they can give effect to it. immediately by proclamation, while holding back all the other provisions. These&#39; are very wide powers for the Government to ask for, especially a Government in the position of the present one, whose Leader in the Senate has announced that they intend to run a Bill of over 2.00 clauses through the Chamber this week. If the Minister desires to do that, I shall not try to stop him. A Government with their majority may run a Bill containing 1,000 clauses, through, for all I care. The Minister knows that I am not particularly interested as to when the Bill gets through, but I am still interested in preserving the right of the Senate to consider measures. Personally, if they put the Bill through this evening it will give me time to get to Monaro. The amendment demands that,- when it is passed by Parliament, the whole Bill, and nothing but the Bill, shall be proclaimed by the Government as the law of the land. Is that unreasonable? Does not that deserve from the Minister the courtesy of a statement as to whether he agrees with it or not? He may agree with the amendment and mean his .silence for consent, but if he does not speak his followers may imagine that he wants them to vote against it. It is usual for Acts of Parliament to come into operation by proclamation as a whole. It is quite unusual for a measure to be treated as so urgent that it must be run through the Senate in a week, and then brought into operation piecemeal by several proclamations. But for the parts of the Bill that I read last week, I venture to say that there is not one senator on the Government side who is acquainted with it.

The Minister, neither accepting nor disagreeing with the proposal, apparently expects the Committee to act in the same manner as his own followers - to be like dumb, driven cattle.

                        <para>- I recognise that you have not, and I. can assure the Committee that I am not going to &#34; stone-wall &#34; the Bill, though I know the Government and their supporters have had it suggested to them that members of the Opposition in the Senate intend to &#34; stone-wall &#34; this measure. I do not want to make use of anything that has been said privately, but I might mention that I told a responsible Minister that if we met on the Wednesday instead of Tuesday, to discuss this Bill, my speeches and the length of time I would occupy would be determined by his own judgment. I do not think that any man could go much further than that in offering a fair deal to the Government. I am not out to &#34; stone-wall &#34; the Bill, but I cannot see that there is a reasonable hope of getting it through by the new year. I speak subject to correction, but I think that when&#39; the 1911 Act was before Parliament there was then an Opposition of five or seven in the Senate, and still the Bill was nine weeks in Committee, although it contained only forty-eight clauses. </para>

                        <para>-This is a consolidating measure, and it contains some new provisions. If the Government are in a hurry to have certain of these provisions proclaimed let them say so. Honorable senators will remember what I said last week on this point. If the Government want the principle of the majority vote to operate at the Corangamite election, let them introduce a new Bill, give facilities to the soldiers to vote, and it will go through. </para>

On the contrary, we allowed honorable senators the fullest opportunity to consider and digest them. I cannot agree, however, that this is the identical Bill that was then prepared, and that there have not been some material alterations. </para>

                        <para>- While that is so, I would remind you, sir, that interjections are frequently of a very helpful character. An interjection by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior,</inline> for example, may elicit from me a reply which will show him that he can support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall&#39;s</inline> amendment, or suggest the adoption- of an intermediate course which will meet with the approval of the Minister. The amendment by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> follows our regular procedure, whereas the proposal embodied in the Bill contemplates an unusual procedure, which is designed to meet an exceptional case and to secure a party advantage. Is it worth the while of this deliberative Assembly to adopt a practice which is decidedly pernicious - the practice of permitting the Government to proclaim one portion of the Act upon a specified date, and another portion of it upon a different date? In  other  words, ought we to empower the Government to bring into operation any particular section of this measure just when they may deem it advisable to do so? How will such a practice operate in the case of preferential voting? I take it that eight out of every ten honorable senators are in favour of that principle. </para>

                        <para>- Shall we be acting wisely by affirming that Ministers may bring into operation any portion of the Act just when they may see fit to do so? This clause creates in my mind a suspicion that Ministers intend to use just so much of the Bill as suits them in the case of the Corangamite election, and to defer bringing into operation so much of it as does not suit them. If they take to themselves this power by reason of their superior numbers, I desire to let the electors know exactly what they are doing. They can pass the measure tonight if they choose, and that&#39; they will use their power to do so I feel sure. They will &#34;gag&#34; honorable senators by moving, &#34; That the Senate do now divide.&#34; The electors have a right to know that. </para>

                        <para>- When the system of preferential voting obtains, the party system will, to some extent, be more loose in its operation. Consequently, more candidates from the rival political parties&#39; will go to the poll. For sixteen years past the electors have been required to put crosses in the squares opposite the names of the candidates for whom they desired to vote. But, if this measure be passed to-morrow, not one elector out of ten in Corangamite will know that his vote will be rendered informal if he fails to disclose his preferences in regard to all of the candidates, even though there be fifty of them. It is one of our chief functions to enlighten the people in regard to these matters. </para>

                        <para>- One of the chief functions of Parliament is to fully and fairly discuss the legislative proposals which come before it. Many electors read the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of our debates, and receive enlightenment in that way. The daily newspapers may, perhaps, devote only a very small space to an amendment which is submitted here, but, immediately they see it, 100,000 readers of the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> possibly 200,000 readers of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> 300,000 readers of the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> and, perhaps, 500,000 readers of <inline font-style="italic">The Worker,</inline> begin to discuss it. It is our duty, therefore, to enlighten the electors upon all measures which may come before us. I know that some new members of the Senate believe it to be the duty of Parliament to rush a Bill through without consideration, but they will gain wisdom by experience. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> says that the Bill is to go through this week, and when he says it, we may be sure that that result will be achieved. He gives no reason, but his supporters on the other side accept his word, and will vote accordingly. They have already shown their willingness to do that. This clause, providing for parts or sections of the Act to come into operation by proclamation, is of very great importance. The part providing for postal voting may be proclaimed in operation for the purpose of the Corangamite election. I was driven, much against my will, to vote against postal voting. because I consider the principle reasonably fair. </para>

If I had here the parliamentary year book I could give the honorable senator the exact number of men who enlisted from Corangamite. There were about 200,000 soldiers&#39; votes polled at the Referendum, and as there are seventy-five electoral divisions it is possible that &#39;2,000 electors of Corangamite are at the Front, and their voice will not be heard at the coming election. </para>

                        <para>- I find that clause 39 deals with enrolment and not with voting. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> knows the difference between enrolment and voting, and he knows that he is misleading himself, the Senate, and the general public, when he suggests that there is provision in this Bill for votes for the soldiers. We intend to try and make that provision, but if this clause is passed the Government may snap their fingers at it. At the last election, in the electorate of Corangamite, the candidates were the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Manifold</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bennett.</inline> The number who voted included 1,794 oversea voters. There were 31,000 voters altogether. I hope&#34; the Committee will make provision to permit those 1,794 soldiers to vote at the coming by-election. As a matter of fact, my estimate of 2,000 will probably be little short of the mark, seeing that there have been many more enlistments, no doubt, since the last ejections. And it may be, also, that among those Corangamite soldiers entitled to vote at the last elections there were some who could not do so for the reason that they were holding the trenches in the Front&#39; lines. Possibly, too, it may have been known that some of them intended to vote &#34; No &#34; in connexion with the referendum; and, therefore, they may have been defrauded of their votes. Although the electoral authorities have not made it known, I am in a position to state that when. about 180,000 votes had been counted of the actual votes cast by soldiers at the Front, there was, at that stage, a difference between &#39; &#39; Yes &#39; &#39; and &#34;No&#34; of only seventy-one votes. I got that information from a gentleman who was in a position to know the facts. </para>

                <para>I&#39; am glad to note that there is at present another Minister in charge of the Bill. I&#39; ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> if he will give the assurance that if this Bill passes - as  it will, no doubt, before the end of the week - the whole of its provisions shall be brought into, operation at the same time, and that the Government will permit the Corangamite soldiers who are away from home to exercise their votes. If he will give that assurance there should be no reason why the measure should not pass before the dinner hour. I am inclined to think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> will, if he can, give those soldiers their votes. I do not think he would wish to disfranchise them merely for the sake of party advantage. The whole trouble is that even if the necessary provision were made in this Bill the Government could still refuse to issue the proclamation to put it into operation. There will be soldier candidates at the by-election. There will be soldier constituents. I am anxious to tell those constituents, and the whole of the electors, all about the actions of the Government in relation to the soldiers&#39; votes. And I shall be there. There will be some honorable senators there who will tell&#34; the electors of Corangamite just what has become of a Parliament which has reached its present state of deliberative. and legislative perfection after centuries of slow parliamentary development. &#34;We shall tell the Corangamite electors that this Parliament has been smashed and shattered because the Government desired to make it the tool of one political party; and all for the sake of one by-election ! What will be the difference of just one seat to the Government ? We . shall win the seat in any circumstances. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator holds that discussion is a waste of time&#39;,- and that Bills should be merely brought in by the Government and passed1 as a matter of course. If this clause is passed, it will take -the power away from Parliament and  place it in the hands of the Government. With great respect I say that this is the worst Government that Australia has ever known. This clause will give to that worst Government the right to override Parliament, to issue a proclamation saying which portions of an Act shall or shall not come into operation. Why should the Government depart from the ordinary procedure? Why should we not wait for the assent of the Governor-General to the whole of the measure ? <inline font-style="italic">Why</inline> should we give such power to the worst Government Australia has ever known - that is, judged by the undoubted verdict of the Swan electorate? Why should we now give to this condemned Government - condemned already at Swan, and soon to be condemned again at Corangamite - a power which has never been asked for in respect to other Acts? I, for one, am not prepared to grant such power. This Parliament may as well not exist. I hope the Committee will force the Government to see the fairness of the proposition that if the Bill is to come into force at all the whole of it should come into operation at the same moment. </para>

Why are not the Government prepared to deal with this measure in the  same way  as with every other Act of Parliament? There are three portions of the Bill which are set out in bold, black type. I refer to Parts VI., VII., and XII. Apparently, those are the parts concerning which the Government, desire power to bring them into operation by proclamation. At present, the remaining portions of the measure are in operation, and they will remain so until the Bill is passed. Part VI. deals with qualifications and disqualifications for enrolment  and for voting. It is instructive to notice that - </para>

                        <para>- I wish to indicate the clauses which I think the Government want to bring into operation by proclamation under clause 2, and to show that it is really the new parts of the Bill that they have in their minds. I wish, then, to prove that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall&#39;s</inline> amendment ought to be agreed to. When the Bill was first introduced in another place,&#34; it was intended to bring it into force as a whole, but that idea was abandoned, arid now we are asked to agree that only certain parts and sections shall be brought into operation. It is evident, and much to be regretted, that the Government have determined to have- certain sections made law mainly in connexion with the Corangamite by-election. It would have been far better if they had decided to conduct that &#39; election under the existing Electoral Act. I do hot know what they are afraid of,- because at the last election they had a majority of about 6,400 in that division. The Government have been guilty of many shortcomings, but I had no idea that their faults were so numerous as to turn 6,000 votes against them in Corangamite. I hope it is so, and that when the election takes place they will find they have not only lost their majority of 6,000- </para>

                        <para>- My purpose was to refer to the by-election now approaching. Surely the Government, with all their shortcomings,- are not so much afraid of defeat that they have to rush a provision of this character through ? I wonder if they propose to bring the postal voting clauses into operation  for the by -election. The Minister is silent on that point. But if this clause is* passed, it will be in -the power of the Government to put only certain clauses into force. Are they going to bring the disqualification part or the enrolment part into force ? Is it intended to bring Part V., Part VII., and Part XII. into operation by proclamation ? It is . to be regretted that the Government cannot see their way to accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall&#39;s</inline> amendment. I am against the clause, and will assist to divide the Committee on it. </para>

If so, I would point out to the Minister the grave danger to the purity of elections involved in that clause. Clause 86 gives the list of persons who may be authorized witnesses to an application for a postal vote certificate and postal ballot-paper. </para>

                        <para>- Under clause 2, the Government have power to bring into force the particular provision to which I am objecting. I suggest to the Minister that that would be a dangerous course to adopt. But we shall have further opportunities of discussing this clause at considerable length. I have no desire to unduly delay the passage of the clause, or of the Bill itself ; but I must add my protest to that already made by Senator Gardiner that it is a political offence of a serious nature for any Government to come down with a measure like this, and ask for power to proclaim any portion of it at any time. There is absolutely no necessity for this course, unless it arises from the fact that a by-election is at hand. Unless the Government have this in mind, they can advance no reason for the proposal now before the Committee. </para>

                        <para>- The cases are not on all fours. I admit there were two proclamations under the Navigation Act; but there were excellent reasons for the adoption of that course. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> knows the Navigation Act had not been proclaimed when war broke out. And <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> probably more than any other honorable senator, knows the reason for that departure from our usual procedure. &#39; There was then a belief that Australian interests might conflict with Imperial interests, and grave reasons were placed before the Government then in power, concerning the wisdom of withholding the proclamations affecting the Navigation Act. But I want to get back to the clause. I was led off the track by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie&#39;s</inline> interjection. </para>

It is true that one Minister, by way of interjection, said that certain powers were asked for, in view of an impending by-election. I invite the Minister to say if they want this Bill through before a certain time, and to be able to proclaim the Act before a certain date, so that its provisions may be applied* to the Corangamite by-election. </para>

                            must know that regulations are made in general terms, and that it would be impracticable to provide for prisoners of war. But there would only be a small percentage of such cases.

                            is, perhaps, in the confidence of the Government when he states that the soldiers and sailors are already provided for; but I point out that

I have not the slightest desire to delay the passage of the measure by one moment&#39;s unnecessary criticism, but I think such a clause as this should be criticised.

But while there are few new features in . it, every honorable senator should be permitted to discuss to the fullest extent proposals which are designed to radically alter our electoral system. I should like the Minister to make a statement on the matter. </para>

Bill. I do not like the measure, because it seeks to introduce into our electoral system an innovation which is not a wise one. It has been argued that because in the past legislation has become operative by proclamation, we are quite justified in following that procedure in connexion with our electoral law. But I submit that the electoral law of a country is really its basic law, and that we ought to proceed very warily before we alter a long-established precedent in regard to it. I do not believe in Parliament slavishly following precedent, but I am very jealous of the law which governs the right of every  citizen in Australia to record a vote for the election of representatives of this Parliament. It is because of that jealousy that I shall support the amendment. </para>

                <para class="block">Now, if the Bill be a good one, why should it be proclaimed in parts? We cannot get too much of a good thing, nor can we get it too soon. If the measure be a good one, why should not our electoral law be amended by proclaiming the entire Act immediately it has received the assent of the1 King&#39;s representative ? &#39; It has been pointed out that various parts of . the Navigation Act were proclaimed at different times. But there is surely no analogy between that measure and this Bill. There was a necessity for proclaiming different portions of the Navigation Act upon different dates by reason of the complicated nature of international interests. But the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> cannot submit a valid reason why the Bill should be proclaimed in sections. If he were able to do so my hostility to it might possibly be weakened. </para>
                <para>I object to - this clause for another reason. The writ in connexion with the by-election which will be determined on the 14th December, and the nominations for which have not yet been lodged, was issued last Tuesday under the old law which this measure seeks to alter. I need scarcely point out that when the writ is issued, the roll automatically closes. No more names can be added to it. Although I am not a constitutional lawyer, I entertain a very strong belief, no matter what may be the result of the Corangamite election, that  an appeal to the High Court may result in the election being vitiated. It is necessary to fix a time for the closing of the rolls in order that the electoral machinery may be got into working order. The Department must have time to get out &#39;ballot-papers, make necessary arrangements for polling booths, and the -appointment of poll clerks. But, once that action has been taken under the law, no new law should intervene to alter electoral conditions. </para>

If it is necessary to-day that the several parts and sections of this Bill should come into operation respectively by proclamation, it was necessary when the Bill was first introduced.

                <para>In connexion with the appeal made by Senators Gardiner and O&#39;Keefe that our soldiers should &#39; be given ari opportunity to vote at the Corangamite election, it was suggested from the other side that, in clause 39, the Bill makes the. necessary provision for that purpose. In the short time at our disposal I have looked through the Bill, but I can see no clause in  Lt  giving our sailors,&#39; soldiers, munition workers, general labourers, or nurses engaged in the activities of the war the opportunity to vote at the b.y-election pending. All these citizens of Australia were given this opportunity at the referendum on compulsory military service in 1916, at the general election in May, 1917, and at the compulsory military service referendum in December, 1917. For that purpose, a special Act had to be passed by this Parliament. This measure consolidates, and does not repeal, that Act, and, had the war lasted, the citizens to whom I have referred would, at a general election, have  the right to vote. But there is no provision in the Bill to enable them to vote at the election for Corangamite on the 14th December. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that. The electors to whom I have referred would have the right to vote at a general election or a referendum, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> cannot point to any clause in this Bill which will give them the right to vote at the Corangamite  election.

I say that, as soon as this Parliament determines what the electoral law of the Commonwealth shall be, it should at  once  become operative. </para>

                        <para>- Prior to the suspension . of the sitting I was pointing out, in reply to an interjection, that there was no provision in the Bill for soldiers and sailors to vote at &#34;the forthcoming 1-9-election. Such persons can vote only at a general election; and even after this Bill has -become law there will be no power to proclaim any portion of it which would provide opportunities for absent soldiers -and sailors of Corangamite to vote. </para>

                <para>Some remarks have been, already uttered as to the time occupied in the consideration of this measure. I recall the debate upon the Electoral Bill of 1911, which &#39; required considerably more than eight weeks to secure its passage through both Houses of the Legislature. I remember also that the war-time measure occupied a considerable period ; and no one will say that it was time ill-spent. I admit that the eight weeks occupied upon the amending Bill of 1911 were not entirely devoted to that measure. There were interludes for the consideration of other important business. The Government may deem it. wise in the present instance to postpone this clause, and even to adjourn consideration of the whole Bill, in order to deal with other important matter. When the Bill of 1911 abolished postal voting there were thirteen honorable senators in opposition. That measure contained forty-eight clauses, and its passage required eight weeks. Here is a Bill of 220 clauses, and there are twelve honorable senators on this side. In the same proportion it should require at least sixteen weeks to dispose&#39; of the present measure. The Government will do wrong in proclaiming any Bill, or any portion of a Bill, just as and when they see fit. With regard to the by-election the Government may contend that because they are introducing preferential voting for the House of Representatives, and reinstating the system of postal voting, they require to &#34; try them out&#34; at Corangamite. An electoral law should not be framed to suit one part of the country, nor should its machinery he brought into operation merely to be tried therein. </para>
                <para>If this Bill were being put through on the eve of a general election my opposition would not be so keen, because, then, after reasonable discussion, an instrument would have been created which would probably be to the advantage of all of the people. It is almost immoral that the Government should adopt their present procedure. I know of no act on the part of any Government which runs as closely as this along the border line of immoral political practice. There was nothing to prevent the Government from following the usual course with this Bill. It could- have been passed in another place without the introduction of the guillotine ; and there should have been no reason why the Senate should be called to meet on Tuesdays at such an early stage in the session in order to force the passage of one particular measure. I support the amendment. </para>
                <para class="block">SenatorLt.  -Colonel O&#39;LOGHLIN  (South Australia) &#91;8.9&#93;. - I am generally in accord with the main principles of the Bill. It is the peculiar way in which the Government are attempting to force it through, in view of an imminent byelection, that I regard as reprehensible. The clause under discussion is unprecedented. Not only do the Government propose to secure the right to bring in the Bill, or any part of it, separately, and at different times, but they may even proclaim it clause by clause. The Government could make 220 separate proclamations with respect to the 220 separate clauses. If clause 2 is passed as it stands we do not know what the Government may not see fit to do with the aid of the power granted to them. I do not know that the Government could interfere with that part of the Bill referring to polling, when once the writs have been issued; but as to the polling booths themselves the Government might even be able to provide that the booths in any part of a district where a majority of votes was likely to be cast in favour of an Opposition candidate should be closed, and that only those booths should remain open in centres favorable to the Government candidate. Then, as to the limitation of candidates&#39; election expenses, it would be quite possible for the Government to refrain from proclaiming that portion of the Bill. Wealth is not on the side of Labour, and thus Government candidates, with the pecuniary assistance of the Government, and of supporters behind them, might be able to spend an unlimited amount in securing their return. With respect also to that part dealing with electoral offences, the Government might see fit not to proclaim it; whereupon there would be nothing to prevent all sorts of illegal practices. The Government may omit to proclaim Part XVIII. &#34;Court of Disputed Returns,&#34; which would have the same effect. If there is no Court of Disputed Returns, it will be an invitation to those engaged in the election to ignore all restrictions, and indulge in illegal practices. Therefore, this little clause of only two lines practically nullifies what the Senate may do, and the other House may have done, in passing this Bill. After passing it, we place it entirely in the hands of the Government&#34; to decide how much of it they will bring into operation, and at what time, and how much omit. In fact, we leave them free to manipulate the Act in whatever way suits their convenience, or the convenience of their party. That is a monstrous and unprecedented power to give any Government. I can find nothing in any of the Bills that have been before us this session to parallel it. It is the first time, so far as I can remember, that such a provision has been put before the Federal Parliament. All other measures passed this session apparently became law immediately they received the assent of the Governor-General. The Institute of Science and Industry Bill contains no provision as to proclamation, wholly or in part. No Minister or senator on the other side has explained why this unusual course is to be followed in this Bill. The Government may have some valid reason. If so, we are entitled to hear it. We pass the Bill as a whole when we pass the third reading, and it should come into operation as a whole. I strenuously oppose this new departure, which aims at the fundamental principles of our system of government, and the rights of. the Senate. I shall support the amendment to provide that the Bill, when it comes into operation, shall be the Bill as passed in its entirety. </para>

                    <para>. -  I thought some honorable senators on the other side might care to speak on this important matter, but I suppose they have been ordered not to. The Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> might tell us how far he is going to-night. We are anxious to meet him on a fair basis. We travelled all last night, but I suppose he will tell us that we ought to live in Melbourne. He will probably get on quicker by telling us what we want to know than if he persists in his obstinate silence, thinking he can force the Senate. I doubt whether he can. I do not intend to speak at much greater length on the amendment, because I am waiting for an opportunity to move one of my own, to prevent the clause operating until the by-election is over. If, before this Bill is through, the Committee adopt preferential voting for the Senate, as I hope they will, because nothing could be more objectionable than to have preferential voting for one House, and the old form of voting for the other - will the Vice-President of the Executive Council give me his . assurance that he will not delay its proclamation for longer than six months? </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> and myself are quite willing to give every reasonable consideration to the honorable senator&#39;s suggestion that some intimation should be given as to the progress we expect to make with each sitting. It is the desire of the Government, and we think it is within the compass of this Chamber, to pass the Bill through all its stages by Friday afternoon. Subject to that limitation, it should not be difficult, if honorable senators desire a reasonable working arrangement, to apportion so much of the Bill to each sitting. I suggest that honorable senators should facilitate the passage through Committee of all clauses except those which deal with postal voting, preferential voting, and the scrutiny, by the dinner hour to-morrow, leaving Thursday and Friday for the consideration of the rest of the Bill. </para>

There is no reason why they should not be, because they are really the law of the laud now, and are being repeated in this Bill merely to secure a consolidating measure. That will leave- the Committee two full days for the discussion of the new provisions I suggest that, as a working compromise. It is the most the Government can offer, with the obligations resting upon them. </para>

                        <para>- I may have to propose a number of most important amendments. The very clause which follows clause 2 repeals a series of existing Acts. This Bill brings all the provisions of those Acts under one cover, but clause 2 would allow the Government to perpetuate one of those old Acts by proclamation, and put another out of existence. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> without any intention to deceive, said there were only one or two new clauses in the Bill, and that, therefore, we should accept it. In the existing Act there are dozens of provisions to which I have been opposed all my life, and I ask the honorable senator, as man to man, if this is not my opportunity to secure some amendment of these provisions? The fact that some of them have been in operation for fifteen years or more is no reason why they should stand. I ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator</inline></para>

                <para>Before I sat down in order to allow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to speak, I was about to point out that if we got preferential voting for the Senate,, the Government could, if they liked, withhold the proclamation bringing it into force. The next election might be held under the present conditions, and the following election under the preferential system. Let us see how it could work out to party advantage. If an election for the Senate were held next June - the Government with their majority could send half the Senate to the country at any time - and if the Labour party won, but did not have sufficient strength in the other House to displace the Government, the Ministry could issue a proclamation providing for the next election to be held under the preferential system. One of my objections to the clause is that it gives the Government power to manipulate elections. There is no question about that. Some honorable senators might assume that this Government are so honest that they would not try to manipulate elections, and that it would be unthinkable for the Corangamite election to be manipulated. But they might think that some portion- of this Bill would materially affect their interests in Corangamite, and could prevent that portion of the Act from becoming the law of the land for the time being. I am not one to give that power to any Government without a strong protest. </para>

                        <para>- In what particular clause ? Tt is not there, and there is no pretence that the Government intend to give the soldiers the vote. The Senate might say that the absent soldiers should have the vote, but if we pass this clause, the Government will then be in the happy position of being empowered to withhold the proclamation with regard to any section of the Act, with the result that the soldiers of Corangamite would be denied the vote, in the face, possibly, of the decision of both Houses of Parliament. I am not going to accept that&#39; position, but intend to appeal to honorable senators with &#39;such force that there will not be the slightest shadow of an excuse afterwards for any honorable senator to say that he did hot know that &#39;this would be the effect of the Bril. I am determined that they shall know. If the </para>

                <para>Government intend that the soldiers should have, a vote, they could insert a special clause providing the necessary facilities, and arrange for polling places at certain centres in France and Great Britain, as was done during the fiercest of the fighting at the time of the last referendum, when hundreds of thousands of our soldiers voted. If that could be done then, it could be done now in the happy lull that has taken place. It could easily be done by regulation under the War Precautions Act, and if the .Government promise to do so, they will expedite the passage of this Bill. At the last referendum about 1,700 soldiers voted for the Corangamite division, and as we have had eighteen months -of recruiting since then, it is quite likely there are about &#39;2,000 soldiers belonging to that division. It is not too much to .ask that the &#39;Government should give the vote to these men. </para>

                        <para>- I realize that I must bring my remarks within the scope of the amendment. I intend to do so by saying that the Government, who have nothing to expect from the soldiers except condemnation, justly anticipate that the soldiers&#39; vote will go against them, and even if the Committee decides to give the soldiers&#39; a vote, as I believe it will, the Government could withhold the proclamation. I know that Senators Rowell, Senior, Keating, Newland, Earle, and Crawford, as well as some other honorable senators, would like to give the soldiers a vote, but they must obey the party Whip. I &#39;know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> is quite impatient to rise and debate this clause, but I am equally satisfied that the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> has merely to look at him to cause him to subside. I recognise, as well as does any honorable senator, the value of good party support. </para>

                <para>In this clause the&#39; Government are seeking  power  to set at defiance the views of, perhaps, a hundred members of both branches of the Legislature. By means of it, a bare majority of the Cabinet may upset the will of Parliament. Now Parliament was called into existence to prevent that sort of thing. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> submitted his amendment the Vice-President of the Executive Council, in a flippant manner, which is quite unusual with him, did not vouchsafe the courtesy of a reply. I am quite prepared to resume my seat if the honorable gentleman will reply now. </para>

                        <para>- Why, at the very outset of this discussion, he should adopt the attitude which he has adopted, I cannot understand. Evidently he believes that any powers which the present Government may exercise will be exercised rightly. But is it proper that we should confer the extraordinary powers which are sought in this clause, upon a Ministry, two of the chief members of which, if the press reports are to be credited, are not on speaking terms with each other? I suppose that the Vice-President of the Executive Council feels that it is not necessary for him to say a word in favour of this provision. He is willing to allow it to pass supported only by his smile. </para>

If both the Vice-President of the Executive Council and myself were chemists, and if we prepared 90 per cent, of a most excellent medicine, to which somebody added 10 per cent, of poison, we should hardly be willing to swallow it. Further, I am rather inclined to question the accuracy of the honorable gentleman&#39;s statement that the Government of which we were members prepared 90 per cent, of the provisions of this Bill. But even, in our existing Electoral Acts there are quite a number of most objectionable features which ought to be amended. </para>

                <para>I am in a position to. submit one important amendment, the adoption of which will, I am satisfied, result in the saving of thousands of pounds at every general election. That amendment provides for the counting of the whole of the Senate votes at the polling booths where -they are recorded. Under that provision what would happen? In a small country booth&#34; within an hour of the closing of the poll, all ths votes would be counted, whilst in the largest booths they would be counted by midnight. But under the existing system all these votes have to be forwarded to one centre. </para>

                    <para>. -  I was hoping that the Minister would listen to reason, and accept the amendment, but it would appear that it is the intention of the Government to rush the Bill through at all hazards. They are introducing a very bad precedent in endeavouring to tamper with the electoral laws of the country.  Honorable senators on this side have a right to protest with the utmost vigor against that. The Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> has suggested that if we pass the non-contentious clauses, honorable senators will be given an opportunity to discuss those dealing with preferential voting, the scrutiny, and postal voting. Whilst I admit that many of the clauses of the Bill are merely machinery provisions, there are many others upon which amendments might very well be moved. A more reasonable attitude for the Government to take up would be to agree that we should pass as many clauses as we can up to half-past 10 o&#39;clock tonight, and then adjourn until the usual time to-morrow. The Committee will be wrong in passing clause 2 as it stands, because the writ has been issued for the Corangamite election, and that election should therefore be carried out under the existing law. Over twelve months ago there was talk of a general election in Great Britain. </para>

                        <para>- I intend to do so. Though the general election in the Old Country was postponed because of the war, the Imperial Government recognised that an amendment of the electoral law of Great Britain was necessary. They admitted that it was necessary to extend the franchise, but they did not rush that legislation through in order to apply it to a particular bv-election. The Commonwealth Government are endeavouring to rush this clause through in order to apply it to the coming byelection at Corangamite. We are guided here very largely by the practice of the House of Commons, and in this matter the Government might very well follow the example set by the Old Country, where the Imperial Government have refrained from using the machinery of the House of Commons to rush through an amending electoral measure for the sake of a by-election,- but have waited to apply, the amended law to the general elections,, so that the whole of the people of Great Britain may benefit by it. If we were on the eve of a general election in Australia I should be prepared to support this clause even as it stands. But I am not prepared to give the Government the power to use this measure, for the purposes of a by-election. Part XVII. of the Bill deals with electoral offences, and the Government might choose to hang up that part of the Bill for an indefinite period. I do not say that they would do so. Thank God, the present Government will not always be the Government of the Commonwealth, but the power conferred by this clause is too much to give any Government. Part XVIII., dealing with the Court of Disputed Returns, might also under this clause be suspended at the will of the Government. Part XVI. is an important part dealing with the limitation of electoral expenditure. It will be most dangerous to hang up the operation of that part of the Bill. To do so might open the door to a vast amount of corruption. Part VIII. deals with objections to names on the rolls. I remember that at the 1913 elections, so severe were the comments upon the way in which they were -conducted that the Senate appointed a Select Committee to inquire into it. I was a member of that Select Committee, and very useful information was obtained, which proved that there was nothing in the allegations made at the time. But if- under clause 2 the operation of Part VIII. of this Bill were to be suspended the rolls might be packed in any way, and in the circumstances there could be no election held which would give a .true reflex of the opinions of the electors. Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> I would be amongst the last who would unnecessarily block the passage df this Bill, and I beseech the Government to accept the amendment. If they do so, they will make more rapid progress with the remaining clauses of the measure. </para>

                        <para>- I shall not do so until we come to it. The clause under consideration provides that the several parts and sections of the Bill shall commence at such dates as are respectively fixed by proclamation. One of the clauses of this Bill which would be brought into operation by proclamation is that which consolidates quite a number of Acts of Parliament. The clause under consideration and clause 3 are linked up, because clause 2 gives the Government power, even if we pass clause 3, to refrain from bringing it into operation. Will the Minister in charge&#39; of the Bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> give me a promise that if we pass this, to me, most objectionable system of proclaiming parts and sections of an Act,- the whole of clause 3 will be proclaimed at the same time? I receive no reply, and this confirms my growing suspicion that the Government have something up their sleeve in connexion with this Bill. The Government pretend that it is their intention to make clause 3 of this Bill the law of the land. The Minister in charge of* the measure has so far declined to extend to us the courtesy of speaking to the amendment, and he has refused to put the case of the Government whether they wilt agree that clause 3 shall be brought into operation with the first proclamation issued respecting this measure. I noticethat <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> shakes his head. How am I to interpret that? </para>

I insist that clause 3 - as to which the Minister in charge will not give an assurance - must be taken into consideration in the discussion of clause 2, seeing that the latter, in so far as it refers to the proclamation of the whole or any part or section of the Act, certainly does bear upon the clause following. That clause is of considerable importance, as it has to do with the consolidation of all the electoral legislation since the Act of 1902. </para>

But I insist that there is a very important connexion in the bearing of clause 2 upon clause 3. I agree that to discuss clause 3 in detail would l&#62;e out of order; but to incidentally refer to it by way of indicating its importance in view of the bearing of clause 2 upon it, should not meet with the disapprobation of the Chair. </para>

                        <para>- If you rule me out of order, I shall have to take the subsequent course available to myself, because I shall not have my rights taken from me. If I were to be tied -down on a ruling of that kind, I should find myself bound by four or five words which, in themselves, would be comparatively unintelligible unless I were permitted to link up their significance with other portions of the measure. I need scarcely repeat that clause 2 deals with the matter of the proclamation of all or any part of the Bill} while clause 3 has to do with the consolidation of existing laws. It is quite out of accord with the ordinary procedure of the Senate for a Minister in charge of a Bill to refuse to answer .an argument, whether reasonable or unreasonable, and to refrain from stating the position of the Government. It is treating the Committee with -discourtesy. However, lest by unduly prolonging my remarks, I might give colour to the unfair and discourteous accusation that I was &#34;&#34; stone-walling,&#34; I shall at this stage have nothing further to say. </para>

                        <para>- There is no. point of order before the Chair. The position is very clear. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> moved, &#34;That the Committee do now divide,&#34; the question was put from the Chair, and carried on the voices. Then when the question, &#34; That the words proposed to be left out be left out,&#34; was put, there was some confusion as to what should be done. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> called &#34; No,&#34; and I declared that the &#34; Noes &#34; had it. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> really wished to call &#34;Aye,&#34; that is, to vote that the words should be left out, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> had moved. Therefore, for greater accuracy: I put the second question again. I declared again that the &#34; Noes &#34; had it, and a division was-called for. While the bells were ringing to summon honorable senators for that division, objection was taken to my ruling. </para>

This clause will have considerable bearing on the application of the Act to any by-elections that may take place. I do not want any by-elections to be conducted in the manner in which the Government may conduct them. After the scene we have just witnessed, we know that the Government and their followers are capable of anything. There is nothing too mean or too despicable for them. There is nothing they will not descend to for the meanest party advantage. They are absolutely unworthy of any powers of control or management. </para>

                        <para>- Instead of putting the whole Act into force by one proclamation, the Government and their party, under the clause as it stands, if we do not postpone its operation, will be able to bring any part of it into force at any time to suit themselves. From their conduct in the last ten minutes, we know that the Government and their party have lost all sense of the proportion of things and all sense of self-respect. </para>

                        <para>- If that is their method of maintaining it, they are welcome to all the satisfaction they can get out of it. If the Government and their party are prepared to do as they are doing, they are certainly not to be trusted with powers of this kind, particularly when by-elections take place. A Government that, on the most miserable and mean pretext, will act as this Government act should certainly not be given extraordinary powers. A Government lost to all sense of decency or dignity in conducting the business of Parliament, &#39; a Government backed by supporters similar to themselves, with a majority in both Houses of men who are absolutely so degrading their political positions that no one can even think of them with respect, let alone speak of them with respect, should not dare to ask for, and certainly cannot be given, the powers they are seeking in this clause. </para>

                        <para>- A Government lost to all sense of self-respect, and with a party in both Houses in the same position, are not to be trusted with exceptional powers. I have moved an amendment similar to one which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> moved on another Bill a few weeks ago. All I ask is that the operation of this clause be delayed for the remainder of November and the whole of December - a little less than two months. That is not a very great delay, but it will secure to all the candidates at the byelection freedom from Government trickery which is menacing the coming election in Corangamite. There is no question that the Government party must have had a meeting and decided on their course of conduct in respect of this Bill, if such a scene could happen as happened in this chamber a little while ago. It is to me the absolute limit to which a Government can go. I have seen Governments which would adopt various methods, but when a Minister of the Crown stands up and moves that the Committee divide on the amendment, and the Government get out of the vote on that question in the way this Government and their party got out of it, they have reached a level that I never thought even they would fall to. </para>

                        <para>- I accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie&#39;s withdrawal. I thought when he rose that he was fulfilling his duty as Government Whip by giving instructions to the official reporter not to report my utterances. As a motion was recently carried enabling the Government to strike out of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> anything they objected to, the honorable senator apparently thinks he can, as Government Whip, instruct the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff what they are to report. Probably the Government, in the exercise of that power, will strike out of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> what I have said. </para>

I am sure the  Chairman  would have ruled me out of order if be thought I had exceeded my rights.

It is language they are not accustomed to, but they know it is thoroughly descriptive of themselves, and at the  same  time quite parliamentary. If it was not, they would avail themselves of the opportunity of taking a point of order. </para>

                        <para>- I was under the impression that there might be something good in some of the sections of the 1902 Act that could be retained in this consolidating measure, and, for that reason, I consider that the Committee is being rushed at an unnecessary pace, in order to get this clause through. To my mind, this is the vital portion of the Bill, and I protest against the hurried manner in which it is being rushed through the Chamber. If I were desirous of delaying the passage of the measure, I might effectually achieve my object by comparing the provisions of our Electoral Act of 1902 with the provisions of the Bill which we are now considering. In this measure, it is proposed to repeal the Electoral Act of 1911. In other words, it is intended to restore a method of voting which, only a few years ago, was regarded by many honorable senators as being an exceedingly reprehensible one. In 1911, we abolished postal voting, and thereby improved our electoral system. Honorable senators opposite enthusiastically supported the abolition of postal voting, as the pages of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> clearly show. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch, Senator Pearce,</inline> and others supported its abolition. </para>

                            <para>- We need to be very careful what we are doing. The Electoral Divisions Act 1903 is a very important one, because it deals with the boundaries of the electoral divisions of the Commonwealth. Some of those divisions contain more than the quota of the electors, and I. think we should have paid attention to the redistribution of our electoral boundaries before dealing with this Bill. It appears to me that we are establishing dangerous precedents. We are  laying Parliament open to the charge of having rushed this Bill through in order that the Government may obtain a party advantage. </para>

                            <para>- Apparently, the Government intend to &#34;gag&#34; every clause of the Bill through the Chamber. If that be their intention, we cannot prevent them giving effect to it, except by subjecting ourselves to physical exhaustion. I do not intend to reduce myself to that state. I protest against the Government bludgeoning important clauses through this Chamber by &#39; sheer brute force. Clause 3 of the Bill is a very important one, because it will govern the franchise of a free people. For that reason, it is practically immoral for the Government to use the &#34;gag&#34; for the purpose of preventing adequate discussion of the measure. </para>

                    <para>Later on I shall move to leave out the words &#34; In this Act unless &#34;, and insert in their place, &#34;Notwithstanding anything to&#34;. The clause would then read, &#34;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary.&#34; I should afterwards have to move to strike out the words &#34;intention appears&#34;. That would improve the phraseology of the clause, but it would necessitate quite a number of other amendments. The definition of &#34;candidate,&#34; in Parts II., XVI., and XVIII. &#34; includes any person who within three months before the day of election announces himself as a candidate for election as a member of the Senate or the House of Representatives.&#34; It is  difficult  to discuss clause 5 when by weight <inline font-style="italic">nf</inline> numbers there has been no discussion r.n clause 4. This definition will apply to the clause by which a candidate announced for an election renders  himself  liable if he incurs expenditure in excess of that allowed by the Act. Three months is the period set out here. As a member of the Senate, there is no necessity for me to announce myself as a candidate until the day of nomination, so that technically I could escape any penalty for exceeding the allowed expenditure during the three months&#39; period. Every candidate who announces himself within three months of the election brings himself within the  bribery  clauses of the Bill. A wealthy candidate  could  go round an electorate spending money freely,  possibly  bribing newspapers, and getting in all his fine work to secure support, four months before the election, and not announce himself as a candidate until the day of nomination.. A poor man who has announced himself as a a candidate may make an innocent mistake by hiring a vehicle, and so exceeding the amount of expenses allowed under the Act, and make himself liable, whereas the other man is not. I have here the electoral rolls for a number of divisions in New South Wales, and will quote a number of names from them to show the varied occupations of electors, and their fitness to act as witnesses to claims for enrolment. Frequently they work early and late to produce foodstuffs, not only for Australia, but for the other side of the world, and incidentally, I may add, millions of bushels have been ruined owing to the neglect of the Government. These men are not in daily communication with town folk or officers of the Electoral Department; but. Parliament has decided that farmers, as electors, may witness the claims of other persons for enrolment. I will take now some more names - Frederick William Anderson, farmer; George Andrew Anderson, fettler; Daniel Angus Reefton, labourer. It will be seen that a labourer, as an elector, may also witness applications for enrolment. A person whose name is on the roll is an elector, but a person may be qualified as an elector, and altheugh his name may not appear on a roll, he may be permitted to stand, as a candidate for Parliament. Let us see now who may be a candidate for Parliament. The clause states that a candidate includes - </para>

Robert William Ashton, sawmill proprietor, is another good type of candidate, and perhaps could fill the position in this Senate with a good deal of credit. The same could be said of John </para>

Then I come to Robert Hamilton Blakeley, a police constable. He will require to resign his position before he can become a candidate. But Alfred Ernest Bonham, farmer, may easily become a candidate for a seat in either branch of this Parliament if honorable senators opposite are only sufficiently broadminded to abolish the preliminary deposit which is required of candidates under the existing law. Charles James Bowering, a miner, also comes within the definitions embodied in this clause. Then, under the definition of &#34; elector,&#34; James Butler is in a position to witness an elector&#39;s application for enrolment. </para>

                            <para>- I wish now to say a few words regarding the officers who will be charged with the administration of this Act, and to point out what constitutes an &#34; officer.&#34; I find that &#34;officer&#34; includes &#34;the Chief Electoral Officer of the Commonwealth and any Commonwealth officer for a State division.&#34; Now, in my judgment, the Commonwealth Electoral Officer should be absolutely free from parliamentary interference. He should hold his position just as does a Judge of the Supreme Court of a State. He should be as free and independent as a Judge, and should not be removable from office nor have his emoluments reduced except on a resolution of both or at least one, House of Parliament. He should conduct the elections  without interference. I do not say that there has yet been any gross interference,, but political warfare is becoming more bitter every year, and an over -zealous Government, if not restrained, might ask. the Chief Electoral Officer to do something which he did not feel legally justified in doing. </para>

Now <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell,</inline> our former colleague, who was sent here by the Trades Hall, is so affected&#34; by his new social surroundings that he feels that a poll clerk is the social superior to a doorkeeper, and must take precedence of him in an enumeration of titles of offices. I see nothing, but snobbery in the proposed amendment. It is a straw which serves to show the drift of the minds of Ministers. </para>

                    <para>Then we are told, that a &#34; &#39; roll &#39; means am electoral roll under this Act.&#34; I have quoted the names of various electors from several electoral rolls to indicate what an electoral roll is, within the meaning&#39; of the definition set out in the clause under discussion. I do not desire to read out a list of many thousands of names; and I again ask whether the &#39;Government are determined - seeing that it is midnight, and that it is the hour1, therefore, at which ordinarily an adjournment is granted for supper - to carry on the inhumane procedure, which was inflicted the other day. I understand that the sessional orders do not provide for an adjournment on Tuesday nights. I have no desire that the Government and officers of the Senate should exhibit the same brutality as was displayed on the other occasion. </para>

                            <para>- I withdraw; and will withdraw from the chamber if the  Chairman  requires me to do so. Now that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> has returned I hope that he will agree that the stupidity displayed on both sides should no longer continue. I do not know how fair he proposes to proceed with the Bill, but  I  trust that he will&#39; indicate the decision of the Government. v I have quoted from several divisional and subdivisional rolls, including that of South Sydney, as a typical city roll, in order that honorable senators may appreciate that in the conduct of an election the officials have a great deal of work and responsibility.  I  desire to quote now the result of the elections for the Senate in New South Wales in  1914.  I have two reasons for doing so. My first is that in reciting the figures honorable senators will be impressed with the enormous number of votes which had to be handled by the electoral officers;, and my second reason is that months ago <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> referred to our relative positions in the Senate as representatives of New South Wales. By quoting the  f914  election re-   turns I shall be able to indicate exactly how <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> and I stood in  relation to that contest. I promised him on that occasion that I would eventually get those figures into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> They are as follows: - </para>

                            <para>- This clause strikes out section 13 of the Act, and I think the Committee ought to know the reason for the alteration. I do not mind passing without discussion a clause which makes no amendment in the existing law, but it is in accordance with parliamentary custom that when an important change is made the clause should not be rushed through by dividing the Committee and without any explanation of the reason for the amendment. I do not insist upon an explanation of this clause, but I merely indicate my opinion in regard to all clauses which make important alterations. </para>

The time will come when the Australians in the Federal Capital area and in the Northern Territory must be given representation  in. this Parliament.

                        <para>.- The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> must see that the time has arrived when the people in the Federal Capital Territory should be included in one of the Federal electorates in New South Wales. If there were any immediate prospect of the Federal Parliament meeting at Canberra there would be some reason for disfranchising them. But so far as the Constitution will allow, we might reasonably provide for the representation of all persons resident in Commonwealth Territory. With the present Government in office, the Federal Parliament will continue to meet in Melbourne for some time. That being so, if arrangements can be made to give representation to the people in the Federal Capital Territory, the Government should consider the matter. </para>

                        <para>. - Notwithstanding that for a number of years a system of compulsory enrolment has been operative so far as the Commonwealth is concerned, it is a fact that many electors fail to enroll and that no steps are taken to secure their enrolment. The  elector  is supposed to see that his name is placed upon the  Toll.  But many persons change their residences so frequently that they neglect this duty. In fairness to them, I think it should be recognised that our system of compulsory enrolment is more or less of a failure. My own opinion is that in each electoral division an officer should be appointed, whose special duty it should be to see that the rolls are kept as accurately as possible. We all know that at every general election thousands of persons whose names should be upon the roll are disfranchised. This undesirable result could be obviated by the appointment of an alert officer in each division, whose time would be fully occupied in insuring that only qualified electors were enrolled. Consequently I move - </para>

                    <para>If my proposal does not meet with the approval of honorable senators, I hope they will recognise the necessity of doing something to secure the enrolment of all electors who are qualified to vote.I know some divisions in which at least a third of the electors move from one place to another between elections. The necessity for obtaining employment is their first consideration, and the need for their electoral enrolment is quite a secondary matter. The additional expenditure that would be incurred by the appointment of an officer in each division for the purpose I have outlined would be merely a nominal one. The existing system does not insure the preparation of a complete roll. In New South Wales members of the police force collect the rolls. </para>

I quite recognise that the appointment of an officer for each division would probably involve the payment to him of a salary equal to that of an Electoral Registrar, in addition to travelling expenses. But, after all, that would amount to only a few hundred pounds a year in each division, and the number of electoral divisions in the Commonwealth is not very large. I hope the Minister will accept my amendment. </para>

                        <para>.  - May I point out to the honorable senator that at the present time we have in each electoral division one permanent officer whose duty it is to obtain information from every possible source. The appointment of an additional officer would mean that in a large electorate he would be completely lost. Our best way of achieving the result which the honorable senator desires is to insure the cooperation of the States with the Commonwealth. We shall then be able to avail ourselves, not merely of the services of the police, but of a great many other officers. At present a small subsidy is being paid to the postmen, who come into daily contact with the whole of the citizens of Australia, and who are, therefore, specially fitted to undertake the work of collecting the rolls. If the postmen are not getting sufficient remuneration for their services in this connexion, I shall be glad to co-operate with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> with a view to seeing that justice is done to them. </para>

                        <para>. - In my judgment the greatest mistake made has been to trust this work to postmen. I suppose that quite 50 per cent, of the people never receive a letter. How, then, is the postman to know what persons live in a particular house? How can he ascertain the names of those who are resident in flats ? He has merely to report that&#39; he cannot deliver a letter in order to receive his fee. That is the greatest mistake of all. I believe that a system could be devised under which we should not have to rely on postmen to collect our rolls, and under which we should secure much purer rolls than we have to-day. We know that at every general election it is found that persons who have been living in the same house for perhaps forty years have had their names struck off the rolls simply because the postman has reported that they did not reside there. </para>

                        <para>. - There are many districts in Australia in which the postman does not effect a letter delivery. In such districts he would have no knowledge either of the arrivals or departures from it. Then, on account of the high cost of land in suburban areas, it has been found necessary by many families to abandon living in bungalows, cottages, or mansions, and to take up their residence in flats. Other persons are continually coming and going, so that obviously the postman can have no real knowledge of the changes which are taking place. . I do not suggest that one officer in an electoral division will be sufficient to cope with the work of enrolment in that division, but there is certainly nothing in the provision we are now discussing which will meet this difficulty. The amendment which I have submitted is a step in the right direction. I quite admit that one officer would be utterly unable to travel over the whole of our large electoral divisions, seeing that it takes a very active candidate several months to traverse them. </para>

But it is not so to-day. It is really a difficult matter to get some people to enroll. The existing law is very defective in that regard, and it would be wise for us to appoint an officer such as I have suggested in each electoral division. </para>

                        <para>. - I venture to suggest that the system of compulsory enrolment is unnecessary in Australia. In the case of adults, I think that anything of a compulsory character is objectionable. But peculiarly objectionable is the system of compulsory electoral enrolment. Let me draw attention to the way in which a very great hardship is inflicted under the existing law. A person may be living on one side of a street in East Sydney, and may move to the other side of that street, thereby transferring his residence to the division of Wentworth without being aware of the fact. The ever-alert electoral officials discover that this change has been made, and, because the elector has not secured a transfer from one division to the other, he is haled before a Court and fined. Or, again, a person in the Waverley subdivision of the division of Wentworth may unconsciously move into another subdivision. He is liable to be fined if he does not notify the Department of his change of residence. Yet it is almost impossible for him to know where a subdivision begins and where it ends. It may be said, by way of reply, that a map showing the different electoral boundaries is posted at the local post-office. But from that map it is quite impossible for an elector to ascertain whether he is resident in one electoral division or in another. </para>

                        <para>. - At the present time, it is impossible to procure in Sydney an electoral roll which is even approximately correct, and no doubt the same statement holds good of the other capitals. The rolls now obtainable were printed prior to the last -election. In some cases, supplementary rolls were published later, but in other cases no such rolls were published. In my opinion, the printing of the rolls should be undertaken, not at the direction of the Minister, but at regular intervals. The shortage of paper cannot be advanced as an objection to this, because any quantity of paper is now available. Will the Minister agree to an amendment providing for the printing of the rolls eighteen months after a general election, and then again immediately before the next election? </para>

                        <para>. - The practice now is to print the rolls just prior to the election, but in each division there is an Electoral Registrar, whose duty it is to keep as accurate a list of the electors as can be compiled. On his roll are shown all additions, transfers, and omissions, and this roll can be inspected at any time. Nothing would be gained by printing the rolls eighteen months after an election, because such rolls would only serve the convenience of a few persons who can now get any information they require by visiting an Electoral Registrar&#39;s office; and, by the time the next general election came, they would be entirely out of date, so that we should be no better off than we are now. There is still a scarcity of paper, and it is necessary to economize. I trust, therefore, that the honorable senator will not press for an amendment of the clause. </para>

                    <para class="block">The amendment will meet with the approval of a majority of &#39; the electors, though not with that of those who have always opposed the extension of the franchise. It was most difficult to obtain the franchise for all adults of twenty-one years of age, and it is not long since - in New South Wales, at any rate - the owners of property could record a vote in every electorate in which their property was situated. It was not unusual for a big property-holder to record votes for from twelve to thirty candidates. The elections were not then all held on the same day, which made it possible for such an elector to vote first in city and suburban electorates, and later in country electorates. It is humiliating that today our municipalities, instead of being under the direct control of the men and women living in them, are governed largely by property-owners. I remember an occasion on which one man recorded four, votes by virtue of the property that he was thought to possess; and yet a few days later he filed his schedule. </para>

                            <para>- The number of persons which ray proposal would affect would not exceed 250,000, and the number in any one division would be very much smaller than that. Parliamentary elections take place usually at intervals of about three years. Consequently, a person who was twenty years and eleven months of age at the time of one election would be nearly twenty-four years of age when the next arrived. Neither the possession of property nor the attainment of the age of twenty-one years should be the qualification for a vote. Some of those who vote now give only the most casual attention to political matters. But, under our system of education, children leave school at the age of fourteen well equipped, and between the ages of fourteen and eighteen years are earning their own living. Boys and girls of eighteen years of age have only left off their schooling for three or four years, and are intellectually keen and alert. They are capable of grasping and solving a problem much more quickly than men and women of more advanced age, and physically are  almost  as fit as  they  will ever be. The average person of eighteen years of age would beat, on an. educational test, 99 per cent, of the members of this Parliament, and such persons are playing the part of citizens. Why then, should &#39;they not have the right to vote for parliamentary candidates? A considerable number of, boys, under eighteen years of age were accepted for military service abroad; but,, leaving out of account the military aspect of the matter, I say that, intellectually, the young man and young woman of eighteen years of age is equal to the average citizen, and,, in many respects, surpasses him in education and intelligence. </para>

At that time it was about twenty-three years. That would indicate that of the number  of  those who had enlisted there were probably between 80,000 and 100,000 who were at that time under twenty-one.  Of  course, since then many have reached the age of twenty-one. I should say that  when  our men have returned there will be from 20,000 to 30,000 soldiers throughout Australia who  will  be entitled to  vote as  an outcome of  the  provision covered  by the amendment. </para>

That disability prevents quite a number of worthy and intelligent aboriginals of Australia from exercising the franchise. I admit that there would be a difficulty in providing a test. I do not suggest an educational test, but that it should be left to the discretion of the Electoral Registrar. I shall move a specific amendment  later. </para>

                        O&#39;LOGHLIN (South Australia) &#91;2.5 a.m.&#93;.- Will aboriginal natives who have served in the Australian Imperial Force be entitled under the amendment just agreed to to vote irrespective of the disabilities imposed in sub-clause 4? Among the members of the Australian Imperial Force with whom I have come in contact, I can recall several aborigines and half-castes who were smart fellows, , and had been well educated at mission stations in South Australia.

Personally, I do not know of any full-blooded aboriginals in the Australian Imperial Force, and I understand that there has been a prohibition against their enlistment. I hope <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> will see how impossible it would be to efficiently administer the law if his amendment were incorporated. No doubt, there are some constituencies where a little looseness on the part of an electoral official in enrolling aborigines might sway an election. Unfortunately, the aborigines, as a class, is susceptible to the sixpenny piece in a manner which does not ordinarily apply to the white man. What sort of a test would be suitable, and what class of electoral officer would make the test? </para>

                        <para>. - It ill-becomes me to oppose any attempt to do justice to native inhabitants of this continent. But there is much in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> contention that unprincipled individuals might easily manipulate the aboriginal vote. In some countries the qualification for the possession of the franchise is the ability to personally write out an application for the vote. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> will make his amendment more particular, and will cite the qualifications as being the ability to write out an application before  a  justice of the peace or an electoral officer, I will support him. Any test should be educational. </para>

                            <para>- It makes me take very good care to see that I and my fellow Australians shall not be at the mercy of those who, not being Australians, seem to have no sympathy with them. During the last twelve months, without hesitation, and for party purposes, a Bill was passed through this Parliament disfranchising Australian-born citizens, the sons and daughters of British mothers and German fathers, and leaving them without a country, not because of their lack of loyalty, but because of the names they bore. If an Australian-born elector has done anything against this country let him be put where he cannot vote, but where there is no proof of anything but upright conduct against an elector he should not be disfranchised. Many Australianborn citizens feel their position keenly, and we cannot be too severe in imposing penalties on Ministers who attempt to deprive them of their right to vote in their native country. </para>

Another way of expressing the meaning would be to say &#34;for the month immediately preceding,&#34; but it would be much more cumbrous. Prior to making a claim for enrolment, a person must be residing for a period of one month last past in the subdivision. Other words might sound better, but may not express the meaning so clearly. </para>

If a deliberate attempt is made to keep a person off a roll he has always the right of appeal, and the further remedy that if he cannot be enrolled for the new subdivision he is presumably enrolled for his old subdivision in which he has lived for a month, or may claim to be enrolled for it. I cannot see any substance in the honorable senator&#39;s objection. </para>

This is a country of vast distances, with a large migratory population, and it may be that shortly before the twenty-one days has expired change of occupation compels an elector to move to some other part of the Commonwealth. He may not be conversant with the requirements of the electoral law, and in any case he may not have had time to notify the electoral office of his change of  address. I propose the amendment in order that no person may be unduly harassed. </para>

                        <para>.- The amendment would place in the hands of officials a power that is not likely to be beneficial to the rolls. Its effect will be to place on the official the responsibility of notifying the elector of his obligation.. That would mean that an elector&#34; would say, &#34; I am all right ; until I receive notice I need not bother.&#34; We know how difficult it is to induce people to interest themselves in getting their names on the roll. Make this amendment, and the elector will have the idea that before he needs to take any action, he will receive a notice from the Department. Thus he will be lulled into- a sense of false security. Even when notices are sent they do not always reach the addressee, and this amendment would prove a trap for the unwary elector, who would find that, through trusting to receive a notification from the Department, his name had been omitted from the roll.. So long as we retain, the compulsory enrolment provisions, it is better to- place the obligation on the elector, because, if only to escape the penalty, he will see that his name- is on the roll. If the amendment is made he will rely upon the officials, and the last state will be worse than the first. </para>

                        has pointed out by interjection what he. regards as an inconsistency between the twenty-one days allowed for enrolment,, and the month last past. The two periods are not concurrent. &#39;In the first place the elector must have resided in the subdivision for the month last past before he can claim enrolment, and after that month, he is allowed twenty-one days within which, to enroll himself and escape prosecution.

                        <para>. - I call the- attention of the Committee to the  fact  that, under&#39; subclause 3 every person who changes his place of living from one address in the subdivision for which he is enrolled to another address in that subdivision must notify the Registrar of his new address, or bc liable to a penalty of 10s. That means that if a man moves from one street to another in the same division, or from one house to the house next door, he will be liable to this penalty. This seems to be imposing penalties unnecessarily. I agree that there should be a time limit within which a man should notify his change of address, but usually the persons who are most likely to commit this offence are those who can ill-afford to pay a fine of 10s. </para>

                        <para>. - I support the amendment, on the ground that I object to compulsory enrolment; but if penalties are to be inflicted for non-enrolment on moving from one subdivision to another, <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> am prepared to support any amendment that will make the electors less liable. Why we should go out of our way to compel persons to enroll who do not wish to do so, I do not know. When a person has&#39; lived outside his. subdivision for a month, objection can be lodged against his name being on the roll, and unless, he can show to the satisfaction of the Electoral Department that, for the month last past he. has been living in- that subdivision, his name will be struck off. Clause 55, dealing with objections, makes that point quite clear. If I move from one side of the road to the other, and in so doing enter another subdivision, somebody may take objection to my name being on the roll for the subdivision which I have just left. And I remind the Committee that objecting is becoming a fine art. The National party has organizers who positively pursue electors in order to object to their enrolment. I may move across a road without knowing that I am entering another subdivision. I am not in that subdivision long enough to qualify for enrolment in it, and yet I -am disqualified from voting in the other subdivision, because I have not lived in it for the month last past. It is an outrage to fine an elector for something he has done innocently. If there has been a deliberate offence against the law, punish the offender, but this proposal to impose penalties in such a way that the electors will be annoyed and harassed makes me stronger in my opposition to compulsory enrolment. In the case of a working man who has offended against this provision, he has not only to pay the fine of 10s., but he must lose his day&#39;s employment in order to appear at the Court. It means nothing to one section of the community to drive to the Court at the appointed hour to answer a charge under this Act, but to the working man it means a lot. We can well afford to wipe out all penalties in respect of unintentional offences. If the Bill went further and provided that in addition to compulsory enrolment, there should be compulsory voting, it would be consistent. I do not say that I would favour compulsory voting. In all the laws I help to frame the fixed idea I have in mind is never to curtail the liberties of the people. Let their individual liberty be as great as possible, consistent with the well-being of the community. There is nothing inconsistent with the well-being of the community in saying that an elector ought to be able to move from one house to another without rendering himself liable to a penalty. The amendment provides a safeguard that before he is penalized for not having reported his change of address, the elector shall have notice that will enable him to comply with the wishes of the Department. It is no more trouble for the Department to issue a notice to him that he must attend to his enrolment than it is to send a summons to him. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>All these wrongs come from a bad principle that is getting an increasing hold ; we do not consider the people, but adopt a roughshod method of ordering them to do something or be penalized. I object to compulsory enrolment in its entirety. I object also to the manner in which it has been administered. I will not say that the electoral officers have not been considerate in individual cases, but having such a law to administer, they must inflict great hardships on the community, who already have enough hardships without being involved in penalties for non-enrolment. In many cases it is impossible for the elector to know that he has shifted from one subdivision into another. I hope the Minister will reconsider the whole of -this clause, and if he will not abolish compulsory enrolment, will at any rate not seek to drag electors before the Court without giving them notice that they ought to enroll. If a hundred notifications were sent to electors, telling them that they must enroll within a specified time, 90 per cent, of them would comply with the requirements of the Act. Only 10 summonses would then be required, and surely there would be a great saving in time and trouble in issuing only ten summonses instead of 100. The Department should study, also, the convenience and feelings of the electors. A wealthy importer doe3 not mind going before the Court to answer a charge of having defrauded the Customs; he suffers no anxiety by reason of the indignity placed upon him. But the highly sensitive working class people suffer intensely when they are summoned.I know of persons who felt so keenly at having been taken before the Court that the monetary penalty was no punishment compared with the mental anguish and sense of degradation they felt at having been dragged into Court for an innocent breach of the law. I do hope that the </para>
                    <para>Minister will consider the convenience  of  the people who sent us here. I am glad of this opportunity to enter my protest against such an iniquitous clause. </para>

                        <para>. - In connexion with sub-clause . 3 of this clause, it is proposed, subject  to  clause 220 being passed, to provide by regulation that defaulting electors may elect to be dealt with by the District Returning Officer, instead of being summoned to a Court. This will avoid Court fees, which in some States are heavy, and insure uniformity of penalty. It was proposed to adopt a similar course in connexion with the compulsory voting provisions of the Act passed in 1915 in relation  to  the abandoned referendum of that year. I think the  course which  I have outlined will remove  much  of the objection which has been urged to our present procedure. Of course, it will not remove objection to compulsory voting as a principle. But  we are  not now discussing that question. </para>

I shall, however, avail myself of this opportunity to reply to the  Minister&#39;s  statement that, if my amendment be accepted, a power will be placed in the hands of certain officials which it may not be desirable to vest in them. Whilst I have every confidence in the officers of the Electoral Department, I have no desire to see people unduly harassed. If, for example, a person engaged, say, in the timber industry in the Swan division of Western Australia finds that he can better himself by accepting employment in the mining industry in the Kalgoorlie division, and accordingly removes to the latter division without notifying the authorities of his change of address within the prescribed period, I want to avoid the possibility of his being summoned for his forgetfulness. Notwithstanding the announcement  of  the Minister, which removes a good deal of my objection to this provision, I still think it will be worth while to ascertain the opinion of the Committee on my amendment. </para>

                        <para>- I challenge the Minister to say that all objections lodged within the past twelve months to the retention on the rolls of the names of electors, have been accompanied by a deposit, as provided by the law. As a matter of fact, the paid professional organizers of the National party avoid &#39;the necessity for putting up this deposit by inducing the Electoral Department to send out the requisite notices. These &#39; organizers are the means of persistently disfranchising persons who should not be disfranchised. I know that Labour electors are persistently pursued by these professional organizers with that end in view. All the tricks imaginable are resorted to in an endeavour to prevent these electors being afforded an opportunity to record their votes. </para>

                        <para>. - I cannot accept the amendment, because I do not think it represents the proper way to deal with an officer who has exceeded his duty. The officer is supposed to lodge these objections only after he has informed himself that there are names upon the roll which ought not to be there. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has alleged that under this provision officers lend themselves to party political organizations by lodging objections to the names of persons who have a perfect right to be on the roll. The way in which to deal with such officers is to discharge them. Members of Parliament are keenly alert to the grievances of electors, and would quickly bring before the Minister any misconduct on the part of an officer. A provision such as the honorable senator proposes would be calculated to deter an officer from doing his duty. Officers are not desirous of objecting to enrolments, because such objections may make trouble for them, and if we made it risky for them to do their duty in this respect we should have inflated and unreliable rolls, and that would not be of advantage to any party. </para>

                        <para>. - Much expense could be saved if it were not made necessary to advertise in the newspapers the receipt and particulars of writs. When the Senate elections take place, within a couple of years&#39; time, a notice must be published in two newspapers in each of the States, although the event could be made known to the public equally well by the posting of notices at the post offices and electoral offices. In regard to House of Representatives elections, notices must be published in two newspapers in each Division. I think that the newspapers might well he asked to publish for nothing the announcement of elections. In the Sydney newspapers columns are filled&#39; with the election announcements relating to the various metropolitan and country electorates, because we are slavishly following a practice that was adopted when there was no better means of informing the public. The New South Wales notices are published not only in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> but, to prevent complaint, they are published also in the daily newspapers&#39; and the Sunday newspapers. </para>

                    <para class="block">If we had business announcements to make we could not do better than advertise in the newspapers with the largest circulation, but the electors could be informed of the particulars of, writs without any newspaper advertising. The candidates themselves could be trusted to make their supporters acquainted with the detailed arrangements for the election. Australia will never have to advertise for Parliamentary candidates. With preferential voting there will be more than ever. The present newspaper expenditure is a waste of public money. No doubt in regard to the coming Corangamite election the Government will publish a formal notice in every newspaper circulated in the district, including the metropolitan newspapers; but the public could get its information just as well from notices published as I have suggested. </para>

                        <para>. - The determination of the Government to continue the subsidizing of the newspapers is characteristic of their attitude towards the press. We were told the other day that some of the newspapers have been paid&#163;1 5s. per inch for advertisements of the war loan, and the electoral advertisements must be very expensive. The publication of notices in the <inline font-style="italic">Government Gazette</inline> would meet all the requirements of the clause, and if I had my. way, the Government would confine its advertising to its own newspaper. No private company would subsidize other agencies than their own. I hope that the Government will not continue to spend money unnecessarily on press advertising. </para>

                        <para>. - The clause provides that no person who is at the date of nomination, or was at any time within fourteen days prior to that date, a member of a State Parliament shall be capable of being nominated. I ask the Committee to strike out the clause. It unnecessarily restricts the choice of the electors. For a long time I have been of the opinion that members of the State Parliaments should not be compelled to resign their seats before being nominated for this Parliament. I think that the intention of the framers of the Constitution was that every citizen should be permitted to offer himself as a candidate for election to this Parliament. I know of no good reason for the clause. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> and I were elected in 1906 he had to resign the seat which he had in the Parliament of Western Australia, and many others have had to do the same. Some have obtained seats in this Parliament, but others have been less fortunate. No embargo should be placed on State members who &#39;wish to contest Federal seats. They should be permitted to do so while still in possession of their State seats, and, if unsuccessful, should be able to retain their State seats. The striking out of the clause would save expense in many cases, because it will make a number of State by-elections unnecessary. Now a State by-election is caused whenever a State member resigns to contest a Federal seat. </para>

                            <para>- That is a poor reason for retaining the clause. The National Parliament has been thought to occupy the highest sphere of legislative activities, and should set a good example to the States, instead of following their  bad example. If we do so, the States will reciprocate. In  any  case, the choice of the Commonwealth electors should not he restricted. State members have &#34;proved themselves, and their services would be of great value in this Parliament. I should like to know the Government&#39;s reason for retaining the clause. </para>

                    <para class="block">I do not see the need for that provision. The choice of such an officer may be limited. There may be an individual who is just under twenty-one, but who in all other respects completely fills the requirements and would make a better presiding officer than any other man available who would not be debarred by the age limit. To indicate the need for placing no restrictions upon the selection of the most suitable presiding officer, I call to mind the incident of an official who was removed from performing his duties in peculiar circumstances. It was in connexion with an election for a New South Wales constituency. The presiding officer at a polling booth lost his job because he refused to shake hands with one of the candidates - a former friendly acquaintance - on election day. The point is that that officer offended the Nationalists&#39; interests by that action, and the outcome was that many of the electors so resented the unfairness of the treatment meted out to the official that they refused to go to the polling booth at all. Here was a reputable man, quite capable of carrying out all his duties, and whose integrity was unquestioned; but he was immediately removed because he had been somewhat offensive in the polling booth to a particular candidate, and because he was not deemed suitable, therefore, from the National stand-point. </para>

                            <para>- I will cite another instance. I boarded a train from Sydney on the&#39; morning before election day, and there were four other men in the carriage going out to stations along the line. One mentioned that he was proceeding to take charge of a polling booth, and added that he had been organizer of a party but that it was considered that he could do more good as a presiding officer. I did not report that matter, as such action is generally useless. Conditions such as that operate in numbers of political contests. Altogether I cannot see why there should be an age limitation when it should be desired to secure the very best man available. Undue influence of party or other nature should not be permitted to interfere with the selection of returning officers. Possibly it might be wise, where there are two officers to be appointed, that, in view of the fact that there are two main parties, one of the officials should be known to belong to one, and the second to the other party. In that way, in every polling booth, one official would be inclined to keep check on the other. No member of a Labour league could secure such a position, because he would be known to be connected with a political organization. But there is no good reason why such a person should not be chosen. A man who belongs to neither one party nor the other is not likely to be either fair and impartial or of a good intelligent type generally. Under  this  clause very serious disabilities are growing up owing to the particular pull which a party may have. Scrutineers should be paid. It is absolutely impossible for a Senate candidate to send a scrutineer to every polling booth, although he may know that if he does not send scrutineers to certain centres he will  not  get a fair deal. Knowing that my party had not got a fair deal at one  Rolling  booth on a prior election, I sent a scrutineer to that booth at a recent election for the Senate, and he reported that there was some underhand work going on.. Thereupon, a second man was sent to see that every ballot-paper counted from that booth was scrutinized. Out of 470 ballot-papers, twelve were wrongly counted to the disadvantage of my party. I insisted  on a recount. When the parties are very evenly divided, twelve votes out of 470 could easily turn the result of an election. Our application for a recount was not granted. In such polling booths dishonesty can creep in, and now we have the opportunity to render it impossible for unfair tactics to he employed in order to unseat a man who has honestly won his election. However, as I do not think that honorable senators would support a proposal to pay scrutineers, I shall not move in that direction. There are many other clauses in the Bill which should receive full consideration, but they can be dealt with on recommittal. Now that we have made so much progress with the Bill, it would be a fair thing for the Minister to have progress reported. </para>

                            <para>. - There is no good reason for retaining this clause. If there is one class of business which is under the immediate supervision of the police, it is the retail liquor trade. The object of this clause is to prevent the consumption of intoxicating liquor on polling days, but in some of the States no licensed premises are permitted to open on the day on which an election for Parliament is held. In any case we should study the convenience of electors. The wealthy candidate is able to stock his committee rooms with liquor in order to make ample provision for those who work hard on polling day, and who are otherwise debarred from obtaining it through the closing of the hotels; but the day has gone by when the consumption of strong drink may -be considered likely to affect an election. I object to our pretending a virtue which we do not possess. The intelligence of the community would strongly resent too open an inroad upon the proper conduct of elections. It would also be inclined to resent the idea of some candidates that they can control votes by supplying liquor to electors. There may be attached to licensed premises a large dining or billiard room, which, seeing that the bar is closed, could be used as a polling booth, hut this clause will prevent its&#39; being utilized, and may compel the officers of the Electoral Department to rent premises which are by no means conveniently situated. Many of the schools have not the advantages possessed by a billiard-room in licensed premises. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator will give the Labour warty credit for having helped to purify elections. I have had the opportunity of watching the means that the old-time candidate used in order to secure his return to Parliament. Those days passed away when the Labour party began to take an active part in the affairs of the country. This clause may have been a very necessary provision in the old days, when some candidates adopted certain means to provide refreshments for their supporters; but that state of affairs does not exist to-day, and the clause is no longer necessary. Many licensed premises are strictly closed on polling day. The landlords will not permit the consumption of liquor even at the price of &#163;1 per glass, and the few shillings that these publicans could earn by letting their dining or billiard rooms as polling booths would serve to compensate them to some slight extent for the loss they suffer by strict adherence to the law and by closing the bars. Why should we make an hypocrisy of this matter by saying that we prevent the consumption of intoxicating liquors by prohibiting the use of any portion of licensed premises for polling booths, when wealthy candidates are able to supply voters and friends at their committee rooms, or at other places conveniently situated to the polling booths? Why should licensed premises be singled out for discrimination? We say to the licensed victualler, &#34; You  must  conduct your business ou legitimately licensed premises; the State will partake of your profits, and the public&#39; must be protected against you; yet your business is such that we cannot permit a polling booth to be conducted in one of your rooms, no matter how far removed it may be from the bar.&#34; However, I feel that I have done my duty in pointing out that this kind of thing could well cease, and I shall not deal with&#39; the matter further. </para>

                        <para>. - This clause informs us that ballot-papers to be used in the Senate election may be in the Form E in the schedule, and that form instructs the voter to put a cross opposite the candidate&#39;s name. The Bill attempts to provide for uniform rolls, Federal and State, and provides for preferential voting for the House of Representatives. If  the Government desired to confuse the electors at general elections they have gone the right way about doing it. The people who will be called upon to put crosses opposite the names of candidates on the Senate ballot-papers will have other ballot-papers in their &#39; bands on which they will be asked to mark 1, 2, 3 in order to show their preference for House of Representatives&#39; candidates. Why cannot the Senate ballot-papers be also marked 1, 2, &#39;3? It may be said that it can only be done when proportional representation is adopted for the Senate. The Government announced as portion of. their policy preferential voting for the House of Representatives, and proportional representation for the Senate, but they have gone only half way, \ having baulked at the latter proposal. With two systems of voting in operation, we shall have confusion worse confounded. It may be that at a general election some referendum regarding proposed alterations of the Constitution- will be taken, and that will mean that there will be at least three ballot-papers handed to the elector, who will be. required to apply to them two methods of voting. In the confusion that will result, there will be a large increase of informal votes. </para>

                            <para>-Preferential voting involves and permits an intelligent discussion of proportional representation. The two systems must be considered together, and the Minister will surely not refuse us an opportunity -of discussing them in a manner and under conditions befitting a deliberative assembly. If my request for such an opportunity is not granted, it will be a stain on the credit . of the Senate that after a highly intelligent community had been pressing this most important matter on public attention, when the Senate had what should have been an opportunity of . discussing it, the&#34; Minister would not allow discussion to take place under favorable conditions. Last night <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> said that he would be willing to postpone this clause, and because of that promise I have refrained from speaking on many clauses to which the Committee has agreed. I remind the Minister that even if the clause is not postponed the schedules will be open for discussion, and if they are altered a recommittal of the clause will be necessary to make it conform to the schedules. </para>

                            <para>- I wish to emphasize&#34; the confusion that will result from having two different systems of voting in operation on the one day. The elector will be given a ballot-paper on which, in accordance with the existing practice, he will be required to place a cross opposite the names of the candidates he prefers. In the same booth, and at the same time, he will be given a ballot-paper for the House of Representatives upon which. may be the names of seven candidates, and he must record a continuous and exhaustive preferential vote. Unless he marks the order of his preference to the full extent of the seven candidates his vote will be informal. I can foresee that under a changed system for the House of Representatives and the old system for the Senate there will be a large crop of informal votes, due not only to a misunderstanding of the system, but also to confusion as to who are the candidates. The confusion may be assisted by&#39; the similarity of the names of the candidates on the two ballot-papers. If the elector should mark a cross against a name on the Senate ballot-paper his vote -will be informal. The Government should provide that ballot-papers shall not be considered informal if the intention of the elector can be clearly seen&#39;. We ought to adhere to the old system of voting until we are in a position to- apply the same new system to both Houses. Preferential voting would have a greater advantage when applied to the Senate than when applied to the House of Representatives. The Senate constituencies are so huge that  that system would probably give candidates who had real support in the community an opportunity of being elected to this Parliament. To some. extent the preferential voting will do away with the party candidates. Why any elector should be called upon to give a second preference to a candidate whom ho dislikes I cannot understand. Of course, it is said that unless preference is indicated in respect of every candidate whose name appears on the ballot-paper the system will fail, and I have good reason to believe that that fear is well founded.

                    <para class="block">Parliament adopted a system of preferential voting, but if the elector did not wish to indicate a preference for more than one candidate, he simply placed the numeral 1 before the name of the candidate whom he favoured. The result was that both parties ignored the- preferential system and each selected a candidate for whom its supporters plumped. The option is still in operation in Queensland to-day, and preference is not much exercised. For the sake of safety each party plumps for its own candidate. The .principle of preferential voting has been very widely discussed. I do not understand it, although I have read a good deal about it. I refer to the system of proportional representation. Quite a number of persons see in this system not the (proportional representation of the States, but a more equitable system of representation than we have at the present time. At the elections which took place in 1914, the Labour party secured four out of. the six vacancies which existed in New South Wales. At the general elections in 1917, that verdict was reversed, and the. Opposition secured the whole of the seats. </para>

                            <para>- I do not intend to discuss this clause at much greater length. I should have liked an opportunity of debating the preferential and proportional systems of voting under conditions which would have &#34;enabled me to deal with them intelligently. However, that cannot be done now. Nobody will pretend that after the strenuous sitting to which we have been subjected, the conditions for debating these matters are anything but bad. One is almost at a loss to understand why the Government have said in effect, &#34; Important as these matters are, we shall debar honorable senators from discussing them in a way which will permit of justice being done to them.&#34; Of course, I am aware that Ministers regard all debate of their measures as an- impertinence on the par.t of honorable senators, and I can quite understand how they have arrived at that condition of mind. While the war was in progress we were, reluctant to oppose them, and as a result they have contracted the habit of suspending our Standing Orders to rush their measures through Parliament. That is the explanation of their attitude on the present occasion. </para>

                    <para>In order to insure majority representation, I think that a second ballot is preferable to preferential voting. This system has obtained in New South Wales for some years. At- the close of each election it is found that, in regard to about a dozen out pf ninety seats, a second ballot requires to be taken. In the closely settled metropolitan districts this second ballot is taken within one week after the first ballot. In the more scattered rural areas, a fortnight is allowed to intervene between the first and second ballots.  This interval affords an opportunity for great exertions being put forth by those responsible for the running of the party machines, in&#39; all contests in which there is a possibility of effecting a change in the result of the first ballot. But, generally speaking, the second ballot gives the opinion of the majority in a rough-and-ready way. If, for example, there are five or six candidates at an election, a.nd no candidate secures an absolute majority On the first ballot, a second ballot is taken. To my mind this second ballot is better&#39; than is the preferential system of voting.  </para>
                    <para>I have not yet grasped the proportional system of voting sufficiently to understand it. </para>

At that time a great deal of suspicion existed between the States. The small States in particular feared to concede proportional representation lest an injustice should be done to them. I am sorry, indeed, that the Government have missed such a splendid opportunity for enlightening the community upon this very important matter. One of the things which puzzles me in connexion - with proportional voting is that of - the quota. &#39; I would have been pleased if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> and other Tasmanian senators had essayed the task of making clear to me exactly how the system of proportional voting operates. I am satisfied that we&#39; shall not be afforded another opportunity of dealing with the question during the present Parliament. Those of us whose term as senators has not six years to run will not be again called upon to amend our Electoral Act. I am bitterly disappointed with the Government for having refused to postpone the consideration of this clause. Upon the admission of the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> and the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell),</inline> it Is the most important provision in the measure. However, I have entered my protest, and I have nothing further to say. But I shall consult the Standing Orders, with a view to determining whether, upon the motion for the recommittal of the Bill I shall be in order in discussing . proportional representation and the preferential voting system. I hope, however, that this threat will not induce Ministers to try to rush the measure through more hurriedly than they have been doing. </para>

                    <para class="block">I submit the amendment, because I think it is one which is worthy of the consideration of the Committee. It is a democratic proposal. The cost of elections is paid out of the Consolidated Revenue, and the Commonwealth Government goes further in paying for the machinery of elections than does the Government of any other country. It would not add greatly to our electoral expenditure to do what I propose. The clause as it stands permits candidates to appoint scrutineers for all the polling places, but it is impossible, owing to the cost, to  obtain  scrutineers for all the polling places in a State, or even in a division. The division of Dampier is, after the division of Grey, probably the largest single electorate in the world, and a candidate contesting the Dampier seat has almost as difficult a task as a candidate for the representation of Western Australia in the Senate. It is impossible, owing to the cost, to place a scrutineer in every polling booth in an electorate like that. I think that &#163;2 2s. is only a reasonable sum to pay to a scrutineer for attending in a polling booth from the opening to the closing of the poll. I admit that my proposal will add to the cost of conducting elections, but it would help to secure still purer elections, though I do not say that our elections have been impure. The presence of scrutineers will facilitate polling, and very often they will be able to materially assist the presiding officers. </para>

                        <para>. - The general principles upon which a ballot-paper may be. rejected are already indicated in clause 134. It is impossible to define what mark, sign, or action of any kind, on the part of the voter, may lead to the rejection of a ballot-paper. I could enumerate off-hand a dozen possible causes, but any list of them would prove deceptive to the public. In any case, I am not sure that it is possible for the electoral office to say finally what an acceptable ballot-paper may be. That is a matter for the decision of the High Court. We would be glad to do what the honorable senator suggests should be done, but it is not possible to do it. </para>

I do not know why the amount was fixed at &#163;25 in the Commonwealth Electoral Act, but, whatever the amount, the deposit is a relic of the bad old days when property and not human beings counted at the ballot-box. It has resulted in a number of enthusiasts who were determined to place their  views before the public having to pay a penalty by forfeiting their deposits.

                            <para>- I have no serious objection to the provision in the Act which provides that persons who will be absent on polling day may record their votes before registrars, but that section is being repealed by this Bill, and apparently absentees will have no means of voting except through the post. In theory the postal vote looks all right. A person who by reason of illness is prevented from recording his vote does suffer a hardship, and I should be very pleased if I could remove that hardship without having to adopt practices of so questionable a character that I predict that after the first general election under the new Act it will be found necessary to repeal this clause. My experience has forcibly impressed upon my mind the conviction that immediately a ballot-paper gets outside a polling booth it is liable to be misused. We are all desirous of seeing elections conducted cleanly and free of abuses, but the postal system has always lent itself to abuse, and I feel certain that the Government are making a grave error in contemplating its reintroduction. Probably the Ministry have carefully thought over the matter and arrived at a conclusion; therefore, a prolonged discussion of the clause would be futile. I understand that the Minister proposes to strike out the present distance limit of fifteen miles and substitute ten miles, and that will make the provision still more objectionable. It will place an immense number of votes at the disposal of those who can employ clerical assistance, and will not result in recording the true opinions of the persons who are alleged to be voting by post. I ask the Committee to reject this clause. The postal system was not in operation at the last general election, and surely the National party ought not to grumble at the results they obtained. If they say that they are including this clause for the special benefit of the Labour party I should very much doubt their word. It is a pity that a blot of this sort should be included in this Bill, which contains very many excellent provisions. The postal voting provisions, were the main reason why I voted against the second&#39; reading. I intend to move an amendment to provide for a departure from the ordinary method of recording votes. It will permit of the inmates of hospitals exercising their franchise, not through the post, but in the presence of a Returning Officer and of a scrutineer. Certainly the ballot-papers would require to be sent to those Institutions some days prior to polling-day, and that I regard as objectionable, because it might possibly permit of the manipulation of those papers. But the fact that the Returning Officer will subsequently appear on the scene would, I think, provide an adequate safeguard. I recognise that in no circumstances is it possible to secure the votes of the entire community. But the amendment which I shall submit will; allow the majority of those who are unable to attend a polling booth on election: day an opportunity of recording their votes. </para>

                        <para>Those honorable senators (referring to Senators Millen and McColl) evidently feel very sore about the proposed abolition of postal voting. Ever since I entered the Senate I have battled against postal voting, and have consistently and strongly opposed it whenever the question came up for discussion. On the first opportunity afforded me here to raise my. voice in opposition to the postal voting system, when I found I was beaten I tried to make the Senate realize the ridiculous nature of the system by suggesting provisions to enable any member of the general public to witness applications for postal ballot-papers. However, that was not done. The Government now recognise the absurdity of the postal voting system, and propose its abolition. . . . </para>

                        <para>On the last occasion when this matter was before the Senate, every member of the Labour party, with the sole exception of myself, voted for the abolition of postal voting. I honestly believed at that time that the system was good and necessary, and that it was possible to safeguard it from corruption, and enable people who could not otherwise do so to record their vote. I regret to say that I was mistaken. The electoral officials have not been able to devise sufficient safeguards to prevent corruption under the postal voting system. . . . </para>
                        <para>I have heard it asserted, and I have every reason to believe that in some cases the statement is quite true, that more postal votes have been issued than have ever been accounted for at the poll. </para>

I shall be -able to show that, not only were the parties engaged in the conduct of elections corrupt in their actions, but they went so far as to corrupt the public servants of the country..... Would it astonish honorable senators if I told them that at one election for Townsville, nearly one-third of the total votes cast were postal Votes of men and women who would have had no difficulty or trouble whatever in going to the poll and recording their votes an the ordinary way. ... I was led away by the interjection from the matter I had in hand, which was the conduct of a particular election at Townsville, in which one-third of the total votes polled were postal Votes. On that occasion, I go so far as to say that somebody was responsible for corrupting a Commonwealth public . Department, and inducing the officers of that Department, to do something which they should not. have done, and which was against the law of the land. These are facts for which I can vouch from personal knowledge and observation. </para>

                    <para>What happened at the referendum in last April? I take the State of Victoria, and let honorable senators see what the figures disclose. There was a total of 28,000 odd postal votes recorded. Of that 28,000 odd votes, no less than 14.000 were recorded in Victoria, where there are greater facilities for voting than in any other State. &#39;Under the Queensland Electoral Act it was provided that a postal vote should be posted on the day on which it was attested by the authorized witness, the same as under the Commonwealth Act, and it should bear the postal stamp of the date on which it was filled in and posted. What happened at the election to which I refer? The canvassers for the alleged Liberals - who ought to be honest enough to call themselves Conservatives and Tories of the deepest dye - went round every day and collected as many postal votes as they could. Of course, as they went round, they tried to influence people to vote for the candidate whom they favoured. After they had collected as many postal votes as they could during the day, they carried them into the organizing office of the alleged Liberal party. They were there retained until after 10 o&#39;clock, or later, when the meetings concluded, and after the letter boxes had been cleared for the day by the postal officials. Then they were posted, and when, next morning, the postal officials cleared the letter boxes, they put on one side the postal ballot-papers, which they could recognise, because of the marking on the envelopes. They then date stamped all the other letters in the ordinary way with the date on which they were Collected from the boxes, but when they came to stamp the postal voting envelopes  they  Changed the date stamp to that of the previous clay. That is a fact which came under my own observation, and I reported it at the time to the Postmaster-General. </para>
                    <para class="block">I am using these arguments to support my opposition now to the postal voting provisions of the Bill. When the Government of that, day appealed to the country to restore the postal vote, it was ignominiously defeated, and the present Government should not have tried to restore the system without a mandate from the electors. The decision of the people has not been reversed. They do not want a postal voting system. To continue my quotation from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> - </para>

                        <para>Let me mention another case to show what happened under the postal voting system. I can say from personal knowledge that, while it was in force in Queensland, on certain mining fields, while the men were at work, the managers, who were justices of the peace, used to go round- to the women folk - the wives, mothers, and sisters of the miners - and terrorise them into recording votes against their convictions. This led to a great deal of family disunion and heartburnings in, many families on the mining fields in Queensland. A poor unfortunate wife, dependant upon her husband continuing in employment with the good-will of the mining manager, would be absolutely forced by the duress of her circumstances to give a vote when asked -for it in that way, though there was no reason why she should not have gone to the polling booth and recorded her vote in the ordinary way. These managers knew that the only way in which they could secure votes for alleged Liberal candidates whom they favoured was to induce such people to vote by post. Will any reasonable or fair-minded man say that a system which could lend itself to so much iniquity and corruption should be retained? What happened at the referenda in last April? I take the State of Victoria, and let honorable senators see what the- figures disclosed. There was a total of 28,000 odd postal votes recorded. </para>

On one occasion, during a &#34;Werriwa election, a Liberal organizer, who had been paid a sum of money to leave the Labour movement, told me that he had put 640 postal votes in the day before the poll, and he was right to the very figure.

                    <para class="block">The Government, in providing for postal voting, are apparently anxious to afford the electors every possible facility to exercise the franchise. They have just carried an amendment under which an elector who has reason to believe that he will not be within 10 miles - instead of 15 miles, as before - of a polling booth on election day will be entitled to vote by post. That will have the effect of largely increasing the number of electors who will avail themselves of this part of the Act; but, at the same time, the Government are placing serious difficulty in the way of prospective applicants for postal ballot-papers by restricting, in the way they have done in this clause, the classes of persons who may act as authorized witnesses to such applications. Those who are remote from centres of population will have great difficulty in securing the witnessing of their applications. These restrictions on the part of the Government are contemptible. Why should not a duly qualified Labour organizer be entitled to witness applications for postal ballot-papers? Many of the authorized witnesses for which this clause provides are to be&#39; found only in our large cities, and are not available to the men in the back-blocks. </para>

In one of the suburbs of Sydney, we had the greatest difficulty in enlisting the services of a justice of the peace to go round with an officer to witness applications for enrolment for the municipal franchise. I do not know whether the Liberal Caucus has met, but I do know that it is most obstinate, and now that the Government have decided to inflict on the people this pernicious and nefarious system of voting- </para>

                            <para>- Then I withdraw the remark. In order that the people for whom ostensibly this discredited system of voting by post has been provided may have an opportunity to avail themselves of it, I submit my amendment, and sincerely hope that it will be carried. Under it any man, say a selector working out back, could get his mate to act as witness and thus save much time. We all know that to many working people it is a matter of much concern to lose even half-a-day&#39;s work in view of the high cost of living. If the Government are determined to have postal voting, then every elector should be given full opportunity to exercise the franchise. </para>

                        <para>. - It is certain that if the witnesses be limited in the way proposed &#39; in the clause, every elector will not be afforded equal opportunity. The penalty for fraud is so drastic that there need be no fear that a man will witness a signature unless he is very satisfied that the case is genuine. Nobody but a husband far away in the back-blocks can know whether his wife is able to go to the poll, and he, if an elector himself, should be able to witness her application. I do not see that the choice of witnesses should be limited to people permanently employed in the Public Service of the  Commonwealth.  What objection is there to permitting the captain or chief engineer of any vessel attesting the signature of a member of the crew, just in the same way as the master of a vessel owned by the Commonwealth or State will be permitted to do ? Why not make it a free and easy matter to take advantage of this clause? During an election in which I was a candidate, one very dear to me was lying in a hospital, and it was amusing to hear from her how the canvassers of the Liberal organizations waited on her and endeavoured to get her vote, until they heard she bore my name. Many unfortunate sick people do not care whether they vote  or  not. </para>

The postal vote is for the men in the backblocks who have to fight famine, storm, and pestilence; and we should also consider the members of our mercantile marine, and enable, as I say, the captain, engineer, or any qualified elector, to witness the signature. I may be appealing in vain, but I know that on previous occasions I have induced the Government to bring about desired amendments by means of regulation; and I hope that on the present occasion some method will be found to give full voting facilities to the classes of people I have mentioned. </para>

                        <para>. - I venture to say that, between the issue of the writ and the day of election, it will, . in many cases, be quite impossible for electors in districts in  which the postal facilities are of a somewhat primitive character, to succeed in securing a postal vote certificate in time to record a postal vote at the election. I think that steps should be taken to enable electors to make application for postal vote certificates at any time when an election is approaching. Notwithstanding the provision here made to meet the convenience of out-back electors and those who are sick, I believe that, in practice, it will be found that very many will be unable to take advantage of it. I am aware that it is useless to submit an amendment upon the clause, but I hope that some attention will be given to what I have said when the regulations dealing with this matter are under consideration. </para>

                            <para>- I have not much hope of being able to alter the views of honorable senators supporting the Government. In the early stages of Federation it was understood that there should be no limitation on the choice of the electors among candidates for the Federal Parliament. We have no reason to believe that the restriction contained in this clause has had a very beneficial effect. The fact that some of the State Parliaments would not reciprocate should not affect this Parliament. The clause limits the right of electors to choose their representatives. As the field of choice should be made as wide as possible, I oppose its re-insertion. </para>

                        <para>. - By far the greatest number of members of the Federal Parliament have had some experience in State Parliaments. We should not be greatly discommoding ourselves by permitting members of the State Parliaments to ascertain the wishes of the electors for Federal seats without inconveniencing their constituents, and occasioning further expense, by having to resign their State seats before nominating. This has been a vexed question  in </para>

                    <para class="block">Tasmania, where, I believe, an Act has been passed enabling State members to contest Federal seats by providing that, if they are defeated, it is not necessary for them to stand again for re-election to the State Parliament. Why should we impose a disability upon men in whom the electors have already expressed confidence ? It savours somewhat of the dog-in-the-manger business. I admit that a State member has ah advantage over the ordinary candidate by retaining his railway pass, and not having to pay his fares in the campaign, but that advantage does not amount to very much; and I know of no other that he possesses. I was a State member, and resigned my seat because I did not find the position very attractive. If I had been defeated for the Federal Parliament it was not my intention to recontest the State seat. It would be generous on the part of honorable senators to refuse to impose any disability on State members, because, after all, whatever may be said of us by some people&#34; outside, the public have selected most of us after experience of us in State politics, and for many years to come the representation in these national Chambers will be largely constituted of recruits from the State Parliaments. It would do no harm if this clause, which was left out by accident, was allowed to stay out. </para>

                        <para>. - I want every elector in the Commonwealth to have equality of opportunity. Every State member should have the chance to nominate for the Federal Parliament without having first to resign his State seat. I hope to see the day when there are no State Parliaments, but that will be a long time coming. We have had some hard lessons lately so far as that is concerned, but it takes very hard lessons indeed to alter old, crusted national customs: This clause was originally put in our electoral law because of the unfair advantage a State sitting member, with his travelling facilities and his railway pass, had over his opponents.I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> that that is a matter of very little importance, and no consideration of that kind should stand in the way of the most brainy men in the community seeking to enter the Federal Parliament without having to go through the ordeal of resigning their State seats. </para>
