The one is not censored while it is in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> volume; yet the same speech contained upon a single sheet is subject to censorship. Will the Minister see that speeches, whether contained in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> orin the form of a reprint, are not interfered with by the censor in transit? </para>

                        <para>- I have seen the press reports of the judgment given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Heydon. The cases referred to, and the unions concerned, come entirely within the jurisdiction of the State arbitration laws of New South Wales. The agreement to which the honorable senator refers is, however, hardly an agreement, since it requires two parties to come to an agreement upon anything. It was a promise by the State Premier concerned, which is necessarily a matter for his redemption. </para>

                            <para>- I ask the Leader of the Senate whether, during the strike of July, August, and September last, certain unions were not de-registered by an Executive act of the Federal Government? If so, in view of the promises of the members of the Government at the Recruiting Conference that steps would be taken to replace the unions upon their old basis, will the Government adopt the necessary action to re-register those unions ? </para>

Is the Minister aware that it has been published frequently that in Canada, which is a British Dominion, prices are available to producers of molybdenite and tungsten ores, which are nearly double the prices that may be secured by producers of those ores in Australia? Will the Minister make representations to secure to Australian miners a parity of prices with those ruling in Canada? </para>

A cable has been received from the High Commissioner conveying an invitation to twelve editors or owners of newspapers in Australia to visit Great Britain and the Western Front. The matter is now receiving the attention of the Government, whose desire is that the mission should be a thoroughly representative one. I hope to be in a position at an early date to make a full statement regarding the matter. </para>

                            <para>- Well, there is even in the Bill a provision relating to a land tax to which I object. This is alleged to be a machinery measure - a Bill to levy further taxes upon industry. Surely there can be nothing more objectionable at this stage in our history. The Bill is designed to tighten up the machinery of existing taxation with a view to squeezing more taxes out of the industrious section of the community. I can conceive of nothing more objectionable than that. There is no doubt, however, that the Commonwealth has full power to levy any taxation that it may please. That point was settled long ago, and the Ministry, having been given a lead by a. previous Government, are only too willing to follow in their footsteps. ]t will doubtless be recollected that a previous Administration brought, forward  an  Income Tax Bill which contained a proposal to levy an impost of 5 per cent, upon the rental value of the house in which a taxpayer resided. Such a provision operates as u direct hindrance to industry. In this Bill it is proposed to proceed still further in the same direction. Following the bad example set by their predecessors, the Government propose to take into consideration the value of the dwelling in which an employee resides, and to regard the rental value of it as part of his income. I think that every person in the community should be encouraged to invest his money in improving the country by building a home for himself. Yet we find that the Government are prepared to tax him in exact proportion to the expenditure he incurs in that direction. I hope that the Senate will refuse to agree to any such proposal when we come to consider it in Committee. It has 'nothing whatever to recommend it, and it simply represents a further effort to secure revenue by "wrong means. Under the guise of an income tax, it is an attempt on the part of the Government to impose a small Federal land tax. I hold that we could deal with a proposal of that sort much more satisfactorily by means of a straight-out amendment of the land tax. </para>

                    <para>I repeat that the Government propose to take into consideration the value of the land upon which a man erects his house, and to tax him at the rate of 5 per cent, on the total value of that laud and of the improvements which he erects thereon. Such taxation does not meet with my approval, and when we reach Committee I shall endeavour to have this obnoxious proposal removed from the Bill. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Under the guise of an income tax, it is a proposal to tax the value of the land, together with the improvements thereon. This Parliament appears to be slavishly following the lead of the British Parliament in the matter .of taxation. According to the Estimates for the current year, the imperial Government propose to collect from income tax, including super-tax, the sum of £224,000,000, whilst from land tax- including Crown  lands,  land and house duty, and land value duties - they expect to collect only 'the nominal sum of £3,600,000. After the speeches which were delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George and others, I was certainly under the impression that the British Parliament would do something in the direction of compelling the land-owners of Great Britain to contribute substantially to the revenue of the country. But it has not done so. The Commonwealth Government - apparently following ' the lead of the Imperial Government - propose to explore every nook and corner with a view to securing as much revenue as possible by means of an income tax, quite regardless of the disturbance to industry which may thus be effected. I noticed in the press a few days ago that, speaking, at Hawthorn, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McPherson,</inline> the Victorian Treasurer, said - </para>

I was trying to show him the proper source of taxation, and he assured me that it did not really matter how taxation was imposed, because in the long run the working mau had to pay it. It will at once be admitted that there is some truth in his statement, but it is very far from being the whole truth. It is an effort made by a member of the Industrial Workers of the World, and, no doubt, also by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McPherson,</inline> to cloud the real issue. It is quite true that the only men who can pay the taxes are the men who work. No men other than those who produce can pay anything. </para>

                            <para>- But it is also true that, in addition to paying the taxes, the men who work are keeping <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie and a great number of other non-producers in very comfortable positions - people who render no service whatever to the community, and who, indeed, are a distinct drawback to it, being merely parasites, and producing nothing. No one would imagine, by the wildest flight of fancy, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie in his position here is engaged in any useful productive work. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McPherson</inline> overlooks the fact that the schoolmaster has been abroad, and that to-day we are quite able to analyze his statement, and show how fallacious, misleading, and mischievous it really is. It is, of course, true that the working man pays the taxes, National, State, and local, because nobody else can pay them ; but, in addition, he has to maintain every one of those parasites who do no useful work, otherwise they would perish, and we should hear no more about them. Yet we are told by prominent public men, as if they were telling the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, that it does not matter how taxation is imposed, because ultimately it has to be paid by the working man. If that is so, and I do not deny it, I would point out, as forcibly as possible, that, in addition to paying all the taxation of the country, the man who does the production of the country has to pay and maintain all those who do no work at all. Who maintains our Forces at the Front to-day ? . Is it the man who does no work ? Not he. The woman who knits a pair of socks for a soldier at the Front does a great deal more for his support, maintenance, and comfort than is done by those who, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, sit down here and do nothing. </para>

                            <para>- Possibly I am a little wide of the mark, but I wish to make the point that it is, and always has been, a matter of the most vital importance how taxation is imposed. The British Government go to Customs and Excise, and to incomes, to raise many million pounds of revenue per year, because they know that by going to those sources they leave untapped and untouched the very people who can best afford to pay, and whom they represent. That is the reason why the Commonwealth Government to-day are following very carefully in their footsteps. When I see a public man making statements like those just referred to, I am not prepared to let them pass unchallenged and uncontradicted. How long would the six State Parliaments of Australia and the National Parliament live but for the man who produces potatoes, pumpkins, and other commodities in the Commonwealth ? They would not, and could not, live at all. They all live upon the man who does the actual work of the country. Consider the number of people in Australia who do not do any work, but live upon the workers ! There are armies of them. We have six State Parliaments, six State Governors, a National Parliament, and a National Governor. How many potatoes do they produce in the course of a year ? Some of them do some useful work, or think they do, by employing other people to do it; but, personally, they do mighty little. Then take the innumerable Boards that have been established, and the Commissions that have been appointed. It is becoming almost impossible to-day to find a man who is doing any useful productive work. He is either shifting papers about, or talking, or doing something in that direction, but producing nothing useful whatever. The men at the Front would not remain there five minutes but for the food and clothing made for them by the actual workers in the community. It is as well to keep steadily in mind that, while the working man pays all the taxes, he has, in addition, to keep all the members of the various bodies throughout the Commonwealth in good positions, without their engaging in any productive work at all. </para>

It is proposed by the Government, under the clause I have just mentioned, to value the premises where an employee may live, and tax the annual rental value of those premises; but they do not say a word about the army of civil servants in some of the States who escape the payment of Federal income tax. That, apparently, is correct. </para><interjection>

Why  should they escape? They are certainly well paid, and should pay some thing? towards the cost of the government of the country in which they live. </para>

They are living here and enjoying the protection of this country in just the same manner as the Honorable senator, and I say that if it is good to tax anybody by way of income - :I do not think that it is, <inline font-style="italic">hut</inline> evidently the Government consider it an excellent principle - surely it should be a good thing to tax the salaries of the State Governors, foreign consuls, and trade commissioners?  Why  should members of the State and Federal Parliaments be called upon to pay income taxation if these officials are to be exempted ? As one representing many of the working people of my State, I want to know also why the Governor-General should not pay taxation, and thus assist in carrying on the affairs of this country ? I am not, of course, referring to th° present occupant of that position, but to the position itself, and I maintain that the salary of the Governor-General should be brought under the operation of this measure in just the same manner as other incomes are. </para>

                            <para>- I am against the whole Bill from start to finish. There is no good in it. The income tax imposed by the Federal Government in 1916 produced £3,932,775, and in 1917 £5,621,948. But the Government are not satisfied with this amount, and it appears now that they are determined to drag a few more pounds out of the poorer sections of the community. That system of taxation does not meet with my approval in any way whatever, and, therefore, I am going to vote, against the Bill with a view to showing that there is a far more equitable method than that now suggested by the Government. I do not care about the proposal to tax cooperative companies. That .also is objectionable. There is nothing in the Bill that meets with my approval, and in Committee I shall take advantage of any opportunity that presents itself to endeavour to defeat all the new clauses proposed by the Government. </para>

                        <para>. - This is a class of measure which we may expect to have very frequently before us in the near future. Any one who has studied the financial position of the Commonwealth at the present time must view it with something akin to alarm. The figures published yesterday by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. "Watt</inline> were little short of staggering. It is not my intention, in great detail, to go into the various figures connected with the finances- of the Commonwealth. That duty was very ably performed last evening by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten.</inline> We are all very much indebted to the honorable senator for the very clear way in which lie put the figures before US. To take only a cursory glance at the financial position of the Commonwealth as disclosed yesterday by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt,</inline> I may say that he represented that. £609,000,000 is the actual debt owing, by the handful of people who are scattered over this great continent. Of that amount, some £300,000,000 is owed by the States. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> pointed out that to some extent, if not entirely, that sum has been expended upon reproductive works which are returning sufficient to meet the interest on the amount borrowed. That leaves us with what may be called a dead debt of £309,000,000, incurred chiefly as the result of the terrible war in which we are engaged. Reckoning the interest on this amount at 4-J per cent, in round figures, we have to face an annual bill of £14,000,000 to provide interest on these dead loans. There must be added to this the annual expenditure involved in the payment of pensions, which, sad to say, 5s increasing day by day. I have looked into the matter pretty thoroughly, and if the war were to cease to-morrow our obligations in respect of the payment of pensions would be something like £9,000,000 a year. </para>

                            <para>- My figures include old-age, invalid, and .military pensions. I have given only an estimate-, but I think I am somewhere near the mark when I say that we" must face a payment of something like £9,000,000 a year to meet the obligations of the Commonwealth in respect of these pensions. It will be seen that in order to meet the interest on dead loans and our obligations in respect to pensions we shall require nearly £22,000,000 a year. That should give us cause for very deep thought. How are we to balance the ledger ? </para>

                    <para>Under our theory of taxation in the past, it has been understood that we should meet ordinary . Government expenditure and fixed expenditure, such as that upon pensions, out of the revenue for the year, otherwise we should gradually drift into insolvency. The only purposes for which we may legitimately borrow money are reproductive works and war expenditure. I hope that we shall continue to be guided by that theory of taxation, as otherwise our finances may drift into a chaotic state. Already we are a very heavily-taxed community. The- Federal income tax on the highest incomes reaches no less than 6s. 3d. in the £1. The highest rate of State income tax paid is paid in Queensland, where it runs up to 3s. in the £1. </para>

                            <para>- I agree with the honorable senator. That has been brought out very pointedly by the fact that the returns from the New South Wales income tax are very much the same as are the returns from the Federal income tax. It is remarkable that this should be so when, under the New South Wales income tax, the highest rate is only ls. 2d. in the £1, whilst under the Federal income tax the highest rate is 6s. 3d. in the £1. In the circumstances, I am inclined to doubt whether the Federal Income Tax Department is deriving all the revenue it should. It would appear that some persons who ought to pay Federal income tax are escaping their obligation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> referred to the fact that the New South Wales income tax produces very much the same results as the federal income tax, although the rate is very much higher in the . case of the latter. I admit that I do not understand the reason for this, and the remarkable fact certainly needs looking into. </para>

                            <para>- - I have not gone thoroughly into that matter, but it is decidedly strange that the New South Wales tax, with a comparatively low maximum, should produce nearly the same amount as the Commonwealth tax, with a very much higher maximum. </para>

                    <para>I have stated our theory of taxation, and under it we know that those in receipt of incomes of over £156 per year, or £100 per year jil the case of unmarried men, have to bear a great deal of the load of taxation. I believe that the taxpayers of the Commonwealth desire chiefly two things. The first is that all should be taxed alike. The people do not desire that there should be discriminating taxation under which' one man escapes whilst his neighbour has to pay. Another tiling is tha't the taxpayers desire to see the most rigid economy practised in carrying on the Government. I hope that that will be the motto of the Government for many a day to come. I look upon the recess that is rapidly approaching as absolutely necessary to give the Government the opportunity to consider the best means of securing economy of administration. </para>

                            <para>- I am prepared to justify it. The honorable senator, unfortunately, because he was ill, was away upon a long holiday, and I may say that I do not desire the recess for myself, but in order to give the Government time to look into the finances of the country. When they meet Parliament after the recess, I hope that they will be prepared with a number of sterling proposals to cut down the number of the Boards and Commissions to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> has referred. It is simply staggering to find by a report of the Public Service Commissioner that the employees of the Commonwealth in this time of war were in creased in number by 2 per cent, last year. </para>

                    <para>Why should not the Commonwealth and State Taxation Departments be amalgamated"? There has been a most admirable conference of the heads of the Taxation Departments of the Commonwealth and States. The report of that conference is one of the most business-like reports that was ever drawn up. The gentlemen attending the conference did their work well. They presented a most able report, and it is now the duty of the Commonwealth and State Governments to give effect to that report. The people of this country demand that something shall be done to amalgamate the Taxation Departments. We need uniformity of taxation, and I am one of those who believe that the Commonwealth is the proper authority to carry it out. I have heard it argued, and I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> mentioned it, that the New South Wales Taxation Department is. run very much more cheaply than the Federal Department. It should not, however, be forgotten that, particularly in the case of landed estates, the Commonwealth Department has had a great deal of work to do in connexion with valuations. It is a comparatively new Department, and is not properly going yet. </para>

                            <para>- No; because there have been so many changes in our taxation that the Department has had almost every year to make a fresh start. If the Commonwealth and State Taxation Departments were amalgamated, the State officers taken into the Federal Department could explain to our Federal officers the way .in which they had conducted their business in the different States. I am sure that our Federal officers would not be above taking a hint that would lead to better administration, and in this way the economy that is so necessary would be brought about. </para>

                            <para>- I intended to refer to that. I am glad the honorable senator has called my attention to it, be? cause there is, at the present time, an enormous unnecessary burden thrown on the taxpayers throughout the Commonwealth. They are hardly done preparing a return of income or land tax for a State Department when they are called upon to prepare another for the Commonwealth Department. The annoyance caused to taxpayers in this respect is getting beyond endurance. I have always been an advocate of State rights, and I feel that that there is nothing so much calculated to weaken the contention for State rights as the continual irritation caused by having to make up separate returns for Commonwealth and State. Many of my friends, who have been strong advocates of State rights, are beginning to say to me, "For goodness' sake, let us have one Government. We are sick of all the returns we. have to make out." If our State Premiers do not now see the disastrous effect this is calculated to have upon the State rights question, I think they very soon will. I am very glad to see a clause in the Bill now before us to enable the amalgamation of Commonwealth and State Taxation Departments to be brought about. I hope that it will lead to a saving of expense, and will put an end to the annoyance and expense to individual taxpayers caused by the present system. </para>

                            <para>- The amalgamation of these Departments would result in the saving of money. That has to do with Commonwealth expenditure, and that is why I refer to the matter in discussing this Bill. If we could amalgamate those Departments we might be able thus to assist to some extent in the reduction of this vast expenditure. The matter has been before the various Governments, who have all come to an agreement. But that does not seem to have any effect. We never appear to do anything. In Parliament, we seem to do nothing tangible. We talk day after day, and night after night, especially upon such things as points of order; but we never do anything, actually. If I were Prime Minister I would cut down expenditure by £10,000,000 in a very short while. It was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> who said that this matter was rotten ripe for consideration. There we could save very much <inline font-style="italic">money,</inline> and conduct our affairs in a really businesslike method. I am therefore glad to see the provisions of clause 3 within this Bill. </para>

                    <para>The increase in the numbers of officials in our Civil Service is significant. The figures given to us are 2 per cent. We are certainly doing more work, but I very much doubt whether we are not duplicating, a great many of our civil duties. As to the Bureau of Science, for example, there were organizations of that sort in all the States previously. They were very efficient, although I do not recall that they have done a great deal of tangible work. Like other educational bodies, however, they pointed out to the individual the right track to follow, and especially did they give assistance to the great producing industries. The imposition of the Commonwealth Bureau on top of the State organizations appears to me to have been unnecessary. </para>

                    <para>At a later period we shall have to face a tremendous increase in taxation. In. Australia we labour under great disadvantages owing to our distance from the world's markets, and because of the freights which we are thus called on to pay Canada and other parts of the Empire are collecting enormous sums by the taxation of legitimate war profits. In the Old Country the Excess Profits Tax, has amounted to £220,214,000 per annum, A great deal of that is drawn from freights. Freights have soared until now poor Australia has been deprived to an enormous extent of its normal tonnage. This is due, of course, almost entirely to the war. Australia expects to get in two years from its war-time profits tax, which is more far-reaching than the British law, a sum amounting to only about £1,000,000. Compare that total with the sum drawn in the Old Country during 1917-18- £220,000,000 sterling. That is a splendid total, drawn from a splendid source of revenue. I have not been able to ascertain what Canada has secured in the same direction, but I know that that Dominion is also reaping a vast harvest by the taxation of war profits It might well be mentioned in the Old Country that a great deal of the £220,000,000 comes out of the pockets of Australians through the excessive freights which they have to pay. When accounts are being rendered from all the different parts of the Empire in connexion with our war costs that is one matter which we should keep prominently before the Old Land. </para>

                    <para>With respect to the provision in the Bill for employers to collect taxes for which their employees are liable in certain cases, it should not be forgotten that much of the friction which existed in the past has now departed. The recent Recruiting Conference at Government House allayed a great deal of that friction. Tax collectors are never very popular, and I am afraid that the imposition of this duty upon employers may develop fresh causes of friction. Employers do not want to undertake the obligation, but I suppose that if the Government say we must do so, there will be no help for it. </para>

                            <para>- I have heard that many men avoid paying income tax by appearing with one name in one avenue of employment, and by working under another name when they have been taken on elsewhere. I understand that that is done to a great extent. The only way to meet that sort of thing would be either by the use of a stamp upon the payment of wages, or by insisting upon a discharge certificate, as in the case of seamen to-day. </para>

Another consideration is that there are many ways of dealing with a recalcitrant employer; but, as to the employee, there is only the source of his wages to draw upon. </para>

                    <para> I hope that in future we shall avoid anything further in the way of retrospective taxation.. One clause in the Bill under discussion validates that principle. We know that the intention is to save revenue. Nevertheless, there are many hard cases which would be affected under this clause, while, in other instances, the parties concerned have brought the situation upon themselves. They had an amount carried forward when the Act came into force. That sum, at first, was not taxable. The Act referred only to the period up to the 30th June, 1914, and .any slim made before that was not taxable. It was found then that a great deal of income which should have paid taxation was stated to "belong to those amounts which had been carried forward. Thereupon the Department, to protect itself, got the Minister to amend the Act so -as to make the carried forward profits taxable in the ordinary way. That amendment 'has not proved 'sufficient. </para>
                    <para class="block">Now, therefore, there is this further proposal, which has been introduced solely for the protection of revenue. In this respect I understand that no further retrospection is contemplated; yet the fact remains that there aTe some very hard cases owing to the difficulty of differentiating between those who should not have to pay, and those who ought not to be permitted to escape. But I hope that in future there will be no retrospective taxation, and that taxation will fall upon all alike. Above everything, I trust that there will be a thorough investigation into our machinery of government and a remorseless cutting down of all unnecessary expenditure. If that course be not followed, assuredly we shall get upon the rocks. </para>

                            <para>- I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> that an allowance of 5 per cent, for wear and tear on machinery is not sufficient. To my mind a larger deduction should be permitted. I also think that when machinery is scrapped the cost of it, less the sum written off for depreciation, ought to be allowed as a deduction in a man's balance-sheet. We do not desire to encourage men »to continue working with antiquated machinery, and if we do not allow them to make the cost of that machinery, when scrapped, a charge against their profits, we shall be legislating to compel them to keep their old machines at work. Now, we require to encourage the use of the newest machinery with a view to increasing production and to making that production as economical as possible. There are a great many details connected with the measure with which we can better deal in Committee, and for that reason I shall not continue my remarks. </para>

                        <para>.- The debate upon this Bill has been commendably short, but it has lost nothing of its value from a business point of view on that account. We have had one or two speeches which, I venture to say, have impressed honorable senators - speeches which have compelled their attention, and which have brought under review certain matters of high importance in regard to which I think a reply from me is necessary. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten's</inline> speech is one of those to which I wish particularly to direct attention. I also desire to associate with him the name of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn,</inline> who has briefly referred to similar matters here to-day. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> in a very thoughtful address which he delivered last evening, put forward certain points, and his objections to this Bill may, I think, be classified under certain definite headings.  His  first criticism was that the Commissioner of Taxation adopts a high-handed attitude in determining the deductions allowed on account of depreciation of plant and machinery. Secondly, he claimed that the Bill ought to touch 381,000 people who were admitted to be in receipt of incomes exceeding £160 per annum, whereas the Commissioner of Taxation only assessed 235,000 persons. </para>

                            <para>- Then the honorable senator was attacking the method. I merely wish to get the real purport qf his criticism. I certainly understood him to contend that the Federal Government loses revenue because instead of following the State system of collecting at the source it collects from the individual. Another objection by him had reference to the retrospective character of certain of the provisions of this measure. He further objected to the liability of employers to pay the tax on behalf of defaulting employees. I think that I have now indicated the points to which the honorable senator took exception. He then proceeded to advocate that the collection of the income tax should be intrusted to the State Taxation Departments rather than to our own Department. </para>

                    <para>I shall deal first with the honorable senator's accusation that there is a tendency to high-handedness on the part of the Commissioner of Taxation in regard to the amount which he allows on account of depreciation of plant and machinery. The honorable senator knows perfectly well that the Act itself lays certain obligations upon that officer. One of those obligations is to determine the deductions which shall be allowed on account of depreciation. Now, the Act itself limits the items in respect of which depreciation may be allowed. Whatever may be said of the Act itself, it is only fair to the Commissioner that I should point out that there are limits placed on his authority. </para>

                            <para>- It must not be assumed because this officer does exercise a discretion that he is without some direction from the Act as to the way in which that discretion should be exercised. So much for the limitations that are placed upon the Commissioner by the Act itself. Now, as to the way in which that officer discharges his duty. I have not the slightest doubt that in fixing the rates in respect of depreciation the Commissioner, to the best of his ability, has had regard to the varieties of plant and machinery used for business purposes, and has sought the best advice available as to the average life of that plant and machinery. He does not pretend to be an expert on machinery, but he does claim to have consulted those persons whose advice was calculated to help him to arrive at a just decision. Having done that, the rates fixed apply to a normal day of eight hours, because scientific examination has shown that if machinery be continuously worked for a longer period the effect upon it is more serious than if it be worked for a shorter period. I was not aware of that fact until the other day, but it is one which has been scientifically demonstrated.- </para>

I am doing this because the complaint made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> is not a new one. I do not think, however, that he quite means all that he says against these officials.

                            <para>- Where a firm sets aside, say, 5 per cent, on account of depreciation, and puts that money into ils own business, which is earning, perhaps 20 per cent., -it will be seen that a considerable difference must be made as to the period when the capital cost of the machinery employed will be wiped out. It is quite a common practice for those who take up the attitude of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> to assume, in reference to the depreciation of machinery, that the cost of any machine ought to be divided by the number of years that represent its life. If a machine, for example, costs £100, and its life is set down at twenty years, the ordinary custom is to wipe off, on account of depreciation, £5 each year. But in practice it has been found that if a machine has a life of twenty years it is not necessary to provide a sinking fund of £5 annually, because if that fund is, as is invariably the case, employed in the business where it earns interest, a smaller amount than 5 per cent, is quite sufficient to make up the capital cost of the machine when its life ceases. </para>

But it is always open to him to show by specific cases where the Commissioner is wrong or where the Act is wrong. At present I say that the Commissioner has taken very great care indeed, in that he has pushed his inquiries as far as possible in an endeavour to obtain scientific knowledge to help him in this matter, and he has arrived at the conclusion that what he is doing is not unfair. </para>

                            <para>- I do  not  know them. But I take the Commissioner's assurance that he has had. such consultations. At present I can go no further than that. I am quite certain that neither the Government nor the  Commissioner  desire to do more than the Act empowers them to do. I have some little knowledge of an evaporating plant - that is a plant which gradually wears out - and I know as a business man that I always allowed more for depreciation than experience showed to be necessary. If I had a machine, I wrote down for depreciation 10 per cent, for the year. But the machine lasted more than ten years. I allowed that rate for depreciation, as all business men do, for the purposes of safety. </para>

                    <para>The next point is that we are losing some revenue by allowing a number of those who ought to be taxpayers to escape in some way or other. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> estimated them at about 100,000, but I am not so much concerned as to the actual number, as I understand the honorable senator to say that he merely gave the figure as indicative without being definite. The point would still be worth inquiring into if the number supposed 'to escape was much less. In fact, if anybody escapes we ' are bound to look, closely into the matter. But is there reason to suppose that any considerable number of persons are avoiding their just 'obligation? The figures concerning the total num'ber of returns received for the 'current year's assessment have not yet been finalized, but from approximations made they exceed 600,000. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> speaking from figures which he had drawn from the wealth census returns, spoke of 381,000 persons who ought to be paying income tax. The estimate made by the Taxation Department is that this year's current returns will exceed 600,000. </para>

                            <para>- It is true that the Act has been widened, but we ought also to recollect that our Taxation Department is a comparatively new institution. It was inevitable that when it came into being there would be some little weakness, some gaps, some slips, but' as each year goes on the Department is able to tighten up, and it is probable that some portion of the increase is due to that tightening-up process. No Department, and I have very close personal reasons for knowing this, can spring into existence, Minerva-like, fully equipped. It takes a little while before the Department adjusts itself to the' task thrown upon it. Our Income Tax Department is now three or four years old, and it is only reasonable to suppose that where gaps have occurred, where a section of the taxpayers have evaded their obligations, track has been taken of them, and they are gradually being roped in. I assume, therefore, that some portion of this increase is due to that fact, and some to the enlargement of. the area of taxation. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot understand the tenacity with which the honorable senator hangs on to. his. point when I have  offered  a. reasonable explanation. Men. who return a, certain income for the purpose of. a wealth census, do not, by that means, declare, themselves as- payers of income tax, because, when they fill in r&amp;turns, for income- tax purposes they are entitled to exemptions, allowed by- the Act, which will frequently- bring them, below the taxable- amount. Besides, insurance payments, they can deduct premiums for friendly societies and there is the deduction, allowed in respect of children. Frequently a man who showed himself to be in receipt of a net income of over £156 under the census return, would not have an income entitling him to be taxed under the Income Tax Act. "Whether the number who would thus escape is large or small, some allowance must be made for them. The 600,000 odd returns that have been received to date by the Commissioner will not all represent income taxpayers. When the accounts are finally adjusted some of those persons will be found to be exempt. -It is a reasonable assumption, and I admit that in this matter one can speak only on assumption, that, in view of the 600,000 returns received, the average number of taxpayers will be in excess of  those of previous years, and will also dispose of any supposed discrepancy between the income taxpayers and those shown on the census cards to which the honorable senator referred. </para>

                    <para>With regard to the failure to trace taxpayers, I have already referred to the fact that the Department is a comparatively new organization. As it has to deal with people spread over a continent of no mean dimensions, it was inevitable that there would be some escapees in the early period of its operations. The Department, in its effort to trace defaulters, is persistently and methodically following out a course which is showing every day beneficial results. There is an invariable tendency in Australia to complain when  a  Department adds to its numerical strength. When honorable senators draw attention to possible loop-holes, they ought to remember the steps taken in other countries to stop them. In England there is a most extensive organization in this regard. The Income Tax Commissioner has his own officer .resident in almost  every considerable centre. He is  a  sort of permanent resident income tax inspector, and is known officially as an inland revenue officer. He is supposed to have personal knowledge of, and supervision over, all the people living within the area of his jurisdiction, and by  a  variety of means, some open and some otherwise, he forms an estimate of, and keeps a check on, their incomes. If Australia adopted that course, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> would, with  a  good deal of sincere indignation, draw attention to the gross expansion of the Department and its rapidly increasing and unjustifiable expenditure. </para>

At any rate, the Department, without any such rapid expansion, is gradually bringing in those who have hitherto avoided the duty imposed upon them by the Act. </para>

                            <para>- Even then it will not be easy. We may tell everybody to do so, but one of the difficulties is that in Australia men change their occupations very much more frequently than in a settled country like England, and not only that, but I think I am not libelling some of them in saying that they also change their names. In the circumstances, it is easy to preach a counsel of perfection, but, as sensible men, we must take notice of practical difficulties in the way. of giving effect to it. The Department is making very strenuous, methodical, and successful efforts gradually to see that those called upon to make returns and payments shall do so. </para>

                    <para>The wisdom of collecting the tax at its source where companies are involved, or of collecting from the individuals, has also been the occasion of much controversy. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has strenuously urged that the system operating in New South Wales can be adopted with advantage by the Commonwealth. He says that system is more simple, and makes the tax easier of collection. That may be quite true, but is it more equitable? The present method of the Commonwealth is to tax the taxpayer on the dividend he receives as portion of his general income. The proposition of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> and those who think with him, is that we should levy on the dividends of the companies on a flat rate before they are distributed. </para>

                            <para>- That is not going to simplify matters. The effect of the proposal is this: We have in operation  a  graduated income tax, which requires that a man with a larger income shall pay a higher rate, and the man with the smaller income a lesser rate. If the tax is collected, as in New South Wales, from the company on a flat rate, the effect will be to release the recipients of bigger incomes from some portion of their just liability, and to throw upon the recipients of smaller incomes a tax to which the law says they are not subject. </para>

                            <para>- I am dealing with the general proposition which has been put to the Government with a great deal of frequency, if not force. The whole difference of the two systems is this : The Commonwealth Government say that if a man liable to pay only 4d. in the £1 receives a portion of his income from a company, that portion shall go into his general income, and he shall be assessed on it at 4d. in the £1, but that, if another individual is liable to pay 5s. or 6s. in the £1, he shall not escape portion of the tax at that rate simply because part of his income is derived in dividends from a company - that each shareholder shall pay at the rate which Parliament says shall apply to his income. If we have a flat rate for a company it will mean that a man will pay either higher than the minimum or lower than the maximum intended by Parliament. We have taken the flat rate at ls. 10£d. in the £1. What will that mean? It will mean that the smaller shareholder, who, Parliament has said, shall pay at the rate of 4d. in the £1 upon his income, will be called upon to pay ls.  10½d.;  whereas the man who Parliament has said shall pay at the rate of 6s. 3d. in the £1 on his income, will be let off the difference between that amount and ls. 10$d. This proposal is manifestly unfair, because it will require a man whose income from shares held in a company may be only £150 to pay at the rate of ls. 10-Jd., while a man with a similar income derived from an individual business will pay at the lower rate. That would be manifestly unfair. </para>

My answer to that is that it would be a distinct injustice to holders of company scrip in receipt of small incomes, and a distinct violation of one of the fundamental principles of our income tax system. </para>

                            <para>- I shall be glad if the honorable senator will first allow me to finish my argument. I repeat that this proposal to levy, a flat rate on companies' would not only be inequitable, so far as the taxpayers in receipt of smaller incomes are concerned, but also a violation of the principle of our Act. It 13 the accepted policy of Australia that the persons in receipt of larger incomes shall pay taxation at the higher rate, and this proposal to levy a flat rate upon companies' dividends before distribution undoubtedly means that the smaller holders of company scrip will be called upon to pay more than the amount which Parliament said they should pay in order that the richer men may be let off the amount which Parliament has said shall be imposed upon them. </para>

                    <para>Let me give one or two sets of figures to show how inequitable it would be to levy a flat rate upon companies prior to the distribution of dividends. I have quite a number of instances, but I do not propose to weary the Senate by reading them all. I shall quote just one or two to illustrate my argument. In a manufacturing concern of 520,000 shares of £1 each the total number of shareholders is 1,323, and the average number of shares is 393 per shareholder. They run all the way from 476 shareholders holding 100 shares or over, to -69 shareholders holding less than 100. And now we <inline font-style="italic">come to</inline> what is the interesting and critical point in the statement - the dividend point. We find that the dividend in this company ranged all the way from 8s. to one shareholder to £2,200 to another. In the case of a pastoral company £18 was the minimum amount of dividend paid to any shareholder, and £810 the maximum. Turning, now, to financial companies, we find that the dividends ranged from 4s. Id. paid to one shareholder, to £406 to the highest. In a commercial trading company, 12s. was the minimum amount paid to one shareholder, and £1,220 the maximum. In an ordinary company, the dividends ranged from 4s. to one shareholder, to £24,017 to the largest shareholder; and in a shipping company, one shareholder received 10d., and another £3,797. It is obvious that Parliament never intended that the shareholders in receipt of the smaller amount should be taxed at the same rate as those in receipt of. the larger dividends. Can any one show justification for releasing recipients of the larger dividends from some of their liabilities, when, by releasing them, we impose upon the persons in receipt of smaller dividends taxation at a rate higher than that sanctioned by Parliament? </para>

The only alternative which, in- my opinion, is entitled to consideration is the adoption of the New South Wales system df levying -on the flat rate, and subsequently collecting any deficiency in the amount received from the larger incomes, and also making a rebate to those who were not entitled to pay the sum demanded of them under the flat rate. </para>

It is not proposed, when this Bill becomes law, to collect any 'taxation from those who have not paid up to 'the 'present. That, indeed, would be retrospective legislation. What is proposed is to validate what has already been done by the Department.

                            <para>- I can quite conceive that a man earning £5 a week for a limited number of weeks in the year would, under <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten's</inline> proposal, be paying income  tax although his total income for the year might not amount to more than £60 or £70, and Parliament has said that that man shall not be taxable. This is a matter not without its difficulties from whatever standpoint is viewed. I am sure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> recognises that the obligation sought to be placed upon some employers will not make them liable to the amount of tax due to the Department. The employer's liability will be merely, after notice has been served upon him by the Taxation Department showing that some one in his employ owes money to the Department, to see that portion of the money due to that employee is withheld and paid to the Crown. </para>

                    <para>There is one other matter to which I should like to refer, and that is the very frank and pronounced advocacy by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> of an agreement with the State Governments under which they should act as collecting agents for the Commonwealth Government. We are all agreed as to the advisability of getting rid, as early as possible, of the duplicate machinery of taxation. I venture to say that, if that were brought about it would effect not only economies in departmental expenditure, but a vastly greater saving to individual taxpayers. Even a man whose operations, like my own, are very small, may consider it worth a few shillings to avoid the preparation of his own income tax returns. Small as my operations are, I hand the preparation of my return over to an accountant, to whom I pay a modest fee. I have no business operations, and I can quite believe that some of my business friends have members of their staffs engaged often for weeks in preparing their returns. If the saving of expense in this respect be multiplied by the number of taxpayers, it will be admitted that the amalgamation suggested would result in the saving to taxpayers in money alone of an amount running into hundreds of thousands of pounds. In addition to that it would re- </para>

It seems to me that for that reason alone it is essential, if there is to be an agent in the matter, that the Commonwealth Government should' act as agent for the States Governments rather than that the States Governments should act as agents for us. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad the honorable senator has reminded me of that. He is quite right when he says that his figures are entitled to some reply. But before I venture to give that reply I think the honorable senator should give the Senate some more information than he has yet given us. He made certain statements, in all sincerity, which he said were supported by the highest authority, to the effect that the Commonwealth is losing some millions of pounds which we might otherwise collect. I suggest that on reading the report of his speech the honorable senator will see that he did not support those statements by facts. He smiles, but I say that it is not sufficient for him to assert that the Commonwealth is losing millions of pounds because it does not adopt some different system. There is an obligation upon him to follow up that statement, and indicate more clearly and definitely than he has- done the particular way in which we are losing that money. He referred to companies and the enormous profits they make, and pointed out how little we are receiving from them. I direct his attention to the fact that the incomes of these companies are not so great as he apparently assumes. </para>

This is a general invitation to the honorable senator to indicate more clearly than he has done so far, the way in which these surplus millions are at present running through our fingers. </para>

                        <para>. - As I am not a financial expert, I have not very much to say on this Bill. Like that which we have just been considering, it is a machinery measure which can be best discussed in Committee, where I may have something to say upon it. I believe that experts are agreed that sinking funds are necessary for all loans, but it is important that they should be properly administered. We shall have to wait to see whether this measure will be properly administered after the war is over. I understand that a sinking fund* of \ per cent will wipe out a loan at 4 per cent, in forty-one years. We have increased the interest on some of our war loans, and in that case it will take longer for the fund so created to redeem those loans. </para>

I should have thought that a Bill involving a very important principle, as this measure does, would have received some attention from them. The only member of the Opposition who has spoken on the measure is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall.</inline> In view of the public attention which financial questions have received recently, especially in Victoria, where a certain trade union has advocated the repudiation of war loans, I expected that some members of the Opposition would have risen to dissociate themselves from any proposal of that kind as affecting Australia. Whether they indorse that principle or not is not for me to say. It would have been just to their own principles, as a party, however, to have referred to that matter in connexion with a Bill of this kind. It was merely the fact that no honorable senator opposite had seen fit to refer to it that brought me to my feet. I can only add that I hope honorable senators opposite do not indorse the principle to which I have referred. , </para>

                <para class="block">Section 52a of the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act relates to the exemption from stamp duty of the instruments of the war loan - the bonds themselves.. On that occasion, when <inline font-weight="bold">.Senator Mullan</inline> moved his amendment, the proposal was received as quite Utopian. It will be recalled that the attitude of the mover and those who supported him was considered to savour of the ridiculous. But in the intervening time there has evidently been opportunity for the present Government to reconsider the action of the Labour Government who were then in .power. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> in reference, then, to the .amendment regarding section 52b of the Inscribed Stock Act - dealing with exemption from State and Federal income tax - pointed out that it was wholly to the interest of the big investor and to the detriment of the small investor. </para>
                <para>The reason that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> gave for not supporting the amendment of  Sen'ator Mullan  was that part of the £20,000,000 loan then on the market had already been covered, and that the position would arise, therefore, that portion of the war loan would be subject to the exemption, while the remainder would not; which would be an anomalous position. Now the same situation has arisen to-day. Clause 5, under discussion, deals with the exemption of war loan bonds, or inscribed stock, from stamp tax; and the same position will arise here, namely, that part of the war loan securities, or intruments,  will be subject to stamp duty, while others will not. I am pleased that the position has evidently been forced upon the Government by their financial advisers owing to the seriousness of the situation - a seriousness to which I may better refer, perhaps, when the Committee is. dealing with the next clause. Meanwhile, I again express approval of the belated action of the Government in thus doing what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> and his financial advisers should have done in connexion with the first war loan, and altogether, in fact, in respect of the early stages of floating war loans in the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not know that much has been gained by making the instruments' of the war loans subject to taxation, when it is remembered that the interest payable on such loans has been increased considerably beyond that given upon the loans free of taxation. It must be  quite  obvious that, so far .as the Government are concerned, and so far as investors are concerned, it is not a matter of much importance whether the bonds are free from taxation or whether holders have to pay, provided that the interest is adjusted accordingly. I quite realize that under these four extraordinary mathematical curves, which no one understands - not even two of our most expert mathematicians - a large investor will have to pay 6s. 3d. in the £,1 on account of the amount of his income; but that the small investor, on the other hand, who is outside the pale of taxation, will get a higher rate of interest for his investment than he could secure from almost any other source at the present time. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Again, it must be remembered that the tax-free investments are only returning 4| per cent., while there are thousands of investments in the Commonwealth which are providing a  much  higher rate of interest. In fact, they are so numerous that it has been only after an extreme process of advertising that the various war loans have been so strongly subscribed to. I do not know that the Government have done anything of advantage in the way of securing additional war loans by making the proceeds liable to taxation; but they have probably met an objection which, to my mind, is more fanciful than real, seeing that they are now paying on taxable war loans a higher rate of interest than upon loans free of taxation. </para>
                <para>I can quite understand why the Government have decided to make the proceeds of the war loans in future subject to taxation. It does appear that to have a huge sum of money invested in war loans free of taxation is somewhat anomalous. But against that it must be recalled that capitalists could easily find better investments for their money, and that many persons invested in the war loans only after considerable pressure. -Further, these tax-free investments will only remain so for a limited number of years, at the end of which period the Government will require to devise some way of refloating them at, probably, a much higher rate of interest. </para>

                    <para>. - I may be permitted now to refer to the phase of exemptions from interest on war loans which I indicated in speaking to the previous clause. It is a remarkable thing that section 52b of the Act should be brought in at such a late stage in the procedure connected with war loan flotation in Australia; and it is even more remarkable that many of those who first howled against any proposal for  doing  away with the exemption from taxation df interest upon war loans are now agreeable to the suggestion. I am not referring to the Government in this respect. But even the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> to-day admits that it is the proper course to pursue now. That journal, however, does not say that it was the proper course to pursue from the beginning. According, to the statement of the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> m another .place, the total amount which has been invested by ' our own people in six war loans is approximately £150,000,000. The interest payable upon that amount is at present free from taxation. In other words, capital to the extent of £150,000,000 has been removed from the arena of. taxation. Of course quite a lot of persons who have invested in these loans will now recognise - having sunk their own money in them - that whilst it is a very proper thing that the interest payable to themselves should be exempt from State and Federal income tax, is is not a proper thing that future investments in our war loans should be treated in the same way. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I recollect an occasion last session upon which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> quoted an address delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">'Sir John</inline> Grice,  chairman  of directors of the Bank of Australasia, in which that gentleman drew attention to the fact that the policy of exempting interest derived from investments in war loans was a dangerous one, and one which might prove to be financially unsound in the 'future. Now, the Bank of Australasia- has invested £12,445,000 in war loans raised in Australia. Of course the interest upon that amount is exempt from taxation, and not unnaturally those persons more imme.diately  concerned have now -set about seeing that the " other fellow " does not get such advantageous terms. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Grice pointed out in his statement that the interest payable upon investments in our .war loans represents more than 4i per cent. - that, as a matter of fact, upon the higher incomes it amounts to as much as 7 per cent. He showed that a man who is deriving an income of £5.00 a year from his investments in our -war loans, receives £4 14s. 6d. per £100, or nearly 4¾  per cent., by reason of his exemption from State and Federal taxation, while a man .with an income of £1,000 from the same source receives £4 1.9s. 2d. per .£.10.0, or nearly <inline font-style="italic">o</inline> per cent, upon his investment. Similarly a man with an income of £3,000 from our war loans secures a return of £5 10s. 5d..per £100, or 5£ per cent.; an individual with an income of £5,500 receives £6 9s. 9d. per £100, or nearly 6 J per cent., whilst a man with an income of £30,000 a year from the same source receives nearly 7 per cent, upon his investment. All these figures go to show that the exemptions which were tolerated by a Labour Government in the earlier stages of the war are wholly in the interests of the big investor. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> himself pointed this out on the floor of this chamber, although he declined to vote against those exemptions later on. He evidently realized that anything in the interests of the big investor was good enough for him, and voted accordingly. </para>
                <para>Very soon after the first War Loan Bill was introduced here I objected to the proposed exemptions. A little later the then Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fisher)</inline> resigned, and a by-election took place to fill the vacancy thus occasioned. Throughout the whole of that campaign I took up the position that the Labour Government, of which he had been the head, acted wrongly in exempting from income tax the interest upon moneys invested in our war loans. I denounced the principle as a vicious one. That position has been fully impressed upon us by speeches delivered here both yesterday and to-day upon another matter. But a tardy recognition of the unfairness of this exemption is not very consoling to those who realize that the interest upon no less a sum than £150,000,000 has been freed from taxation. The interest upon that amount represents about £7,000,000 annually. </para>

When we could not secure that result we endeavoured to get' the rate of interest fixed at 3J per cent. But those who .possessed the money demanded an increased rate of interest, and they bludgeoned the Commonwealth into paying it. We then attempted to bring the interest payable upon these loans within the operation of the Income  Tax Acts, both State and Federal. </para>

I recollect that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> was in and out of this chamber all that afternoon, and that he exhibited every symptom of concern. He wanted the Bill to be put through before the Senate adjourned that day, because the prospectus of the war loan had already been sent out to the newspapers.

As a matter of fact, it has been argued that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> themselves were better supporters of that Government than we were. Only some seven or eight of us voted in favour of abolishing the exemption in respect of interest derived from investments in our war loans. We were on right lines, because it was the right policy for Australia, and it would have been the right policy if the money had been lent at pre-war rates of interest without a jump of 33$ per cent. </para>

                    <para>. - I am glad to know that, even at this late hour, the Government repent of its past practice of exempting the interest on money invested in war loans from Federal and State taxation. It has been stated that the investment in the next war loan will be liable to taxation. While I rejoice in the repentance of the Government, let me say that I am repenting also. I admit that I opposed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mullan;s</inline> amendment; but I am a sadder and wiser man to-day. When the first loan was under consideration, the then Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fisher)</inline> was flitting in and out of the precincts of this chamber, fearful lest we might do something that would prevent the successful flotation of that first effort. </para>

When the Australian "Labour party was united, I was one of those who thought that it might be wise to float our war loans on the conditions then prescribed, with interest at 4J per cent., and freedom from Federal and State income taxation. I have since repented of that action, because I have realized that other men have made greater sacrifices - than those who lend us their money. When the tocsin of war sounded, and Australia was asked to assist the Motherland in her trouble, and when our young Australian manhood responded to the call, they placed no condition whatever on their services. But when our wealthy men were asked to assist the nation in that moment of dire peril they placed a condition on their offer of assistance - that the interest should be at 4£ per cent, and free from Federal and State income taxation. </para>

                        <para>- When this portion of the Empire responded to the call, and asked ' its wealthy men to assist to equip, clothe, feed, and transport our soldiers, they imposed a condition which, I say, was wrong. They demanded their pound of flesh. They were modern Shylocks, and if they had not been -.granted those conditions our war loans would not have been a success. To prove that, I need go no further back than the sixth war loan, .where alternative terms were offered to the investor - 4£ per cent, free from Federal and State income taxation, or 5  per  cent, with liability to such taxation. I learnt from the Leader of the "Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen),</inline> in answer "to a question, that about £6,000,000 of the total of that last loan -was contributed on the 5 per cent, basis, with liability "to income taxation, Federal and State, and that the remaining £37,322,850 was offered on the '4J per cent, basis, free from taxation. </para>

                    <para>. - I propose to raise some objections to this measure. The very meagre information given to us by the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> in introducing it gives one food for thought as to whether it is going to be a .good thing or not, and what really is its purpose. I understood the Minister to say that its object was to provide money out of war loans for operations on the market in purchasing our own stock to keep up the market price. The Bill provides that the securities shall be done away with when they are bought. It simply means that we are going to use one part of the loan money to buy up the stock practically to annihilate the loan in time. The Minister says that the intention is to protect the holder of the security. I do not know whether that object is going to be attained, but it seems to me  that the effect will be to give the speculator an opportunity to exploit the holders of this stock at times. The Bill gives one no idea of when the Treasurer will step in to buy up the stock. We are not told whether he will step in when it is at £99 12s. 6d., £99, or £98, as quoted at different periods. I take it that it will be optional with him. Can <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> tell me whether the Treasurer's idea is to wait until the stock has fallen to a certain figure? I believe our stock dropped to £98 when the Government threatened to place a wealth tax on the' community. As soon as that tax was mentioned our securities fell, but directly the Government decided not to go on with it, although they had promised when before the people to impose such a tax, the stock went up again to £99 12s. 6cl. If the Bill aimed at preventing trafficking in this stock I might  be inclined to support it, but I think it is intended to protect the big men. Suppose the Government have £1,000,000 to the credit of the fund, and £750,000 of that amount is utilized. How will they obtain additional money for the purchase of - further securities which may come on the market? If the idea is to prevent stock getting on to the market at all the measure may be satisfactory; but if it is not, I see no reason for this provision enabling the Treasurer to step in and operate at any time. The brokers, I believe, are the only people who will gain any benefit by the Bill. I do not pretend to be a financial expert at all, but I read carefully the speech delivered by the Minister in moving the second reading, and he seems to think that, because a similar law is in operation in Great Britain, we should pass this legislation now. But, in my judgment, - what may be a good thing for the British investors and the British Government may not be a good thing for Australian investors and the Commonwealth Government, because the conditions in Australia are totally different from those in Great Britain. I believe the British Act is in-  tended to enable the Treasurer to prevent any exploitation of the market by foreign buyers in respect of British stock, but I do not think we shall ever have that experience in Australia. I would like to have some further explanation as to the need for the Bill from some honorable senator who is a financial expert. At the present time I am doubtful whether I should vote for the measure or not. </para>

                    <para>. - I would like to put forward a few aspects of this question which, I think, are worthy of consideration. The . Bill before the Senate provides for the constitution of a fund for the repurchase of Commonwealth securities, the basis to be a percentage of one-eighth maximum per month on the amount of war loan money raised in Australia. That percentage each month would mean about <inline font-style="italic">li</inline> per cent, in the twelve months, and there is this stipulation, that the fund will not be allowed to go beyond £1,000,000 or below £900,000, but that it will be kept at about that amount, by what we may regard as a syphon system, in which money instead of water will flow out at one end and be syphoned from another, so that the fund will always be kept at about that level. But here is the responsibility devolving upon Australia. Taking the Treasurer's statement as fairly accurate, we may assume that £150,000,000 in round figures have been raised in war loans in Australia, and it will be possible for 1-J per cent, on that amount during twelve months to reach £2,250,000, which Australia is rendering itself liable for by the passage of this simple looking little measure. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The argument put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> and which has been mentioned in the press and advanced in another place, is that the Bill will enable the Treasurer to take in what is termed the " slack " of the market - that is to say, when the market in war-loan securities shows any weakening effect, the Treasurer, from this fund, would be empowered to purchase securities and so take in the " slack." It is further said that the State Treasurers have had this power for many years in relation to dealings in their securities, and have been using it for that purpose, with the result that their stock on the Colonial and British markets - the British market particularly - has always been kept at what might be termed an attractive level from the investor's point of view. This is put forward as an argument why the Senate should pass this </para>
                <para class="block">Bill to enable the Federal Treasurer to deal similarly with Commonwealth stocks. I would point  out,  however, that the State Treasurers have no special Acts of Parliament authorizing them to do this, their operations being carried on from their sinking funds. I point out also that already a Commonwealth law which, if not technically, is practically in operation provides that the sum of £  per cent, per annum of the public debt of Australia shall be accumulated. On the basis of the Treasurer's statement we may compute the public debt of this country at £227,000,000 on account of war, and there is, in addition, a liability of about £33,000,000 for note issue, and a further liability in respect of transferred properties, the Northern Territory debt, and the Oodnadatta railway, of about £34,000,000, so that the total public debt of the Commonwealth must be in the vicinity of £300,000,000, and \ per cent, on that amount would give us about £1,500,000 per year. There is no gainsaying the fact that unfortunately our public debt is going to grow in the near future to uncomfortably large dimensions, and there need be no feaT that \ per cent, would not be* sufficient for the establishment of a pool from which to recover the floating Commonwealth securities. </para>
                <para>The existing law empowers the Treasurer of the Commonwealth to purchase securities guaranteed by the Government of the United Kingdom, the Government of the Commonwealth, or the Government of any State, and may at any time sell such securities. Why should the Commonwealth seek to purchase in Great Britain,  or in any of the States, when they have securities of their own which the sooner they are redeemed the better it will be for the financial stability of the Commonwealth ? I submit that there is no better method of redeeming these securities than by means of the accumulated fund to which I have referred. The Bill authorizes the -Treasurer to purchase any of the securities referred to that may be on the market at up to par value, and I point out what I conceive to be a danger in intrusting the Treasurer with this power. Perhaps the danger has been exaggerated somewhat elsewhere by pointing to the  fact that investments in war loans, under the instalment system, would, in some circumstances, mean interest payment not at the rate of 4| per cent., but, calculated for the first term, would really work out at about 11 per cent., and if carried over the- first year actually would be 6 per cent, or over, and not <inline font-style="italic">A.\</inline> per cent. It has 'been actuarially proved, and set down irrefutably, that the interest on our war loan investments is not 4^ per cent., but, by virtue of this concession in regard to the interest for the first year under the instalment plan, it actually rises to £4 13s. 4d. over the period of the loan. In this connexion I point out what I conceive to be a danger. I am not saying that actual dishonesty may arise in the purchase of these securities to an almost unlimited extent by the Treasurer ; but, as I have already pointed out, 1£ per cent, on the Australian war debt will in the future mean a huge reserve, and it might happen that when the Government of the day think the time opportune to take in the "slack" of the market prices might be forced down to 98 by the manipulation of the market. </para>

                        <para>- We may leave that out altogether, and say that the market may be forced down to 98 by reason of operations on the Stock Exchange. Every one who has lived  on  a mining field knows that "engineering" is resorted to on some occasions in order to affect the value of certain shares. Probably a very large holder who desires to unload will go into the open call at the exchange, and by' buying at enhanced or rising values some scrip in a certain mine, will persuade the general investing public to rush in and get some of it, when all the time probably it is his own scrip that is being unloaded at enhanced prices. This operation has been performed time after time on our stock exchanges, and the same might be done in regard to the repurchase of Commonwealth securities. The Treasurer may be purchasing without knowing who the seller is.  His  financial advisers may not know who are the sellers, and I therefore submit that there is great danger of manipulation in this connexion. </para>

                </continue>
                <para>There is another phase of the question which is rather important. Some reference was made, I think, by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap,</inline> to the financial advisers who framed the war loan conditions for the </para>
                <para>Fisher Government. I believe that they were big guns in the financial world. It is reasonable to assume that the financial advisers of the Treasurer in the repurchase of these Commonwealth securities will be officers of the Treasury Department, and it is no injustice to them to say that it is quite conceivable that they may not. know what is going on in the financial world as well as keen business men outside. It seems to me that the person responsible for the repurchase of these securities, out of what appears to be an almost unlimited fund based on one-eighth per cent, per month of the amount of war loan <inline font-style="italic">money</inline> raised in Australia, should not be the Treasurer of the Commonwealth. He has many Cabinet, political, and parliamentary duties to perform, and in my opinion it would be far' safer and better to give this power, if it is to be given to any one, to the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, who would have his finger on the pulse of the financial market. </para>
                <para>The Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> suggested that one effect of creating the fund for the repurchase of Commonwealth securities on the market would be to bring about stability in the market price of the securities should small investors in bonds of £50 or £100,- through necessitous circumstances, be forced to sell. I want to express the opinion that the comparatively small investor is not going to affect the market prices of these stocks. We have some evidence of that in the particulars which have been given of the investments in the last loan. We find that £37,000,000 of that loan was subscribed at 4$ per cent, free of Federal and State taxation, and about £6,500,000 was subscribed at 5 per cent, with liability to taxation. It is not unreasonable to assume that it was the big investors who desired freedom from Federal and State taxation, who contributed the £37,000,000, and the' small men to whom an additional A per cent, interest was a matter of more concern than the freedom of interest on their investments from Federal and State taxation who contributed the £6,500,000. I submit, therefore, that there is much justification for my contention that the small men who might, by reason of necessitous circumstances, have to sell a £50 or a £100 bond would not be a factor in affecting the stability of the market. </para>

                        <para>- I shall deal with that point, but I wish honorable senators first of all to realize what has been done in connexion with the issue of war-saving certificates. There has been a great deal of advertising of that scheme going on. It has been in operation now for some time, and the total sum raised by means of war-saving certificates is, I believe, about £6,000,000. That is very gratifying, as showing the tendency to save small amounts. The persons who have invested in war-saving certificates, in view of the amount secured in this way, must be numerically fifty or a thousand times as many as the subscribers to our loans in larger amounts. When it comes to a question of buying and selling, it will be the big men and not the small men who will be able to affect the market for these stocks. If the big investors, for their own benefit, or the benefit of a group of moneyed men, seek to bring about a financial crisis in Australia, the responsibility will be theirs, and they must take the consequences. It will not be the small bond-holders, who have put their mites into our war loans, who will precipitate a financial crisis in Australia. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> that the man who holds a £50 or a £100 bond is entitled, if he desires to sell it, to as much as he can get for it. But I remind the honorable senator that if, because of necessitous circumstances, a man sells a horse, or a house, or a piece of land, he does not always receive full value for it. The honorable senator must also bear in mind that the man who takes up a bond of £100 in a war loan receives 4J per cent, interest on it. Under future conditions, the holder of such a bond will receive 5 per cent. If he put the money into the Government Savings Bank he would only receive 3| per cent., and if he has had the bond for a couple of years he will have received an additional return of £2 or £3, and would lose nothing by selling his £100 bond at £98. The sales of their securities by such men will not, in my opinion, be sufficient' to affect the market. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                </continue>
                <para>We are not to assume that the man who puts his money into a war loan does so merely for what he can make out of it. When on one occasion <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was referring to the fact that a man puts money into a joint stock company rather than into a war loan because he can get a better return for it, I asked him what was the difference between such a man and a man who invested in a war loan, if the latter desired merely to make a profit. If investors in the war loan must have full face value in any circumstances for their security, it cannot be said that they are actuated by the patriotic motives about which we have heard so much. It is clear, in my opinion, that it will be the big men who bear responsibility in this direction who will have the power to affect the market, and if they do so, and bring about a slump, it will be at their own cost. </para>
                <para>Another important consideration in dealing with this Bill is that, when the Treasurer buys up floating war loan securities, he may do so, if honorable senators please, -out of war loan moneys. That is not getting rid of the securities. It is merely transferring the responsibility from one pocket to another. Surely to repurchase war loan securities with war loan money is a Micawber method of finance. It will not get rid of our responsibility in any way. There is nothing financially sound about such a proposal. The machinery exists now to enable the Treasurer to carry out his intentions in this regard, and this Bill is, therefore, quite unnecessary. If war loan securities are repurchased, aud paid for out of the sinking fund, there will be a practical, effective, and' permanent redemption. I realize that the money put into the sinking fund, will come out of the Consolidated Revenue, and war loan securities repurchased from that source may be cancelled, and something will have, been achieved. If the Treasurer buys war loan securities with war loan money, he may tear up the securities he has purchased a dozen times, but he will be no further ahead. We should make some advance if the repurchases were made from the Consolidated Revenue, as they were under the pre-existing Stock" Redemption Fund. </para>
                <para class="block">It is due to the Senate that the Minister for Repatriation should give us some reason why this is not done. I have pointed out that if the ^ per cent. I have referred to is not enough, it could be raised to a higher percentage. </para>

                        <para>. - I think the Senate will readily understand that, in common with every other section of the community, the Government are fully seized with the wide-spreading importance of the question raised in the report, the adoption of which we are now asked to accept. The Government are also aware of the very considerable strength of public feeling which has manifested itself regarding this matter. We are obviously not ignorant of many of the evils that exist as the result of the drink habit in our midst. At the same time, there are certain features in connexion with the subject which have already received the attention of the Government. The liquor question, as such, does not come directly within the ambit of Federal jurisdiction. It is primarily a State matter. The Commonwealth is concerned only in so far as it affects the prosecution of the war. I would not like to go so far as to say upon that point more  than  this: That the Commonwealth Government, strictly speaking, while entitled to use every power necessary for the prosecution of the war, can hardly be expected to use those powers for the mere securing of a moral reform, however urgently needed such reform may be. The Government must employ its powers for military purposes only. And, in view of this consideration, the Government, after having given very careful and frequent thought to the matter, have decided to adopt a policy which is in conformity with the first recommendation of the Committee's report. That is the recommendation wherein the Committee, as a result of its investigations, sets out the advisability of prohibiting the serving of intoxicating liquors to invalided soldiers. Within the next few days the Minister for .Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> will make a public announcement as to the methods by which effect will be given to that proposition. It is sufficient for me to say, therefore, that the Government will take steps to prohibit the serving of intoxicants to those soldiers who are invalids. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>With respect ito the other recommendation -  i-that  is the matter of .anti-" .shouting " regulations being put into (practice - I invite the attention of <inline font-weight="bold">-Senator Thomas,</inline> and of the Senate generally, to the fact that when we approach this phase, other considerations not directly associated with soldiers come into view. It is part of the whole question of liquor control, and at this juncture I am not prepared to -say that the  Government can accept the recommendation. I remind the Senate that this is only a progress report; it is to be assumed that in due course the Select Committee will present a report covering its completed investigations. The Government feel, therefore, that they are entitled to have the remaining recommendations - if any are to come before them - before they are asked to decide upon a mere sectional presentation of the case. In addition, there are other matters which, so far, have not been touched upon in the report - matters very intimately associated with the question now raised. The Government have the whole of these under consideration, and, upon receipt of the final report of the Committee, will give very prompt attention to what is then presented. </para>
                    <para>In the circumstances I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas,</inline> as the honorable senator in charge of the motion, to rest content for the present with the announcement I have just made, which, from his standpoint, may be regarded, I think, as a distinct advance in the direction he has sought to carry us. I ask that he will accede to my suggestion, that upon a suitable occasion he will either withdraw the motion or -allow it to stand, without forcing it to an issue at this juncture. I point out that, otherwise, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> would place in rather a false position those who, like myself, may take the view that he would be forcing an issue upon what is really a double-barrelled motion. I feel certain, therefore, that the honorable senator will regard my suggestion as one entitled to consideration. </para>

                        <para>.- I wish to say a few words in support of the motion. The position which the Government have adopted presents a phase that is worthy of consideration. Had I known ten minutes ago that this specific matter was likely to arise, I would have consulted my colleagues upon the Committee, and have ascertained their opinions. Personally, and without - consultation with any one of them, I feel disposed to accept the promise of the Minister. It is satisfactory to know that the Government will adopt the first recommendation, for it is one which is very urgent and necessary. The Minister does not Bay that he is opposed to the .second recommendation, but that the Government will give it consideration. Under the circumstances, I do not know whether we should continue the debate or .accept the offer. I, personally, am willing to accept the offer and to drop the discussion ; tout if I felt that my colleagues desired to go on, I would be prepared to join with them in doing so. Altogether, therefore, I am in some difficulty to know what to do. </para>

                        <para>. - The objective of my motion - as I have previously indicated - is the action of the Federal Government in relation to the capitation grant of 25s. per head regarding soldiers from the various States. I have already quoted a certain section from the Surplus Revenue Act 1910, which I contend is illegal. It has been argued by some honorable senators that the section in question is quite legal, and that it was perfectly in order for the Government to deprive the States of the capitation grant in respect of citizens who are serving at the Front. I point out, however, that no amendment of that Surplus Revenue Act has been before the Senate. The Government of the Commonwealth have taken to themselves a certain power which, to my mind, is undoubtedly illegal. The law as it stands under the Surplus Revenue Act states distinctly that 25s. per head shall be paid for every citizen of the Commonwealth; and, because certain citizens have elected to take their part in the world warfare, and are absent from their respective States, those States are being deprived of portion of their revenue. </para>

                            <para>- I know; but the very fact of their not being in their States does not deprive them of their rights of citizenship. We have had, during this war period, amending legislation to enable those citizens to exercise their franchise. We have an electoral law. Every honorable senator is acquainted with all its provisions. It sets forth that every citizen over the age of twenty-one who has been for six months resident in a State has the right to vote on election day. When it became necessary to hold an election or a referendum in Australia, those citizens, concerning whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> has just interjected, had to be qualified in order that they might maintain their franchise. The electoral law was amended to enable the soldiers to record their votes when on active service abroad. It was quite right that the Parliament should have passed that Statute, and, that being so, those rights of citizenship continue in every respect, by the amendment of the electoral law. In effect, Parliament said that those men were still citizens of Australia. If they are still citizens of Australia, why should not the States from which they hail receive the benefit of the Surplus Revenue Act so far as the capitation grant is concerned? In reply, the Minister may say that the Government are bearing the cost of the maintenance and equipment of these men. But whilst that is so, it must be remembered that the States from which they come are contributors towards that cost. We are one people, and consequently the Commonwealth ought not to deprive the States of the capitation grant in respect to their soldiers abroad. </para>

                    <para>I have noticed that the Premiers' Conference has dealt with this matter, but I do not know what agreement has been entered into between that body and the Commonwealth Government. Nor do I care what arrangement has been arrived at, because, after all, this Parliament is supreme. Whatever may have been agreed to, it cannot be denied that the action of the Commonwealth Government is an illegal one. I do not intend to labour this question. I contend that our soldiers abroad are still citizens of the Commonwealth and of the States which they have left. In these circumstances the capitation grant of 25s. per head should be paid to the States on their account. </para>
                    <para>In concluding, may I be permitted to make an appeal on behalf- of the State which I represent? I do not know of any State in the Commonwealth which has been harder hit by. the war than has "Western Australia. So far as its  eligibles  are concerned, I believe that in proportion to population it has contributed a larger quota to the Australian Imperial Force than has any other State. In saying that, I have no desire to reflect on any other State of the Union. But anybody familiar with industrial matters will readily recognise what that contribution by Western Australia really means. However, I shall not say any more on the matter. In the terms of my motion I consider that the Surplus Revenue Act has been infringed, and that the retention by the Commonwealth of the capitation grant is an illegal act. </para>

                        <para>. - This motion is one which, under ordinary circumstances, would undoubtedly appeal to the sympathies of honorable senators, who, quite regardless of their allegiance to the Commonwealth, still entertain, very properly, a regard for the position of their own individual States. If the Commonwealth possessed' an inexhaustible supply of wealth, or if it were endowed with the philosopher's stone, by the timely use of which it could replenish its own resources, everybody would give a ready acceptance to the motion that has been submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham.</inline> But we have to look upon things as they are, and not as we would wish them to be. I propose, therefore, to show, first of all, that there is no justification for the honorable senator's contention that the capitation grant is being illegally withheld, and then I shall invite consideration of the financial position with which the Commonwealth, as well as the States, is now confronted. May I say at once that it was hardly necessary for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> to refer to the efforts and sacrifices made by Western Australia during this war? We all recognise them. I do not seek to institute any comparison with other States when I say that it is recognised throughout the Commonwealth that Western Australia has loyally and man fully borne her part in this great conflict. </para>

                    <para>I come now to the legal aspect of the case. I deny altogether that what the Commonwealth is doing is illegal. It is quite true that under an agreement with the States the Commonwealth undertook to pay to them annually 25s. per head, based upon the population figures determined in a certain way. Let us see how the number of the population is to be determined. I invite attention to this aspect of. the matter, because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> has specifically taken his stand upon what he regards as the legal claim of the States. Section 4 of the Surplus Revenue Act of 1910 provides for the payment by the Commonwealth to the States by monthly instalments of an annual sum amounting to 25s. per head of the number of the people of the States. There is no dispute that under that section the Commonwealth is bound to pay 25s. per head for the number of the people in any State. The whole question involved, therefore, is, "What is that number?" Now, the Act is not silent upon how that number is to be computed. Indeed, it gives specific directions as to how it is to be ascertained. Section 7 provides - </para>

Now, a census was taken in 1911, and, in order to ascertain the population in the years intervening before the next census, the Commonwealth Statistician has regard to the excess of births over deaths, or <inline font-style="italic">vice versa,</inline> and of arrivals over departures, or <inline font-style="italic">vice versa.</inline> He thus ascertains the number of persons who are in Australia at the time fixed, and cannot take into account the probable duration of, or reason for, the absence of any person from Australia. On the assumption that the Statistician has based his estimate of the population in each year on the principle mentioned above, the Solicitor-General has advised that the States, have no claim to payment in respect of men who are absent with the Australian Imperial Force abroad. Nobody, looking at sections 4 and '7 of the Act, can dispute that the Commonwealth is relieved of. the legal responsibility to pay the amount that is claimed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham.</inline></para>

                    <para>But I want to pass from that aspect of . the matter. I have already stated that, under other circumstances, the Commonwealth would he found as ready to pay this capitation grant as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> is to claim it. But, although under the agreement with the States 25s. per head is to be paid by the Commonwealth for the number of persons resident in any State, we know that the basis of that grant was laid many years before, upon the creation of the Federation. Its basis is really to » be found in that provision in our Constitution which affirms  that out of the Customs revenue a certain percentage should -be handed back to the States. "When, in the evolution of time, the Commonwealth Parliament, in its wisdom, not only thought it desirable - but was, indeed, forced by  circumstances  - to legislate on that point, it arrived at an agreement under, which it was to- pay to the States 25s. per head on a. population basis, in lieu: of the percentage of the Customs revenue which was set out in the Constitution itself. The basis of the agreement, therefore, was the taking over of the- Customs revenue. , It, is important to remember that, for the reason that 25s. per head is, to some extent, a set-off against depriving the States of the Customs revenue which was previously returned to them. It is important also to- remember that if the States are losing the 25s. per head which they would have received if their absent soldiers had remained in Australia, the Commonwealth, is. also losing the Customs revenue in respect of which, in essence, it agreed to pay that 25s. If we are paying 25s. per head, to the States, in lieu of their share of the Customs revenue contributed by the people of Australia, their moral claim for payment on account of their absent soldiers. disappears, seeing that those soldiers are- no longer contributors to our Customs revenue. The States, it is true, thus lose 25s. per head for every absent man. But what is the Commonwealth losing? It is. impossible to say exactly how much, it is losing; but it needs to be remembered that the adult male is- a more liberal contributor to the Customs revenue than is any other unit of the population. It is easy to see, therefore, that the Commonwealth has lost between £4 and £5&gt; per- head' on- account of Customs revenue in respect of these absent soldiers. In- other words, the Commonwealth is losing- two or three times as much as are the States-. That means that, whilst the States may have lost - in the sense that- they did not receive it - £400,000 since the outbreak of the war, the- Commonwealth has lost £1,500,000 during that period. In addition, it has had to main-tain these soldiers What the .cost of their maintenance is: I do not know; but it is a- modest estimate to say that the maintenance of. our- armies abroad- is not less than £150 per man annually, and possibly it is. much nearer £200-. When we remember these things, is it unfair to ask the States to recognise' the  Commonwealth's  position? </para>
                    <para>Certain statements have been made by some honorable senators to-day,  which have  brought us face to- face with the very serious financial position, which confronts us. We are within measurable distance of the time when heavy additional taxation must be imposed. The outlook is hard, for the States, but it is still harder for those charged with the responsibility of Federal finance. However much honorable senators' sympathies may lead them to support the motion, they must first remember the condition of the Commonwealth finances, and ask themselves whether they can, there being no legal liability in the matter, lightly accept as an act of grace the additional burden which will be imposed on the Commonwealth Treasury if effect is given to the motion. , When the matter was discussed at the Premiers' Conference in Sydney recently, after <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watt</inline> had defined the attitude of the Commonwealth, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman,</inline> the Premier of the State which, so far as numbers are concerned, would be most substantially affected, said he would not proceed with the claim. I suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> should take up the same attitude. I am certain that he has brought the matter forward in the interests of his State, as he was quite entitled to do. </para>

                    <para>I first deny that there is any legal liability, and then I ask the honorable senator to consider the Federal financial position, responsibilities, and outlook. In view of all these circumstances, and quite apart from the legal aspect, the Commonwealth has the right to ask the States not to press the claim even as a matter of grace, but rather to remember the very heavy financial responsibility imposed on the Commonwealth by its share in the conduct of the war. It cannot be disputed that our war-like operations impose on the Commonwealth Government a responsibility very much greater than any additional responsibility the States are called upon to carry. It is therefore a fair, reasonable, and logical proposition that the States, stall apart from the legal aspect of the case, should not unduly press claims on the attention of the Federal Treasurer, who has, and will have, enough to do to make ends meet in those matters which come within our jurisdiction. We should like to be generous, but we must keep our own financial affairs straight. When that is done, I am afraid there will be nothing left to meet claims of the kind now submitted. For those reasons I am obliged to oppose the motion. </para>

                        <para>. - The financial question has developed so enormously that I have long ceased to take the same interest in it as I did when it was much smaller. That may seem a contradiction in terms, but the question has grown to such tremendous proportions that it is quite beyond my imagination to grasp. The financial problem of Australia, like that of every other belligerent country, has grown at such a rate that it has become almost too big for the human brain to grasp. Our public debts have grown enormously, and there is every prospect that they will grow still bigger as the war goes on. No one can forecast the future financial conditions of the various countries. Australia is in just as bad a condition financially as any other country. The war really means more to Australia financially than to any other country, because we have rightly undertaken the burden of paying our men who go to the Front a much bigger allowance than any other country is paying, and our burden is consequently much greater in proportion. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Western Australia, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> has properly pointed out, has not been backward in its efforts in the war. If comparisons must be made, that State stands second to none in the Commonwealth in its efforts to do its duty in the conflict. It has not only sent the largest percentage of its manhood to the Front voluntarily, but it is the only State that on two occasions has declared by referendum that every citizen capable of bearing arms should go to the Front. With the departure of our men, and the closing up of many of our industries, the finances and the business of our State have got into a worse condition than perhaps those of any other State. Our secondary industries are somewhat backward; gold mining, which has been our big industry for many years, has fallen away considerably, and our other big industry, that of timber, has been practically stagnant since the war began. It is therefore evident that Western Australia, which is greater in area than any of the States, and has to face a higher expenditure on cost of government, must be in the worst financial position of all. If any State had the right to advance this question, it was Western Australia, where the financial needs are more pressing than in any other part of the Commonwealth. But even if the Commonwealth Government agreed to pay the sum proposed in the motion, it would not make a very great difference, so far as Western Australia is concerned. Some financial help should be given to that State, but not in this way. Seeing that Western Australia comprises one-third of the whole area of this big continent, and has to bear the cost of government of that large expanse of territory, financial help should be granted to it in the same way as has already been done in the case of Tasmania, the smallest in area of all the States. </para>

I certainly cannot support it, and I am not going to vote under any political pretence. I do not wish to be placed in a false position. I am going to take what I consider is a straightforward and honest course by opposing the motion by speech and vote, believing that no good can come from presenting it in this way.

                            <para>- I have often consulted the honorable senator on other matters, but I want again to refresh his memory. He tells me that if I had advanced this proposal before now I would have had a better chance of carrying it. May I assume that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie refers to the time when he and I were in the same party, and supporting the same Government? Probably that was in the honorable senator's mind. But let me tell him that this matter is not four years old, as he would have the Senate believe. It is true that the war is very nearly four years old, and that for a greater part of this term we had a united Labour party, with an Australian Labour Government in power ; but it is not correct to assume that the deprivation of this grant to the States is four years old. It is under one year old, and consequently <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie's argument falls to the ground. </para>

                            <para>- I do not want to place any one in a false position. If the deprivation of this grant took place in the financial years 1915, 1916, 1917, and 1918, then I come back to the statement that there was only a period of six months of the financial year 1915-16 when I could have had any chance of having this matter dealt with by the united Labour party. As regards consulting my colleagues, let me say that in submitting the motion off my own " bat," as it were, I had no intention of hurting their feelings in any way. I am simply asking the Senate to obey the law as it stands now. If the Senate does not want to carry out the provisions of the Surplus Revenue Act, I cannot help it. I leave the motion now, and ask the Senate to support it. </para>

                            <para>- It is not; but although it is something like a habit, it is <inline font-style="italic">not</inline> a pleasant one so far as I am concerned. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> is asking the Senate to pass a Bill to amend the section in the arbitration law which deals with the Public Service, so as to deprive Parliament of the opportunity to review any decision of the Arbitration Court. Honorable senators will remember that when he introduced the Bill <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> made one or two statements, and with all due respect to him, I desire to point out that they were incorrect. He appealed to the Senate to pass the Bill on the ground that some injustice would be done to those public servants who had submitted their case to the Court, and obtained an award, because, so he said, it would- not be possible for the Court to make its award retrospective; but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson,</inline> by interjection, sought to set the honorable gentleman right, though we all know .that is rather a difficult undertaking. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> refused to take the advice tendered to him by his colleague, and persisted in affirming -that, unless this amendment were adopted', there were no means by which an injustice to the Public Service could be avoided. I do not ask the Senate to accept my authority in this matter, so I would point out that the Crown Law officers of the Commonwealth state distinctly that it is within the competency of the Arbitration Court Judge to make any award retrospective either in whole or in part. The Court can, if it likes, fix the date from which an award shall operate, and there is also provision to the effect that an award may remain in a state of suspended animation until Parliament has had an opportunity of. expressing approval or disapproval of it. </para>

I again point out that the effect of the honorable member's Bill, if adopted, will be to remove from Parliament any opportunity of reviewing an award. Although Parliament has placed in the hands of the Arbitration Court the duty of making an award, the reserve power to review must 'always rest with Parliament, seeing that Parliament is called upon to appropriate the sums necessary to pay the Public Service. </para>

                            <para>- It may not take away the power of Parliament directly, but the proposed alterations would have that effect. As the Act stands, Parliament may object to and veto an award, but if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham's</inline> Bill be carried, Parliament will not have the right of veto before an award becomes operative. It could only withdraw it, and honorable senators know it is much more difficult to withdraw an increase of salary made to a class of public servants, if they have been in receipt of it for a few months, than for Parliament to step in before it is paid, and veto it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> must know that the Bill will hamper Parliament considerably. It is a much simpler proposition for Parliament to interpose before an award becomes operative. </para>

                            <para>- Nothing that I may say can be regarded as a guarantee, because Parliament has a sovereign right to step in, and declare whether an award shall become operative or not. If we had fifty Acts of Parliament, the Legislature could still prevent an award from becoming operative. Parliament, which rnakes a law, can always repeal it. I submit that the public servants of the Commonwealth have no reason to complain of any act of injustice on the part of this Parliament in connexion with these awards. All that I am pleading for is that the Parliament should have in law, as well as in fact, a.n effective opportunity of exercising, if necessary, the reserve power of veto in connexion with awards affecting the Public Service, for the carrying on of which the Senate,- as a part of the Parliament, is called upon to make the necessary financial arrangements. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> could point to any case of injustice suffered by public servants in this connexion, he might make out a case for what he proposes. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator mentioned two or three cases where there had been some delay in the operation of an award. That delay, however, is easily avoidable. A Judge of the Arbitration Court might, if he saw fit, make his award apply from the date upon which he gave it. Although the award would not become operative until Parliament had had thirty days within which to consider it, if within that time it took no action, and by silence gave its assent, the award, at the close of that time, would become operative from the date upon which it was made. The worst then that could happen to the public servants would be that they might have to wait thirty days, or sixty days, for the benefits to which they might be entitled under the award. </para>

                            <para>- Theoretically, the honorable senator is right. It is conceivable that they might have to wait six months, but in practice they would1 not have to wait nearly so long. I admit that it is desirable- that a public' servant should know <inline font-style="italic">hg</inline> fate as quickly as pOS.sible; but, in the- absence of anything more than inconvenience to which' <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> can point under the existing law, I venture to say honorable senators should  not be lightly induced to surrender the reserve power in this- mutter which Parliament has hitherto possessed. In the circumstances,. I ask the Senate to dissent from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham'^</inline> proposition. </para>
