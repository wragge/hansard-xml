                        <para>- I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate if he has perused the evidence of a number of witnesses taken before the Interstate Commission during the last two or three days, referring to the manufacture and distribution of soft goods, in which it  is  alleged that goods of Australian manufacture, such as hats, cloth, &#38;c., can only be obtained&#39; through merchants, who levy a tax of something like 20 per cent. on the consumers? Is the Minister not of the opinion that such tactics have the effect of hampering Australian industries, and, consequently, of limiting Australian production ? If so, will he, on behalf of the public, have this matter placed in the hands of the Price Fixing Board for regulation ? </para>

                        <para class="block">I regret exceedingly to have to take this course, but it is the only means available to enable me to achieve the object I have &#39; in view. I wish the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> in charge of this particular matter to understand that, notwithstanding his remarks on the motion for the adjournment at our last sitting, I have no desire whatever to charge him with withholding any information on this question. I do not ask him to divulge anything with reference to the bag contract for the coming season. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> first brought the matter under the notice of the Senate by referring to an interview reported in a section of the daily press, headed &#34;Cornsacks and Woolpacks,&#34; &#34; Cause of Increase in Prices,&#34; &#34; Some Startling Statements.&#34; The honorable senator asked a&#39; question in connexion with that report, and I then asked the Minister, who promised to make a statement on the subject, whether he would in that statement define the position of Australian bag merchants in the coming season. Nothing was done, and last week I again asked a question of the Minister in connexion with a further paragraph in the press, in which the gentleman interviewed made what I considered some glaring misstatements. The Minister said that he was awaiting some cablegram from India. The statements which have appeared in a section of the press are so misleading to the people of Australia - those interested in the bag trade and the farming community - that the facts in connexion with the matter should be. placed before the Senate at the earliest possible moment. I shall be as concise as possible. </para>
                        <para>I have not yet been able to ascertain who <inline font-weight="bold">Major Purcell</inline> is. He is the gentleman who was interviewed, and, according to the press, he was connected with the Light Horse in India, and made inquiries in connexion with the jute trade. The second statement he makes is this - </para>

                                pointed out that the Imperial Government had purchased the whole of the wheat and wool of Australia for the past three seasons, and Australia was, therefore, entitled to be supplied with wool bales and cornsacks direct from the mills.
                            </para>
                        </quote>
                        <para class="block">If that was correct, I would point out that the Imperial Government did not supply the bags to hold the wheat; they purchased the wheat in the bag, and, therefore, the Imperial authorities did not trouble as to what was paid for those bags. It made no difference to them in relation to the price of the wheat itself. If those bags could have been secured for less, then it is a matter for the farming community of Australia, and not for the Imperial Government. But that is not correct. The Imperial Government have not purchased the whole of the wheat for the past three seasons. The amount totals less than half of two seasons&#39; crops, and is equal, therefore, to about one season&#39;s; and it does not represent anything like the whole of the three seasons&#39; crops. If such a statement as that fails to accord with facts, we would do well to look closely into certain of the other assertions. The point is that this man should have been able to find a journal in Australia ready to publish such a glaring misstatement. He goes on to say: - </para>

                            <para>The low cost in 1914,&#34; and present cost, see-  ing that no increase has taken place in cost of production, is sufficient indication that the primary producer of Australia is being badly exploited by the Indian middlemen as far as jute supplies are concerned, and this the Imperial Government can prevent if representations are made. </para>
                        </quote>
                        <para class="block">I understand that representations have been made to the Imperial Government to see if the bags can be secured more cheaply. But, if <inline font-weight="bold">Major Purcell</inline> had been commissioned to buy bags&#39; in India, he could not have got them at anything like the price ruling in 1914. It is idle nonsense, therefore, for him to say that there is no difference in the price of manufactured bags in India to-day compared &#34;with 1914. The jute commodity has a fluctuating value, and it does not .vary materially unless there is a great scarcity. Thus, it has not a very great bearing on the cost of the manufactured article </para>

                                <para>- If this man has made inquiries from the millers in India, he should be in a position to tell the people that, since 1914, the hours of labour, and rates of pay, and the conditions generally, under which bags are manufactured have been so altered by regulation that the price for jute materials in India, despite the war, in 1914, would have been higher than they were in the year preceding the war. Therefore, it is not correct to say that the bags to-day&#39; can be manufactured at the same1 price as prior to &#34;the war. One of the great influences on the jute trade has been the enormous demand for different kinds of bags owing to. the war - for sand-bags, particularly. It will be readily understood that the mills, upon getting an order for huge supplies of sand-bags at one time, will not put their machinery into order for the manufacture of cornsacks for Australia at the same cost as hitherto. </para>

                                <para>- That is nominally the price. I do not wish to go into the detail, but into the principle. The point I desire to make clear is that bags purchased at 6s. 4 1/2 d. in 1914 are to-day nominally 9s. 6d., and that the whole of the difference has not been pocketed by the middlemen of India and the bag merchants of Australia. </para>

                        <para>In 1914 the freight was only 25s. per ton. That is equal to 4d. per dozen for bags. There are 75 dozen bags to every ton freight, and, at 25s., that amounts to exactly 4d. per dozen. But freights on the bags used for Australia last year were four times increased. I do not wish to hamper the Minister in relation to the transactions for next season. I take it that, as the Government have seen fit to enter into this trade for the coming season, it is the duty of all parties, including those of the bag merchants, to render every assistance&#39; in making the whole scheme a success. But, as the freight for the past season was no less than &#163;5 per ton, which is four times what it was before, that means another 16d. to be paid. And, in addition, there must be considered the rise in exchanges, extra war risks, extra insurance during time of war, and, above and beyond that, the fact that the Indian Government have placed 4d. export tax on all cornsacks leaving India. If those factors are added to the cost, it will be found that bags could not be sold in Australia at 9s. a dozen if they had been bought at the same price as in 1914. </para>

There was no complaint against the merchants of Australia who were retailing to the farmers at 6s. 4&#163;d. in 1914, but there is against those who are selling at 9s. 6d., and there is the suggestion in Hie article from which I have quoted that there is something sinister in lie position, namely, that the merchants are pocketing the difference. That is not so. </para>

I do not know whether he has been misinformed by the jute manufacturers of India, or whether my own information is at fault, but what I have already stated was the information, which was given to us in 1915, when we were specially told that in the future, and quite irrespective of war conditions, Australia would not be able to purchase bags again at anything like their former price. This jute industry in India, I would have honorable senators understand, is not a. small one, nor is it carried on by only one or two mill&#39;s in Calcutta. . My information is that so numerous are the mills which are engaged in the production of jute goods there, that if a man decided to make a round of them with a view to obtaining first-hand information regarding their output, he would practically be occupied for his lifetime. </para>

Now, I have taken the trouble to bring into the chamber a sample of the Argentine bag and of the Australian bag, so that honorable senators may see for themselves. The Argentine sack is made of hessian, and holds only 100 lbs., whereas the Australian sack is made of cloth, and&#39; has a capacity of 180 lbs. or 190 lbs.

                                <para>- It is used for the carriage of wheat. I know that after the drought which occurred in Australia: in 1914 some Argentine wheat was- <inline font-style="italic">innported</inline> into South Australia. Upon it&#187; arrival at Port Adelaide- although it had been bagged - it was found to be practically in bulk, and, so far as I can ascertain, all those bags were burnt. About the same time, a shipment of maize from Argentina arrived in Sydney, and I am informed that, between the wharf and the warehouse, the wheels of the lorries which carted it were grinding through 6 inches of maize. Certain it is that the man who bought 100 bushels of that maize had to accept only 93 bushels. In the light of these facts, it is ridiculous for anybody to assert that the Argentine farmers are getting their bags for half the price that is being paid for bags by the Australian farmers. No comparison can be instituted between the qualities of the respective bags, and, as I have already said, the Argentine sack has only half the capacity of. the Australian sack. To the farming community of Australia, the Argentine bag would be useless. I have been informed that a shipment of these sacks has been tried in the Commonwealth, with the result that to-day they can be obtained for practically nothing. As a matter of fact, if they were offered gratuitously to our farmers, the latter would decline to accept them. The difference between the price of these two classes of bags in India, on the 31st March of the present year, is represented by the difference between 6¾d. and 9d. per dozen. Yet we are informed, in the article from which I have quoted, that the Argentine farmers are getting their bags at half the price which the Australian farmers are paying for their sacks. I say, unhesitatingly, that the Australian farmer is not only getting the better of the bargain, but that he is getting his bags at half the price that is being paid for sacks by the Argentine farmer. </para>

If he means the same amount spread over the three years, it is absolutely ridiculous, because the cornsack trade of the whole of Australia does not exceed an average of &#163;2,000,000 per annum, and certainly has not exceeded that sum during the past two or three years. How is it possible for the farming community of the Commonwealth to have been saved from &#163;1,000,000 to &#163;2,000,000 when the whole of their annual trade in this direction is worth only &#163;2,000,000?

Taking the trade at its full estimate of &#163;2,000,000 per annum at 5 per cent., which has never been made by the merchants of Australia on an average during the last three years, the possible saving is only &#163;100,000 per annum, and, at the very worst, it could be only about &#163;250,000 spread, over the three years.

                            <para>. - I am glad <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Shannon</inline> has afforded me the opportunity of reviewing briefly the position of cornsacks in Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> asked the other day a question limited to jute. If I did not give him as complete information as was possible on that occasion, it was the fault of yourself, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> who ruled both of us out of order. I have always endeavoured, on the floor of this chamber, and in another place, through my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Greene,</inline> and through the newspapers, to give the public an indication of what was going on; but I could not be definite, nor could anybody else be definite, about a contract that was not, and is not yet, finalized. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> interjected during the debate that the farmers could not get bag3 in New South Wales .at the last harvest. I am not questioning the statement. There was a shortage of bags for 1916, and it arose in this way: There was a bad drought in Australia in 1914, consequently, there was a large surplus of cornsacks; and, during the next year, we had plenty of sacks in &#34;Australia ; but the following year, there was a good season, and there was a shortage. Let me give one typical instance. An old sea captain came down .to my office to look for cornsacks. He said he wanted some to put his wheat&#62; in, and when I told him the Government were not dealing in cornsacks, he asked, &#34; What sort of a Government is it, when a man cannot get a few cornsacks from them at a pinch?&#34; This brought the question under my notice, and I went into it with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clarke,</inline> the then Prices Commissioner. As a result, we cabled to the Indian Government in March, 1917, asking them whether the Commonwealth Government could make direct arrangements through them to purchase the cornsacks required for Australia. Their reply was that, as most of the Australian merchants had previously ordered - and cornsacks are sometimes ordered as far ahead as thirteen or fourteen months - they could not act for us that year, seeing that the Australian mer-&#39; chants had entered into contracts with the millers of India. To get over the difficulty, I called a conference of the jute trade of all the States. We asked them to give the Government, through me, an undertaking . to supply sufficient cornsacks for Australia. Following that, we took a census of the whole of the cornsacks in Australia, and of the . cornsacks on order, and made them supply a further return once a month showing any new orders for cornsacks. The census showed us that we had a surplus of something like 10,000,000 more bags in Australia and on order than were required for Australia last year - which was quite correct. Everything went .well. Shipping had been engaged; but in September, owing to war conditions in the East, the shipping belonging to the British-India Shipping Company, which had been engaged for the jute exporters and importers, was suddenly required for war purposes by our Allies, and particularly by Great Britain. Australian ships, iti cooperation with one or two vessels allowed to us by the British Government, brought the cornsacks to Australia, and from September onward those responsible for distribution in this country worked very hard indeed. Some of the ships purchased by the Commonwealth Government were employed in carrying the bags to Australia, and thus the farmers of this country were saved from a very serious position indeed. As honorable senators are aware, seasons differ throughout Australia. We found that in some cases farmers who usually reap in January, and had ordered bags under contract for November, were about two months late with their harvest, while on the other hand farmers who wanted bags&#39; for November had npt ordered them until .September. In order to obviate the difficulty thus created, the Government issued a regulation under the War Precautions Act giving them authority to deviate contracts, with the result that 3,000 boles of bags under order for Victoria were diverted to Western Australia without any &#39;additional expenditure, and thus these sacks were available for an early crop in Western Australia. Subsequently, anticipating difficulty, we purchased about 20,000 bales of bags ourselves, and were able to return to a Melbourne private merchant the 3,000 bags which had been under order for Western Australia. Night after night those intrusted with the details of cornsacks distribution were engaged in solving the difficulties as they arose, and the Government practically took control of all bags on order for Australia. We studied the weather and the condition of the crops, and tried, as far as was humanly possible, to see that each particular district had cornsacks when they were required, supplies for the late districts being held back. It was an enormous task, but we had the hearty co-operation of the whole of the jute merchants in Australia, as well as all those associated with artificial manure companies, and I must say, oh behalf of the Price Fixing Commissioner and the staff responsible for this work, that they carried out in a very satisfactory manner one of the most difficult tasks that could have been intrusted to them. </para>

                                <para>- I&#39; want to point out that, though we did all we could, we were still from ten. to twelve days behind right throughout Australia. But I desire also to point out that but for the action of the Government cornsacks for the Australian wheat harvest would not have been available at all. Everybody knows that we cannot control shipping, and it was owing to this fact that New South Wales was for a time without bags. I am not, much interested in the price of bags iri 1914, but I do know that at the time we bought cornsacks in India we were able to purchase at about 2s. per dozen lower than the rate at which any private firm could have bought, and. I hope the1 farmers will get the benefit of that transaction. Last year the Indian Government declined to allow us to use their Jute Controller, who has been buying all jute material for the Allies, but we are pur- &#39; chasing through the Jute Commissioner this year 60,000,000 bags, or 200,000 bales. The purchases already made by  the Government carry no commission. So far as I know, the cornsacks were bought from the mills direct. At the time of purchase the freight to Australia was 80s., but since then it has advanced to 20s. by neutral boats. </para>

                                <para>- Yes ; but the demand for silver in India is increasing, and , must have a tendency to harden the market. We have been asked about the distribution of bags, and, in this connexion, I might mention that as soon as the contract was sufficiently advanced, I summoned a conference of the whole of the jute trade in Australia for the purpose of dealing with this question. The decisions of the conference, which have been indorsed by the Government, favour the utilization of existing distributing agencies, as it was thought to be impossible to organize any other system for distribution at a cost less than that entailed by existing agencies. . We will receive information when each boat leaves Calcutta, and it has been agreed by the trade that the cornsacks will be apportioned between the States according to the. quantities required. All details will be publicly advertised, and we hope to effect the sale of the cornsacks in transit, basing the price at ships&#39; slings at Melbourne, Sydney, Fremantle, or Adelaide, as the case may be, instead of at Calcutta, as in previous . years. It is hoped that the price to be realized will cover all costs, and, perhaps, leave a small margin, although we have no desire to make any money out of the farmers of Australia. We are not doing this as a commercial business at all, but merely to help the producers of this country out of the difficulties that confront them in war time. The retail price of the bass will be controlled by the Prices Commissioner, in the same manner as other commodities are controlled. </para>

That is being arranged by the Jute Controller in India. There are only two things which prevent me making a public pronouncement as to the price. One is that we have not yet finalized arrangements with respect to exchange, which runs into something over &#163;50,000. As honorable senators are aware, the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> has, during the last few days been attending the Premiers&#39; Conference in Sydney; but I hope to be able to finalize this matter in the course of the next few days. Another matter which delays an announcement is that, whilst the British Government have promised us sufficient shipping accommodation to bring cornsacks to Australia, we have not yet come to an agreement with regard to the freight; and I regard the price which they suggest as too high. </para>

                                <para>- To-day bags are unobtainable; but a few months ago they were costing from lis. 3d., to 12s. per dozen c.i.f. on the Melbourne wharf. Some men made contracts, and some of these got in early. Some want their contracts cancelle&#39;d, while others do not desire that that should be done. I believe that the matter has been settled finally by the British-India Steam Navigation Company cancelling their contracts for shipping, because the British Government have taken their ships off the line. That matter is being determined at a conference of the jute trade which is being held &#39;at the present moment. </para>

                            <para>. - I can scarcely approach the discussion of this question in the normal frame of mind in which one should consider a question of so much importance. About this time last year we had a Tariff Bill before the House in connexion with which the price of cornsacks came up, and I endeavoured to have the duty on these goods, amounting to &#163;40,000, knocked off, to enable our farmers to obtain the bags they required for last year&#39;s harvest at a lower price. I took that opportunity to urge upon the Government the necessity of securing cornsacks in time for the harvest. But honorable senators on the other side, in the interests of the people who deal in cornsacks, but do not use them, retained the duty. I warned the Government at that time that there would be a shortage of bags for the harvest, and now the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> stands up here and makes his excellent explanation. The honorable senator will never be found guilty, of anything which he did not do with the best intentions. The charge he has to meet with respect to the scarcity of sacks for last year&#39;s harvest, and also for the coming harvest, is that he has never yet succeeded in securing results commensurate with his expectations and promises. What happened in connexion with cornsacks last year? There were ships in Sydney Harbor bringing cornsacks, and the Government, instead of unloading them, allowed one vessel - the <inline font-style="italic">Dorset</inline> - to leave the wharf and go out into midstream, causing a delay in the lauding of the goods of twenty-four hours. That might appear to be a small matter, but if honorable senators were wheat farmers, and had wheat lying in their paddocks which they were obliged to cover with tarpaulins because they had not the sacks in which to bag it, they would know what such a delay means. </para>

                                <para>- I repeat that the manipulation of the wheat business and the cornsack business has been against the farmers. Fortunately, owing to the wet season, the harvest in New South Wales last year was six weeks late. If it had not been for that, it is hard to say what the disaster to the farmers would have been in the harvesting of their crops. But with that six weeks to the good, the Government were still behind in the supply of cornsacks. I heard one man offering to sell his wheat for one-third of its value because he could not obtain bags for it. That was late in November. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has told us that something happened to the shipping in September ; but why were not the necessary bags here before September? Those who are familiar with Australian conditions know that the harvest begins late in October or early in November, and anything that happened to the shipping in September was too late for the purpose of the Minister&#39;s argument. He should have had the necessary bags here before September, and in the districts in which they were required. </para>

Let the Vice-President of the Executive Council wake up and realize that the men who are growing wheat in this country are as much entitled to a rise in prices as are the manufacturers of bags and jute goods in India. Even under the existing high shipping rates, wheat can be landed on the American&#39; coast for lOd. per bushel. </para>

                                <para>- I can make suggestions if I am left alone. My time is too short to enable me to follow up the Minister&#39;s questions. Wheat, last year, was landed in America for10d. per bushel, and sold there for 10s. 6d. per bushel. Our farmers were compelled to sell at 4s. 9d. per bushel. Why were they not allowed to secure some increase in price? It cannot be said that it is because we want to give the wheat to the British Government. </para>

                                <para>- I do not. I say that the Government have taken the farmers&#39; wheat at 4s. 9d. per bushel. It could have been landed in America for 10d. per bushel, which would make the cost 5s. 7d., and there would then have been a profit of 5s. per bushel, to which the farmer would have been entitled. When prices are soaring up all over the world, it is not fair to say to the farmers of Australia that the price of bags may go up, the price of machinery and labour may go up, but the one thing that must not increase in price is the wheat he produces, which must be kept down to the level of pre-war times. The Government and their supporters are working in with the people whose direct aim is that the farmer shall have to pay. </para>

                                <para>- I ask that when we are making the farmer pay, at least we should not compel him to Waste his crop. Even if we make him sell his wheat at half its value, we should supply him with the cornsacks in which to bag it. If we are not prepared to do that, we should let him know sufficiently early to enable him to make an effort to do something for himself. The farmers are kept waiting, their crops are ready to be gathered, the machines are ready in the paddocks, and the wheat has to be laid on tarpaulins and covered with tarpaulins because the farmers are not supplied with cornsacks. A farmer dealing with a local merchant is supplied, because the merchants have the foresight to make provision for the supply of bags to their regular customers. But those who are dependent on the promise of the Government, and on the men for whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Shannon</inline> spoke,are unable to obtain the bags they require, and have to pay for secondhand bags a higher price than they ought to be charged for new bags. </para>

                                <para>- On the subject of private enterprise, let me say that we have had a good deal of feeling expressed with regard to the after-the-war trade. Quite a number of our people say that when the war is over we should not trade again with our enemies. In this connexion, I venture to say that the Government should direct. the attention of the Shipping Ring to the way in which they are treating the people of Australia in preventing the landing of goods except at exorbitant rates of freight, and should tell them that when the war is over their ships will not be allowed to trade with Australia. If a really determined stand were made on behalf of the people of the Commonwealth in dealing with the Shipping Ring, the Bag Combine, and the Jute Combine, they would know that there would be a day of reckoning for them when we get back to normal times, and there would be less of the exploitation that is going on now. I say that this country is being absolutely crippled at the present time, that our producers are being hampered, hindered, and interfered with by middlemen, who are making profits that they have no right to make at a time like this. </para>

I ask the honorable senator to answer the question : Is it not a fact that the price paid to the farmers of Australia for their wheat is only half the&#39; world&#39;s market price? Let the honorable senator answer that.  His  colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Cook, went round recently telling us how very much obliged we should be to Great Britain because she was buying our wheat harvest at half its price. </para>

                            - We are; and this is done by the &#34;rats.&#34; It is they who are responsible for it. I said in the beginning that I could scarcely * trust myself to deal with this matter in the frame of mind in which one should approach so serious a question. During the recent campaign, I was all over the wheat districts of New South Wales, and it was a saddening thing to see men who had put their year&#39;s work into the harvest hampered and hindered, not by a Government who did so wilfully, but by a Government actuated by good intentions but unable to secure results. I am speaking now with the hope that the Government will at once take active steps to secure cornsacks for the wheat farmers.&#39;

Is the German less an enemy than the shipping enemy, who will take his ships off the line and prevent our getting &#39;our supplies away to the people at Home? If any honorable senator says that the - shipping companies are fighting in the interests of the Empire, I violently differ with him. If there is one glaring scandal in the world to-day it is the enormous profits of the Shipping Ring. </para>

The  time has arrived for the Government to take drastic steps to deal with the men who are out to make profits- not steps to try and tak&#169; their profits from them, but to treat them as they should be treated, namely, as traitors. And let them pay the penalty of traitors; for although I am not an advocate of the death penalty, if ever there was justification for it, it is that it should be put into operation against the combine which is increasing the prices of food to the women and children of those who are fighting for us. </para>

I have been in Opposition myself for many years. I graduated there. I yield to no one in my experience of what it is to be in Opposition; and all my experience there has taught me that the only place where anything can be done perfectly is where one is in Opposition. </para>

                                <para>- If the honorable senator means that statement, and knows how he can get bags when everybody else knows that the matter of shipping is the difficulty in the way, he should get up and expound this panacea for our ills. But he is only talking bombast now. I rose not so much to&#39; deal with the general tenor of the honorable gentleman&#39;s remarks - remarks with which we are all familiar when we stop to listen to an orator at the street corner-7-for it was in no sense a serious contribution to the subject brought forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Shannon.</inline> There were, however, two or three statements made, upon which, because they are incorrect, and have been utilized by an honorable senator reckless as to their accuracy, I feel it my duty to make some comments. </para>

                                <para>- To the Pool here. And the honorable senator knows why it was paid to the Pool. It was in order that, as different prices were realized for different parcels of wheat sold, the whole of the farmers should get the average price. It was for the reason that one farmer, whose wheat had gone to America, should not receive a better return than the man whose wheat had been sent to England, or was being consumed locally.  The  freight was 95s. per ton. That is very different from the price which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> stated. </para>

The. honorable senator will see that the amount of 95s. per ton divided by the 37 bushels to the ton brings the quotation to somewhere in the neighbourhood of 3s. 7d. per bushel freight. , If he deducts that from the price paid for the wheat, he will find that we are getting 5s. 9d. per bushel from our contracts with the American Government. That 5s.9d. per bushel went into the Pool. It is absurd to think otherwise. </para>

                                <para>- There are certain holidays upon which men will not work. The vessel did not coal at the wharf, but was hauled out into the fairway to be coaled by barges and colliers.&#39; Let me now show how little there is in the accusation which has been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline> He himself most effectually dis posed of his own argument by saying that the moment representations were made to the Government on the subject, the vessel was brought back to the wharf. In other words, the moment it was pointed out that the farmers would be prejudiced by the action which had been taken, the Government risked the coaling of the vessel, and had the bags taken out of her hold. Probably a little forethought on the part of those who had charge of her might have impelled them to the conclusion that this was the correct course to adopt. But the fact that the vessel was brought back to the wharf the moment it was pointed out that the work of coaling her first would be prejudicial to the interests of the farmers, shows conclusively that the Government had no such desire as that which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has alleged&#39;. Had they entertained that desire they would have kept the vessel out in the fairway. </para>

                            <para>. - We are all obliged to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Shannon</inline> for having initiated this debate, which, though it promised to be a somewhat dry one, has proved to be extremely interesting, as well as of a practical nature. Upon this motion I do not intend to discuss the price of wheat. A great deal of time has been devoted to that matter,- which might more profitably have been occupied in discussing the price of bags. When we recall the pre-war prices of bags, and remember the enormous increase which has taken place in the freight &#39;from India to the Commonwealth, it must &#176;be recognised that the bag merchants are to-day deriving a smaller profit than they were receiving before the war. That being the case, I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> and his associates why they allowed greater profits to be made in former years without then entering any protest against the price of bags, and without bringing forward extravagant charges of corruption? According to the figures in my possession, the freight from India at the present time is about 80s. per ton. </para>

                                <para>- That is the minimum given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> a day or two ago. These bags are selling at 9s. 6d. per dozen. Now, I can recollect that long before the war, evidence was given before the Tariff Commission that the freight upon these bags from Calcutta to Australia was as low as 7s. 6d. per ton. Yet, at that time, the minimum price of the bags was 6s. 4d. per dozen. The figures prove that in those days there was a larger margin of profit to the bag merchant than there is to-day. </para>

                        <para>In the light of these statistics, the Government may be complimented upon their very successful handling of the freight business. The most improbable of the reckless charges made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline>  was that honorable senators upon this side of the chamber are parties to a conspiracy to get the better of the farmers, and to play into the hands of the bag merchants of Australia. </para>

It is that after his speech of last week he feels bound to make up a little bit of the ground which he has lost with outside organizations, and, in order to do that he has indulged in his usual reckless talk about &#34;rats,&#34; &#34; scabs,&#34; &#38;c. </para>

                                <para>- Exactly . I never hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> talk about &#34; scabs &#34; and &#34; rats &#34; without feeling disposed to reiterate the statements I made on a former occasion, that he is quite qualified to speak with some authority on that question. The absurdity of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> remarks <inline font-style="italic">re</inline> farming interests is seen in the fact that there are many honorable senators on this side who are wheatgrowers and are thus directly interested in cheap supplies for the farmers. As one in that position, I say, unhesitatingly, that there are more honorable senators upon this side of the chamber who are directly interested in wheat-growing than are to be found on the opposite side. As a matter of fact, I doubt if there is a single honorable senator opposite who is directly interested in wheat-growing. </para>

                                <para>- Surely the fact that there are half-a-dozen honorable senators upon this side of the chamber who are wheat-growers is convincing proof that they are interested in getting their bags as cheaply as possible. Surely it is evidence that they do not desire to play into the hands of the bag merchants and injure the wheat growers.

                                <para>- He certainly indulges in a good many tales which are highly improbable. I do not pose as an authority upon this question, but I say that if <inline font-weight="bold">Major Purcell</inline> knows as little about the business upon which he was sent to India - I refer to the purchase of horses - as he does about the purchase of wheat bags, a Royal Commission ought to be appointed to inquire into his knowledge upon that subject, and I do not think we could appoint to such a Commission a better man than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Shannon.</inline> The Government are doing their very best to insure a sufficient supply of wheat sacks for the coming harvest. For some months past they have been endeavouring to secure a sufficiency of shipping for that purpose, and consequently they cannot be charged with negligence. They have been in communication first with the British Government, and secondly with the Jute Commission in Calcutta. In attempting to obtain an adequate supply of wheat sacks for our Australian farmers, they are certainly taking proper action. No suggestion has been made on the other side to give greater help than the Government are giving, and altogether the Government deserve credit rather than blame for the manner in which they have handled the bag question up to the present time. </para>

                            <para>. - I welcome the motion because it has presented an opportunity to focus attention on the question of the treatment meted out to the wheat industry in Australia. The question of the bags which hold the wheat is inseparably interwoven with the question of the conditions under which the industry of producing wheat is being carried on in the Commonwealth. It brings back to my mind the great hullabaloo raised about the wheat agreement, the wool agreement, and the metals agreement made by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> on the memorable occasion on which he went to Great Britain. With the exception of the wool industry, these agreements have not given satisfaction, . and there has not been dissatisfaction in the case of wool only because of the abnormal demand that has arisen for wool on account* of war usage. Both the metals . industry and the wheat industry have received detrimental treatment as the result of the agreements entered into on that occasion by the Prime Minister. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie referred to honorable senators on this side as not being personally interested in the subject of wheat production&#39;, but I hold that every citizen is seriously concerned in the wheat industry and its expansion, and. in the question of procuring bags to complete the harvest. The harsh treatment that the Australian wheat industry has received makes it more difficult for wheat producers and users of wheat bags to pay the enhanced cost they have to pay for commodities on account of the general increases that have taken place since the outbreak of war. That harsh treatment becomes very apparent when we compare the price, 4s. 9d. per bushel, paid in Australia for wheat to the wheat-grower, and the price being paid in England for wheat from Canada and the United States. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> quite mistakenly thought I was trying to attract his fire from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> but I was only trying to pin that elusive gentleman down to some definite reference to the difference in price. </para>

                                <para>- Very well. While the price of everything, bags included, has gone up to the grower, the price of wheat has not been allowed to enhance. That is why I say the Australian wheat industry is being harshly dealt with through the agreement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> on behalf of the Commonwealth Government. He mixed that question up, as he mixed up everything else that he touched on that occasion. </para>

                                    seems to think that he is to be allowed, not only to evade the Standing Orders which regulate debate, but also to reflect on the  President.  That will not be tolerated, and I ask him to withdraw unreservedly the expression which he has just used, and which amounts to a &#34;reflection on the Chair.

                                <para>- It is the proper attitude of the Opposition to think the Government always are lunatics, but the public cannot be expected to take that view. The Flinders election showed that the farmers of that district - and they are a good sample of the farmers of Australia - thought it better to return a supporter of the Government. &#34; In time of war, we cannot hope for an entire absence of friction. The farmer does not think he has been well dealt with in every way, and the wool-grower who had to sell his wool much under the free market price also did not think he was getting too good a deal; but we must look at these matters from the point of view of war-time. The Government, in stepping in to buy the bags, took the place of large numbers of instrumentalities that were operating for the public previously. Thousands of brains were working in the past at the businesses which are now managed by the different Pools. All that work is now concentrated in the hands of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> and a few others, who deserve our utmost sympathy and patience. I think they are getting it from the bulk of the farmers, judging by the Flinders election, and also from the bulk of the wool men- </para>

                                <para>- I can quite believe it, because I have always held that one or two men cannot satisfactorily take the place of the hundreds of agencies which operated before. What we want is a sort of pool of Siloam, where we can dip Ministers at the end of each week to rejuvenate them. On the whole, we must recollect that this is a time of war. The British Government were tremendously criticised in the Old Country for buying the last Australian wheat crop and leaving it in Australia to be eaten by mice. The post of freight has a great deal to do with the cost of bags. Honorable senators opposite have been criticising the enormous profits made by the shipping companies, and I am inclined to agree with them; but the British Government get 80 per cent. of that money back, and no doubt they have an arrangement whereby a great deal of the remainder of that profit is spent in building fresh ships, which are of vital importance now. </para>

                                <para>- The neutrals, of course, were quite independent of the British Government. The bags could not be carried in neutral bottoms, and at the same time our Governments insist on the neutral ship-owners charging reasonable freights. They were absolutely independent of any of our Governments. There is no doubt that the shipping companies have been making most excessive charges. </para>

I have not the slightest desire to question his motive; I have every reason to believe that it was good, but I do not think he did himself justice when he was dealing with the comparison that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Purcell</inline> had made between the cost of bags to Australia and the cost to the Argentine producers. We ought to be satisfied - and I do not know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Shannon</inline> is satisfied on the point - that there was the difference that he claims did exist in the price of bags exported to the Argentine and those exported to Australia. If the bags sent to the respective countries were of the same quality, obviously <inline font-weight="bold">Major Purcell</inline> would have been quite right in his contention that the Argentine producers were getting bags at about half the price charged to Australian farmers, but I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Shannon</inline> failed to demonstrate this fact.

It was really refreshing to listen to the honorable senator defending those who, when he was associated with the party on this side of the Senate, comprised what is known as the Bag Combine of Australia. The honorable senator went back to the time when the Tariff Commission made inquiries into the cost of different articles, and in that way endeavoured to show&#39; that the bag merchants were really not getting as much profit to-day as they were then. Obviously they are not, because in 1909 bags were costing the Australian producer 4s. 9d. per dozen, but at the latter end of 1913, when there was no stress of shipping, and no increase in freights, the price had mounted to 9s. 3d. per dozen. </para>

I remember <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie on more than one occasion denouncing this combine for its ruthless exploitation of the Australian producers, but to-day we had the humiliating spectacle of that honorable senator - I believe he now feels bound to do something for his new-found supporters -trying to show that although the Australian producers have to pay nearly 12s. 3d. per dozen for their bags, the Bag Combine is not receiving as much profit as. formerly. Indeed, he went further, and said that the Government were doing all that could reasonably be expected of them to protect the Australian farmer from exploitation. If that is so, then all I can say is: Between the Bag and Shipping Combines and the present Government, may the Lord have mercy on the Australian producers ! </para>

                            in his reply to
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline>
                            carefully avoided some of those wholesome and grim-visaged facts that the Leader of the Opposition presented. He attempted to ridicule them, and introduced into some sentences meanings that were never intended by
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline>
                            And in that spirit of magnanimity for which he has become noted, the Minister tried to throw upon the unionists responsibility for the removal of that shipping from wharf -side to mid-stream. For the moment &#34;the Minister forgot it was not the Wharf Lumpers Union that had been engaged by the Government to coal the ship. It was the organization known as the Loyalists.
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline>
                            told us that, while the men refused to coal the ship alongside the wharf, they cheerfully undertook this duty when the vessel was removed into mid-stream. Is it not pitiful to find a responsible Minister of the Crown going to such lengths to attempt to answer the definite statement and charges made by the Leader of the Opposition? This question of the supply of bags for the Australian producers has been a bone of contention for many years. One party and the other party have always been going to do something; yet no party has ever done anything, with the result that the price of hags has to-day reached its absolute maximum, and is a tremendous burden upon our producers. The present Government claim, however, to have adopted a course that will relieve our farmers to a considerable extent in the future.

I realize that to-day the price of bags is governed in a great measure by freight, but that does not relieve the Government of their responsibility for not having taken some action at least two years ago. </para>

                                <para>- I refer to the Australian Bag Combine. In 1908 or 1909 a number of Australian merchants acted independently, with the result that&#39; the farmers of this country were able to get bags at a fairly reasonable price, regulated in a great measure by competition; but competition gave place to combination, and bags rose to 9s. 3d. at the latter end of 1913. I hope the Government will do their utmost to see that the maximum of protection is extended to our farmers, and that there are no middlemen between the purchaser of the bags and the farmers who have to use them. It is to be hoped that the Government will not allow any medium of distribution to levy a profit on those bags, but. that they will be made available direct to the farming i community at net cost. </para>

As a director of one of the largest companies engaged in importing bags to Australia, I say that the object of that company has been to enable the farmers to secure the bags they require at the lowest possible cost.

                        <para class="block">That is to say, that it was in no way due to matters over which the Government had any control. That is an absolute reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner&#39;s</inline> tirade this afternoon. He should have read the report before making such wild statements. The honorable senator referred to the difference in the price of wheat in Australia and in the Old Country. It was very nice of him to try to tickle the ears of the farmers with that kind of thing. Of course, we should like to get 10s. per bushel for our wheat ; but his remarks remind me of the story of a farmer who was driving half-a-dozen head of cattle by the side of a loch, and some tourists asked him where he was going. When he said he was going to the market with them, they asked him how much he expected to get for them. He replied that he expected to get &#163;6 or &#163;8 per head, and one of them said to him, &#34; You fool, if you took them to Smithfield you could get &#163;20 per head for them.&#34; The farmer&#39;s reply to that was, &#34; Yes, and if I had this loch in hell I could get ls. a gill for it.&#34; The honorable senator is aware of the shipping difficulty, but he told the Senate that if he were made Commissioner in connexion with this matter he would have all these things done. If that is to be the honorable senator&#39;s price for helping the farming community, of which he has professed to be the champion, I say, &#34; Bosh to- such a legislator!&#34; If he knows a way by which the farming community of Australia might be benefited, it is his bounden duty, as a representative of New South Wales, to give the information in his possession to the people if he will not give it to the Government. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable senator could obtain Australian bags in the Argentine. He has told us that, despite the fact that there was no rise in prices in 1913, bags were selling in Tasmania at that time at 9s. 3d. per dozen. If that be true, all I have to say is that the honorable senator was very lax in his duty, as a representative of Tasmania, if he did not protest against such a charge for bags in 1913, as I pledge him my word - and it can be proved by a reference to the books of the South Australian Co-operative Farmers Union - that in March, 1914, we were retailing bags at 6s. 3d. per dozen. </para>

                                In your issue of 2nd August, you state : - &#34; While British farmers get 72s a quarter, or 9s. a bushel, for their wheat, the Australian farmer gets only 4s.10d. High freight, of course, accounts for the difference in the cost of wheat here and in the Commonwealth, but those freights go to British ship-owners.&#34; If by this you mean that the difference between 4s.10d. and 9s. a bushel is the freight on wheat from Australia to England, you are in error. By a question in the House of Commons, I elicited the fact that wheat is brought from Australia at &#34; blue book rates,&#34; the charge being10d. a bushel. So that the British shipowner does not get the difference. As I wished to find out if the British consumer got the difference, I put questions to the representative of the Food Controller, who replied that Such questions should not be asked, at which the seventy-two shilling patriots on the Tory benches cheered loudly. Wheat was then up to 9s. a bushel. I presume that the Government sells the wheat at market rates, and that the Treasury takes the difference. It appeared to me that if the Australian farmer is not permitted to get his share of the plunder that is going, the benefit should accrue either to the British consumer or to the Commonwealth Treasury. The Canadian Government refused to commandeer the Canadian wheat harvest at a maximum price, the Canadian farmer declaring that so long as the British farmer was free to extort a war price they were not going to consider the proposition. But the Canadian farmer can sell his wheat without having to make terms with the British Government in control of shipping. The scandal consists in the difference of treatment meted out to the British as compared with the Australian farmer. Of course, I realize that the Government has to keep up the enthusiasm for the war, and so the British farmer must be paid his price. If the Treasury ear-marks the difference between the cost of Australian wheat landed here (5s. 8d.) and the current price, say, 10s. a bushel, and later utilizes it to pay the bonus on wheat due to the British farmer under the Corn Production Bill, if his wheat is sold below a certain minimum, the Australian farmer will at least have the consolation of feeling that he has lent a helping hand to a poor distressed brother, not to mention the British landlord.

Whatever <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> may say is not sufficient to justify the- honorable senator in disobeying the rules of this Chamber. After this matter has been dealt with, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> will point out anything that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> said which was offensive to him, I shall deem it my duty to take the same course of action with respect to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> and ask him also to withdraw. Again I ask the honorable senator to withdraw his .statement. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> will not obey the Chair , there is only one course remaining for me, and that is to report <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> to the Senate for having continually and wilfully disobeyed the Chair. </para>

However, I shall not refrain from following the course laid down under the Standing Orders if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> leaves me no other course open. But first I beg him to accept my assurance that I made no such accusation. It was limited to one of inaccuracy on his part, and not that he was in any sense guilty of wilful misrepresentation of the truth. Having said that, I put it to the honorable senator whether it is not now competent for him to follow the recognised rules of the Chamber, so that there may be no necessity on my part to proceed further. </para>

                            <para>- The answer is - &#163;85,047. This amount represents commission, at the rate of 5s. per cent., on subscriptions totalling &#163;34,018,800. Commission to brokers is paid only on applications lodged through brokers. The total amount of subscriptions to the war loans is &#163;144,941,310. The amount quoted for commission - &#163;85,047 - is closely approximate, but will be slightly altered when the results of the sixth loan have been finally analyzed. </para>

                    <para>. - This section of the principal Act provides that the Crown shall have priority in respect to any debt due to it, whether the debtor becomes bankrupt or not. It has, however, been pointed out that men who become insolvent for very small amounts, rarely become bankrupt in the technical sense of the term. The Government, therefore, desire to amend the section so as to give the Crown priority as against any other creditor wherever a man may be in default, irrespective of whether or not he becomes officially bankrupt. Take the case of a returned soldier who obtains an advance from the Repatriation Department for the purpose of purchasing stock in a little business. Under this section, unless he became bankrupt, the Department would have no priority as against other creditors. Now, it is almost the invariable rule where amounts are owing to the Crown, that the Crown is a preferential creditor. I ask the Committee to put the Crown in that position, and in order to give effect to my desire, I move - </para>

                    <para>. - I gather from the Minister&#39;s explanation that in the event of a returned soldier becoming insolvent, the Crown, under the amendment proposed, will have a prior claim over all other creditors. If that be so, it is legislation of a most objectionable kind. The very fact that our returned soldiers will be to some extent assisted by the Government will enable them to obtain from small traders and others credit which they otherwise would not get. Take the case of a returned soldier who goes farming, and who finally strikes the Insolvency Court. Is it fair to say that the whole of his assets shall go to the Government to the exclusion, perhaps, of every other creditor? I think that unsuspecting traders who advance supplies to reputable men should be placed on an equal footing with the Crown. These same traders may advance supplies to keep men going, and yet we are asked to give the Government a preferential claim over them. I am always willing to protect the interests of the, Government, but I am not prepared to go that far. </para>

                    <para>. - If the Government insist upon the amendment, our returned soldiers will very properly be refused credit by ordinary traders. It is within my own knowledge that, on account of landlords having experienced a difficulty in getting their rents from persons who are deriving support from the Defence Department, they entertain a strong objection to letting houses to returned soldiers at all. If the Government are now going to tell all traders that if they supply our returned soldiers with goods upon credit, the Crown is going to have a prior claim upon the assets of those soldiers, they will be doing the men who have fought for Australia a very bad turn indeed. It would be much better for them to exercise a little more care over the amounts to be advanced to returned soldiers. </para>

                    <para>. - This is the most extraordinary spectacle in the world. When the Bill was going through Committee, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> assented to the proposition that the Crown should have a prior claim if the debtor paid a lawyer&#39;s bill and became officially bankrupt. Now we all know that very few small debtors go through the Bankruptcy Court. Yet when it is proposed that the Crown shall have a prior claim, irrespective of whether or not a returned soldier becomes officially bankrupt, Senators Gardiner and Grant demur at it. I ask the Committee to consider what will be the general run of cases with which we shall have to deal. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> put the case of a number of traders who might be willing to sustain our returned soldiers for a time by giving them extended credit. No doubt there will be cases of that kind. But there will also be other cases in which traders will be willing to take advantage of them. A man may have obtained &#163;100 worth of stock by way of advance from the Repatriation Department. Some one, seeing the business going back, or perhaps not even for that reason, may lend the man &#163;10 or &#163;15. What happens? When the man fails to meet his liabilities, who should have the prior claim, the Department, which put the &#163;100 worth of stock in <inline font-style="italic">bona fide,</inline> or the man who made the advance on it, perhaps not with <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> intentions ? I cannot understand that objection being taken at this stage. The principle obtains in all our land laws. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> will remember that when we were in the New South Wales Parliament together it was recognised in the land legislation of that State that the Crown must have the first claim. Apart from legislation here, the Crown has a claim. In order to make it perfectly cleaT, we propose to put it in the Bill. I ask honorable senators, as they have assented to the main principle on the second reading, to make the measure perfect by agreeing to these amendments. </para>

                    <para>.- .The fact that the thing has been done before does not weigh with me in the least; and the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has stirred me up only makes me the more keen. Let me put the position of the small trader who makes an advance. A returned soldier has been advanced &#163;100 for the equipment of his farm. One of his plough horses dies just at the beginning of the season. He cannot wait for the Government to advance him money to get another, and therefore borrows from some one else &#163;15 to buy another horse. The season is bad, and he goes insolvent, and that horse is sold, with ^ the others, twelve months hence. The whole of the &#163;15 advanced to him to buy the horse is lost to the lender, and the Government rope it all in. That is not a fair deal. It is perfectly fair that the Government, in a case of bankruptcy, should stand on the same footing as other creditors. { </para>

                        <para>- When introducing legislation to benefit returned soldiers, I cannot see why we should load it up with anything likely to do them an injury. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> has put his finger on a very weak spot. No man ever started a business without finding that it required more capital than he at first anticipated, and that his returns would be slower than he anticipated. The Government in this matter will be lending money to thousands of men to start in various businesses. In many cases there will come a time when the man will want a further advance to carry on. If he gets it, and the business still goes to the wall, the tradesman who made the advance will be the creditor after the Government. In an estate that would pay 10s. in the &#163;1, the Government would step in and get 20s. in the &#163;1, and the other creditors would not get even 10s. The Government claim would swamp the lot. Naturally only the Government side is put in Parliament, and all the laws protect the Government. But in cases of this kind, which will be spread broadcast throughout Australia, we may be not only doing an injury to the soldier embarking on a business, by making it difficult for him to obtain credit, but will certainly be doing an injury to the people who legitimately lend him money.

                <para class="block">Government by trickery, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has been very fertile in suggestions in that regard, but there are thousands of cases of legitimate traders, such as storekeepers, who make advances against next season&#39;s wheat or wool, either in money or goods. If this amendment is passed-, no storekeeper will be able to afford to do that. He has to get his supplies from the wholesale merchant, who will refuse to take the promissory note of the borrower, because he knows the Government claim comes first. The argument that we should do this because it has been done before would apply to every case where a reform is sought. No doubt if the Bill had gone through in its original form, I might not have noticed section 19; but when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> points out the effect of it, I am justified in pointing out to the Committee what they are doing, and in asking the Minister to reconsider the matter. </para>

                    <para>. - Before the land settlement question was dealt with in Australia by State Governments, advances to settlers were made by private bankers or big storekeepers, and in many instances when the settler failed the farm fell into the hands of these people. In recent years, particularly in Western Australia, the State Government have come forward as the money lender, and the result has been that in cases of failure the State has at least had the farm as security. The Government have always seen to it that they had the first claim ; but in this case the Commonwealth Government will be in a different position, because the Commonwealth does not own the land, and will have no claim on the farm for the money it advances to the soldier as repatriation help. That is all the more reason why we should safeguard ourselves and the returned soldiers. We should be handling the public moneys very rashly if we allowed soldiers to whom we advance money to incur further debts from second or third parties, and then allowed those claims to rank on an equal footing with our own. We can expect just as many failures in our efforts to settle men on the land as the State Governments have had in the past, and can look forward to much of the money we advance being squandered, or, at any rate, not spent to the best advantage. Very few men are cut out for a career on the land, and many find this out after a year or two, when all their capital has been spent, foolishly or otherwise. Something like -600 farms on&#39; which money has been advanced have been thrown back on the hands of the Government of Western Australia. We may expect a repetition of that, and will be only safeguarding the public purse if we take the precaution to see that the Commonwealth is not unfairly dealt with. </para>

I do not think the Government would be justified in spending money on another inquiry unless there were much better grounds than are to be found in a mere idle newspaper report. </para>

                            <para>- If any one inadvertently and innocently - or, may I say, in this particular case, who, without due care and -inquiry - gives publicity to that which is not true, although he himself may believe it to be true, he is doing a public wrong. It is his duty to inquire and see whether the facts are as represented. In this case, I said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> had been guilty of recklessly publishing abroad as facts things which have been advanced by other people, and that he should have verified them himself. I challenged him to produce his proof ; and I can only say that facts presented on such proofs as he produced today would not last for five seconds in any Court in the universe. He said the statement was published in a Sydney paper, and when I asked him to name the paper, he very carefully refrained from doing so. The statement purported to be an extract from the <inline font-style="italic">British Australasian.</inline></para>

The whole question is one of facts. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> advanced what he called facts earlier in the afternoon, and he was followed by myself. I challenged his statements, and invited him to demonstrate their truth. He said he would do so, and he comes down and submits as proof of his facts a statement appearing in a newspaper. </para>

That committee is in no sense under the control of the Defence Department. There is also a hospital advisory committee equally free to visit the hospital, and under no official control. Both these bodies visit the place, and it is a fair assumption that if any negligence exists of the kind referred to in&#39; the paragraph quoted, one or other of those committees would have sensed it, and would have reported the matter to the Minister for Defence. No such report has been received. I think it is highly improbable that there is the slightest foundation of truth in any of those statements, but the Minister has already notified that an. inquiry is to be made into the allegations. </para>
