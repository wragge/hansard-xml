                    <para>) - I desire to make a short statement on a matter which I regard as of importance to the people of Australia generally, and of Victoria in particular. Following on the surrender of Turkey, honorable senators may have seen a press notice to the effect that the Imperial Government are taking action to insure a visit of the Imperial Graves Commission to Gallipoli in order to arrange for- the proper care and protection of the last resting places of many of our glorious dead. The military operations of Australians on Gallipoli were practically confined to the area known as Anzac, between Gaba Tepe and Sulla Bay, but there was a period between the 6th and 17th of May, 1915, when the 2nd Brigade of Victorian Infantry were operating at Cape Helles,. some 14 miles south of Anzac. I am sure that the Imperial Graves Commission will not meet with any difficulty in the identification of localities at Anzac, but I have very good reason to believe that, unless some action is taken by the Government of this- country, there is serious danger that hundreds of our gallant Victorian heroes now lying at Cape Helles may sleep in unknown and unmarked graves for all time. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>In order that honorable senators may understand and appreciate this danger, I may briefly review the facts. In connexion with the general- operations on Gallipoli early in May, it was considered by a high authority that an immediate attack was necessary on  Achi  Baba. Expected reinforcements for the 29th Division not having arrived, a request was made to the Australian Division to assist by detailing troops for this proposed attack. It was finally arranged to form a composite division, consisting of the 2nd Brigade, Victorian Infantry, a Now Zealand Brigade, and two or three battalions of the Royal Naval Reserve. This composite division was placed under the command of the General Officer.&#34; at Cape Helles. On the 5th May, the 2nd Brigade of Victorian Infantry were transported from Anzac by gunboats and minesweepers to Cape Helles. They landed there on the morning of the 6th May, and moved immediately to a rendezvous some 3 miles from the enemy&#39;s position. I am giving this explanation in order that honorable senators may see the reasons for the anxiety I expressed in the early part of my statement. The line occupied by the Allies extended from the Aegean to the Dardanelles. On the .left flank there was the  29th  Division, and on the right French troops. The right flank was not. so far advanced as the left flank, and, before beginning, the attack on the whole line, the General Officer Commanding decided it was necessary to bring the right flank into line with the left flank. &#34;Consequently, on the 6th and 7th May, very heavy fighting by the French troops took place. These brave troops secured their objective on the night of the 7th May, when the alignment was completed, and preparations made for the general attack on the following day. On the following -morning, 8th May, the 2nd Victorian Infantry Brigade were moved up close to the rear of the front positions occupied by the Allies. The ground- allotted to them was in the centre, between the French and British Divisions. &#39; It covered a front of about 1,000 yards, and was clearly defined on each flank by a small creek. It formed a tableland that was uncovered and without protection, with the exception of here and there a few small trees. </para>
                <para>Preparation was made for the general attack by the naval guns and artillery on shore at 5 a.m., and at 5.30 a.m. the whole line was ordered to advance. It is well known that tha 2nd Victorian Infantry Brigade, owing, no doubt, to the fact that the ground they occupied was uncovered, advanced much more rapidly than did the general line to a considerable distance both right and left, and this brought them under very heavy and destructive enemy fire. During a few short hours there were very heavy casualties in that brigade, including the brigadier and the whole of his staff- killed or wounded. During the night, some confusion naturally arose, until these facts were ascertained, and the next senior officer took command. It was found that the whole of that plain area of 1,000 yards front, for a distance of nearly half-a-mile back from the front line, was littered with dead, dying, and wounded Australians. The advance they made was held up within 300 or 400 yards of the enemy line, where our men dug in under very heavy machine gun and rifle fire by the enemy during the whole of the night. This involved very serious difficulty in dealing with the dead and wounded on the Saturday night. </para>
                <para>I shall never forget the heroic work of the Army Medical Officers and the Army Medical Corps, leading to the death, amongst others, of that brilliant officer, Captain Mathews, who was not obliged to be there, as his place was 2 miles back from the front, but who, knowing the great demand for medical services, came up and rendered what aid he could. That was on the Saturday night, and on the following Sunday night attempts were made to collect and bury the dead. During the daytime, it was impossible for any one to move on that exposed ground. During the night, the enemy were quite aware of the fact that we were establishing ourselves in that position, and every few minutes they lit up the whole area with star shells and flare lights, so that honorable senators can realize the difficulties that had to be encountered in gathering the dead and relieving the wounded. The dead were collected in groups of from 70 to 80, each group being buried in a large grave. The difficulty of collecting the personal belongings of the men can be readily understood, seeing that the work had to be carried out in the dark. The personal effects of the men, as well as their identification discs, had to be taken from <inline font-style="italic">they...</inline> Directly a light appeared those engaged in this work had to fall flat on the ground in. order to escape the machine gun fire. Thus, they could work only during the few moments of darkness. On the night of the 12th- 13th May this Brigade was relieved by the Lancashire Fusiliers. </para>
                <para>In collecting the dead under the conditions I have described, obviously no action could be taken to mark the graves in which the dead were buried. On the evening I have, mentioned, the Brigade retired to its base some 3 miles in the rear, and on the 17th May it left Cape Helles altogether. The scene of the actual burial of our dead was therefore practically known only to persons attached to the 2nd Brigade. A few days after this Brigade had been relieved by the Lancashire Fusiliers, the latter were driven out of that position, which again became enemy territory. It is probable, therefore, that there is very little to indicate the exact spot where these graves are located. But there are two officers alive to-day - I believe that one of them is in France - who were detailed on that occasion to raise the burial parties, and I feel sure that unless some action be taken by the Government to obtain the services of one or other of these officers, who have a personal knowledge of the. work done on that Sunday and Monday night, there is a very grave risk of serious mistakes being made. I consider it is the duty of the Government to take every step that may be necessary to insure direct identification of the graves on this particular spot. I should like the Ministry to take some action- </para>

                    <para>By the Indulgence of the Senate, a senator may explain matters of a personal nature, although there may be no question before the Senate; but such matters may not be debated. 1 have always understood that statements other than those indicated are statements referring to the business before the Senate, or to matters to be dealt with by the Senate. Honorable senators are afforded an opportunity upon the motion for the adjournment of the Senate to raise other matters&#39; not necessarily connected with the business of this Chamber.  A matter such as that which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> has quite properly brought forward might well have been raised  on the motion for adjournment, and if it had been dealt with in that way other honorable senators would have been enabled to express their&#39; opinions upton it - opinions either of a similar or of a different character. It would also have permitted the Minister concerned to reply to the statement. The_ point I am now raising is whether the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> comes within standing order 408, or any other standing order. I think it is necessary that I should take this point because/ when an honorable senator asks permission to make a statement, it is usual for honorable senators to at once grant that permission, assuming that the statement will be of a personal nature in regard to some action of the honorable senator which has been misconstrued. Standing order 408 was framed to protect honorable senators, and with only that object in view. It seems to me, therefore, that we ought to know whether the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> is to be regarded as a precedent, seeing that the matter with, which he dealt is one which might well have been brought for-  ward on the motion for the adjournment of the Senate. The statement was- in no sense of a personal character. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton,</inline> I am sure, will understand that 1 am raising this question only with a view to ascertaining what is the position for our future guidance. </para>

                    <para>- There is a good deal in the contention of the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> about the inconvenience arising from honorable senators making statements which are not of a personal character. But the Senate can always protect itself in cases of that kind, because it can refuse the required permission to make any statement. I understood that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> was going to indicate the nature of his statement, and that would have been the proper course for him to pursue, because honorable senators would then have been in a position to judge whether the requisite permission to make it should be granted. Ministers themselves frequently ask leave to make statements. The matter is always one entirely for the Senate to decide. But upon a strict interpretation of the standing order, I must say that the Minister for Defence is correct in the view which he has expressed. If standing order 408 be strictly interpreted, no statement that is not of a personal character can be made by an honorable senator. I did not think it was necessary for me to interrupt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> until he began to venture into the region of argument rather than of statement. However, as the point of order has been raised, I shall be more strict in my application of the standing order in the future. The Minister, I repeat, was entirely right in his contention. A strict interpretation of the standing order will limit statements by- honorable senators to matters of a personal nature, or to the business before the Senate. </para>

                    <para>. - There is no provision for the State Advisory Councils or for the directors of the Institute to appoint advisory committees on special subjects. Some provision of that nature should he made, and this appears to be the most convenient place for it. So far the Bill has dealt purely with the scaffolding, and we have done nothing towards the erection of the building itself. There is nothing before us to show the mind of the Ministry on the number of members to constitute the Advisory Councils, the length of time for which they should be appointed, or even what their duties are to be. The clause is delightfully vague, and its vagueness will probably destroy its usefulness. In the old land there are special committees working under the Advisory Councils, and dealing with such special subjects as food grains, jute cotton wool and other fibres, hides and tanning material,  gums  resins and essential oils, drugs tobacco and spices, oil, seeds, and timber and paper material. It is very necessary at this juncture in Australia to pay the closest attention to the fibre question. Australia uses a large quantity of jute for bags and other purposes, and it would be most opportune for the State Advisory Councils, in conjunction with the directors, to establish branch committees dealing with that and other subjects. A committee on fibres could deal with wood, rope or paper fibres, from the point of view of the extension of our trade. Another committee could do good work on the question of obtaining new tanning materials. A large quantity of shrubs growing around our coastline have been rejected as tanning materials because their juices contain a large quantity of dye which stains the leather red; but recent investigations have proved that the stain can be removed by very simple processes without destroying the tanning properties. For many years we have been using wattle bark. Recently we have even been importing it. But some such committee as I have suggested would find suitable work, and might have a large field open for investigation, with respect to the use of other products for tanning purposes. Only in this morning&#39;s paper I read that objection has been raised to Australian leather on the ground that it was largely tanned by wattle bark, and that it became very porous and so was considered to be inferior to certain other leather which also had been imported, and was, as an actual fact, Australian hide, but not tanned in Australia. Other countries have used our Australian hides, but not our system of tanning. We have materials in Australia with which we could accomplish the same result as is achieved elsewhere with regard to this important industry. </para>

                <para>My object in giving this specific instance is to make the Bill as perfect as possible while we are putting together the necessary machinery. I would like the Minister to say whether he can see his way clear, in connexion with the formation of advisory committees, to introduce a clause which would provide power to form committees upon special subjects. </para>

Wherever we can secure suitable men we shall have no hesitation in increasing the numbers on a council, if necessary, so as to include! them. It may not be requisite for each State to have the same numbers upon a council. &#39; In Tasmania, for example, five scientists might form a very suitable body, and might include practically the whole of the trained men available upon a specific subject. But in a large State, like New South Wales, where there are so many more primary and secondary industries, it might be well worth while for a council to consist of a dozen, and even more; members, thus embracing all the trained minds available in that State upon the subject at issue. </para>

                <para>The purpose of the Bill is really to create special committees for special work. This is establishing a job for specialists, and there is no need to clothe them with statutory powers or to hamper them with too close a definition. At present we are making experiments in one particular direction, and these are being carried on by merely two or three specialists. But, in investigating tick and prickly pear, it may be quite possible to have much larger committees, so as to cover work done in ! various districts upon different varieties of the pest. The different species of prickly &#39; pear are almost innumerable. </para>
                <para class="block">There are certain varieties that can be effectively dealt with to-day, but there may be seventy others concerning which it would be well worth while to appoint special branches of committees to do particular work. </para>

If a special committee is appointed, consisting of experts who for years have studied the subject of the prickly pear,  we  shall not permit them to wander over every subject  or  any phase of a subject. Their particular information and attainments will be concentrated upon the one especial task. Therefore, the powers under this Bill are almost unlimited. They are limited only  by  the amount of money which Parliament may vote for the carrying out of any specialized section of the work. </para>

But there is no schedule. Parliament itself should prescribe the fees which the directors are to receive for attendance at their meetings. Parliament determines the travelling expenses and fees to be drawn by the members of the Public Works and Public Accounts Committees, and surely Parliament could prescribe, in this Bill, the fees and travelling expenses of the scientific investigators. I am not speaking in a parsimonious spirit. I think it would be unwise to leave it to the Governor-General, or, in other words, the Government of the day, to say what each member of the Advisory Council in each State shall receive, and what amount of travelling expenses shall be allowed. 1 suggest that these amounts should be stated in, the measure itself. </para>

                        <para>. - Practically what the honorable senator suggests will be done, as the regulations governing the fees and travelling expenses must be laid on the table of the Senate. It is impossible .to state in this measure, what such amounts shall be. At present, we are investigating the tanning problem, and have favorable reports from Western Australia. If the directors ask a special committee to visit Western Australia in connexion with this matter, such committee might comprise one expert from Western Australia, and, possibly experts from Queensland, New South Wales, or Victoria. Obviously, it would not be fair to allow the representatives of Western Australia travelling expenses in anything like the same proportion as the amount allowed to experts from Queensland, or the other States. A similar difficulty will arise in a hundred and one other ways. Inquiries are at present being  made in the scientists&#39; spare time at the Melbourne University, and some of them are receiving no expenses at all, but are doing the work in the interests of science. These special committees, when appointed, will have to travel-, and, necessarily, they should be recompensed in accordance with the time involved and work done. As I have already indicated, the amount of travelling expenses and allowances will be determined by these circumstances, and a regulation governing the amounts to be allowed will be laid upon the table of the Senate, so that Parliament will have the right to criticise any amounts proposed to be paid to these committees. </para>

                    <para>. - I am still in want of information. I cannot see power in this or any other clause for the appointment of these special committees. In the latter part of the clause we are told that the functions of the State Advisory Councils will be to advise the directors with respect to the affairs of the Institute, and naturally I turn to subsequent clauses, and I find that clause 13, which deals with the powers and functions of the directors, contains no definite provision to enable these special committees to be appointed. I find also that once a year,, at least, the directors shall visit the State Advisory Councils, and I judge, therefore, that advice from these bodies will be tendered to the directors once a year. My fear is that the clause is not definite enough to make the operations of the Institute successful. We are at a very critical juncture in the affairs of Australia. We must pay special attention to the development of our primary industries, and we must bear in mind, also, that unless we can develop our manufacturing enterprises we shall be left behind in the race. For that reason I am anxious to see more definite provision made in this clause. The Minister tells us that the directors will have full power to do all these things, but this will be legislation by regulation, and not by Act of. Parliament. We are responsible for the moulding of this measure, and we should see to it that the functions of the various scientific bodies are clearly indicated. Otherwise we shall have an amending Bill almost before the. ink is dry on the measure now before us. </para>

                    <para>- That is so. As an illustration, I may say we have these Advisory Councils in operation already, but we are limited practically by a pledge to Parliament that the expenditure shall not exceed &#163;17,000 this year. The directors, I presume, would ascertain the amount available and the problems - which are unlimited - to be solved, and probably they would decide that it would be wiser to concentrate attention upon one particular problem than to spread a small amount of expenditure over several. For instance, in Victoria there is the problem of utilizing our vast resources in brown coal. This is of supreme importance to the industrial life of this State. If this brown coal could be profitably manufactured into briquettes, a magnificent future for the industries of Victoria would be opened up. In Western Australia, also, the development of the immense timber resources of that State might be considered. It is possible that the directors would request .a special committee in Victoria to concentrate upon this question of manufacturing brown coal briquettes. I would say that they should give their best attention to that problem. In the case of Western Australia, I would say that they should concentrate upon the problem of making the best use of the byproducts of forestry. I understand that, at the present time, nearly 33 per cent, of the timber cut in Western Australia goes absolutely to waste. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. These by-products of the timber industry are of great value, and we should make an effort to prevent this waste. In the case of Queensland, if only  a  limited sum is available, there are three obvious prob lems to be considered, namely, the prickly pear, the blow-fly, and the tick pest. I should say that the authorities of the Institute should concentrate themselves upon the vital problems first, and should not spread their inquiries over a hundred different questions. They will work in co-operation with the State Advisory Councils, and, when they receive the advice of those Councils, they can determine their action, and then draw up a campaign and appoint specialists to try to bring about practical results on practical lines. Under this Bill, the powers proposed in regard to scientific development are practically unlimited.. I think that .is advisable, because the man who would limit the inquiry of the scientist would be a fool. </para>

I know nothing whatever of the wasp referred to, beyond what has appeared in the press, but I hope that a similar success on other lines will be attained.

                <para class="block">It is my intention, if the amendment is carried, to move the insertion of the words &#34; Commonwealth Public Service Commissioner.&#34; We know that, during the last two or three years, the activities of the Commonwealth Government have been extended to something like twenty-three new Departments, which have been&#39; placed under the direct control of different </para>
                <para class="block">Ministers. I venture to say that it is a mistake to place all these new Departments under the direct control of Ministers. The measure we are now discussing is well intended, and the Department it proposes to create should do good work in Australia. In my view, such a Department should have been established long ago, but I am afraid that, under clause 15 of this Bill, there may be some danger of political patronage and political influence. Many years ago, this Parliament, in its wisdom, passed the Public Service Act, thereby placing all Departments of the State under the control of the Public Service Commissioner. I, personally, hold the opinion that the Commonwealth Public Service Commissioner has too much power. He holds in the hollow of his hand the destinies of thousands of Commonwealth public servants. I do not think he should possess this power; but, as that is the law, it is in my opinion, wrong to place in the hands of a Minister the power to appoint persons to such positions as those we are now considering, or to positions in connexion with any of the new activities undertaken by the Commonwealth Government. It may be in order to mention some of the commercial activities recently undertaken by the Government. They include the Commonwealth Railway Department, Northern Territory Administration, Commonwealth Line of Steamers, Central Wool Committee, Commonwealth Shipping Board, Ship Construction Branch, Australian Metal Exchange, Central Coal Board, Munitions Directorate, Bureau of Commerce and Industry, Institute of Science and Industry, Commonwealth Winter Butter Pool, Commonwealth Film. Censorship Board, Australian Wheat Board, Wheat Storage Commission, Price-fixing Branch, Leather Industry Board, Flax Committee, Sulphate of Ammonia Board, Commonwealth Serum Institute, and Repatriation Department. The Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> is aware that I have supported this Bill throughout, but I do object to place in the &#39;hands of a Minister the power to appoint the members of these various bodies, because I see in that provision a danger of the operation of political influence. I do not say or suggest that in connexion with any of the Boards to which 1 have referred any -df the members have been appointed as the result of political patronage; but I say that under the policy which has been adopted, the door has been left open for the. appointment of members to those Boards as the result of political influence. That, without labouring the question further, is the reason why I submit my amendment. </para>

                    <para>. -  I think that the amendment submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> should be accepted by the Minister in charge of the Bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell),</inline> , because, presumably, the Institute of Science and Industry would be a permanent Department. I feel very sure that it is certain to be housed in a magnificent suite of offices in Melbourne. We shall never find the Directorate of the Institute going into the prickly-pear country of Queensland. Appointments to this new Department will be keenly sought by persons inside and outside the&#39; Public Service. Under the clause as it stands, the Minister will no doubt have to meet innumerable deputations of persons wishing to urge upon him the claims of certain gentlemen for these positions. I do not say .that the Minister would not be likely in most cases to make these appointments as well as the Public Service Commissioner could make them, but I do not think that it is work which the Minister should be called upon to do. The Public Service Commissioner has been specially appointed to deal with applications for positions of this description. In these times, when a number of people are exceedingly anxious to economize in every direction, if these appointments are to be withdrawn from the Public Service Commissioner, it will be held that there will be justification for abolishing the offices of the Public Service Commissioner and his deputies, and leaving the appointment of all public servants in the hands of Ministers. So far, no reason has been given for the proposal to leave these appointments to the discretion of the Minister. The amendment is worthy of consideration,, as, if passed, it would relieve the Minister of a good deal of annoyance, and give greater satisfaction to the public generally than will the provision contained in the clause as it stands. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not intend to support the amendment, because while the Public Service Act contains the very objectionable, and, to me, repugnant provision governing the employment of temporary assistance. I should far rather see appointments to positions in the Public Service in the hands of Ministers than in the hands of the Public Service Commissioner. I have no doubt that a great deal of temporary assistance will be required in carrying on the work of the Institute of Science and Industry, and, in my view, it is objectionable and unwise that men should be appointed to certain positions for six months, with a three months&#39; extension, and when they have become familiar with the work, and of use to the Institute, should have to get out to allow some other person to get in. If that provision were excised from our Public Service Act, I would support the contention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham.</inline> But while it remains operative I will not place in the hands of the Public Service Commissioner ?mandatory power to compel a temporary employee, the moment he has become of use to this country, to forgo his employment. I have always been opposed to that provision, and I always will be. </para>

But the position of persons appointed under this Bill will be entirely different from that of officers appointed under our Public Service Act. Under this Bill specialists  will do the real work of the Institute, and they will do that work wherever their researches require it to be done. The clerical staff of the Institute will probably consist of only one or two typists. Let us suppose that in connexion with an investigation into any .particular industry it is necessary to engage the services of  scientists for, say, six or twelve months. If the power of appointing them were vested in the Public Service Commissioner he would be bound to select scientists from &#34;within the Public Service itself. If he wished bo- go outside of it, it would be necessary for him to certify that there was no officer within the Service capable of doing the work required of him. Under this Bill practically the whole of the employees will have appointments of a temporary character. </para>

It may be that there will be ordinary work attached to camp and field work; but, as a rule, the men employed in these investigations will be chemists and analysts - professional men. Where ordinary clerical work has had to be performed, it has been usual to appoint men from within the Public Service. For instance, the secretary  of  the Institute is a public servant, and the typists are public servants. Then, the secretary of the Wool Pool was formerely an officer in my own Department. He has proved a wonderful success in his new sphere. </para>

                    <para>.- In his desire to prevent the Minister having the power to make these appointments, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> has argued rather against himself. T know that he is in favour of the Bill, and that he desires to get the best results from it; but with that end in view, he could not adopt a more unwise course than to seek to make the appointment of these officers subject to our Public Service Act. What qualification has the Public Service Commissioner to choose a scientist? </para>

                        <para>- The Minister will be very much more in touch . with it than will the Public Service Commissioner. The latter is merely a specialist in the matter of making appointments to the Public Service. The Minister will be in actual, touch with the work of the Institute, and will have a much freer hand. If the honorable senator wishes to kill the measure, he cannot devise a more effective method of achieving that object than by making the appointment of the scientists, whose services will be required under this Bill, subject to our Public Service Act. I know that there is nothing more hampering to our Public Service than our Public Service regulations. The effect of their operation is to squeeze all merit and special ability out of our public servants. I shall vote against men who possess special abilities being brought within the scope of those regulations. It might suit <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> to see the Bill killed. </para>

In other words, the Minister will seek for the man who can efficiently fill the office, whereas the Public Service Commissioner would seek for an office in which to place the man. In my judgment, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham&#39;s</inline> amendment, by taking the power of appointment from the Minister, and vesting it in the Public Service Commissioner, would weaken rather than strengthen the measure. </para>

                    <para>.  - I desire to take the opportunity to express my deep regret that  the Government  have laid themselves  out  to severely tax that section of the community which is least able to bear additional taxation. This measure is to tax the amusements of the people, and, particularly, those of the younger folk. The Government have taken this action without  first  exploiting existing sources of taxation to their legitimate ends, and without endeavouring to place additional responsibilities upon  the  shoulders  of those best able to bear them. The untold wealth of this country is, apparently, to be left free of any additional imposts, so far as profits made out of the war are concerned. But the children are to be called on to pay more than their share. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> may say that it is intended to mitigate the severity of the measure by freeing Saturday matinees of this levy, so far as concerns children apparently under twelve. But is there one child of such tender years who goes to a picture show unaccompanied by an elder? Members of the family will still be taxed. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Why the Government should have adopted this method of taxation is quite apparent. It is the fact that they were created for the one purpose of winning the war. I am very happy to say that the war is nearly won. </para>

                        <para>- When I listen to the cheers of honorable members opposite I can only say that if I belonged ,to a party which, eighteen months ago, said its Government had  been  elected to win the war, and I found that the most effective way in which that Government had gone about winning the war was to tax the poorest section in our midst, I would be too much ashamed to cheer. The imposition of this tax will stand out .as one of the things which the Government did to win the war. They taxed the amusements of the working classes of this country. Let honorable senators cheer. This is all they have to cheer about. . This is all I can see that their party has done to win the war. </para>

                <para>This Bill displays the Government and their supporters in their true light. It is the work of a Government which, up till the last moment, avoided, taxing the rich interests of the community; which, as far as possible, avoided doing what they should have done straightway, to prevent the rich interests from exploiting the working classes. It is this same Government who now are readily, and almost hastily, passing a measure to collect pennies from the children. I congratulate the Government on the only thing I can see that they have done to win the war. I congratulate, also, the supporters of the Government. This measure reaches the high-water mark of- their ability to grapple with problems concerning the war. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt the honorable senator and his party feel- that they have Hone so, but there are a good many people who will doubt what that party&#39;s efforts have amounted to, in the direction indicated. This measure is something that the people can see and will feel. It will simply mean that two or three children in a family, who have been in the habit of visiting a picture show, or some such place of amusement, now and again, will be deprived of that pleasure. And all because a National Win-the-war Government had not the courage to tax the people who possess the wealth, for the reason that they are the people who have the power. It is easy to tax the poor. The wealthy people insist that taxation shall be placed with the .people who&#62; cannot resist it - the people who can least afford it. </para>

                        <para>- I am delighted to hear that the Government have collected even that much out of it. But what about the bachelor tax? How much have the Government collected by means of that? This Bill to grab the children&#39;s pennies is to be rushed through by the same Government who were to have insisted on the bachelors paying their tax. But the Government found that that was a different proposition, and that it was a great deal safer and wiser to throw that impost overboard, and collect the children&#39;s pennies. The Government had the authority to collect the bachelor&#39;s tax; and it was the Government&#39;s duty to do so. But it was realized that that would be dangerous. Bachelors have votes, and wealthy bachelors would have to pay a lot of money. Therefore, the wealthy bachelor gotto work, and this cowardly Government held their hands. Then they looked around for some other source of taxation which would be less dangerous to their interests. It is the old method of national parties since ever they have been governing this country, and it matters not under what name they have worked, the method has always been the same, namely, to enable the wealthy people really controlling the power to avoid their fair share of taxation, and to place the burden on the shoulders least able to bear it. </para>

                    Largie. I enter my protest against a system of taxation which is unworthy of a National Government. In time of war, . or even in time of peace, there are certain forms of taxation which can well be introduced and exploited, and which will not bear harshly on any section of the community. The Government could have stood by income and land taxation. The land tax offers to any Government the fairest form of taxation possible. Yet, with such an avenue for securing money, which is practically untouched, so far as interests below an annual value of &#163;5,000 are concerned, we see the Government hastening after the children and their pennies. If the Government were to take unimproved land values - values created by the energies and by the needs of the people they would find an avenue of taxation which would provide ample funds to meet many of the needs of government at the present time. But it is preferred that the little boys and girls should be taxed. They can afford to pay taxation, and so save the great National party !

                <para>If the cost of living had been kept within reasonable bounds, it might have been said with reason that the people were living under the same conditions as in pre-war times. But every one knows that the profiteer and the exploiter have not felt the war in any real sense, because their businesses have grown as the needs of the community have become more and more pressing. Luxuries of life are altogether beyond the reach of the humbler classes to-day. Speaking for New South Wales, I can say the people there are paying more for their meat than are the people of Queensland, under a Labour Government. </para>

                        <para>- I hope I may be allowed, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> to mention these facts as an illustration for my argument against the taxation of the children of the poorer classes, instead of taxing the wealthier people of this country. I can quite understand that the range of the debate is extending; but, at the same time, these are the facts. It is true that in only one State of the Commonwealth have any steps been taken to protect the interests of the people in this direction. </para>

                    <para>. - We are now in the last lap, and  1  desire to say a few final words. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> said that we were raising a plaintive cry on behalf of the children, but he himself inserted a concession intended specifically for the children. I rose, however, to reply to some statements made the other day by the Minister in answer to my assertion that this tax, on a percentage basis, would operate unfairly. What I said was that, while people who paid 10s. for entrance to a race-course would be called upon to pay 10s. 10d., on the basis of this Bill children paying 10s. for admission to picture theatres, would pay a tax of. 3s. 4d. ; and, in view of these facts, I urge that this is not the fairest method of taxation. The Minister also said that a . certain amount of revenue had been lost owing to the curtailment of racing, and I tried to point out that there was now more racing than ever. I find I was perfectly correct, and that, although there has been a falling off in revenue from this source, there has not been any real curtailment of racing at all. You have only to go 40 miles outside of Sydney or Melbourne to prove this statement. On one occasion recently there were five train loads of passengers from Sydney and three from Newcastle to a certain race meeting, and instead of forty-five bookmakers on the course, there were no less than ninety-six. I hope that when the war is over the Government will take early steps to repeal this obnoxious legislation, which places the burden on the poorer classes. I- would feel ashamed to belong to any party that indorsed this proposal to tax a 3d. entertainment ticket. I suppose I will be out of order, but I would like to say that if the Federal Government would only pay their valuers a fair wage, they would get twice as much revenue from the land-owners in this country as they get to-day. The State valuers of New South Wales and the City Council valuers receive &#163;200 and &#163;300 a year more than is ,paid to the Federal valuers, and under these conditions good work cannot be expected from the latter, and revenue is lost. </para>

                    <para>. -  When the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> submitted the request which the other place has agreed to, he said Unit Saturday was a children&#39;s day, and there was a suggestion from this side that the Government should also include public holidays. It is quite true that on Saturday there is no school, but this miserable concession, which has been wrenched from the Government, should be extended as I have indicated. It is well known that, on public holidays, the father of a family, as a rule, takes his wife and children out for the day, and, therefore, the same concessions should be available to them as on a Saturday afternoon. </para>

I know it is quite a correct thing for the National Government, from their view-point, to place taxation on the shoulders of those least able to bear it. I fully expected them to do that. Unless I am very much mistaken, Ave shall have further taxation in the same direction in the <inline font-style="italic">very</inline> near future. </para>

This method of taxation is a mean, shabby, and contemptible way of getting money. It is only paralleled by the State of Tasmania, where visitors are taxed 2s. per head at Launceston before they can get in or get out. </para>

                        <para>- It is, perhaps, futile to expect the Government to drop this proposal and &#62; bring down a measure of taxation which will reach the wealthy people of the country, but I appeal to them; even at this late stage, to abandon this miserable Bill, and look in other directions for revenue from taxation. I should like to know why in August last year the duty then existing on imported picture films was reduced. Was it in order that the wealthy importers of these films should escape taxation, and is this proposed entertainment tax intended to make up the deficiency in the revenue caused by the removal of that duty ? If that is the case, it is not to the credit of the Government. I hope that they will abandon this proposal, and will impose taxation upon those who can well afford to pay it, and not upon the poor children of the country. </para>

For instance, he has made an impassioned appeal this afternoon for the little children. A similar appeal was made by his supporters, and it was met by the invitation to honorable senators opposite &#34; to walk down Bourke-street any afternoon, stand opposite one of the picture theatres and count the number of children coming out of it. They would find that the number attending any one performance might be counted on the fingers of a hand, but, if they went inside, they  Would  find that there were hundreds of other persons present. </para>

                    if he needs it, though I do nob think he does, that we are taxing the wealthy of this country. Practically the whole cost of the war, so far as it is being borne out of revenue, is being borne by the wealthy people of this country. There is probably no other country in the world where taxation due to the war is being borne in the same proportion bv the .wealthy as it is in this country. Practically none of the war taxation introduced by the Government since the beginning of the war has been imposed upon those who may be called&#39; the working classes. If
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline>
                    will analyze the returns of the income tax, he will find that an enormous proportion of the revenue derived from that tax is paid  by  what are called in Australia the wealthy classes. As regards the taxation proposed  by  the Government this year, the war-profits tax which the honorable senator spoke of with such scorn is expected to contribute &#163; 1,S00,000 to the revenue this year. This revenue will be derived from excess war profits. Seventy-five per cent, of &#34;the excess war profits will be paid into the revenue  by  those who have made profits in excess of what they made prior to the war.

                        <para>- The cost of living varies in different parts of Australia, but I have been speaking of Australia as a whole. The last returns issued by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> show that the greatest increase in <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> cost of living in the last quarter took place in Queensland. The cost of living has not increased at the same rate in Australia generally. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> is careful to point out that in other States the cost of living .has not shown the same increase as in Queensland. Prices have been regulated by the Commonwealth Government, and it is for this reason that the cost of living is lower in Australia than in any of the other countries engaged in the war on either side. </para>

                <para>The facts are, first of all, that we are taxing the wealthy classes of the country, and the greater proportion of the revenue charged to the war is being contributed by them. In the next place, as regards the consumers, the cost of living in Australia is cheaper than in any other country engaged in the war. In view of these facts, what becomes of the harangue we have had from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> this afternoon, and which was merely a repetition of speeches we had from other honorable senators on the opposite side last week? I invite <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> when he next retires - I do not know where the honorable senator goes to during his disappearances - to take with him a volume of the statistics of Australia and of other parts of the world, and when he again visits us in this chamber he will not be likely to m&#39;ake such a speech as that which we had from him this afternoon. </para>

                <para class="block">The reason for this motion is that, as honorable senators are aware, the greater part of the legislation proposed for the present sittings of this session must necessarily be introduced in another place, as the greater number of the Bills to be introduced are money Bills. Many have already been introduced, and there is at present some congestion of business in another place. We hope that &#39; next week we shall have some Bills coming up to the Senate from another place. The Senate has dealt very expeditiously with the business that has come before it so far. There has been no delay here, and we have had before us some very important business. With the exception of the Electoral Bill, which largely affects the voting for honorable members in another place, the chief Bills to be dealt with are financial Bills, and, necessarily , these measures are introduced there. I ask the Senate to meet for an additional day next week in order that we may be able to deal with any Bills that come forward, and that all the Government measures may be disposed of before the Christmas adjournment. </para>

                    <para>.- I ask the Minister for Defence not to press his motion. The Senate has in the most expeditious way assisted the Government in the transaction of their business since they have held office. There has never been any delay on any occasion in the Senate, and there is no reason to anticipate that there will be any delay here in dealing with business. It is most inconvenient for honorable senators to be called back here a day earlier than usual in the week when no notice of the proposal has been given. I can give an instance of the way in which it affects honorable senators from New South Wales. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant,</inline> after consulting with me, made an arrangement that we should attend a function in the form of a send-off to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Con.</inline> Wallace, a member of the House of Representatives, who is going away with reinforcements. If we are to be called back here on Tuesday next we shall be prevented from attending that function. I recognise that our parliamentary duties are of more importance than are these functions, and if there were any urgency for calling us back here on the Tuesday I should raise no protest. I believe there is no urgency, and to call us back on Tuesday will not put our business any further ahead. </para>

To have such a taunt thrown across the chamber at me is just what I would expect from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henderson.</inline> Honorable senators are suddenly called upon to come here a day earlier than usual next week, notwithstanding that we are now asked to close up for two days this week because there is no business for us to transact. The Minister for Defence has assigned no valid reason for the course which he has proposed. Are we to meet on Tuesday next to close up on Wednesday of that week ? Will our meeting on Tuesday put us any further forward on the following Friday if we are forced to assemble a. day earlier - than usual by the Government? Are the resources of the Government so limited that Ministers expect to gain time by calling upon us to meet here at 3 o&#39;clock on Tuesday next, instead of 3 o&#39;clock on Wednesday next? If, at the caprice of the Minister, the sittings to which honorable senators are accustomed are to be changed without any valid reason being assigned for the adoption of that course, I fear that the harmony which has hitherto characterized the conduct of business &#176; in this Chamber may give place to resistance on the part of some honorable members of the .Opposition. Is there any pressing business to be brought forward which will warrant our meeting on Tuesday next instead of Wednesday? Has the Minister any assurance that Bills now occupying the attention of the other branch of the Legislature will be ready for our consideration ? I would not complain if we were asked to sit six days a week, so long as I knew before leaving Sydney that we were going to sit six days, because I would then be in a position to make my arrangements.

It may he that the Government think they can &#34; gerrymander &#34; that election by hurriedly passing an Electoral Bill through Parliament. Let me tell them that they can do nothing of the kind. To my mind, it would be quite an outrage on the practice and on the constitution of Parliament, to have members- sitting in this Parliament tinder different electoral laws - to have one representative elected under one electoral law and another representative elected under a different electoral law. The Government should pause before they attempt, for party ends, to rush an Electoral Bill through Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- Most certainly. As soon as the Electoral Bill has been passed, we should go to the country.  What can be more reasonable ? What sort of a mixed Parliament shall we have if some members of it are elected under one Electoral Act and others under a different Electoral Act? In such, circumstances, we may have <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Corboy</inline> sitting in the Commonwealth Parliament as the representative of a minority, and another man. taking his seat under an Electoral Act which precludes the possibility of the representative of a minority being elected. If the Government are speeding up the work of Parliament with that end in view, their action will recoil on their own heads. Parliament will not sanction it; and the Government will be making haste slowly if they say, &#34; Because we have met and put our heads together in Caucus, and because a majority of the Caucus has said that we can get this Bill through in time to make it apply to an impending election if the Senate meets on Tuesday instead of Wednesday next week- &#34; </para>

                        <para>- It is the journal&#39; which gives my honorable friends opposite instructions as to how they shall act. In the election for Swan the Government found their nominee only third on the poll. This National Government, after their splendid exploit in winning the war, actually found that their National candidate was able to secure only third place on the poll. That result may be repeated in Victoria, and to avoid it, the Government wish to rush an Electoral Bill through Parliament. With this end in view, they desire the Senate to meet on Tuesday, instead of Wednesday next. I want Ministers to understand that they will not expedite matters in that way. </para>

                        <para>- I have not said anything of the kind. Even the Minister must recognise that up to date we have not obstructed the Government in any way whatever. If we are to blame at all, it is that we have allowed Ministerial measures to pass the Senate without devoting to them that consideration which perhaps should have been devoted to them. In other words, we have afforded the Government every opportunity to give effect to their policy of winning the war. But if Ministers think that such consideration justifies them, without consulting the reasonable wishes of honorable senators, in submitting a motion . of this character, they are very much mistaken. Apparently they believe that they can treat us as so many puppets. Some of us have travelled 500 miles in order to attend to-day&#39;s sitting of three hours. We shall have to travel another 500 miles to attend here on Tuesday next. If there be any legislative proposal of an urgent character demanding our consideration, by all means let us sit to-morrow and on Friday to deal with it. If the Minister believes that there is a possibility of business reaching the Senate in time to warrant us in meeting on Tuesday  next, he has not shown it. Indeed, anybody who takes a reasonable view of what is occurring elsewhere must conclude that there is no such possibility. Ministers are merely pretending to be in a hurry - pretending, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie put it, to do some work. </para>

                        <para>- I recognise that the conduct of business in this Chamber must conform to the progress that is made in another place. But I object to the Government Whip saying that we require to show that we are anxious to do work when we are being asked to adjourn over two ordinary sitting days and to meet a day earlier than usual next week. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie objects to my saying that this is &#34; pretending to do work.&#34; I say that it is nothing but the shallowest of pretences - the facts are too plain. I am strongly opposed to the Senate making a move in the direction indicated when everybody knows that it is merely a pretence. We shall accomplish nothing by meeting on Tuesday instead of Wednesday next week. If there be any real hurry, the Government can meet the situation by allowing the Senate to sit to-morrow and on Friday. Members of the Opposition have not delayed the Government for a single hour since the latter came into office, and it is treating us with scant courtesy to suddenly spring upon us a motion to increase the number of our ordinary sitting days. If the business which Ministers desire us to transact is of a pressing character, and if it is honest business, let them say what it is. But if they attempt to rush through Parliament a measure to affect an impending election, the &#34;public will understand precisely what they are doing. The public are honest, no matter what their representatives may be. No Government whose members have rushed a measure through Parliament with a view to benefiting themselves have ever been able to avert defeat immediately they went to the polls. The public have always resented their action in the most emphatic manner. </para>

                        <para>- The credit of this Parliament is of more importance to me than party victories, and it should be more important to every honorable senator. The fact that we would gain by allowing the Government to go their own wrong way, if the experience of the past is repeated, would not justify us in refusing to warn them. If they go their own wrong way after they have been forewarned, their blood is on their own head. We shall not be responsible for it, and our hands will be clean, because we are telling them that if  they  think they can stampede legislation through Parliament with a view to assisting them in electioneering matters, they are making a grave mistake so far as the outside electors are concerned. It may be that that is not the important business that Ministers will bring up next week. The Victorian by-election may be a mere myth that I am introducing. I hope the Minister, when he replies, will give us the assurance that no attempt will be made to push through a special Bill to deal with a by-election in one State. If the Government do attempt it, it will be a scandalous thing. I trust that my mention of it will give the Minister an opportunity to inform the Senate and the country immediately that my suspicions are groundless. I shall be very pleased if they are. If the Minister thinks he will gain time by calling the Senate together a day sooner for the purpose I have foreshadowed, I assure him that practices of that kind will be resisted. </para>

                    <para>. - The motion is very unusual. I have no recollection of anything like it at this period of a session in my twelve years&#39; experience. If the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> had been honest in telling the Senate the reason for the proposed meeting next Tuesday, I might have supported the motion. I would not mind if the Government called us together on Saturday, or even on Sunday, to deal with business of real importance to the country, but it is a well-known fact that, in another place, the guillotine is at work on ascertain Bill, and will drop at a certain hour. It is because of that fact that this motion has been moved. </para>

                        <para>- I am not bothering much about my head, or the honorable senator&#39;s. I am referring distinctly to the Commonwealth Electoral Bill. I pointed out by interjection that the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> has called the tune, and the Government are now dancing to it. That newspaper  this  morning Published a leaderette demanding not only the hurried&#34; passage of the Bill in question, but the introduction of a special Bill to provide for preferential voting, so that the Corangamite seat might be retained by the National Government. If the result of the Swan by-election, under the old law, had been the return of the nominee of  the National Government - the party hack - we should not have been asked to meet next Tuesday, because there would have been no need to hurry the Electoral Bill through. Its urgency has only been discovered because of the awful thing that has happened in Western Australia. That great State, which voted on two occasions for conscription, and rejected all Labour candidates at the last election, has now returned an Official Labour candidate to sit for Swan. . </para>

                        <para>- I was quoting the name given to the party by the press. The Swan electorate has returned a member of the Australian Labour party to the National Parliament. Because the Government&#39;s nominee was defeated there in the absence of preferential voting, the Government demand that the Electoral Bill shall be put through so that Corangamite may not fall into the hands of the same party. That is the position, and it is as well that the people should know it. It is a well-known fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hedges,</inline> who was third on the poll for the Swan election, was the direct nominee, not only of the National Government, but of the National&#39; Labour party. The National Labour party of Western Australia called for nominations, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas,</inline> ex-member for Bunbury, was announced as a candidate. When they saw that the National Government had selected <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hedges-</inline></para>

                    <para>.- I express no opinion as to the object animating the Ministry in presenting this motion to call the Senate together a day earlier than usual. I hope there is no foundation for the suggestion of Senators Gardiner and Needham, that the real motive actuating the Government is the desire to pass the Electoral Bill through quickly for certain specific reasons. But in proposing to call the Senate together on Tuesday for whatever special business he has in his mind, the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has probably overlooked the very great disadvantage at which he .must necessarily place the representatives  of  Tasmania. There are no available means for them to leave Tasmania until Tuesday, and it will, therefore, be quite impossible for them to reach Melbourne until Wednesday morning. Senators who are anxious to go to their homes in that State must be absent from Tuesday&#39;s sitting, or they must remain here over the week-end. Unless the proposals which the Government have to bring before the Senate are exceedingly important, and they may be, for. all we know, the Minister ought to show some consideration to Tasmanian senators. I .am sure the Minister has moved the motion without thinking of the difficulties and inconveniences that it will cause us. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> that if the business was so urgent as to necessitate the Senate meeting a day earlier than customary, all honorable senators, including those from Tasmania, would willingly put up with the inconvenience in the interests of the country; but unless urgent reasons  do  exist, I ask the Minister to show us some little consideration by withdrawing the motion and reverting to the ordinary sitting days. </para>

                    <para>. - I wish, also,-  to  enter  my  protest against the proposal to  meet on  Tuesday. Nobody can throw at  me the insinuation  that I am not here  to do my  duty. In these very busy times,  it is impossible to get travelling accommodation from Sydney at short notice. Since I heard of this arrangement, I have been in communication with Sydney, and find that we cannot get accommodation to leave Sydney on Monday night so as to be back here by Tuesday. Probably we shall have to stay in Melbourne. That is unfair and unjust to us. It is punishing honorable senators &#34;who are always here to do their work, and it will not forward in any way the business of the Government. I am confident that when these facts are placed before the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. &#34;Watt),</inline> and he sees that the motion not only inconveniences members of the Senate, but does them an injustice, he will reconsider the decision which was arrived at, I suppose, in Cabinet this morning. I am not saying that there is any ulterior motive behind the proposal. I do not know what the urgency is, but, if there is urgency, notice should be given, so that we may have plenty of time to make arrangements. If the Minister wants the financial measures put through before the end of the session, let him give us notice now that Tuesday sittings will be necessary, beginning with the week after next. I protest against the alteration being made without letting honorable senators know anything about it until the eleventh hour, thus disarranging whatever plans they have made, in the belief that ample notice would be given to them of any change in the days of meeting. </para>

I thought  that, perhaps, I was wrong in the interjection which I made to the honorable senator; but, after hearing his speech, and particularly his concluding remarks, I felt perfectly satisfied that I was not wrong at all, and that, therefore, he is most uncharitable in the position he has taken up, seeing that there are members of the -Senate who are not placed in the same easy circumstances as himself, and that the sooner we close the session the better it will be for those who are under greater disadvantages than he is. The honorable senator ought to assist in securing the cessation of our work at the earliest possible moment. </para>

                    <para>.  - I am one of those honorable senators who will be inconvenienced by the Senate meeting on Tuesday next. I do not return to Tasmania every week-end; but I had arranged to attend a function in Hobart on Monday next. I shall not be able to do so now, however. I had intended to leave Melbourne on Friday, reaching Hobart on Saturday night, and departing again on Tuesday morning. Our duty is to be present in the Senate when there is business to be done; and- in that light I would not object to the proposal of the Minister. But he should have told us exactly what is the nature of the business which the Senate is to be- asked .to conduct on Tuesday next. If the Government wish to  push  the Electoral Bill through within a certain time, it would be proper for the Minister to inform us of the fact. I trust he .will do so in the course of his reply. Probably, the Government desire to get that Bill passed as speedily as possible; and, seeing that they have the numbers, there would be nothing lost if the Minister were frank, and informed the Senate and the country that that is the reason for asking honorable senators to meet on Tuesday next. </para>

Practically, we shall have only about sixteen actual sitting days after re-assembling - if we are to adjourn in time to allow honorable senators to return to their distant homes.

                    <para>. - I ask the Minister in control of the Wheat Pool <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> whether it is a fact that the steam-ships purchased by the Labour Government in 1916 have already been paid for, and, if it is true, that they have been paid for chiefly out of the earnings of the farmers - the Government charging them more than 4s. per bushel freight on wheat from Australia to Great Britain, whereas, in prewar times, it was less than1s. ? Previously, private ships carried wheat, in some cases, at the rate of 6&#189;d., and in others at 10&#189;d., per bushel. I am naturally pleased that the ships purchased by the Government have already paid for themselves; but I am very much disposed to think that the primary producers have been called upon during these years of war, owing to the drastic action of&#39; the National Government in enormously increasing freights, to pay more than &#163;2,000,000 for those ships. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> has said that the actual cost has been paid, and that there is &#163;15,000 in hand. Will the Government consider the fact that, the ships having been paid for, 4s. and more is now being charged to carry the farmers&#39; wheat to Great Britain? A reduction of 2s. in freight would enable the farmer to get 6s. 9d. per bushel instead of 4s. 9d. for his wheat. This is a perfectly reasonable request, and if the Government would do something in this direction they would really be helping the farmers. </para>

                <para>There are one or two other matters to which I should like to refer. I have noticed in the press of late that the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jensen)</inline> ceased to perform the duties of his office because of some statements that were made on information given to a certain  Committee. I should like to know who comprised this Committee which has interfered with the duties of a Cabinet Minister, and who are responsible for statements that have resulted in the removal of a Cabinet Minister, responsible to Parliament, from his office. &#39;If I understand our parliamentary system at all, the Ministry are the Executive Committee of Parliament, and responsible only to Parliament, and if any suspicion attaches to the administration of any Minister he should immediately refrain from exercising the functions of his office. But this Committee, I understand, does not represent the Government at all. and I hope the Government will take into consideration the effect of these inroads into our parliamentary system. Does the Committee represent the voice of the National party? By whom was it appointed ? What would be said if the executive of the Labour party appointed such a Committee, and brought about the suspension of a Labour Minister in this way ? I venture to say it would be regarded as such an outrage on parliamentary government that it would be head-lined in the press right throughout Australia. This Committee was not appointed by this Parliament. If it was, I knew nothing about it. It was not even a Royal Commission appointed in the ordinary way by the Government. Was it appointed at the instance of the big business interests ? The Government and their supporters are sitting down complacently, and saying, &#34;Yes&#34; to what, the big business interests  of this country have decided, even to the suspension of a Minister of the Crown, responsible to Parliament. The Minister, it seems, has lost the confidence of his colleagues and is no longer administering his Department &#34;-it. I say that immediately any suspi ion arose he should have immediately resigned his office. There can be no other course under parliamentary government as I know it, and if we are to maintain the high standards that have obtained hitherto. Ministers hold their various offices by virtue of the confidence reposed in them by Parliament, and not at the will of some Committee. Who comprised this Committee? If &#39; I were to ask any two senators on the Ministerial side they could not give me the names. Most likely it was a Departmental Committee, appointed as the result of Cabinet deliberations and recommendations by a Minister to have an investigation into certain business arrangements. I can quite understand the necessity for this course because, owing to the business incapacity of the Government, they are unable to manage the affairs of the country satisfactorily, and look for some way out of a difficulty. </para>

I understand this Win-the-war Government, who were elected to Parliament on a definite policy, have now decided to recognise Tattersalls sweeps by collecting 10 per cent, of the winnings. </para>

                        <para>- I understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap&#39;s</inline> attitude. He is a sup porter of a Government which refuses to send letters through the post addressed to Tattersalls, but is prepared to take a percentage of the winnings. However, I do not wish to be drawn off the track. It seems that the Act under which this money is being collected is made retrospective, and quite a number of people who have won small amounts within the past year or two are nOw being called upon to pay a percentage of their winnings. I should like to know from the Minister, as early as possible, just how far back the retrospective action of this legislation goes. If it is to go back to 1914, when the war began, it will certainly inflict a hardship upon men who, a few years ago, won small amounts in Tattersalls sweeps. </para>

                        <para>- I agree with the honorable senator. Retrospective legislation is bad in principle, and should never have been agreed to. Complaints have been made lately, particularly by those who have had small winnings in Tattersalls, that they are being called upon to pay a percentage on their winnings. They do not know whether it is legal or not, or why the collection is being made. One man told me that it is two years ago since he has had a win in Tattersalls, and yet he had received a notice to pay. I said to him that he was lucky to have had a win, but he told me that he was no better off, as he had spent the money, and now he had to pay the tax. I am anxious that the fullest publicity should be given to this aspect of the question, so that people will know whether they can be called upon to pay or not. </para>

                        <para>- If that were so, it should be operative for only one year. There can be no mistake about the fact that back money has been called up in this way, and when I was asked about it, I was unable to explain the reason. I dare say the Minister himself could not offer a satisfactory explanation, and say definitely how far back the Act is operative. 1 do not want to complain, but it seems strange that while the Government will not allow their post-offices to be used for the delivery of letters to Tattersalls, they are ready to participate in the profits by taking a share of an investor&#39;s winnings. The collection, I believe, is being made illegally, and it should he stopped. In my opinion also, the Postal Department should deliver all letters to the addressees. If the postage is paid, the Government should not inquire into the nature, of the business, particularly if, afterwards, they participate in the profits of a sweep. </para>

I cannot - see why the Government should bring us back next Tuesday unless it be to get the Electoral Bill through, so that its provisions may be applied to the Corangamite election.- I have said that the guillotine has been started in another place, and it will drop at 3 o&#39;clock next Friday afternoon in that chamber. It is because this has been done, and there has been a Cabinet meeting at which this was determined upon that we are being called Back next Tuesday. Honorable members in another place carried the guillotine proposal some weeks ago, and it is significant that the first measure to which it is to be applied is the Electoral Bill. The man who runs may read the significance of this. This is why I say that it is because of party action, and to gain a party victory at a by-election, we are being called together next Tuesday. </para>

                    <para>. - There is a grievance which I -desire to bring under the notice of the Government. If we were meeting to-morrow, I might not refer to the matter now; but I consider it of great urgency, and this is the only opportunity that I have of ventilating it, and I would rather wait till the Minister for Repatriation is present. It will be within the recollection of honorable senators that on numerous occasions when the Repatriation Bill was under consideration I championed the. Fruit and Vegetable Fund for Fighters&#39; Families, established in Sydney. It is now proposed by the Repatriation Board in New South Wales that this Fund shall be deliberately closed up. I make an appeal to the Government, now that the war has almost ended, to let the Fund continue, as it has done for some considerable time, to assist distressed wives and children of soldiers at the Front. This Fund was  started by a gentleman who has a home in the Blue Mountains. He grew a lot of fruit and vegetables, which he could not use himself, and he brought the surplus to Sydney, and distributed it from his place of business. The demand for the goods became so large that he appealed to his neighbours settled in the Blue Mountains to assist him by supplying fruit and vegetables. They responded nobly to his appeal. The demand continued to increase, and he was forced to appeal to the public, and the State Government supplied him with a depot. He has now 1,000 families on his books receiving gifts of fruit and vegetables twice a week. The authorities of the Red Cross organization came to him and asked him why he did not come under their wing. He replied that he was content to come under any one&#39;s wing to help the people whom he was endeavouring to assist. He came under the Red Cross organization, but because of certain interference he was compelled to separate from that organization again. It is not necessary that at this stage I should go into the details of his difficulties with that organization, but I will say that this gentleman was shabbily treated by that body. He started on his own again, and collected money wherever he could get it, and fruit, vegetables, and other produce were sent to him from different parts of New South Wales. The New South Wales Government carried this produce free, and assisted the Fund with a little money. The object of the Fund is to assist the wives and families of fighters, men who are really at the Front; and these people assert that they cannot be catered for bv any .other body in Sydney, and they are perfectly content to continue to receive assistance through this Fund. The men and women conducting the Fund do not receive a threepenny-bit for the work they do. They are satisfied to continue to operate it, but the Repatriation Department now says that they must not do so. If the Department adopted a similar policy in dealing with other funds, I should not complain; but they do not. There are other bodies in Sydney raising money for the assistance of the wives and families of soldiers that are not interfered with. Theatre parties, regattas, and all sorts of entertainments are held to raise funds for these bodies, but the gentleman who has established the Fund to which I am referring has received an order from the </para>

                <para class="block">Repatriation Board that he must not collect any more money for his Fund, though he may continue to collect goods. If this order is enforced he will have to close the distributing depot. I am consequently making a last earnest appeal to prevent this being done. I appealed to the Minister on the subject before, and it was referred to the Repatriation Council in Melbourne, who referred it to the State Board, and they have decided practically to close up the Fund. In view of the fact that the war is nearly over, I again appeal through the Minister for Defence to the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> to permit this Fund to be continued. In a letter sent to me to-day, the honorary organizer of the Fund writes as follows: - </para>

With the apparent near approach of the end of the war, it is possible we may be able to manage to carry on long enough to save the Repatriation Department the everlasting disgrace of having wantonly turned out over 1,000 soldiers&#39; wives from, the depot. </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>In submitting my report for the year ended 30th June, 1918, it is to be regretted that the need for the work of this fund continues to be of such pressing necessity. Unfortunately, so long as the war continues, and the same conditions prevail here, the work of the fund must be maintained. The operations of the fund were carried on during the year in much the same way as they have been hitherto, with the notable &#34;exception that larger quantities of women&#39;s and children&#39;s clothing were received, and were much appreciated by the families. If anything, owing to the increased cost of living, the need for assistance to the soldiers&#39; families has been more acute, but, fortunately, the depot has been able to afford a fair measure of relief. The number of families receiving help from the depot has fluctuated from time to time between COO and 700 to 1,200, whilst the number of children being provided for has varied from about 2,f(in to about 5,000. The strike which occurred in August, 1017. had a disastrous effect on the work of the fund, through transportation difficulties. We were practically unable to get any donations of goods by the rail or boat, which meant that we wore forced to buy everything. The effect of this increased buying was so serious that at one stage the fund&#39;s financial credit balance went right down to 3s. lid. Whilst being able to provide for all the families with three children each and upwards, numbering about !!00 families, we were compelled during this period of stress, to put off over 300 families with two children each, and, unfortunately, through lack . of supplies, it has not been possible to put these families back on the list again. There are at present somewhere between 700 and- 800 families with two children who have applied to the depot for assistance, but whom we have been, so far, unable to do anything for. </para>
                    <para>An important development has taken place in connexion with the public schools since my last report. At the instance of the UnderSecretary, a committee of the teachers in the metropolitan area has been formed, with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ed.</inline> Webster as convener. The objects for which this committee was brought into existence were to properly organize and stimulate patriotic effort on the part of public school pupils throughout the State. This movement was inaugurated towards the end of 1917, and a special rush appeal was made to provide Christmas cheer for those receiving supplies from the dep&#233;t. The success of this initial effort was splendid. Since the beginning- of 1918 the organizing of the schools&#39; efforts has gone ahead rapidly, and the fund has received very material help therefrom. This will be better understood when I say that prior to the formation ot this committee the total number of schools helping the work of the fund was twenty-four, whilst for the six months ended June, 1918, this number had increased to 124, the value of whose help amounted  to &#163;447 10s. 2id. </para>

                <para>Since the last report was presented to you, the Railway Commissioners have granted the fund free carriage; this came into force on the 1st January, 1918. I am also pleased to report that Frank Cridland, Limited, have been good enough to arrange free cartage of consignments for the fund from the railway, boat, &#38;c. </para>
                <para>In March last, at my request, an officer from the Auditor-General&#39;s Department thoroughly investigated the whole of the fund&#39;s books, accounts, &#38;c, and issued a certificate to the effect that everything was in satisfactory order. Again, since .the close of our year, another officer has gone through the fund&#39;s accounts, and his certificate will be noticed on the balance-sheet presented with this report, whilst the report to the Government reads as follows: - &#39;&#34;I have examined the books and accounts of the above fund, which have already been subjected to the audit of a public accountant for the year ended 30th June, 1918. A clear certificate as to their correctness was given, and my examination enabled me to give an unqualified endorsement thereto&#39;. The figures&#39; appended show that the ratio of administrative expenses is low, especially as the value of goods in kind received and distributed has been taken on  a  very conservative basis. - A. C. K. Mackenzie,  Insp.  of Pub.  Accts.,  12/8/18.&#34; . </para>
                <para>The total donations in cash received during the year amounted to &#163;1,693 12s. 7d., which added to the balance brought forward at the beginning of the year totals &#163;1,843 12s. 9d., whilst the total expenditure in &#39;goods, &#38;c, totals &#163;1,578 ls. 10d., leaving a credit balance at 30th June, 1918, of &#163;205 10s. lid. As during the previous years, careful records have been kept of gifts in kind received, and a conservative valuation of these (including over seven tons of jam made on the premises) amounts to &#163;3,610 lis. 9d., which makes the total supplies distributed during the year &#163;4,961 19s. lOd. The only items in the balance-sheet which are chargeable to cost of administration are postage, &#163;55 lis.; printing and stationery, &#163;9 19s. 6d. ; sundries (telephone, cleaning room, &#38;c), &#163;38 5s. These total &#163;103 15s. 6d., equivalent to only 2 per cent, on the fund&#39;s total operations for the year. </para>
                <para class="block">I have read that statement because it has been said by some persons connected with the State Repatriation Committee - indeed, I interviewed one of them myself - that I ought to have nothing to do with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pontey,</inline> the organizer of this Fund, who was a bounder. I only hope that.. I may be associated with such bounders for the rest of my life. He has sacrificed time, money, and business in order to carry on this Fund, and he is now fighting for the right to get donations from the public amounting to a paltry &#163;840 a year. But the State Repatriation Committee have come down upon him with the guillotine, and have said, &#34; You must close up. But you may receive gifts in kind.&#34; What is the value of gifts in kind if the man cannot get money to cover the cost of postage and other charges incidental to his work? He only asks that his expenses shall be recouped to him. When we passed the Repatriation Bill, giving the State Committees power to cut down these funds, we never anticipated that they would attempt to stem the efforts of a man who submits his balance-sheet to the State .Auditor-General, or the endeavours of the noble-hearted women who have manufactured on the premises the quantity of jam I have indicated. It was never intended by any section of this Parliament that such an arbitrary power should be placed in the hands of anybody. Now that the war is nearly over, I appeal to the Minister for Repatriation to allow this man to continue his labours. As I have pointed out, 124 schools have contributed &#163;447 to the Fund. Yet this man is now obliged to say to the school children, &#34;You must not contribute to it,&#34; and to the school teachers, &#34; You must not help me because the Repatriation Committee has forbidden you to help these people.&#34; Certain trouble exists between these private associations with which, however, I am not going to deal here. But if I did, I am satisfied that my disclosures would surprise honorable senators. &#34;I appeal once more to the Minister to allow&#39; this man to continue the good work upon which he has embarked. Then, when the history of the war comes to be written, we shall not be able to say that the Government declined to allow people to assist families of our fighters while they were absent at( the battle front. </para>

                    BOLTON (Victoria) &#91;8.30&#93;.  -  Referring to the subject upon which I made a statement earlier in the day, I would like an expression of opinion from the Government as to the probability of any action being taken by them. Now that hostilities with Turkey  have ceased, it seems to me that the proper care of the graves of our troops -who were buried in Gallipoli, demands urgent attention. In the press recently an. announcement appeared to the effect that these graves had been very much neglected and disfigured, and in my statement this afternoon, I pointed out that there was considerable doubt as to the identification of many of the graves. It is, I submit, a sacred duty on the part of the Government to take such steps as will insure, not merely the proper . protection of those graves, but that no effort should be spared to identify every one of them. Indeed the Government should endeavour to secure some vested rights in the areas covered by the battlefields in Gallipoli. They are battlefields which will be historical so far as the Commonwealth is concerned, and, in my opinion, they will become places of pilgrimage for Australians for many years to come. I hope that action will be taken by the Government to commemorate the first great work done by Australians in this war.

                    <para>.- -In reply to the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> upon the question of wheat freight, I desire to say that, in my opinion, he was somewhat unjust in instituting a comparison between the rates of freight at the present time and the rates of freight which obtained prior to the war. Surely he would not have us believe that he is un- . aware of such a thing as war risk, or of the higher cost that is involved in working ships now, as compared with the cost of working them before the war. Yet, this afternoon, he actually instituted that comparison. I have not the figures relating to the rates of freight before me, but I have seen them quite recently. My recollection of them is that in this particular class of cargo, Australia has the cheapest freight of any wheat-growing country &#39;in the Southern Hemisphere. I am confident that the rate of freight from the Argentine is very much higher, in proportion to distance, than is the rate from Australia. Therefore, nothing is to be gained by the honorable senator attempting to rouse the passions of .the farmers of this country by endeavouring to make them believe that they are not getting a fair deal from the Government. </para>

                <para class="block">As a matter of fact, several Governments have dealt with this question. I think that the scheme was first propounded by a Labour Government. But all Governments have encountered the same difficulty - the difficulty of getting freight. Indeed, it has been a real difficulty to obtain freight at any price. </para>

There is no doubt that the purchase of these ships led to a larger number of vessels coming to the Commonwealth than would otherwise have been the case. The present Government have endeavoured to do their best in the interests of the producers of this country. That they have not been able to give the farmer better conditions is not due to circumstances within their control, but to circumstances of a worldwide character. </para>

The facts in regard to the particular matter mentioned by &#39;the honorable senator are that no tax was collected prior to 1915, but that in their returns for 1915-16 and subsequent years certain persons who had won cash prizes in Tattersall sweeps did not include them. The Taxation Department has now obtained a list of prize winners in those sweeps, and by this means has discovered the persons who did not include the amounts thus won in their returns, and it has taken action accordingly. I do not think there can be any reasonable complaint of that. There is the law. It distinctly states that cash prizes won in lotteries shall be included in taxable income. These people did not include such prizes won by them in their income tax schedules, .and they are now being called upon to comply with the law. It will he seen, therefore, that this is not retrospective legislation. </para>

In 1915, 1 think that the minimum taxable income was &#163;250. It will be seen, therefore, that if a man earned some income, and on top of that won a cash prize in a lottery, his income would probably exceed the minimum taxable amount. </para>

                        <para>- But the incomes of some persons added to the cash prizes won by them- would not exceed the taxable amount. For instance, a man who received a cash prize of only &#163;10 is called upon to pay taxation upon it. </para>

                <para>In regard to the question raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall,</inline> he, of course, recognises that it concerns the Repatriation Department. I know that the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> has given consideration to that matter, and also to a number of other matters. He recognises that it is necessary to secure some uniformity, and, with- this end in view, to lay down certain guiding principles in regard to the funds which shall be allowed to operate throughout Australia. Nobody can justify allowing a fund to exist in one particular locality, and refusing to sanction the establishment of a similar fund elsewhere. </para>

                <para>In regard to the question raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton,</inline> as to the graves of our troops who died in. Gallipoli,  we are all agreed that it is one in respect of which a strong sentiment exists throughout Australia. The honorable senator will probably remember that very early in the war this matter did receive the attention of the Government, and that we made certain representations to the British Government concerning it. But it was not then possible to do anything of a practical character except to appoint a Graves Commission, representative of the United Kingdom and of all the Dominions - a Commission of which the Prince of Wales is  Chairman.  This Commission has been working ever since its appointment to obtain as complete a register as possible of the graves of all the Empire soldiers who have fallen in every theatre of war. In regard to the greater part of Gallipoli, I know that a very complete register of the graves there is in existence, and a similar remark is applicable to the graves in Egypt. I can quite understand that in the circumstances related by the honorable senator earlier  in  the afternoon, this was not possible at Cape Helles. I shall see what has been done, and shall  be  obliged  if  the honorable senator will give me the names  of  the two officers who,  he  says, can furnish complete information on the subject, although, probably, I should be able  to  ascertain them  in  any case. I can assure the. honorable  senator,  and the Senate generally, that  we  are giving the matter  out  best attention, and that  it  is the intention of the Government to do everything  we  can. </para>
                <para>We shall certainly make representations about reserving the land  on  the Gallipoli Peninsula in some way. We cannot say what the ultimate destination of that land will be, but  we shall  endeavour, through the British Government, to secure that the spots where our countrymen are buried shall remain sacred for all time. We have not lost sight of the matter, and whatever arrangement is come to as to the future destination  of  the Gallipoli Peninsula, we may  be  able to have some stipulation mode that the graves shall not be desecrated  in  any way. </para>
