                    <para>- &#91;3.25&#93;. - I am surprised that the Minister in charge of the business should move the first reading of a Bill of this importance without one word of explanation of what the Government have done during the very long period since we had an, opportunity to discuss public business. It would not have been out of place if the Government&#39;s representative here had told the Senate and the country what the Government have been doing to carry out their pledge to win the war; for that pledge is the only reason why the present Government find themselves in office. The Minister, I think, might well have put before the members of the Senate some reasons why the Government, of its own volition, without calling Parliament together, and without discussing the matter at all, subjected the people of the country to turmoil such as we have gone through in the recent referendum campaign. However, it is quite in keeping with the whole conduct of the Government that the Leader of the House, in introducing this Supply Bill, should merely move that it be read a first time, and say no more about it - it is quite in keeping with the evident determination of the Government to dispense with parliamentary services altogether. If the country will submit to the Government taking out of the hands of Parliament such an important matter as a referendum, and if the Government will violate a pledge made, not on one platform, but on a hundred, and reported not in one newspaper, but in every newspaper in the Commonwealth, that if they were not given the powers sought, they would cease to govern the country, we may expect such treatment as we are now receiving. I cannot help expressing my surprise, however, that the Minister should throw this measure before us without a word of explanation, or without a word to condone the conduct of the Government; though, perhaps, as he is a member of such a new Government he thinks that he and his colleagues have nothing to answer for. I have one or two things to say &#39;to the Government, because, despite all their lightning changes - despite the fact that they have degraded the Ministerial office in Australia to a level never before reached - and that into this degradation they have drawn, not only themselves, but the representative of  His  Majesty, the Governor-General, I can quite understand that, when the subject has been dealt with at length, honorable senators now behind the Government will remain there as complacently as they have since they were elected to the Parliament. There is only one course to which honour points. No matter what a man&#39;s views may be, or what his pledges to his party may be, no one sitting in this Parliament can put hi a loyalty to party in place of his personal honour. The personal honour and reputation of all members of the party opposite who did not disclaim the Ministerial pledge to resign demand that they should vote the Government! out of office. </para>

                        <para>- There are no half measures; and if honorable senators opposite sneer, it is only what one might expect. I should like to commence my remarks by placing on record that excellent epigrammatic description of the leadership of the present Prime Minister, by our old friend, ex-Senator Rae, who said, &#34; In twelve months he <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> forced the Labour party to surrender its power to retain its honour, and in less than twelve months he has forced the. National party to surrender its honour to retain its power.&#34; That, I think, deserves a place in the pages of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard;</inline> and if I said no more the Government would be well dealt with. They are welcome to that power. I intend to read to the Senate the pledges given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and the Minister for Defence as to what would follow if certain things happened. While this war lasts the most important member of this Parliament is the Minister for Defence, and I think we are at least entitled to know why his position is vacant to-day. </para>

I am not, and never was, much of a believer in the referendum, but when a referendum has been held, and by an overwhelming majority of the people the question has been decided, it is not right for the Government then, of their own volition, without consulting Parliament, and without giving fresh reasons to the people, through Parliament, why the issue should be re-submitted, to throw such a bone of contention between the people at a time when wise statesmanship would have aimed, not at spreading, dissension, distrust, and ill-feeling, but . at ending strife by bringing peace, and compelling ill-will to cease by causing good-will. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator is not apologizing, he is excusing. During the last referendum campaign, public men were degraded in a manner in which public men in&#39; Great Britain have not been degraded for centuries; they were dragged before magistrates because they dared to speak the truth on the platform; and the Prime Minister held up to ridicule and contempt the head of a great religious denomination and tried to win his election thereby. If actions like, those are not calculated to bring  strife  amongst us, I should like to know what would. </para>

                        <para>- I never said there was, but more than love the leader of that denomination prefers justice and fair play, and never from me did he get anything else. What are we to think of a man who is a member of the denomination, and condones not only public utterances that held up to ridicule and contempt the head of the Church in Victoria, but also the effort to win the fight by the introduction of a mean and dirty sectarian element. The honorable senator is still excusing that conduct, and will continue excusing it so long as he holds his seat. </para>

                        <para>- I am inclined to be cautious. If the conscription issue is dead, it is the duty of the Leader of the Senate to make a public announcement here that the Government will not during the life of this Parliament, either by means of regulations under the War Precautions Act or : by direct legislation, attempt to further interfere with the liberties of the people by conscripting them. There are thousands of people in the State of New South Wales who would resent it, and, if they are defrauded of their liberty by the fraudulent actions of Ministers there will be only one recourse left to them, and that is force. In times such as these no one can regard force as a reasonable method of resisting the wrongful actions of a Government, but it is just as well to say here that Ministers cannot conscript free Australians, and if they attempt to do so, it is as well that </para>

                        <para>- A million people voted for the Government which introduced it, but the most thoughtful of them regretted that the question had been introduced. That is the danger we have to fear from this Government. Ministers looked at that million votes, and claiming that  another  referendum on conscription  was  sought for, they took one. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> says, a million people have voted for conscription. But how was the vote obtained ? By a series of regulations the Government introduced a reign of terror among public speakers who were on the &#34;No &#34; side. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall,</inline> for an utterance made at Albury, one that any honorable senator would have made, and should have made, was dragged before a magistrate in Sydney. Of course, the magistrate had too much common sense to record a conviction. There was no offence deserving of a penalty. </para>

                        <para>- I will not use the term &#34; fool,&#34; but I will say that only a lunatic would have framed such a regulation as would drag men before magistrates on the charges on which they were proceeded against. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> merely advised the electors to maks sure that they were on the roll by going up to vote and demanding their votes. Of course, the case was dismissed, and costs to the amount of &#163;5 were given against the Commonwealth. A charge was laid against the Premier of Queensland. Surely <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan&#39;s</inline> position should have saved him from the mean methods pursued by the Commonwealth Attorney-General, who was in control of the administration of the War Precautions Act, under which regulations were gazetted for one purpose only, namely, in order to harass and annoy speakers on the &#34; No &#34; side. The most glaring false-  hoods were allowed to go unchallenged if they were uttered by men on the &#34; Yes &#34; side, and appeals to the Commonwealth Attorney-General or to the Commonwealth law officers to institute prosecutions fell on deaf ears. No action would be taken if the person making the statement belonged to the &#34; Yes &#34; side. On the other hand, detectives were sent out to listen to speakers on the &#34;No&#34; side, and shorthand writers were sent out to take notes of their utterances. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> was dragged before a magistrate. </para>

                        <para>- I suppose they were in the wrong again. Ex-Senator Rae was charged with having made the statement that there were not 60,000 fit single men left in Australia, though it was based on good figures and sound reasoning. The magistrate decided that he had good grounds for making the statement, though his facts were wrong, as there were 60,000 fit single men in Australia, but I am prepared to say now, as I did during the campaign, that, if the figures of the Statistician can be taken as any guide, there are not 60,000 fit single men in Australia at the present time. </para>

If ex-Senator Rae&#39;s statement, that there were not 60,000 fit single men left in Australia, based, as the magistrate admitted, on good grounds, was sufficient to justify him being taken before a magistrate, unless it was the deliberate intention that this ill-conceived law should be wickedly administered, Messrs. Percy Hunter and Archdale Parkhill should also have been prosecuted. There should have been an even deal to both sides. </para>

                        <para>- No, because it has not yet come to hand.- If it had I would have given it. This goes to the root of the matter. My honorable colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall,</inline> spoke at Albury, and his tour of the constituency was interrupted by proceedings! taken against him on a summons issued in Sydney. He was called upon to appear before a magistrate there, and witnesses had to be brought from Albury. On the other hand, other men make a statement which, on the face of it, was far more wide of the truth, and no prosecution is instituted. If it was right that ex-Senator Rae, Senators McDougall and Barnes, and other members of the Official Labour party should be brought before magistrates for alleged false statements made by them, why were not the other men I have referred to similarly treated ? J Justice  in this matter was not only blind, but in the case of persons advocating the &#34; Yes &#34; side in the campaign the law itself was dead. These are the things we complain of. </para>

                        <para>- What evidence does the honorable senator require? If the letters which&#39; I have read are not evidence in the opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior,</inline> then I can produce no evidence which he would appreciate or understand, and I shall not attempt the impossible. I say that the regulation against which I protest takes from Britishers the liberty which is rightly theirs. One has to go back to the time of the Star Chamber to look for its equal. Under this regulation any man, public or private, could be brought before a magistrate, not in order to establish his guilt, but that he might be called upon  to prove his innocence. We ordinarily give a man charged with the worst of crimes the benefit of the doubt until his guilt is proved. Under this regulation a public speaker makes a statement which  some  of his most malicious opponents say is wrong, and he is then taken before a magistrate and compelled to prove that the statement he made was correct. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> may say that I have no proof to justify that statement, but the proof is in the wording of the regulation itself. Have we reached such a stage in this country that we are willing, without raising our voice against it, to permit any man to tamper with liberties which the people have enjoyed for centuries ? Have party differences so embittered us that honorable senators opposite object to honorable senators on this side raising such a grievance before the grant of Supply? In my view, honorable senators opposite are evading an obvious duty. It does not rest with me alone to protest against a regulation of this kind. No man who loves liberty could justify such a regulation used in the way in which this has been used, against one party aud only after a request, not to a public officer, but to the Right Honorable W. M. Hughes, the man chiefly interested in the referendum campaign. This regulation, and the way in which it was applied, not merely invaded the liberties and rights of the people, but polluted the fountain of justice. Apart from the invasion of individual rights, this regulation invaded the right of the people to hold public meetings. Is not that a right which ought to be protected? Are we to have public meetings held in fear and trembling that any word which may escape our lips, no matter how true it may be, may involve us in a penalty if we are unable to prove its truth to the satisfaction of a magistrate, who may never have given a moment&#39;s thought to the question. I take the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> H. Catts, the honorable member for Cook. <inline font-style="italic">No</inline> man I know of is as well informed on the Eastern question as is that gentleman. For three years and longer he has made it his business &#39;to become acquainted with the nature of the menace from the North. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, he has read it up. He stood upon a public platform and took the responsibility of his utterance, and he was then dragged before a magistrate and bound over on six or seven different conditions to say no more on that line. He desired to appeal to a higher Court, and his right to appeal was refused. That in liberty-loving Australia, by a Government that appears bent on taking from us the liberty we enjoy ! </para>

                        <para>- If that is the honorable senator&#39;s idea of liberty, if the Attorney-General or some one else is to be the judge of our rights, then our rights and liberties will exist, only until feeling runs sufficiently high for some one in authority to want to check us. There is no fear of the relations between Australia and any of the Allies being interfered with by free speech, but the hush-up and  smother-up  policy, the secret diplomacy method, the attempt to maintain friendship with the open hand and the hidden dagger, will not preserve friendship with our Allies. If what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Catts</inline> says is true, Japan has a right to know it, and to know, too, that Australia knows it, and then Japan&#39;s answer will tend more towards good feeling and friendship between Australia and Japan than any of the present hush-up methods. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Catts&#39;</inline> speech consisted simply of quotations drawn from a hundred sources, and given to his public meeting almost without comment. He used no wild obnoxious language, but made merely a statement of facts as he saw and read them. Do honorable senators think it tends to a better understanding between Japan and Australia if we do not speak freely&#39; of each other? Does Japan exercise a censorship or control over what is said of Australia in her newspapers? </para>

                        <para>- I regret tha*, the honorable senator should make that statement. Does he think that a statement like this appearing in a Japanese newspaper means anything: - &#34;The Marshall Islands must be taken as a stepping-stone to the South Pacific. When this war ends the Pacific Ocean will lose its&#39; name&#34;? The man who will not look fact3 in. the face is in the same position as the Britisher years ago when he was being warned of what was happening in Germany. The law which prevents a public man from stating facts should be&#39; wiped out. If it is a regulation, so much the worse for the people who will submit to it. I will not. I said on the public platform that, so far as that law was concerned, it did not bind me nor put a padlock on my lips. The fact that I got through without even a charge of making a misstatement is a proof of my great truthfulness that I can hand down proudly to my children. Even the Government, with their War Precautions regulations, with their pimp3 and spies attending public meetings, could not find one utterance which&#34; would justify them on the most flimsy pretext in dragging me before a magistrate.&#39; </para>

                        <para>- Turned down ! If he were prepared to agree to the National policy ! The point that I want to make clear is that the Government are offering no bridge to span the gulf that separates parties. And they are wise in not doing so. The difference dividing Australia to-day is not the difference between its public men.The difference dividing Australia, and that has each party, as it were, panting, ready to jump at the other&#39;s throat, is the fact that the power-holding classes, as soon as they got this National Government into power, made war on the unions from one end of Australia  to the other. They forced the most wretched strike we ever had - it may suit honorable senators to jeer at that, but they deliberately forced it, when the Government under its War Precautions Act proposed to take from the unions the award they had earned by years of labour and the expenditure of thousands of pounds of their hard-earned savings. The Government is wise in not trying to reconcile those representing the different classes in Parliament, but any Government is blind that fails to see the dissension and strife it is creating at a time like this, when the one aim and object of every man in public or private life should be to link together in unity all sections and classes of the community. A Government that makes open war on the trade unions, a Government that makes every member of a trade union an enemy of the Government - honorable senators may not believe me, but I tell them that the fact that there are men penalized and prevented from earning their living simply bv the fact that they are trade unionists, gives me more concern than all our parliamentary differences. </para>

                        <para>- One of them was penalized for taking the chair as a trade unionist at a public meeting. Another who worked for fifteen years in a Department is not to be allowed employment again because he acted as a picket during the strike. This National Government, working in league with tha National Government in my own State, deliberately made war upon those trade unionists, and deliberately forced them to leave their positions. </para>

My honorable friend wants me to prove that men were sacked because they were unionists; well, I charge the National Government with holding positions from men because they were unionists. If the honorable senator has any doubt about the matter, he is one of the very few people in this country who are in doubt. What was the position? Men from one end of New South Wales to the other were written to and asked to hold themselves in readiness in the event of a strike. Will the honorable senator doubt that this was done, or that the Minister who was responsible for this instruction was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beeby,</inline> and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beeby</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hall</inline> were over in Melbourne for weeks getting ready for the strike? </para>

                        <para>- Well, there was one place - I refer to Manly - where the people seemed to enjoy themselves at my expense. It was there that they attempted to howl me down, and sang that good old German tune &#34; God save the King,&#34; thus degrading our National Anthem. They also sang &#34;Rule Britannia.&#34; They counted me out, and used all the methods that could be employed by an excited crowd to prevent a man from being heard. The meeting at Manly was the worst I have ever spoken at in all my life. But I do not blame them. </para>

                        <para>- No ; and I can assure the honorable senator that it is a perfectly sound one. I am only pointing out that Nationalists, if assured that they are in a majority, can display just as much ill-feeling and improper conduct as any other section of the community. That, meeting at Manly was the worst feature in the whole of my public career of twenty-five years, though, possibly, I enjoyed myself there as much as at any other gathering, because, after all, the temper of the crowd showed that the people were in deadly earnest over this question. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking sarcastically, of course, because honorable senators know, as I do, that, although the Prime Minister spoke in that vein, he did not believe what he was saying, because, if his opponents&#39; hands were stained with German gold, how is it that he has since made an offer to the Leader of the Opposition to get out of the Ministry if the Labour party will join forces with Nationalists? What sort of a traitor is he if, believing that statement to be correct, he now asks for the co-operation of these persons in the, government of this country? It is high time honorable senators looked for traitors in high places. One who calmly and deliberately considers what has happened in this country since <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> returned from Great Britain might well ask if his business here is not German business - if   his business here has not been to prevent this country from doing its share as it has done it in the past. It has done more than its share if what it has done is compared  with what has. been done by any other country that is fighting. </para>

                        <para>- According to Major-General Maurice, from July to November, 1917, the portion df the fighting line in France and Flanders for which Great  Britain was responsible was held by 82 per cent, of British troops, 9 per cent, of Australian troops, 7 per cent, of Canadian, and 2 per cent, of New Zealand troops. Australia has&#39; a population of less than 5,000,000 persons; the population of Great Britain exceeds 46,500,000. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot speak of all that Great Britain has done, but I am trying to put in a word for what has been done by Australia, which my honorable friends held up to ridicule and contempt whenever they spoke during the recent campaign. If the figures I have quoted are correct, Australia, in proportion to population, was as well represented in the fighting line as Great Britain, and as well represented as Canada and New Zealand put together. Yet honorable senators say that Australia has not done her share. </para>

                        <para>- When led off the track by the interjections, I was about to refer to certain statements made by Ministers. I shall preface my reference to them by quoting from a letter written by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Goschen, then British Ambassador at Berlin, to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Grey. In order to make it intelligible to those who may read the report of my speech, let me explain that this letter contains the memorable statement of the British Ambassador at Berlin in regard to what is known as the &#34; Scrap of Paper &#34; interview with the German Chancellor. Writing of his interview with the German Secretary of State, he goes on to state that - </para>

                    <para>I then said that I should like to go and see the Chancellor, as it might be perhaps the last time I should have an opportunity of seeing him. He begged me to do so. I found the Chancellor very agitated.  His Excellency  at once began a harangue which lasted for about twenty minutes. He said that the step taken by  His  Majesty&#39;s Government was terrible to a degree; just for a word - &#34;Neutrality,&#34; a. word which in war time had so often been disregarded - just for a scrap of paper Great Britain was going to make war on a kindred nation who desired nothing better than to be friends with her. All his efforts in that direction had been rendered useless by this last terrible threat, and the policy to which, as I knew, he had devoted himself since his accession to office had tumbled down like a House of cards. What  we had done was unthinkable; it was like striking a man from behind while he was fighting for his life against two assailants. He held Great Britain responsible for all the terrible events that might&#34; happen. I protested strongly against that statement, and said that, in the same way as he and Herr von Jagow  wished me to understand, that for strategical reasons it was a matter of life and death to Germany to advance through Belgium and violate the latter&#39;s neutrality, so I -would wish  him to understand that it was, so to speak, a matter of &#34; life and death &#34; for the honour of Great Britain that she should keep her solemn engagements to do her utmost to defend Belgium&#39;s neutrality from attack. That solemn compact had to be kept, or what confidence could any one have in engagements given by Great Britain in the future? The Chancellor said, &#34; But at what price will that compact have been kept? Has the British Government thought of that?&#34; I hinted to  His Excellency  as plainly as I could that fear of consequences could hardly be regarded as an excuse for breaking solemn engagements. But  His Excellency  was so excited, so evidently overcome by the news of our action, and so little disposed to hear reason that I refrained from adding fuel to the flame by further argument. </para>

                <para class="block">I have made that quotation for a definite purpose. Every one of us on reading that letter, which was broadcasted by the Government, soon after the war broke out, felt his heart beat with pride in the knowledge that Great Britain had entered this war on a higher moral plane than had Germany. We realized that Great Britain went into this war with her eyes open as to what would be the result of her action. Knowing the awful cost, knowing that it would mean a perfect holocaust of human lives, she was yet determined to keep her word. I, as a unit of this Empire, felt a thrill of . pride when I read this statement; and realized what British statesmen were prepared to do in order to keep their word. And I, as an Australian, am now going to place on record a few facts that will serve to show how Australian statesmen keep their word. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> gave some pledges during the recent campaign; he practically gave, in fact, a fresh pledge at each place at which he spoke. Speaking at Bendigo, as reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of 13th November last, he said -  . . We who were elected on a Win-the-war policy tell you plainly that thu situation in Russia and Italy is such that without the power to insure reinforcements we cannot give effect to the policy which you approved with such enthusiasm last May. </para>
                <para>I tell you plainly that the Government must have this power. It cannot govern the country without it, and will not attempt to do so. </para>

                        <para>- I am not egotistical enough to imagine that I can do it, and I am quite sure the honorable senator could not. Given wise government, the links, chains, or threads that bind Australia to the Empire will remain. But give us a Government&#34; that outrages every sense of decency, give us, for instance, a Government that, behind the backs of the people, would enforce conscription, and I will not answer for any further connexion with the Empire. We ought to take a warning from these facts - from the feeling in the public mind. We have an overwrought people organizing to protect their liberties, which every day are threatened in the name of loyalty to the Empire. Our loyalty will stand a great deal stronger test if it is allowed to develop in its own way. It is the &#34;crimson thread,&#34; and not War Regulations, that will make us loyal; we shall not make people loyal by dragging them before magistrates in order to make them speak the truth. I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> would need any such step being taken in order to make him speak the truth. </para>

                        <para>- However that may be, I said I had a few words to say about <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine. I am not going to run with my hat off and salute him as a heaven-born statesman. I have as much contempt for his judgment as I would for that of a man who, on the 17th March, would walk in the Hibernian procession wearing an orange ribbon and whistling &#34;The Battle of the Boyne&#34; ; or of a man who, on the 12th July, would take part in an Orange celebration wearing a green ribbon, and singing&#34; The Wearing of the Green.&#34; That represents the statesmanship of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine, who is always &#34;butting in&#34; when it would be better for him to refrain. He has held positions in the public life of this country that should enable him to exercise such judgment, in times like these, as not further to divide the people. I am told, on what I consider good authority, that the Public Service of Victoria has not yet recovered, and is not likely to recover, from the attack he made on it in 1902. When this war broke out, it found the two parties in this country fighting an election forced upon it by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine attacking preference to unionists. No one will deny that it was his attitude on conscription that gave us, not only the first, but the second referendum. </para>

                        <para>- I happen to hold a position in a section of this Parliament where Governments are neither made nor unmade, and  His Excellency  had only to wait till the House met to hear my opinion. As I have said, I am not going to applaud the statesmanlike qualities of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine, when, after all the positions he has occupied in public life, we find him in the present crisis without a following. That is certainly nothing to the honorable gentleman&#39;s credit. If he has the parts and abilities that those who acclaim him say he has, why does he cut such a poor figure at a time like this? There are, however, matters on which I would take him as a guide. Living in the aloof atmosphere of a man who cares for no one&#39;s opinion but his own, he is, perhaps, a particularly good exponent of codes of honour.

                    <para>The Government has declared in language which admits of no shadow of ambiguity that it will not attempt to continue governing this country without the powers asked for in this referendum. That is a clear, definite, and welcome assertion of the truth of Government responsibility in an issue vital to our national honour and safety. No other course would have been possible. The Government says, in effect - &#34;You must choose between our party with conscription and the Official Labour party without conscription.&#34; In this pledge the Government must not be allowed to stand alone. All members sitting behind the Government are hound by it in honour, or they cease to be Government supporters. Hence no Ministry can be formed on the Nationalists&#39; side of the House which will attempt to carry on the Government, without conscription. It is clear, therefore, that should the electors decline the responsibility of sanctioning conscription by a direct vote, one of two things must happen - either the government of this country must be handed over to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor&#39;s</inline> party, or the Nationalist party in Parliament must take the full responsibility of its policy even should that necessitate an appeal to the constituencies. </para>

                <para>No one will disagree with that. That was a clear statement of the position that the Government assumed when they made their political lives, and their positions in the Cabinet, depend on whether the referendum was carried or not. </para>
                <para>I do not claim that an adverse vote should have called on the Government to resign, but the Leader df the Government, and, as I believe, every member of it, pledged themselves individually and collectively that if the vote went against them they would no longer govern. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine declared that in the case of an adverse vote the Government would refuse to conduct the affairs of the country. He not only said that the Government would resign, but that no -section of the National party would accept office. In fairness to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine, I must say that he has since stated in the House that he did not mean his remarks to apply to those who disagreed with the pledge and publicly announced the fact, but only to those who acquiesced in it. </para>

                <para>I turn now to another distinguished lawyer, a man of very much political experience, and one whom I hold in perhaps more contempt than <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine. I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman,</inline> the Premier of New South Wales. He saw clearly that the straight and constitutional course for the Government to adopt was not only to resign, but to place the Opposition in office. Honorable senators have reminded me that the Governor-General sent for quite a number of men, and sought their advice. There was no occasion for him to seek such advice. Never was a clearer issue put before a Governor-General or a reigning monarch. The issue was so clear that there was only one proper thing to do. When the Government, representing the whole of the Nationalist party, expressed by their resignation their unwillingness to continue to conduct the affairs of the country, the only course for  His Excellency  to adopt was to send for the Leader of the Opposition. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has interjected that the Governor-General did send for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor.</inline> He did; that fact makes worse this pretence and make-believe. When the Leader of the Opposition was sent for, whether he should be intrusted to form an Administration or not depended upon what he said. If he was prepared to undertake the task of forming a Ministry it&#39; was for Parliament to say whether his Cabinet should remain in office or not. Such a decision was not in the domain of the Governor-General  His Excellency  may be a very high constitutional authority ; he may have some excellent qualities, but he has no right to interfere between the political parties of this country when the right path is. so plain that no man could fail to see it. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor</inline> was wrong when he expressed the opinion that he could form a Cabinet to carry on the Government - and I say there were reasonable grounds for thinking that he would be able to carry on- </para>

                    <para>I am certain that the Tudor Ministry would obtain at the hands of the present Nationalist party in the Federal Parliament every measure of patriotic consideration, and would obtain support in every step sincerely taken in the interests of voluntary recruiting. If, however, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor</inline> and his friends find that they can only live as a Government by listening to the counsels of the extremists amongst their followers - if they feel bound to give effect to immoderate resolutions carried by irresponsible conferences - if they forget that they represent the majority only on one point, and permit themselves to imagine that they represent it on all points, then it seems to me that this healing compromise, such as I and others are hoping for, will fail, and we shall have to return to a newly constituted National Govern- . ment. </para>

                        <para>- I know that; but I am quoting the public utterance of a Nationalist to show that there were reasonable grounds for believing that in the present grave crisis any Government coining forward to carry out a strong war policy would receive the support of Nationalists in the Senate and in another place. If they did not receive that support so much the better for Parliament; the Government could have been removed from office within a couple of minutes if the Opposition had so desired, and no time would have been lost. The Nationalists have not got rid of their trouble by the white-washing process they have adopted. </para>

                <para>The Government resigned, and the Governor-General invited <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor</inline> to see him. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor</inline> expressed his willingness to form a Government. I will not say it is  His  Excellency&#39;s peculiar way of joking, but I understand that he enjoyed considerably inviting to his councils all the men who thought they were prospective leaders of Australia in this crisis. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Forrest found his way to Government House. I am told that he had the longest interview, and fared sumptuously. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. ^Poynton</inline> was sent for, and I have no doubt that as he sat in his motor car while it hurried him to  His  Excellency&#39;s presence, he thought that Great Britain had at last sent us a constitutional Governor-General, a man capable of discerning the public man best fitted to lead Australia out of its troubles. When my late colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgs,</inline> was sent for, doubtless he, too, with that grim humour for which he is so renowned, said, &#34; Here at last is a Governor-General above mere party arrangements. The man who is elected leader is not necessarily the only man to be called upon to form a Government. I have not been elected leader, but it has been said that leaders are born, not made.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wise</inline> was also summoned to Government House, and that honorable gentleman could truthfully tell  His Excellency  that he led the most solid party in Parliament, that as the leader of a party of one he alone could say there were no supporters wishing to displace him from the high position he held. Probably he thought that after having been for many years almost unrecognised by any of the other parties, he had arrived at a time when he was to be given the chance to lead Australia. I have no doubt that on his return he had quite a different opinion of the gentleman who had sent for him. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Cook, I understand, received a summons almost simultaneously with the Leader of the Opposition, because, as the latter left  His  Excellency&#39;s presence, the Minister for the Navy was ready to be ushered in. What a strange idea was this,, of looking for somebody to take the job ! Here were all these possible leaders, one after the other receiving a mysterious message, &#34;  His Excellency  the Governor-General wishes to see you.&#34; We can imagine the hurry, the excitement, and all the thoughts that went flashing through their minds. I do not think that any one will say that  His Excellency  desired to see <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> in order to get his opinion about the crisis. Anybody who knows the honorable gentleman realizes that he would at once say, &#34; Let everything else go, provided I remain in office.&#34; </para>

There are hundreds of thousands of men in Australia who feel that, through all this sham and make-believe, one fact stands clear - that Labour cannot get a fair deal ; and Labour will not get a fair deal until positions such as that of the Governor-General are filled by Australians. </para>

The Standing Orders will not permit me to reflect on the Governor-General, but if I am not allowed to criticise his actions in a constitutional crisis, I misunderstand my privileges in this Senate. What would have happened had there been a similar crisis in Great Britain, and a new procedure was adopted ? There were only two parties in this Parliament, and one of them, having said that it could not govern,  His  Excellency&#39;s plain duty was to say to the other party, &#34; Take up office.&#34; Then Parliament&#39;s business would begin. I have no time for a representative of  His  Majesty who would fish around to see where he could find permanency in parties, or find a man who could hold a political partnership together.

His  business is to hold the balance evenly between the parties in Parliament, and it is Parliament&#39;s business to say who shall administer the affairs of the country. </para>

                        <para>- Parliament is saying it only after it has been prevented, by the decision of His Excellency the Governor-General to send for the man who had resigned, from seeing whether the Labour party could put before the country a national policy, not the policy of the Nationalist party, but a policy that would link up the people and enable all sections of the community to pull together. That opportunity was lost. </para>

                <para>Australia will have no chance of making good while the present Government remain in office. Ministers are pledged to the most bitter warfare against the Labour party. No word is too strong for them to utter in condemnation of us. They call us associates of the Industrial Workers of the World, Sinn Feiners, disloyalists,  and  traitors to the Empire, whose one desire is to place the dagger at the heart of Britain. </para>
                <para>I can afford to let all their abuse pass, but I cannot allow their efforts to degrade this Parliament to pass. Let us review them briefly. Less than twelve months ago this Senate was degraded through the majority that sat on this side being converted to a majority sitting on the Government side ; and this was brought about by a chain of circumstances which led the Prime Minister to say that he would use the Courts of Australia for the purpose of vindicating his character. When I asked for a Royal Commission for the purpose of vindicating our reputation, honorable senators opposite sheltered themselves behind the fact that the Prime Minister was taking action in the Courts, where the whole matter would be threshed out. What has happened since them? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> has paid the costs of the man against whom he took action. </para>

If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is satisfied with a withdrawal where <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> paid &#163;500, representing his own costs and those of his opponent, if he regards that as a complete vindication of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes&#39;</inline> character, I am surprised.

                        <para>- Yes, by paying the costs. That is not my only charge against the Government, because, with all their many whitewashings, they are the same old Government which attempted to corrupt Parliament. Their abuse has been bad enough in itself, but they have not been manly enough to stand to it. They have been heaping vile abuse on our party, and yet they say that it was only meant for outside consumption. If they would only stand to what they have said, one could deal with them. </para>

                        <para>- When I stood up in this Senate, and claimed that the question of privilege would stand, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> refuted my arguments, saying that it would not avail, and inquiry was evaded by that means. Many honorable senators would have stood for an inquiry if they had not thought that the honour of Parliament would be vindicated by the proceedings in the Courts, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> however, evaded the conflict in the Law Courts. He threw down his weapons, put up the white flag, and said to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson,</inline> &#34;I withdraw; I will pay all costs.&#34; What could <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson</inline> have done He could do nothing else than what he did. That incident itself was enough to condemn the Government. I say, with regard to the verdict of the electors on the 5th May, that the party opposite made such a mouthful of the statement that they were going to win the war that their party carried the people off their feet, and they won the day. But if the attempt to corrupt the Senate was not sufficient to condemn the Government, is it not enough to condemn them that, of their own volition, and by the exercise df their powers sitting in Executive, they robbed free-born Australians of their votes in the hope of securing for themselves a majority on a question in connexion with which the interests of the people they robbed were as great as their own? If they could take his vote from a man whose mother was an Australian and whose father was of German descent, then, upon any. paltry excuse, they could take his vote from any man in this community. What a miserable position that was to put the people of this country in. If King Edward himself, of blessed memory, had been an elector of this country he could not have voted at the referendum under that regulation. </para>

                        <para>- No ; their idea of justice. Their idea of justice is that those who will not vote with them must be disfranchised, and they passed a regulation to give effect to that idea. But. badly as the Government may have erred in passing such a regulation, I regard as far worse the action of men who. knowing these things to be wrong, still support that Government. This Government, most of the members of which came to Australia from another country, passed a regulation to prevent free-born Australians from voting They passed another regulation, which interfered with Britishers&#39; and Australians&#39; rights of public meeting, so that men could only address a public meeting in fear and trembling lest for any statement they might make they might be treated worse than a criminal. Under British justice a man is considered innocent until sufficient evidence has been submitted to convict him, but under a regulation passed by this Government a public  speaker,  whether he were a public mau or a private individual, speaking during the referendum was held to be guilty of making a false statement unless he could convince a magistrate that the statement was true. I have referred to the regulation which defranchised Australianborn electors. Honorable senators opposite will say that they were of German descent, that some of their forebears were Germans, or they would not have been disfranchised. Is it a crime in this country that one&#39;s ancestors were of German origin? If it is, why do we sing &#34;God Save the King&#34;? </para>

                        <para>- And to German music. There is a great sense of logic in the people of this country. If they are invited to believe that persons born in Australia ought to he disfranchised because their Australian parents were of German descent, the logical deduction from that may raise some question of the warrant for loyalty in a race who are pure German or pure alien, and in whom no British blood runs. Such a course of action simply serves to bring these things into public light, and compels men to think and talk about them whether they will or not. The less we irritate, harass, and nnnoy such a great section of the community as persons of German descent were irritated, harassed, and annoyed by the idiotic regulation to which I have referred, the better it will be for us. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I am referring to fit single men of military age. I need not read the figures, as I used them at public meetings, and they are well fixed in my mind. The census taken on the 3rd April, 1911, showed that there were then 423,000 single men in Australia. What was the increase in the number of single men during 1912, 1913, and 1914, when the war commenced? </para>

                        <para>- I am prepared to go right on, and ask what has been the increase in the number of single men during 1912, 1913, 1914, 1915, 1916, and 1917? The Prime Minister placed the increase in. the number of single men at 32,000 each year; that is to say, that each year that number of men passed from their twentieth to their twenty-first year. But it does not follow that the number of fit single men in each year was increased by that amount, because just as there are a certain number coming of age each year, so at the other end of the scale there are men passing from their forty-fourth to their forty-fifth year, and so dropping out of the class eligible for service. </para>

                        <para>- That is one of the features of the case, to which I intend to refer. Whilst 32,000 each year come in at one end of the class of military age, at the other end a few thousand, who have escaped all the risks and dangers of matrimony, fall into the old-age section, and are not required to serve. Between the ages of twenty and forty-five, a great many men cease to be fit as the result of sickness, accident, and the other ills to which flesh is heir.This will account for another 5,000. I go back to the basis of the calculation, that on the 3rd April, 1911, there were 423,000 single men in Australia, and the suggestion that the number was increased in each subsequent year by 32,000. What do honorable senators think the marriage rate was for men between the ages of twenty and forty-five years ? Do they think that it was 2,000 or 3,000 each year? It represents a greater number than the number of single men who come of age in each year. That is particularly the case in prosperous years. </para>

                        <para>- There is no suggestion of bigamy about it. The number of bachelors between the ages of twenty and forty-four, inclusive who married during 1914, was 39,191. The number during 1915 was 40,974. Thus there are more men married in one year between those ages than there are men who would come of age. If we can accept the Statistician&#39;s statement, there&#39; were 423,000 single men in Australia in 1911 - and those figures are based on census returns compiled under the most scientific system throughout the Commonwealth - and if we can take the average of men married in 1914 and 1915 as about 40,000, there has been no great increase in the number of single men in this country since 1911. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> 383,000 men had enlisted when he made his speech on the 31st October. If Ave can accept the Defence Department&#39;s estimate .that 83 per cent, of the enlistments are single men, we arrive at the fact that 323,000 single men enlisted. </para>

                        <para>- I will make full, allowance, because there is such &#39;an ample margin. On <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce&#39;s</inline> figures, 316,000 men have crossed the water, although I believe Major-General Legge subsequently said that the figures, properly worked out, showed that only 298,000 men had gone. In the Ryan case, in Queensland, I heard Major-General Legge say that about 40 per cent, of those who presented themselves to the doctor would not be passed. I will reduce that estimate to 25 per cent., that is, that of every four men who face the doctor, one fails to pass. </para>

                        <para>- There are many reasons why the estimate will either increase or decrease. But with our general knowledge of what is happening, we can safely take 25 per cent, as failing to pass the doctor as a very fair estimate. If only 75 per cent, of the single men offering pass, it follows that if 300,000 men pass into the ranks, another 100,000 fail to pass, showing that 400,000 single men have been through the doctor&#39;s hands. If, as the Statistician said, we had 423,000&#39; single men of the military age in 1911, where are the 60,000 men left? On the Statistician&#39;s own figures, if 300,000 enlisted, and 100,000 failed to pass the doctor, there are only 23,000 left. Moreover, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. William</inline> Morris Hughes has promised the people that the industries will be kept going, and the men essential to keep them going will not be called up. That applies to farming, wool raising - for the wool must come off the sheep&#39;s back - mining - the raising of the minerals to help to keep the war going - and other industries. The wheels of industry must be kept going, and none but the men in the jobs now can be trained in time to keep them going. A further deduction therefore must be made. With these figures staring the Government in the face, was ever a greater outrage perpetrated in this country than to drag a public man before a magistrate for daring to say there were not 60,000 single men left? Think of that outrage! Government supporters would not think of it unless it happened to themselves. I have given the Statistician&#39;s figures, and not a calculation of my own, for 1911; and the figures as to marriages are officially computed each year. Allowing- for marriages, for those within the ages who drop over the edge, and for accidents and ill-health, the fit single men in Australia are not increasing from year to year. </para>

                        <para>- It is not a reflection upon them at all, particularly iu these years, because it is known that before 1910 Australia was cursed with a Liberal Government, and in that year she got a Labour Government which meant prosperity, prosperity meant marriages, and marriages meant lessening the number of single men. That is the reason why, taking the 1911&#39; figures, I challenge any one who speaks in opposition to say that there has been any increase in the number of fit single men in 1914, 1915, and 1916, compared with 1911. I believe the figures show that in 1916 the number of marriages was about 42,000.&#39; I am using those figures1 as every public man should, not to mislead, not to build on a false foundation that can be knocked from under me, but with a firm belief that they are correct. Seeing that we have a 24-year period for marriage, and only one year for coming of age, I am convinced there has been no very great increase in the number of single men in the years I have mentioned. Think therefore of the injustice and wickedness of dragging a man before a magistrate to prove his case, and of the magistrate saying, &#34;You were justified in making that statement, but I declare it to be false.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator can put it that way, but if that is the position he tries to put our party in, all the worse for the regulation. The Government may use it to beat their political opponents on the win, tie, or wrangle principle, but there may yet be a Government in this country, not guided by reason, who may use the same methods to rob the members of the National party of their liberty. If they do, what answer can our honorable friends make? The Government who do these things in their day of power should remember that there is a to-morrow as well as to-day, and if ever there was a party that should look to to-morrow it is the present Ministerial party. When I move about the country I am astonished at the number of men who say, &#34; Let them bring in conscription. We will show them.&#34; No man understanding the conditions under which we are living in this complex society of ours can look with anything but horror to physical force as a means of checking misgovernment. It must be checked the moment it steps into the wrong path, and that moment is now. It will not be checked by remaining silent and allowing the Government to impose regulations of this kind. They are the most cursed regulations ever passed. They interfere with all that should be religiously protected by a British people - the right of public meeting. Under them public men may be attacked by the pimp who comes with his pencil and scratches down what they say. Then they are convicted on his notes before a magistrate. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, I am. I was in the Government that called up the men under the Home Service Proclamation in 1916, and what was the result? The Statistician&#39;s figures informed us that we could expect 176,000 men to report themselves. As a matter of fact, 190,000 reported themselves; but even after the most hurried examination only 110,000 single men between the ages of twenty-five years and thirty-one years were pronounced fit for service. Since then, over 50,000 have enlisted for active service. </para>

                        <para>- That was after a cursory medical examination. If the honorable senator knew anything about the military business, he would know that some men offer themselves half-a-dozen times before they are accepted. Honorable senators opposite, who have been trying to force everybody else to the war, do not take count of these figures, and yet they stand in judgment on those men who have not gone. It is a libel on Australia, which has drained herself of her manhood, and undertaken obligations that posterity will have to honour, to say that she has not done enough, and that her young men must be compelled to go. </para>

                <para>This Government,twelve months after the first referendum had been turned down, madly rushed the people into &#39;another. There had been another fixing up by members of the Government. What was the basis of that arrangement? I invite the Leader of the Senate to give us, not a statement which can be read in two different ways, but &#39; a clear and definite utterance that may help to heal the differences between the parties. Feeling runs high in both Houses, and there is seething discontent among the masses of the people, who feel that the Government are looking for an opportunity to trick them out of the liberties they have hitherto enjoyed. Therefore, it is up to the members of this Government, if they want to better the present condition of things, if they are anxious to bridge the gulf dividing the parties, and which, as they say, is preventing the proper flow of recruits, to make a definite statement of policy on this question. With the exception of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> whom I do not include in my general condemnation, I do not think there is a single honorable senator on the other side of the chamber who, prior to the referendum, did not justify conscription by saying that voluntarism has failed. </para>

                        <para>-That has been said for more than twelve months. The Prime Minister, I repeat, wanted 50,000 volunteers by the end of June. January, 1916, gave 22,000. February gave 18,000, and March 15,000, so there were 50,000 within three months. At the first referendum the Government asked for 16,500 men a month. Of course, that was quite absurd, and I remember, when I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> how many men he thought were required as reinforcements for 100,000 men in the firing line, and he told me 16,500, I said that 5,000 a month was much nearer the estimate. What is the position to-day ? </para>

                        <para>- We were told that 16,500 men were necessary, but figures since made available, have shown that for the twelve months succeeding that request, 3,000 men per month would have filled all the gaps in the ranks. The Government since then have asked for 7,000 a month, and I invite the Leader of the Government to make himself acquainted with the message in, the Defence Department from General Birdwood saying that 5,500 would be sufficient. </para>

                        <para>- I followed him at different places, and turned up the local newspapers to read what he had said. At Junee, the statement was made, &#34;You will have to fight. Parliament will make you.&#34; There is no mistaking the&#39; reply to that threat. As I said, if &#34; No &#34; were carried, and the Government persisted in conscripting men, or if &#34; Yes &#34; were carried by the faking or fixing of the soldiers&#39; vote, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> said that he would make Australians fight, he would get all the fight he wanted here in Australia. If Ministers and their followers are Avise, they will not persist in flying in the face of the people whose opinion they have asked. They will deny this dream of a mind that is, I shall not say diseased, but very excited, and will take steps to remove the suspicion that has been created. Imaginary grievances are more dangerous than real ones. </para>

                <para>I have ammunition here for a very long speech, but I have no desire to occupy time longer, though I &#39;make no apology for the length of my remarks. Every member of the Ministry pledged himself to leave office, and Ministers have come back a discredited Government, having degraded the public life of the country by the breaking of their solemn word. No dressing up in new suits, no resigning and accepting office again, gets rid of the fact that they have been responsible for the most discreditable proceeding in Australian politics. . It would be wise if, instead of trying to cover up their tracks, and offering the extremists what they want, they would give up their idea of still&#34; forcing conscription. Unless, when the Leader of the Government sits down, there has been a clear reply to my statement, I shall continue to spread the belief that they are still forcing conscription. I am making that statement repeatedly, in the hope that Ministers will have the good sense to give it the emphatic denial to which it is entitled, if it is wrong. </para>

                        <para>- No ; because I know you too well. The honorable senator, speaking at Bathurst, said that he and his colleagues would go out of office if the &#34; No&#34; vote were in the majority. The Prime Minister said at Bendigo that the Government would not, and could not, continue to govern unless they secured the power they sought. Every member of the Government gave practically the same pledge, and when, notwithstanding that pledge, I see them still in office, they must pardon me if I refuse to accept their word. </para>

                        <para>- I am dissatisfied and grievously disappointed. I have put before the Senate a quotation showing that a high regard for honour on the part of British statesmen has cost Britain thousands of lives, and an expenditure of many millions of money in this war. They knew what the keeping of their promise to Belgium would mean; but they kept it, and  when  I am confronted with a Government who give us a pledge to-day and break it to-morrow, I feel constrained to speak with warmth and feeling, in the hope that there may be at least one member of their party who will differ from the view they take of the duty of the public men of Australia. </para>

                    <para>.- The motion before the Chair is for the first reading of a Bill to grant and apply out of the Consolidated Revenue a sum not exceeding &#163;2,284,037 for the services of the present financial year; but although I listened very attentively to the speech just concluded by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> I certainly failed to hear him make any reference to it. While he expressed the hope that there would be greater cooperation and unanimity on the part of political parties in this Parliament in carrying on the government of Australia during the present war, I can conceive of no utterance more calculated than was his speech to widen the breach, or, at all events, to perpetuate the political bitterness existing between political parties today. </para>

                <para>I may be permitted very briefly to refer to one or two of the statements made by the honorable senator. In the first place, he declared - and the statement seemed to cause him the greatest anxiety - that there were not in Australia more than 60,000 eligible single men who could be called up should a system of compulsion be adopted. As a matter of principle that point is not of very great importance to the- main question. If there were only 60,000 eligible single men who could be called up under the compulsory system&#39;, then only60,000 would be called up. I should be very sorry to learn, however, that Australia&#39;s manpower did not: exceed that number. I doubt very much the honorable senator&#39;s figures. I prefer to take those advanced by the Government Statistician, although he does not vouch for their absolute accuracy.. </para>

The figures now presented by the Government Statistician in regard to this question of eligibles are more or less approximate and of a guesswork character ;. but he should be in a better position to make an accurate guess -if I may use that expression - than any honorable&#39; senator, not excepting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>

                        <para>- I assure the honorable senator that my statement is correct. The Statistician estimated that the number of men between the ages of twenty and forty-five years was 370,000. He then proceeded to eliminate from that total those of enemy origin, as well as the children of persons of enemy origin. From the result so obtained he deducted 50 per cent, as representing those who might possibly be ineligible, and showed that there were 145,000 or 147,000 eligibles between the ages of twenty and forty-five years. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. The exemptions to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> has referred were not provided for in the estimate made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> that we had not. in Australia more than 60,000 eligibles who could have been called up under compulsion. The Statistician shows that after allowing a deduction of 50 per cent, for ineligibles between the ages of twenty and forty-five years there are over 145.000, and I prefer to take his figures rather than mere guess-work computations made by honorable senators or any one else. Be that as it may, even if there are only 60,000 eligibles, there is no reason why they should not bear their responsibilities for the defence of: those privileges which they enjoy equally with the men who are now fighting for their country, many of them married and a considerable number of therm  under twenty years of age. </para>

                <para>The honorable senator, apparently in a bad temper, hurled against me and other honorable senators the charge of slandering Australia. My reply is that Australia has sent to the Front a wonderfully large number of men who have done marvellously well. At! the same time the men who will not go - those who shirk their responsibility and those who encourage them to shirk it - are not entitled to take any credit for the good and great deeds done by the men who fought on Gallipoli and who have fought in Flanders and other places. In one district in an electorate in Tasmania, which* I represented for some years, there were five families, each of which sent three sons, making fifteen  recruits  in all, while of another family of eight sons not one joined the Forces. Is there any credit due to that family of eight boys for the great deeds done by the men who went from the district of Hastings? </para>

                        <para>- Some of them were, and I admire their attitude, because it was absolutely unselfish, but I fail to recognise the logic of fathers, mothers, sisters, and  brothers of the men who are laying down their lives for the freedom of Australia in voting against a proposition to insure reinforcements. At present I shall not refer further to the speech of the honorable senator opposite. I was .strongly opposed to a referendum on the question of compulsory military service, and I declined any responsibility for the one taken on the 28th October, 1916. When I learnt that there was a possibility of trouble in this connexion, I visited Melbourne, and, in conversation with honorable senators and members who were then my colleagues - as I hope they will be again - I strongly advised them to take the responsibility devolving on them as statesmen, and, if they were convinced that it was a proper thing for Australia to send more men, to put an Act through Parliament. </para>

That manifesto set forth that if the party to- which they belonged were returned to power, it would, recognising that the very existence of Australia was bound up in the existence of the Old Country, do anything and everything under all circumstances to stand behind the Imperial Government in this war. That manifesto, on which the Fisher Government and honorable senators opposite were returned in September, 1914, went further, and declared that the  party  accepted the annunciation by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> in his policy speech, that in this war Australia was behind the Mother Country to the &#34; last man and the last shilling.&#34; </para>

It is important to have men now in order to end the war as soon .as possible, but the collection of the &#34; last shilling &#34; must go on, at any rate, during the life of this generation to meet our war obligations. </para>

                <para>I strongly advised the members of the then Labour party to carry out their pledge. I&#39; took an opportunity to go direct from Hobart to Sydney to meet the Prime Minister on his return from the Old Country, in order to get from him, at first hand, his impressions regarding the progress of the war, and the need for further effort on the part of Australia. I have always been convinced that, excepting, perhaps, Canada, the Dominions, and particularly Australia and New Zealand, will not have done their share until they have done all that is humanly possible, and the war is over. Everything that we possess, and all the great potentialities of the future, depend on our success in the war. Canada is in rather a different position, because she has at her back the great American nation, and there is not much danger of German power ever entering the Dominion. Apart altogether from the duty which Australia owes to the Mother Country and to the Empire, she has the great incentive of absolute self-preservation. Therefore, I repeat that Australia will never be able to fully do her part until she has done all that is absolutely possible- </para>

                        <para>- I believe you were, and I know that I was hooted and howled at all over the place. The position I then took up was that the war was unjust and unreasonable, and that Great Britain had been drawn into it by the German Jews of London, who were vitally interested in the Transvaal gold-mines. I held that Australia - then on the eve of her birth as a Federated nation - ought not to come into existence under the cloud of war, and stained by unnecessary bloodshed. All the arguments I then used have been proved correct, and their greatest justification is in the fact that, immediately Great Britain conquered the South African Republics, she handed them back self-government; and that to-day England&#39;s then greatest enemy - General Botha - is banishing Britain&#39;s enemies from the shores of Africa. And another  man who was a formidable antagonist in that war, General the Right Honorable J. C. Smuts, is a member of the British War Council. However, all this is apart from the question. I merely mention these facts to show that my attitude on that occasion has since been justified. </para>

                <para>In regard to the success of the voluntary system, whilst the supply of willing men was unexhausted, voluntarism was a great success. I constituted the War Council in Tasmania, and have been a member of it ever since its inception. I knew exactly what was being done in that State, and it is a remarkable thing that the experience of one State in these matters is invariably the reflex of the experiences of other States. At the beginning of the war there was no difficulty at all in getting recruits. Men enlisted by the hundred. In the first four months of this war 52,000 men enlisted, whilst during the four months ended the 31st October last there were only 14,000 enlistments. </para>

                        <para>- The conscription fight sent a number of men into the camps who otherwise would not have gone. I met many men who signified their intention of enlisting rather than run the risk of being conscripted. I take no responsibility for the referendum. I would not have agreed to refer such a question to the electors, because I realize that it is an issue upon which we cannot get a true expression of the people&#39;s opinion. There are so many interests involved, and there is so much likelihood of the electors giving a false vote, if I may use that expression, that it is absolutely impossible to get a true sense of the people on such a question. For instance, we have in the community those people who are opposed to compulsion of any kind. They do not believe in men being forced to- go to the war, neither do they believe in heavy taxation. Then there are the men who have been deliberately misled by the speakers on the negative side. The electors were told that if they voted &#34; Yes &#34; they would fasten Prussian conscription on Australia for all time. The men who made that statement knew it to be untrue, but the fear of such a consequence would frighten many a man. He would say, &#34; I would sooner take the risk of Australia going down, even now, than I would place upon my sons and my sons&#39; sons the yoke of military conscription.&#34; </para>

                <para>Another section which counted very effectively comprises the soldiers who did not agree to assistance being sent to them by means of compulsion. Many soldiers argued that as they had sufficient love for Australia to offer their lives for her, they would not accept assistance from men who had to be compelled to go to the Front. They failed to recognise that Australia was the only important section of the Allies that did not have conscription;. and that they were fighting side by side with conscripts iron Great Britain, France, Belgium, Canada, and New Zealand. They failed to recognise that practically all the men who were fighting for the continuance of the world&#39;s freedom were conscripts. There was another section among the men on active service comprising those who, having gone through certain hardships, felt that it would be unfair to force others to undergo the same. They were a self-sacrificing class of men who did not complain of their own lot, and although they recognised that it was important that more men should go to assist them, they would not ask for them to be compelled to go. No man recorded an affirmative vote for the pleasure of doing it. I venture to say that not one person put a cross opposite the word &#34; Yes &#34; with any pleasure. </para>

                        <para>- I was pointing out that it is impossible by a referendum to obtain the real opinion of the people on such a question as compulsory reinforcements for the defence of the country. I have referred to a number of conflicting interests which prompted the electors to vote &#34;No,&#34; while on the other hand there are not more than two reasons why on such a question an elector should vote &#34;Yes.&#34; One reason is love of country and patriotism, and the fear of the loss of the freedom of the country, and the other, which may be associated with the first, consideration for a father, son, or friend, who might be serving at the Front. No man or woman, for the mere pleasure of doing so, voted &#34; Yes &#34; at the referendum to compel men to serve their country. Every man and every woman who voted &#34; Yes &#34; realized that it was an unpleasant duty to the State to do so. The odds and the interests on the &#34; No &#34; side were so great that the appeal was entirely one-sided, and it was thus impossible to get a fair expression of the opinion of the people on such a question by the method adopted. The principle of the referendum is entirely inapplicable to such a question. War is not democratic. It is the very antithesis of  all  that is democratic. If all the nations of the world were Democracies we might take steps to prevent war and avoid that state of madness into which the world is at present thrown, and prevent the horrible outrages that are being perpetrated in the present struggle. But while one country is ruled by an autocracy or a bureaucracy, those nations who desire to enjoy the privileges and advantages of Democracy must themselves institute an autocracy in order to protect their democratic privileges and advantages. A referendum is qf the very essence of Democracy - rule by the people. Even if it were practical to obtain a sound judgment from the people on such a question as reinforcements by means of a referendum the very necessity to reveal information which should not be allowed to reach the enemy in order to enable the people to understand the true position is of itself an important reason why the question of war should never be decided by a plebiscite. Giving such information to the electors it is impossible to avoid giving it to the enemy. One question, for instance, which had to be dealt with during the last referendum campaign was the number of Australian troops in England. When dealing with millions of men the number Australia has supplied for the conduct of the war is comparatively insignificant, but an important principle was still involved. Those opposed to an affirmative vote at the referendum, in order to induce people to vote &#34; No,&#34; repeatedly stated that there were in England at least 121,000 Australians who might be used as reinforcements. That statement had to be met, and it was necessary to give official figures to show that the actual number of Australians in England was only 71,000, and that that number included post-office officials, hospital attendants, orderlies, and all the rest. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. It had to be explained that the whole of the fighting men available for reinforcements in the course of training, or already trained in England, numbered only 20,000. This information coming from Australia was, perhaps, of very small importance to the enemy, but the principle involved was the same, whether the number was 20,000 or 500,000.. This illustrates the fact that the submission of a question like that which was the subject of the referendum to a popular vote is condemned to failure from the start. </para>

The Leader of the Official Labour party in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gardiner)</inline> has dealt with the pledge given by the Government at the beginning of the last referendum. I have no sympathy with that pledge. I did not agree with it. It was a foolish pledge, or a foolish threat to make. It was a negation of the principle of the referendum, and was something which in the interests of Australia could not be carried out. </para>

                        <para>- At one time we could not, but at present we could not throw it into worse. I have not lost hope yet for honorable senators opposite. I believe that a day will come when they will assert their authority, and refuse to obey instructions given to them by gentlemen outside, estimable as they are, and right enough in their own way, but who have not the responsibility that honorable senators have. By refusing those instructions they will regain the old prestige which they enjoyed during the early days of the Labour movement, and return to carry out the very excellent work which they assisted to initiate and advance to a certain stage in this nation. </para>

                        <para>- No. When I last contested the position of leader of that party there were only fifteen members in it, and I was given twelve votes, while the present occupant of the position gained three. That was before I took part in a referendum to the people on a question where both sides were supposed to have absolute freedom to express their views and induce the people to accept them. I laid the question before my party before I took action. I said, &#34; I am going to take a certain course, and hope you will all do the same, but if you do not agree with me you are absolutely free to adopt the course which your conscience dictates to you is right.&#34; They all agreed that that was the proper stand to take. I took that course, and was rejected from the position after ten years of leadership. They did this, not of their own volition, but pursuant to instructions which they received from outside. The correspondence on that matter is now on the file. While the party submits to that kind of thine, I say with regret that the&#39; government of this nation is not safe in their hands, and it is not desirable to place it there. In the course of his speech. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> referred to the industrial rebellion that took place some little time ago. I could not imagine anything more inconsistent with the fact than his statement that the National party, to which I belong, forced   the strike upon the workers. I remember the honorable senator, with his usual force and eloquence, dealing with that question in the Senate for a considerable time, and asking the Commonwealth Government to take steps to bring the strike to an end. He spoke for about half-an-hour on one phase of the matter, dealing with what he called card No. 6,  pointing  out its evils, and tell-, ing us that was the only card he could get as a sample. </para>

                        <para>- Everybody who knows anything about the supervision of work performed by men knows that such a report must come in to the head of a Department. Does not the honorable senator realize that it is a greater protection to the men themselves if the sub-foreman is compelled to put his report concerning his men in writing than if he has merely to go to the office and deliver it verbally? Every person in charge of men has: to report to his superior from time to time whether his gang is satisfactory or not. But the comedy of the whole  proposition  lay in the fact that after the honorable senator had spoken for half-an-hour on this particular card, he had to acknowledge that no such card was in existence. </para>

                        <para>- No. The strike was a political rebellion against the success of the National party, and no word was uttered on the other side of the Senate to point out to the men the foolishness of their action. No effort was made to induce them to. accept that legal process, for which the Labour party hitherto had always fought, to bring about industrial peace. Nothing was said to impress upon the men the seriousness of their action in bringing about a cessation of work while this country was at war with an outside enemy. Bad as any strike might be at any time, it is infinitely worse during war, especially when reasonable facilities are provided for the redress of grievances by appealing to lawful tribunals. </para>

                <para>In my opinion, it would be foolish to betray the electors of this country by placing the government in the hands of the Official Labour party. Concerning the pledge given by the Prime Minister, I want to make it clear that I did not approve of it in any way, and I am satisfied that the interests of Australia would not be protected if that pledge were carried out in the spirit. Nor would it be honoured by the selection from the National party, other than the present Ministers, of a Government to carry on the affairs of this country. That pledge could only be honoured by handing over the government to the Tudor party. </para>

                <para>SenatorEARLE. - No, it is not. There are sufficient members in the National party to form half-a-dozen Governments,but if that course had been taken the pledge would not have been honoured any more than by the resignation of the late Government and there commissioning of the Prime Minister to form a new Government consisting of the same members. </para>
                <para>Another grievance I have with members of the Official Labour party is that, while they profess to believe in the voluntary system of recruiting, there has not yet been any whole-hearted effort on their part to co-operate with the National party in giving effect to that system. When the last referendum was decided upon, and a special effort was made in my own State to press forward the voluntary system of recruiting, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ready,</inline> a pronounced &#34; No &#34; voter, accepted the position of  Chairman  of the Recruiting Council of Tasmania, and, from that hour, dated his downfall. Members of the Official Labour party, either in State or Federal politics, rendered practically no assistance. </para>

I was one of his greatest friends, and strongly urged the Director of Recruiting to appoint him, because I realized that the members of the National party (had done all they could in the interests of voluntary recruiting, and had advised the adoption of the compulsory system. Then, surely, the proper thing, if they were sincere, was for those who had advised the people to vote against conscription to become prominent in advocating the voluntary system. Under these circumstances, honorable senators opposite will excuse me if I say that it isa tax on my credulity to ask me to believe that they are anxious to recruit men for the reinforcement of those at the Front. </para>

                        <para>- Is that so? The&#34; work that the present Prime Minister has done is, after all, the measure by which he will be judged hereafter. All statesmen are judged by their usefulness and not by the regard or disregard of the people for whom they laboured. Let us remember in the midst of all this bitter denunciation of the &#39;Prime  Minister  - denunciation which in some cases dates back only to the 20th December last and in others&#34; to the date on which he left the Labour party - that the purely political side of his activities is by far the least; that he has, ever since he took office as Prime Minister of this country, undertaken tasks the magnitude and importance of which are beyond the conception of honorable senators opposite. He has organized our greatest industries. He has found markets for our products; ships to carry our products overseas; money to pay the producer, even although the article produced has not yet reached its destination; and storage accommodation for our fast  accumulating stocks. By timely pools and sagacious selling he has saved many of our industries from absolute extinction. </para>

Alongside these achievements the referendum i3 nob so important. v Had the proposals of the Government been carried on 20th December last, its importance to Australia would have been infinitesimal compared with the importance of the steps already taken by the Prime Minister to safeguard industry. Seven thousand men a month mean much to the forces in the trenches and to our prestige amongst belligerent nations; but the organization of Australia&#39;s primary industries and the disposal of her primary products are the very essence of our material and economic being. Without the one we can live, however disgraced, but without the other all our activities cease and our limbs fall practically paralyzed. </para>

                <para>What strange anomaly is this, then, that provokes criticism, in a comparatively unimportant matter, and withholds support in one of vital necessity to the country ? The people of Australia should hold themselves fortunate in having as Prime Minister in this . hour of crisis the one man who cannot only handle business on the colossal scale rendered necessary by the circumstances, but can do so in face of all the many difficulties created by the war. No other man, I believe I am correct in saying, would have so won the confidence of Britain and smoothed the way for profita ble business and finance. No other man would have been permitted to buy ships when Britain herself was so hungrily searching for freight. No other man would have so&#39; ably represented us at the conferences ab Home in 1916 - every honorable senator was -loud in his applause of the Prime Minister&#39;s actions on that occasion - and no other man can possibly represent us at the conferences to discuss the terms of peace. </para>

When this political clamour dies down, and the things that really matter to Australia are reviewed, the people of this country will give full credit to the man who possessed the imagination, energy, and pluck that our grave circumstances demanded in a leader. The whole of our politics as such - the whole of the talking done during the elections and the referendum - have, not contributed one fraction &#39;towards winning the war. Apart from the services rendered by our soldiers, the practical work so far done in this war will be traced, when our history comes to be written, to the administration of the Honorable William Morris Hughes and his Ministers assisting him. </para>

                <para>From the outbreak of war, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> has had a controlling hand in the affairs of this country. From September, 1914, to October, 1.915, he was a member of the Cabinet, and in that capacity initiated most of the early legislation connected with the war. From the 27th October 1915, onwards, however, he has held the office of Prime Minister uninterruptedly. During this period, the problems confronting the Government of this country - politically .&#39;ind industrially - have been Unique in history. The war created conditions for the solution of which there was no precedent. Legislators were forced to grapple with each new situation as it arose, depending entirely on their own judgment. In these circumstances, amongst the dangers which menaced Australia, that of choosing an inefficient leader was by no means the least. There have been no less than six Governments in this country since the outbreak of war, and of these <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> formed four. During his terms of office the electors were appealed to- on three occasions - one general election and two referenda. Unfortunately for him, the interest in the political situation has at times been so great that the larger issues have been entirely overlooked by the citizens of the Commonwealth. The breaking up of the old Labour party, the formation of the National party, the attempt to form a Coalition Government of all parties and the refusal of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor,</inline> the exciting election of 5th May, the two vigorous campaigns on the conscription issue, have revealed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> to the public as a leader of great resource and marvellous energy. Yet the events which served to bring him so prominently before the people have kept them from a realization of the greater national work in which he was continually engaged. The political side of his work, though naturally the most prominent, was by far the least important. </para>
                <para>Australia, during the period of the Prime Minister&#39;s leadership, was faced with a situation so grave that only prompt action on his part saved the country from temporary financial chaos. Freight was practically unobtainable; the usual markets for our foodstuffs, metals, <inline font-style="italic">Sic.,</inline> were entirely dislocated; the producers of this country were faced with a situation for which there seemed to be no solution. And on them the whole structure of Australia&#39;s commercial and industrial welfare rested. How <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> stepped in, organized the primary industries, found new markets, sold the produce, provided the freight, and financed the whole venture, is a story that cannot be told in detail. But if the people of Australia will remember the vast, amount of Australia&#39;s business at Home and overseas that is either overlooked or entirely controlled by the Prime Minister, they will appreciate to some extent the vitally important functions which, apart entirely from, politics, have been attached to that office. </para>

                <para>The organization of our great primary industries with the object of marketing the whole of the &#34;produce was a colossal undertaking.  None  could foresee, and few can yet appreciate, its ramifications. Pools were formed of almost all the producers in the country; the Government made the sale, provided the freight,  obtained  and -distributed the money. At a time when so many of the world&#39;s producers were  unable  to find markets, the Commonwealth Government stepped in and relieved the Australian farmer of .all responsibility and risk.

The price of cornsacks was fixed to prevent exploitation of the farmer; the Government itself purchased huge quantities of sacks - until the makers refused to supply orders. To keep up the supply of wheat, advances were made on crops unsold, .and guaranteed prices .given for crops unsown.

                <para>In other directions, also, fresh difficulties were encountered. To assist the fruit-growers, the Government secured large orders from Britain and &#39; America for jam and tinned fruits, but the jam manufacturers then clamoured for cheaper sugar and tin plates. The Government solved the sugar problem, and by bringing their influence to bear on the Munitions Departments in England they gradually arranged for supplies of tin plates. This increased local manufacture created a demand for machinery, and again the Government were called upon to plead with the British authorities. Special permits had to be obtained for such, articles, for in many cases their export from Great Britain was absolutely .prohibited... Honorable senators will realize how disastrously private enterprise would have fared., and .how vitally important was the action taken by the Australian Government. The shortage ox&#39; freight led to a shortage&#39; of imports, and, to prevent monopolies and exploitation of the people, the Government created a Prices Board. Then, to stimulate local production and encourage industries, it established a Science and Industries Bureau. This Department has not yet begun te bear fruit, but I expect important developments from it in the very near future. </para>
                <para>The dependence of one industry upon another, the relation of one problem, to another, have thus gradually&#39; extended the scope of the Government&#39;s operations until at this moment they practically hold the whole of the industrial welfare of the country in their hands-- On their administration, not only in the political, but also in the purely business sense, rests the welfare of the nation alike with that of the individual. </para>
                <para>Some  idea of the magnitude of the transactions in which the Commonwealth lias been involved since the outbreak of the war, will be gathered from the following tables showing, the moneys that Great Britain has, expended, on our account, and. paid to. us directly im cash.. I am sure these figures will in  terest  honorable, senators. Iel&#39; -order to, maintain our soldiers at the Front, Great Britain, has. paid &#163;100-, 750,000.. She has paid for wheat &#163;51,095,000, for wool  &#163;64,000,000,  for butter &#163;4,5.&#39;3Q,000, for jam &#163;3,000,000, for rabbits- &#163;1,500:000 and for metals &#163;19,000,000;, or a total, paid to. us of &#163;2.43,875,000,. much of it for- material  which  has not yet been- delivered. Those figures are by no means exhaustive.-. In, addition-, there were several smaller purchases: by Great. Britain which increase- the total, considerably. For this year alone no less- a. sum than &#163;76,750,000- will be required to- finance the  primary  producers^. </para>
                <para>The total quantity of wheat pooled of. the 1915-16 crop was 162,250y000bushels, and of the 1916-17 crop 138,000,000 bushels. These figures exclude &#34;seed wheat and a certain quantity of feed wheat. The magnitude* of the scheme can be gauged, and the helplessness of the Australian growers realized, if they had- been, dependent, upon, the usual marketing channels. This beneficent- monopoly may be- described, as&#39; the- greatest co-operative venture in the world. It has given rise to the largest single wheat transaction recorded hi history, namely, the sale of 3r000,000 tons by the Government of Australia to the Imperial Government for a sum of &#163;26,.600,000. A further quantity of. 200,000 tons was sold to France. For the 1915-16 crop, the farmers have already been paid 4s. 6d. per bushel,, less rail freights and agents&#39; handling charges, the total payment amounting to &#163;31,920,000. For the 1916-17 crop, growers have been paid, so far, 3s. &#39;per bushel, involving an amount of &#163;2.0&#39;,262,000. In regard to the 1917-18 crop,, arrangements have now been made for an advance of 3s. per bushel, involving an amount estimated at &#163;15,750,000. Up to date,, no, less a sum than &#163;51,095,000 has been paid for wheat; and as Great Britain paid for the bulk, of the grain.- before delivery,, the Government were able to: guarantee- the- farmers- 4s.. per bushel for the 1917-18 crop, though the possibility of transporting it overseas, was more- than remote-. The importance of the steps taken- by the Prime Minister in. regard to wheat cam scarcely be- realized.. Had there been no guarantee, or. had Great Britain insisted on delivery before- payment, thousands, of. acres of wheat-bearing la-nd would have gone out of production,, thousands of: farmers would have  been  bankrupt, and millions, of pounds: now circulating in. our midst: would never have entered Australia.. </para>
                <para>The whole of the wool clip has been handled&#39; by a central committee in much the. same way as wheat. The task may be. gauged by the figures for the 1916-17  clip.  Of this the quantity appraised under the Imperial Government&#39;s purchase was, of greasy wool,. 323-, 748,376 lbs.; and scoured, 34,310,645 lbs. Nearly 300,000 separate and independent valuations were made of wool classified into 381 types. Foi- the wool appraised in 1916-17 an. average price of 15.&#163;.d. per lb. was realized,, or a total of &#163;25,340,540; of this&#39; Great Britain paid &#163;24,268,127. Almost the whole of this clip was paid for before delivery, and arrangements have now been made with Great Britain to purchase the 1917-18 clip for approximately &#163;40,000,000.. </para>
                <para>The operations of the butter pool established in: May, 1917, have resulted, not only in a. profit te the producer, but also in a saving to the consumer. The average price ruling in Australia from June to August, in 1917, was ls. 7d. per lb., whereas the average price ruling for the same months, over a series of years. ranged from ls. lOd. to 2s. per lb. Thus the pool assured to the Australian, consumer an adequate supply of butter and a financial saving of some thousands of pounds. The total value of the butter handled by the pool was &#163;8,500,000. In October, 1917, the Prime Minister completed arrangements for the sale to Great Britain of 30,000 tons of butter at 151s. per cwt. f .o.b. for first grade - 90 points - ls, less for each grade downwards, and ls. more for grades above 90 points, the total amount involved being &#163;4,530,000. In addition to the above prices, Australian producers share in any profits made by the sale of the butter in Great Britain. </para>
                <para>The shortage of refrigerated space and tonnage generally threatened the fruit industry in Australia with almost total extinction, but prompt action by the Prime Minister and his Government saved it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> sold to the British Government 12,000,000 lbs. of assorted jams at 5&#163;d. per lb., and some thousands of tons of dried fruits; also, in order to enable the fruit-growers in Australia to compete in jam-making with other countries, the Government made arrangements by which cheap sugar, at &#163;24 per ton in bond, was made available to- the manufacturers, and assured a supply of tinplate which otherwise would not have been obtainable. In addition to the jam sold to Great Britain, 3S,000,000 lbs. were sold to the United States at 5&#163;d. per lb.- or &#163;1,093,450 over all. Altogether it is estimated that the amount of jam sold since the beginning of the war is valued at &#163;3,000,000. Another order for 100,000 tins of canned fruit was received from Great Britain at prices ranging from 7s. 6d. to 8s. 3d. per dozen, but so far only 35,000 tins have been offered. In addition, 105,000 2-lb. tins of pineapple were placed at 7&#163;d. per lb., and 1,800 cases of evaporated apples at 7 dr. per lb. These three orders alone represent approximately &#163;131,000. Apart from the matter of export, the Government have financed the fruit-growers of Australia in a scheme for marketing their surplus products within the Commonwealth. </para>
                <para>Another industry which some are apt to despise - the rabbit packing and export industry - has also been considered. In February, 1917, the Government sold to the British Government .the whole of the rabbit pack, valued at over &#163;1,000,000, and representing over 30,000,000 rabbits. This deal in itself is remarkable, for it amounts to double the quantity exported in any previous year. A further contract has been made for the 1918 pack, of which Great Britain is prepared to take no less than 20,000 tons. </para>
                <para>The Prime Minister&#39;s action in ridding the metal industry of all German influence, and then organizing the production and sale of metals on a national basis, is known throughout the world.  In November, 1915, he first established the Australian Metal Exchange, and since that date over &#163;19,000,000 worth of metals have been sold to Great Britain alone. In addition to the sale to Great Britain, extensive valuable postwar contracts have &#39; been made with Belgium and France, which will place the metal industry on a basis far sounder than it has ever occupied. The importance of this action cannot be too greatly emphasized, for control of Australian metals is of vital importance not only to the whole Empire, but also to Great Britain&#39;s Allies. </para>
                <para>The Government have also sold the whole of the present season&#39;s exportable surplus of cheese, which may be estimated at 3,000,000 lbs., at 9d. per lb. for first grade. The transaction involves approximately &#163;75,000. </para>
                <para>Most of the problems which confront Australia&#39;s producers arise from the shortage of &#39;shipping. The serious condition of affairs in Australia in this connexion will be seen in the fact that during June of last year not one bushel of wheat was shipped from the Commonwealth, although at the time there was awaiting shipment sufficient cargo to fill fifteen refrigerated vessels and 548 general cargo ships of an average tonnage. The steps taken by the Government to relieve the strain which they foresaw would come are now fairly well known. Freight was organized, vessels chartered, and others taken over from the enemy. Fifteen steamers were purchased in 1915 at a price of &#163;2,062,000, a transaction which is now regarded everywhere as a masterly stroke. &#39;Although under the Government freight scheme, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> kept down freights to the lowest point, these ships have already earned enormous profits, and. could to-day be sold for double the price paid for them. Fourteen new ships are now being built in America for the Commonwealth Government, and will shortly be engaged in transporting Australia&#39;s products overseas. </para>
                <para>In addition, a comprehensive shipbuilding scheme, which I have already alluded to, has been launched in Australia. Experts have been engaged, agreements made with unions concerned, sites chosen, material provided for, and everything done essential to the successful launching of this great industry. The building of ships will commence forthwith. The importance of this scheme, not only from the stand-point of freight, <inline font-style="italic">i.e.,</inline> of tonnage independence, out also in relation to the metal industry, will be readily recognised. </para>
                <para>Had nothing been done bv the Prime Minister but the organization of tonnage at a time when the shipping problem was the most vital to the Empire, he might well have been satisfied with his. work, but taken in conjunction with the organization of primary industries, and the sale of produce to Great Britain, it forms but a link in one of the greatest national achievements of any statesman of the present day. </para>

I am anxious to deliver this statement, because everywhere I go I am asked by political opponents, &#34; What has the National party done to win the war?

                <para>The war created problems, not only in our markets abroad, but in the local markets. For example, when the values of rabbit skins rose to a high figure in England and America, it was obvious that trappers here would trap for skins instead of carcasses. This threatened not only to jeopardize the Imperial Government&#39;s rabbit purchase, but also the supplies of fur for local hat manufacturers. The Government promptly stepped in and controlled the rabbit skins trade.Under the scheme, the skins are bought at schedule rates (from 27d. per lb. downwards), and after the hat manufacturers of the Commonwealth have been supplied with their requirements, the balance is sold at auction. This means a saving to Australian hat-makers of not less than &#163;40,000 a year. As the price of hats is also regulated, the benefit goes to the community. I find that the price of hats is now about the same as in normal times, as I bought one a little while ago. The profit to the Government over the year will be about &#163;120,000. </para>

                <para>In sugar the Government&#39;s action was the most important and far-reaching of any other which concerned the local market. The entire sugar crops of Queensland for 1915-16 and 1916-17 were purchased by the Commonwealth-, and the sugar sold to the consumer at the pre-war price of 3&#189;d. per lb. Before the war the miller received &#163;&#39;13 per ton. Under the Government&#39;s scheme he received &#163;18 for the 1915-16 crop, and &#163;21 for the 1916-17 crop.

                <para>The amount of national wealth actually handled or controlled by the Prime Minister is enormous. Probably no corporation in this world has ever in its history been responsible for the business management of so much wealth. Yet, despite the fact that the way was beset with countless problems arising from the state of war, this great national business undertaking has resulted in triumphant success. Better profits have been paid to the producer, better wages to the worker, and last, but by no means least, the consumer has been safeguarded to a very great degree from exploitation. The value, ire round numbers, of the commodities sold, handled, or controlled by the Government - which some say is doing nothing to assist in winning the war - during the past year is as follows : - </para>

                <para>It must be remembered that most of the measures introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> for the betterment, if not the actual salvation, of Australia were bitterly opposed by his political enemies.  His  action in leaving the Labour party made him the persona&#93; target of the extremists. Every conceivable method of discounting or hindering his work was resorted to by unprincipled politicians and private citizens. The farmer was told that the Wheat Pool robbed him; the primary producers were everywhere deceived by the grossest lies concerning the actions taken to safeguard them; voluntary recruiting was definitely hindered by sections who merely desired to see the Hughes Administration discredited. Never in the history of Australia have so many vital problems been &#39;faced by a Prime Minister, and never has he been confronted by so much open and concealed hostility. The deepest criticism came from those who most benefited under the scheme; no one seemed to appreciate the absolute futility of proceeding along the usual channels. The success which has attended his truly great efforts is nothing short of remarkable in the light of the difficulties to be overcome. TEat the public of Australia, who have benefited - and all have benefited - by his actions, will appreciate to the full the work done, is more than one can expect, but at least it is reasonable to ask that its value shall not be submerged in criticism over something political, which even had it been successful would have contributed nothing to the economic welfare of Australia. </para>
                <para>The problem of raising recruits was one of the most important that confronted the various Governments led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes.</inline> On his&#39; accession to office in </para>
                <para class="block">October, 1915, recruiting was falling gradually away. The first excited rush to the colours following the declaration of war had stopped. Recruiting had developed into a slow laborious business, and the Government set about a definite business scheme of organization. Committees were established throughout the Commonwealth, and branches formed wherever it was possible to form them. All the volunteer assistance obtainable was organized, and every device of the volunteer system exploited to the limit. Its possibilities .were exhausted. Never before in the world&#39;s history, possibly, has the system been given such a trial. The demands for men, however, more than overtook the supply, and resulted in the two conscription referenda which the people rejected. Although the Prime Minister was the most earnest disciple of compulsory reinforcements, during his term of office no less than 189,802 enlistments were obtained under the voluntary system. </para>
                <para>We live to-day in what London newspapers term a &#34;Paradise of Plenty.&#34; The phenomenal fact that we do so is due to the foresight, energy, and indomitable perseverance of the one man against whom the barbed darts of venomous criticism, both inside and outside Parliament, have so recently been ruthlessly launched? </para>
                <para>I make this special reference to the Prime Minister - first, because he deserves it; secondly, because he is the one person in whom the venomous hatred of Australia&#39;s enemies is centred. May he be granted health and strength to long guide the destinies of Australia in the manner in which he has been doing for the last few years. I pray that some vein of reasonableness will be tapped from which honorable members on the opposite side may be replenished. Simply because they disagree with him on one subject, they should not blind themselves to the great and good things the Prime Minister has done. They should try to be more equitable in their criticism of a man who has done more for this country and the Empire, as well as for his fellow workers, than can be credited to any other person in any country in the world. </para>

There was no justification whatever for this course. The Government had decided upon a referendum; but, instead of taking the people into their confidence at the earliest opportunity, they kept the matter secret until it suited them to make an announcement. In fairness to all concerned, ample opportunity of enrolment should have been given to all electors if they were to get a fair and square deal. &#39; </para>

                        <para>- I am not complaining so much as simply stating the facts. We were told, when we agreed to the War Precautions Act, and sometimes when we were asked to pass regulations under that Act, that they would only be used for the purpose of preventing the enemy from securing information; but we have since found that the War Precautions Act, the Crimes Act, and a number of other measures have been used mainly against those Australians who hold views different from members on the Ministerial benches, and I have no hesitation in saying that the action of the Government in regard to the censorship was responsible for throwing many thousands, of votes against the referendum. Then, again, the police,-&#39; though in some instances they were moderately fair, allowed speakers at &#34; No &#34; meetings to be hustled most unreasonably. </para>

                        <para>- They took good care that proper order was maintained. The prosecution of public men who made statements that were not in strict accordance with fact - although they spoke on the best information obtainable - and the prosecution of newspapers, was directly connived at by the Government to defeat the referendum. I am quite sure that, the Government realize now that the defeat of the referendum proposals was largely due to the causes that I have stated. What could be more ridiculous than for the Prime Minister, before the referendum of 1916, to force large numbers of young men into camp? By this blunder they lost tens of thousands of votes. </para>

                        <para>- I have taken part, in many campaigns, but I have never experienced so much personal abuse as was indulged in by the other side - from the Prime Minister downwards - during the recent referendum. It may not have been intended to arouse antipathy to members of the Nationalist party, and to stir up strong opposition to the principles they were advocating, but it certainly had that effect. I am glad that in the Senate, at all events, statements that are uncalled for, and not in accordance with fact, are not permissible under the Standing Orders, and must be withdrawn. </para>

                        <para>- I do. The old Government merely went out at one door and came in at the other. We were told only a few minutes agoby <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> of the magnificent work done by the Prime Minister in organizing the industries of Australia, as well as in other directions. He quite erroneously claimed for the present Government the credit of those achievements. Those who know anything of the facts, and are prepared to speak the truth concerning them, will admit at once that it was whilst Leader of the Labour party that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> took in hand the work of releasing the Australian metal trade from German influence. It was while he was Leader of the Labour party that he purchased the fifteen vessels now comprising the Commonwealth line of steamers, and carried out most of the other works referred to by the honorable senator. As a matter of fact, every one of those matters, with the exception of the agreement for the&#39; sale of rabbits to the British Government, were dealt with by the Prime Minister, either wholly or in part, while he was Leader of the Labour party. </para>

                <para class="block">Personally, I was all the time of the opinion that, no matter what happened, the late - or the present - Government would find ways and means of holding on to office. I sometimes thought that they might make some slight alteration in the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Ministry, but, on the whole, I felt that they would not relinquish their positions; and in this I was not disappointed. Many people, of course, were of opinion that the members of the Government actually meant what they said; and, in determining to hold on to office, the Ministry have brought the words of public men into greater disrepute than has any other event that has happened in the Commonwealth. In view of the f act that , the Government and their supporters in another place number fifty-three as against twenty-two Labour men, and about twenty-four as against twelve in the Senate, it seemed plain to me that they would  necessarily  remain in office; but these definite promises, threats, or pledges were repeated by prominent men in the Ministerial rank, not only in the few cases I have quoted, but all over the Commonwealth throughout the campaign, and the impression was left on the minds of a great number of electors that, unless there was a majority vote for the referendum proposal, they would not attempt, either as that Government or any other, to carry on the business of the country. However, they, have broken their pledge in word and deed, and, as I say, have brought the public&#39; utterances of public men into more disrepute than any other action could have done. </para>

                <para>The Government and their supporters charged the Labour party with doing nothing to win the war. I point out clearly and distinctly that, like the late Government, the present Government have a majority in both Chambers, and have absolute control of the affairs of the country. That being so, they have no right whatever to expect or rely on members of the Opposition to show them what to do. But as the Government have no initiative, and are perfectly helpless - as they have done nothing and are not likely to do anything - I shall show what, in my opinion, they can and ought to do in regard to recruiting, and, incidentally, towards winning the war. The first step on the part of the Government should be to increase the soldiers&#39; pay. It may be a matter of no importance to men who are receiving substantial pay themselves how the soldiers and their dependants are faring.- Is it fair to men who, in civil life, were receiving &#163;4 and &#163;5 per week when they enlisted, that they should be paid only 6s. per day ? Is such a pay fair to their wives and families or dependants ? </para>

This country is wealthy enough to bear an expense of the kind. Why not increase the salary of the soldier to the amount he was earning as a civilian when he enlisted ? This country can easily afford to do that, and would do it if the soldiers demanded it. The first thing the Government ought to do when it asks a man who has been earning &#163;4 or &#163;5 per week to leave his wife and family is to see that the dependants are left in possession of an income equal to what the man has earned in civil employment. </para>

                        <para>- Australia, through the men, at the Front, has done marvellously well. We have a right to see that &#39; the dependants of , a soldier are as well cared for as if the soldier were at home pursuing his ordinary avocation. If the Government wish to secure additional men to fight for the interests of the Commonwealth, the proper course is to at once increase the pay to the amount recruits were receiving when they were in civil employment. I believe the Government of New South Wales does make up the pay of those of its servants who enlist to the amount they were receiving as civilians. </para>

                        <para>- I should start straightway, and I should not mind if the increase were made retrospective. Nothing is too good for the men who went  to the Front, as I expect they will let us know when they return and become properly organized. I have suggested one means by which the Government lean substantially increase the number of recruits. There is so much distrust of the present Government among those who are eligible to go to the Front that the number of volunteers is decreasing day by day. The decrease may not be due to the fact that the present Government are in office, but that is my interpretation of the position. </para>

The time has come for the Government to realize that the dependants of soldiers cannot meet the expenses of living unless the pay is increased. I do not mind if the Government increase the rate to 8s. or 9s. per, day, or to the amount the man was receiving in civil employment. The pensions paid to the men who return maimed are not sufficient. </para>

                        <para>- At the time at which they were passed we may have been of opinion that they were sufficient or all that we could afford. But three years have elapsed since then, and in the meantime the pensions have been increased at least once. The time is opportune to increase them again. The country is immensely wealthy and can afford to pay an increase. If the Government sincerely desire to see more soldiers offering for military service let them increase the pay, the separation allowance, and the pensions; the public will be only too glad to meet the bill. Moreover, the Government and the departmental officers should treat with every courtesy, and particularly with promptitude, the claims of those women who have business relations with the Defence Department. Red-tape should be eliminated wherever possible, and whenever money is due they should receive it promptly. I have had brought under <inline font-style="italic">my</inline> notice many bitter complaints of almost interminable delay in regard to the payment of money that is due to relatives of soldiers. I quite realize that a Department which is called suddenly into being must take time to shake down into working order, and that men who have not had experience in military positions cannot be expected to work as efficiently as trained officers; but after three years the Defence Department should be in a position to deal  promptly  with any persons to whom money is due as a pension or as pay. I have suggested ways in which the Government may easily increase the number of recruits. </para>

                <para> Let them also re-assure the country by giving a definite promise that the idea of compulsion for  military  service abroad is definitely and finally abandoned. I am not sure that the public will accept the word of the Government, but if they do  not give such an assurance they will delay healing the breach that exists amongst the people to-day. We have sent, approximately, 400,000 men voluntarily. Probably a few more might have gone had they so desired, but the only way to get them is the method that I have pointed out. </para>
                <para>It has been suggested by some writers in the press that the construction of the cruiser <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide</inline> at Cockatoo Island, in Sydney Harbor, should be discontinued, and that the slip should be used for the construction of merchant vessels. If that suggestion were carried out it would . mean either that the uncompleted cruiser would be slipped to the bottom of the harbour, where it would block up the fairway, or that it would be dismantled, involving a waste of many thousand pounds. I hope that the Government will not entertain the idea. I saw the vessel under construction about seven days ago, and, from what I gather, work is proceeding upon it most expeditiously. There are from 400 to 500 men directly employed on it, and in the course of a few months it should be ready for launching.. Nothing should be done to interfere with its construction. Let it be launched, and then the slip-way, if necessary, can be used for the construction of one or more of the merchant vessels which it is contemplated shall be built. At present there is ample room for building those vessels without interfering with the <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide.</inline> I am glad to learn that something definite has been done in regard to the construction of vessels in Australia. </para>

We know very well that he did not mean the last man and the last shilling. We have not commenced to take the last shilling ; we have not commenced to think about it.

                        <para>- Yes, it is but a paltry sum. We hear that the war expenditure of Great Britain amounts already to over &#163;5,000,000,000, and her war budget runs into &#163;500,000,000 a year. What  is  &#163;2,000,000 a year to the people who own the Commonwealth of Australia It is an unconsidered trifle. </para>

                        <para>- -I am putting forward the necessity of getting the owners of Australia to pay the taxation, or most of it, required to carry on the war. The total amount they are to be called upon to pay  thiB  year is only &#163;2,110,000. As honorable senators are aware, the Senate was good enough to enable mc to obtain a return of the total value of the lands of the Commonwealth. They were returned as worth &#163;445,000,000. I do not say that that valuation is quite accurate, but  it  was as near as could be supplied from the information disclosed by the wealth census cards. I believe that the people who own land worth &#163;445,000,000 are not called upon to pay enough for its defence when they are asked to contribute only &#163;2,110,000 a year. What are our men fighting for ? They are fighting for&#34; Australia. Let honorable senators listen to . what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Outhwaite,</inline> M.P., said at a conference held in Glasgow on 4th December, 1916,- when the hall was packed to overflowing with from 700 to 800 persons - </para>

                <para>Lately wa have had some measures  of  land reform  in  the House  of  Commons. We have  had  a Small Colonics  Bill,  which  was a Bill to  purchase land at the  high  inflated war prices and  put  the soldiers upon  it.  That means,  if  you buy the land  on the high-price  basis,  and put the men on it,  they  will pay  a  high  rent  and  rates  and  taxes,  and it  means making such  men the  slaves  of the  soil.  To  the  man  who fought to save this land. &#39;from German possession you  SHY,  &#34; Before  you  can use  an  acre, you have to pay  &#163;50  or  &#163;60 an  acre to the landlord for permission to do so.&#34; That is the fate of the soldier who goes to fight for&#39; Great Britain. If he comes back and desires to produce anything, he has first of all to interview one of the* friends of honorable senators opposite, one of the landlords of Great Britain, and  plead with him to let him purchase some.  of  the land  he  has fought for. He has not the right  to  produce anything  at al)  unless he first of  all  agrees  ,to  pay the landlord &#163;50  or  &#163;60  an  acre for the land  he  requires. Where is the returned British soldier  .to  get that money out  of  his pay  of ls.  per day ! He must get a mortgage,  .or  something of the sort, and remain  an  absolute slave upon the land for the rest  of  his life. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Outhwaite</inline> went on to say - </para>
                <para>Well, you may accept that position  - I  don&#39;t think this audience will, and  I  think the soldier himself will have something to say. </para>
                <para class="block">Honorable senators will agree with me that when the soldier from Great Britain goes into Flanders, and fights, there for Great Britain,  he  should get better treatment  on  his return than to have  to  pay &#163;50  or  &#163;60  an  acre for&#39; the right  to  produce something whereon  to  live.

                        <para>- The honorable senator might do so if I were willing to take up land along the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway, where there is an average rainfall of 6 inches a year, and where in some years it does not rain at all. That is the place where, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> largie waa a member of the Labour party, it was said that he held a magnificent estate comprising 10,000 square miles, or 10,000 miles square. When the honorable member was a member of the Labour party he was said on that account to be the champion land monopolist, but since he went over to the other side we hear nothing more about it. There is, no. doubt, plenty of land to be obtained along the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway, where the rainfall amounts to only 6 inches a year, but&#39; I do not think that land will be rushed for many years to come. The fact remains that there aro plenty of good lands in the Commonwealth easily accessible to the markets of the country which are being purposely held out of use , in order that the owners may later on secure an enhanced price for them. We hear, almost every year, of proposals to tax lands within 20 miles of a railway because they are held out of use, but nothing comes of them. The result is that we send men abroad to fight for Australia, and when they return they find it almost impossible to secure suitable employment. There are thousands of men who are not returned soldiers who also find it difficult to secure suitable employment. This is mainly, if not entirely, due to the fact that we have been foolish enough to practically imitate here the land laws of Great Britain. I ask leave to continue my remarks at the next sitting of the Senate. </para>

As a member of the Cabinet which agreed to it, after detailed consideration of the whole business, brought properly before it by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Malley,</inline> I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Railways, who was also a member of the Cabinet, is it not a fact that the matter was considered By the Government in a proper way, and agreed to ? </para>
