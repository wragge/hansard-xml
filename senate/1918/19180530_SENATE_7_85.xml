            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maughan</inline> very courteously furnished me with a copy of the question he has asked, but I have not since been able to make any inquiries. I can only say that I have no knowledge of anything in particular happening last Friday. I am sure, in view of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maughan</inline> has said, that something did happen, but I have no knowledge of it. With regard to the general question raised, I have to say that the correspondence of honorable senators should be regarded as sacred in this building. So far as I can, I shall prevent any interference whatever with such correspondence. To issue instructions such as has been suggested by the honorable senator&#39;s question, I am afraid, would not meet what he desires, because interference with the correspondence of honorable senators may be at their own request. So far us I can, I shall see that their correspondence is kept sacred. </para>

          <para>. - The operation of this clause will impose double taxation, and, in addition, will throw a tremendous amount of unnecessary work, not only on trustee companies, which are already overburdened with a multiplicity of returns, but also on the Department, and the result obtained from a revenue point of view will not be commensurate with the work that is involved. Estate duty is payable only in respect to estates the net value of which does not exceed <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1,000;</inline> therefore, it follows that this provision, in the majority of cases, will affect the estates of deceased persons of moderate means who derived their income from personal exertion. The following is an example of the double taxation which will be imposed by this clause: - &#34;A&#34; dies on 30th September, 1918, after filing a return of his income to 30th June, 1918. The executors are assessed in respect to the income shown in the return lodged by &#34;A&#34; prior to his death, and pay tax thereon, the taxso paid liquidating &#34; A&#39;s &#34; liability for the financial year ending 30th June, 1919. &#34; A&#39;s &#34; executors are required to file a return of the income derived by him from 30th June, 1918, to 30th September, 1918, although &#34; A&#39;s &#34; liability for the year ending 30th June, 1919, has already been liquidated, and to pay tax thereon. I would like the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> to look into the matter, with a view to seeing if this double taxation cannot be avoided.. The difficulty arises from the fact that income tax is really paid in advance. </para>

            <para>- If the Minister will look carefully into the matter he will find that income tax. is practically paid in advance. The first Federal income tax was paid for the year 1915-16 on an assessment based on incomes for the previous year. It was paid for 1915-16 during that year - practically in advance. That is the practice which has been adopted throughout. In reality, the tax is always paid in advance. The Act came into operation on the 1st July, 1914, and the first year in respect of which it was levied ended on the 30th June, 1915. </para>

          <para>.-I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> is labouring under a misapprehension in regard to this question. With all due respect to him, I do not see how income tax can be paid in advance, because it is based upon income that has already been earned. What really happened in the first instance was that income tax was paid nine months after the period elapsed during which the income was earned. The first income tax was paid in March, 1916, in respect of the financial year 1914-15. That year ended the 30th June, 1915. It was not until March of the following year, or nine months late, that that tax was collected. </para>

          <para>. -  This clause raises the much debated question whether employers shall be bound on notice from the Commissioner to collect tax practically from the wages of their employees. I fully admit that the clause was agreed to at the conference of Income Tax Commissioners, but that is no reason why the Senate should be called upon to pass it without discussion. It will be a cause of endless trouble and confusion without any set-off in the way of increased revenue. Apparently the object is to make every employer insist that those in his service shall pay their taxes. What business is it of the employer any more than of anybody else? The same Government machinery should be used for collecting the taxes of both employer and employee, without respect of persons. It may be impossible for the employer to carry out the duty which the clause imposes upon him. Take the case of a man who leaves his billet before the tax is sixty days due, or that of the man who works for several people in the same year. Which employer is to see that this man pays his tax? The only thing for an employer who wants to be safe to do will be to keep from his employee&#39;s wages a sufficient amount in hand to pay the tax in case of the worker&#39;s default. The worker would probably and rightly demand the money he had earned, and sue for it in a State Court, if it was his due. If the object of this legislation is to further increase the chaos existing- in the Taxation Department, then let the clause stand, but the whole point is that this Parliament should not impose upon corporations or individuals who employ labour the duty of the tax gatherer. Are employees not as honest in the payment of their taxes as employers, and have not the Government equal facilities for seeing that employer and employee alike pay their taxes? A clause such as this is not incorporated, so far as I know, in the New South Wales Income Tax  Act. </para>

            <para>- - The New South Wales Act requires the employer to furnish a schedule of the employees in his pay who are getting more than the amount of the exemption. The clause is full of pitfalls and traps. There may be something said for it in the direction of increasing the revenue, and perhaps imposing on outside individuals the obligations of the Taxation Department, but if it is passed as it stands, and imposes on the employer the obligation of collecting taxes from casual employees, we shall have confusion worse confounded, and perhaps in a small  Way  we shall increase the friction that sometimes occurs between the worker and those employing him. It is not the province of the corporations or individuals who employ labour in Australia to collect taxes for the Commissioner. There is a way of doing what is wanted. The employer can be made to schedule his returns so that the Commissioner will know the name and address of and amount earned during  the  year by every one of his employees. That is as far as this Parliament&#34; ought  to go. </para>

          <para>. - I shall oppose the clause. It is not just or honorable to ask an employer to garnishee his employees&#39; wages, but that is what the clause does. &#34;Under the existing conditions of exemption a great number of working men come under the Act. Many of them work for three or four different employers during the week. How can we make an employer liable for those men&#39;s tax ? Which employer is to be liable? The clause will add to the confusion, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> says, and is unjust to the employer and employee alike. If the employer is to be liable, he must make provision to protect himselfbeforeband, and the only way to do that is to deduct a certain amount from the employee&#39;s wages. That is wrong, unjust, and unfair. </para>

          <para>. - If honorable senators approve, as many of them do, of the reduction in the exemption, they must be prepared also to approve of some practical means of collecting the tax. There is no great difficulty in dealing with the class of employees who are continuously employed by one employer and whose names figure <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> the list of employees returned by every employer in the country. But that in no sense meets the case of the casual labourer who works for three or four weeks at one place, or, say, of the wharf labourer who works at one wharf to-day and another to-morrow. No employer&#39;s returns would show whether that man had or had not earned an income entitling him to pay the tax. If honorable senators do not think that those men ought to be called on to pay, the correct course is to amend the Act in that direction; but if they maintain that they should pay, they must provide the machinery for collecting the money from them. There is no other way than to follow the principle of &#34; taxation at the source,&#34; so eloquently and frequently urged yesterday by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten.</inline> He does not seem to see the charm in that principle to-day that apparently inspired him yesterday. The clause simply invites him to take a draught of that medicine which he prescribed for us yesterday in such liberal doses. I invite those who dislike the clause to suggest a practical alternative. </para>

        <para class="block">The Government are not wedded to any particular method of doing it, still less is it desired to adopt a principle which will annoy any one, if a principle equally effective can be devised without annoyance.

It is impossible, from any returns given on employers&#39; lists, to locate the men who pass from employer to employer, and from job to job, or even to determine what their total incomes are. </para>

            <para>- Yes; but only if the employer is in possession&#39; of the amount demanded. I admit that some employers may regard this as an inconvenient arrangement; but I have never yet known of any taxation &#39;methods that were not regarded as irksome in some way or other. Quite recentty, I, myself, received two notices from the State and Federal Income Tax Departments, and I could use a much stronger term than &#34; inconvenience &#39; &#39; to express my feelings with regard to them. I ask honorable senators who are objecting to the clause to be practical, and say how we can collect the amount from these employees except by some&#39; such expedient as is suggested in the Bill. The proposal is not put forward as being, in itself, desirable, but only as a necessary expedient to insure the collection of such taxation that Parliament has said shall be paid by the persons concerned. I invite <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> to suggest an alternative to meet the difficulty. </para>

          <para>. - I think this proposal is simply a resurrection of the old garnishee  5256 <inline font-style="italic">Income Tax</inline> &#91;SENATE.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Assessment Bill.</inline> system, imposing responsibility for the collection of the tax upon the employer, when it should be the responsibility of the Department itself. I object to the clause, not because I desire that any man should escape his legal obligations. If an employee is in receipt of wages which would bring him within the taxable area, and if he does not pay the amount of taxation demanded of him, he should be subject to the law; but I fail to see why an employer shouldbe called upon to make any deduction from his wages. The proposal is simply a mixing up of the old garnishee practice with the truck system. In the Income Tax Department we have a big staff of able men, well qualified for the positions they occupy, and this should be their responsibility. Quite recently, I noticed in the press a report that a number of people who were evading or had forgotten to pay their income taxation were haled before the Courts and penalized in some way or other. The same practice should be adopted with regard to employees who seek to evade their obligations. I do not see why the employer should be made an agent to collect this tax on behalf of the Government. </para>

          <para>. -  I should like to point out that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> is in error when he says that this provision will not apply to any but employees. Certainly subsection 1 of proposed new section 50a deals exclusively with employees, but proposed new section 50b applies to taxpayers generally, for it states that where the Commissioner is of opinion that a person in receipt of income is liable to pay the tax, and it is difficult to ascertain his whereabouts, the Commissioner may require any person making payments to him to deduct the amount due, and pay it to the Commissioner. After all, then, there is no invidious distinction between employees and other persons, and I would like further to remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> that we have an exactly similar provision in Queensland, where employers are required under the State Act to collect an amount due from employees, in cases where the latter fail to make payments. The provision in the Bill may be regarded as in effect the garnishee order without the usual legal procedure; but so far as I am aware, employers, who are fairly well organized in Australia, have not made any complaint against it. I have not heard of any employers&#39; organization protesting against this responsibility being placed on employers. I am well aware that in my own State a great many persons evade taxation, and without a clause of this kind I do not see how it would be possible for the Commissioner to collect the amounts due except at great expense and by the employment of a great number of tax-gatherers. Surely any honorable senator can see how difficult it would be, in the absence of a provision such as that now before the Committee, to collect taxation from men living in remote parts of the Commonwealth. One reason which, I think, should reconcile employers to this provision is the knowledge that if employees evade payment the employers themselves will have to pay a higher rate of taxation than at present. The provision in the Queensland Act has been in operation for some years. I believe it has been effective, and I have never heard a word of complaint from any one in regard to it. </para>

          <para>. - Some time ago a person carrying on farming operations in Southern Queensland, and other people following similar occupations in Northern New South Wales, informed me that owing to the wages paid and other conditions, they were quite indifferent as to whether they continued in the business or not, because the cost of production was so great. Now we see the Government proposing to throw some extra cost upon them. Employers frequently complain in the public press that it is scarcely worth while being an employer nowadays, and that they would almost as soon return to .the ranks of the workers. They do not usually come back, by the way. The Government now seriously propose, just because a number of highly paid permanent officials in the Taxation Departments of the States have made this recommendation, ito adopt it without further consideration. They have not sufficient initiative to throw it to the winds and - using their own common sense - accept only those recommendations presented by the conference of taxing officials, which are really worth adopting. The Government have just as much right to collect the taxes due to them as have trades-people to collect their accounts from their own customers. I suggested in Committee yesterday that every taxpayer should be called upon to make public the amount of taxation which lie pays in respect both to land and to income. Honorable senators opposite seemed to treat the matter with a considerable degree of amusement. </para>

        <para>The practice set out in the clause is reminiscent of the garnishee system. One  5258 <inline font-style="italic">Income Tax</inline> &#91;SENATE.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Assessment Bill.</inline> would think that the officers of the Federal Income Tax Department had neither ability nor initiative, nor knowledge of how to get their debts in, and that they must, therefore, make tax collectors of the employers. There are very few employers who desire to be placed in such a situation. It is not necessary so far as income tax collection in New South Wales is concerned. The State official is not obliged to resort to any such procedure; and we are assured - although I am not in a position to vouch for it - that he collects income tax in that State with such completeness and exactness that the total of his collection in excess of the sum raised by the Commonwealth officials amounts to almost 100 per cent. If that is so, it is time the Commonwealth officials woke up and adopted the methods of the State Department. </para>
        <para>Altogether, the proposal under discussion will cause a good deal of trouble. Honorable senators are not desirous of encouraging further strikes or cessations of work. When workmen strike, production ceases, and all the parasites living on them are compelled to look around and find their own food; and that is the very last thing honorable senators opposite would liketo do. </para>

            <para>- Any proposal of this kind, however attractive it may seem, will be found to be entirely distasteful to all employers. Not one of them has asked the Government that they should be saddled with this unnecessary source of annoyance. I suggest that the Government, while adopting certain excellent recommendations of the taxation officials, should disregard this silly proposal. Its fit and proper place is the waste-paper basket. It will give&#39; satisfaction neither to the employee nor to the employer, and will not be productive of very much revenue. Men permanently employed by municipal councils are presumed to pay their taxes with clocklike regularity; if they do not, there is an easy way of getting at them. Employees also of such bodies as shipping companies and the like - permanent hands - may be easily traced: and, if the Commonwealth officers cannot find them, they might apply to the State officials, when those gentlemen, perhaps, would be willing - for a small consideration - to supply a list of their own taxpayers. </para>

        <para>Who are the people whom the Government are anxious to get at under this provision?So far as I can see, its operation will be confined exclusively to men who are unable to secure permanent employment; but who may be receiving more than <inline font-style="italic">&#163;100</inline> a year if they are unmarried, and more than <inline font-style="italic">&#163;156</inline> a year if they are married. There are other ways of collecting taxation due from such persons. When the grocer, butcher, and baker can collect their debts a Commonwealth Department should be able , to collect taxation. </para>

            <para>- They could not collect by this method in New South Wales, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> would know if he were a grocer. However, the honorable senator has neve followed any occupation of that kind, and, therefore, does not know what he is talking about. There are other provisions in the Bill providing excellent machinery for the collection of taxation, and such pains and penalties for its evasion as to make the person who fails to pay it sorry for his neglect, if he is caught. In the circumstances, this innovation is entirely unnecessary. It was never introduced on the initiative of the Government. The draftsman who framed the measure was, no doubt, given some indication by the Government that some permanent officials held a picnic somewhere, and drew up a report, and that it would be wise to incorporate their suggestions in this measure. In my opinion, the Government would be wise to look through the report of the Conference of Taxation Commissioners, set aside what is useless and silly in it, and adopt only such suggestions as are really beneficial. </para>

            <para>- No; I am humbly endeavouring to induce the Committee to agree with me that this clause is not necessary. If I thought that, in order to protect the revenue of the Commonwealth, such a clause was necessary, there would be no more ardent supporter of it than myself. It has not been found necessary so far. It is merely the introduction of the old pernicious system of the garnishee order. If I am working in any occupation I have so much money to draw as wages at the end of a week, a fortnight, or a month, and I should get that money from my employer. It is what I have earned, and I am legally entitled to it. </para>

            <para>- That is exactly what will happen. Now an employer does not want to be troubled in that way. Other things being equal, if two men present themselves for employment, the employer will naturally give a preference to the individual who has paid his income tax. The other applicant for work may have such a small income that he is not required to pay the tax. The employer will not be aware of this fact, and merely because he cannot produce a receipt for the payment of the tax he will be prevented from procuring employment. I do hope that the Government will recognise that they are on the wrong track, and will abandon this proposal. </para>

          <para>. - 1 am in considerable difficulty in regard to this clause. It certainly possesses some advantages, but many objections can also be urged against it. There is a good deal in what has been said as to the undesirableness of imposing on employers what must be a nauseating duty. On the other hand, there are admittedly scores of thousands of taxpayers throughout Australia who are escaping their just obligations to the Taxation Department. It has occurred to me that if a compromise can be effected, under which this clause will not become operative until after notice has been given both to the employer and employee, it will, to some extent, meet the objections which can be urged against it. </para>

            <para>- I heard of that amendment just now after I had already drafted an amendment myself. During the course of the debate, something has been said regarding the absence of objections to this clause on the part of organizations of employers. To my own knowledge, there has been considerable objection urged to the clause by associations of employers, and also by the general public. I quite recognise the difficulty with which we are confronted, and I shall be glad to see a compromise arrived at on the lines I have suggested. </para>

Indeed, in view of the fact that there is a far rr.ore reaching provision immediately following it, I fail to recognise the necessity for retaining proposed new section 50a. It seems to me that if we agree to the latter, and we also adopt proposed new section 50b, we shall be incorporating in the measure redundant provisions. </para>

The clause makes it obligatory on the person owing the money to deduct such a sum &#34; as the Commissioner may assess.&#34; The assessment may be a guess or a wrong assessment. The provision, as amended, will be comprehensive, and, to a large extent, cover the four sub-sections which the Committee has struck out, and must be qualified in the direction I suggest, otherwise the Commissioner will be in an autocratic position and able to demand any sum he may assess, although in excess of what should be paid. </para>

It would only operate in the  case  of defaulting taxpayers, in  regard  . to whom we must leave the Commissioner some freedom of action. A taxpayer who is doing his duty can only be assessed in one way. If a taxpayer refuses to furnish any particulars at all, he can only blame himself if the assessment, made up by the Commissioner, is in excess of the proper amount.  His  alternative is to put himself right by furnishing &#34; a .return. </para>

          <para>. -  Suppose a taxpayer is trying to evade his obligations, and the Commissioner, in assessing him, fixes on an exorbitant amount. As far as I can see, this provision will impose a liability upon an employer to collect the amount, although it be exorbitant.

In such circumstances, and if a taxpayer demurs, he - may, like any other taxpayer, present his case to the Commissioner, so that he will he under no disability. I ask honorable senators to remember that, after all,  we  are dealing with defaulting taxpayers. I have sq much sympathy for the taxpayer that I have not much for the man who is trying to evade his tax, and I ask that, fair consideration be given&#39; to the machinery of the Department to compel payments from those people who are trying to evade the obligations placed upon them by the National Parliament. </para>

            <para>- But Queensland is not the whole of the Commonwealth, and as a rule we do not look to that Stats for inspiration in legislative matters, although lately the Government haw&#169; passed a few good measures that might even be adopted by the Commonwealth Parliament. The mere fact that a retrogressive objectionable Parliament in Queensland incorporated a. provision &#171;if this kind in the State Act is no reason why this Government should include a similar proposal in the measure now before the Committee. It does not exist, so far as I know, in the Income Tax Department of New South Wales, and <inline font-style="italic">tss&#62;</inline> have &#39;been assured on very good authority  5264 <inline font-style="italic">Income Tax</inline> &#91;SENATE.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Assessment Bill.</inline> that the Commissioner in that State can collect income taxation in a manner which some honorable senators would be glad &#39;to see adopted by the Commonwealth Income Tax Department. The clause, to my mind, is a deliberately conceived and direct insult to the whole of the working men of the Commonwealth. It is at them, and them only, that it is aimed, and it isaimed more particularly at those workmen who, on account of the misgovernment to which the Commonwealth and the various States have been subjected, are unable to secure permanent employment. If this provision is incorporated in the Bill employees seeking work will probably be called upon to produce receipts for income tax payment, and their non-production will probably mean a refusal of employment. That is the idea behind this measure. </para>

            <para>- It is the same thing. I remember that some years ago a ship trading on the Australian coast,but not going. to Queensland, was put off her run and had to remain for three days in Queensland. This rendered the men liable for the tax. When the vessel reached Melbourne the ship owner said that the men would have to pay &#163;1 each. They refused, because they were on Victorian articles, and, as the ship master in Victoria was unable to enforce the Queensland law, the ship-owner had to pay for sixty -two men. The result was, he refused to engage the men again. They were absolutely boycotted. And that is what we are trying to re-enact in this Bill. Take the case of the Union Shipping Company. If that company sent a boat to Australia for a week or a fortnight they would have the right to deduct income tax payment for the whole year from the wages of the men. </para>

            <para>- Isay that itis virtually the same provision. Because the men refused to pay the Queensland poll tax they were absolutely boycotted, and could not get back into the shipowner&#39;s employment again. So far as the Commonwealth is concerned the provision now under consideration may be all right, but I invite honorable senators to consider the position of Commonwealth ships. They may be away for three years, and yet, under this clause, the manager of the Commonwealth line of steamers will have the right to deduct three years&#39; income tax from men who may not have been a fortnight in the Commonwealth during that period. </para>

The Commonwealth Shipping Company is now the biggest concern in Australia, and I remind the Committee that no men are more heavily taxed than seamen. They have to pay every time they sign articles and every time they sign off - whether It be for a week, a month, or three years Now it is proposed to tax them again. I ask the Committee to consider this matter carefully, because what happened under the Queensland law will happen to seamen under this provision. </para>

          <para>- This clause, which is to affect, possibly, hundreds of individuals in the Commonwealth, has to be foregone, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie,</inline> to protect an engineer and a mate on a ship. If persons are liable, then they are taxpayers, and should pay; but if they are not liable, there can be no imposition. Tosuggest that it means drawing in the whole of the seamen all around the Commonwealth is merely straining the argument to endeavour to procure a point. This clause is totally different from that which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> has referred to as being in operation in Queensland. This is not a poll tax; it is an income tax. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator must see that it is necessary to have some such provision where there are many persons coming into Australia for a very brief period, and where there are others constantly changing their addresses, so that it is difficult to ascertain really where they are. Since <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> would not endeavour to evade taxation himself, I plead that he should not try to shelter others who are liable and desire to evade it. All who are liable should pay taxation. If they demur, the Commissioner has a perfect right to use legitimate means to see that they do. While the clause may have its faults, it meets what I can see is an exceptional difficulty. </para>

          <para>. - Whatever may be the merits of the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall,</inline> they are not affected by the proposed new section 52n. It deals only with the machinery for collecting the tax, and does not in any way impose it. It does not make a single prize  winner  in Tattersall&#39;s sweeps liable to taxation. That is done elsewhere. What the proposed new section provides is that, instead of taxing the recipient of a  prize  directly, the Government may direct the controllers of such an institution as Tattersall&#39;s to take the amount from their prizes and pay it into the Treasury. The provision is intended to protect the revenue. If the proposed new section is left out, the Commissioner of Taxation will still have the right to assess the recipients of prizes in lotteries. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> desires to move in the direction of denying the Commonwealth Treasurer the right to participate in lottery prizes, he will not attain his object by the rejection of this provision, but by amending the law which makes these prizes assessable as a part of a man&#39;s income. </para>

          <para>. - This is another departure from the Commonwealth method of taxation. This is an attempt to tax income at its source. If the Government propose to abandon the present method of taxation of the individual, it is better that they should do so in a straightforward way. There is ample machinery at their disposal to insure the collection of this taxation under the system adopted for the Commonwealth. That being so, they would do well to abandon the proposed new section, which will be merely another pitfall in the way of the taxpayer. The provision does not make it mandatory on the part of the Commissioner of Taxation to compel sweep or lottery promoters to pay income tax on the value of the prizes they distribute. He may not do so. If the provision were mandatory, people wouldknow how they stood; but, under this provision, they may come to the conclusion that it would be quite right for them not to include in their income returns money received from lotteries. In other clauses of this Bill we impose heavy penalties upon those who make mistakes in their income tax returns, and the effect of this provision will be to mislead taxpayers. Most people, unfortunately, do not draw very much from these lotteries, and that is, perhaps, one of the worst phases of the business. The proposed new section will lead to a misconception of their duties on the part of the taxpayers, and I think the Government would be wise to withdraw it, and continue to collect the revenue as at present from taxpayers, in accordance with the returns of income furnished by them. </para>

          <para>.- The Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen),</inline> in his reply, has only made the case for the proposed new section worse than it was. He is proposing to make the gambler a tax collector by permitting him, for the purpose, to take money belonging to another person. Although the proposed new section does not affect the taxation of these lottery prizes, it does affect the method by which the winners of prizes are compelled to pay taxation. The Government have in this matter always had the law to appeal to, and it has been appealed to. There was acase not long ago of a man who was prosecuted for not having paid the tax in respect of a prize of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;100</inline> or <inline font-style="italic">&#163;200,</inline> and he was compelled to pay up. That is the remedy for the Taxation Department; but, for God&#39;s sake, do not make the gambler a tax collector for the Commonwealth. I strongly protest against that. </para>

            <para>- The position is not the same. I do not spend money on a theatre ticket with any idea of increasing my income; but, however they may gloss it over, those who invest money in Tattersall&#39;s sweep do so with the idea of adding totheir income. There is no doubt that this provision is farcical. I suppose that a considerable amount of revenue is raised by this taxation, and in these days we cannot afford to do without revenue, even if it be derived from a doubtful source. We know that, in connexion with the shows run on behalf of Red Cross and other appeals, Monte Carlo is brought into Collins-street. Exactly the same kind of thing goes on in the principal streets of this city as goes on in the gambling saloons of the Continent. </para>

          <para>.- I have always understood that, from its inception, the Federal Parliament has discouraged gambling. Under the law, the Post and Telegraph Department has refused to carry articles connected with gambling. In hundreds and, perhaps, thousands of cases people have been prosecuted for receiving orders for tickets in sweeps drawn in Tasmania. This course has been followed since the inception of Federation, and the public believe that the law of the Commonwealth is against gambling. It is most inconsistent of this Parliament to have a law discouraging gambling and to now propose to tax the very thing that the law declares to be illegal. I have no sympathy with such a proposal, and must oppose it. </para>

            <para>- That is so, but I never missed an opportunity when in the Tasmanian Parliament of letting the public know that I was an uncompromising opponent of gambling. It is known to every one who is acquainted with me in Tasmania that that is the position which I have always taken up. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has said that the proposed new section 52b provides merely the means for the collection of taxation, but I am not sure that there is not more than machinery in this provision. I presume that up to now the man who won a prize in any lottery was subject to income tax in respect of it if his income was over a certain amount. </para>

          <para>. - I shall vote without any hesitation against the proposal to levy taxation on lotteries such as Tattersall&#39;s. For a long time, I could not quite understand why Continental peoples are accustomed to levy against the British race  the charge of hypocrisy. But it is in matters like that which we are now discussing that we seem to justify such criticism. There has been a good deal of Pecksniffianism exhibited in regard to Tattersall&#39;s. I should not like to be the Tasmanian legislator who had to undertake the task of finding the revenue that State would sacrifice by the abolition of this institution. I believe that it amounts to about  &#163;70,000  annually. The Commonwealth does its level Best to check the stream of investment towards this particular lottery. I do not regard a lottery of this character as an immoral form of gambling. Indeed, of all the forms of gamb ling with which I am* acquainted - and I am acquainted with a good many - the lottery business is the least immoral. No man knocks off his employment to invest in Tattersall&#39;s. He merely sends along his 5s. or 6s. for a ticket, and the matter then passes from his mind until the time arrives when he should obtain a result slip. There is no frenzy of gambling about it. It is a cold-blooded investment, which, to a large extent, satisfies the gambling spirit in man. Since the establishment of Tattersall&#39;s in Tasmania, other forms of gambling have disappeared. In my youth, I have seen, in certain districts of Tasmania, men playing cards for forty-eight hours on end for very high stakes indeed. But if one goes through those districts to-day, he will find - although greater prosperity obtains there than formerly obtained - that gambling has disappeared. This is due to the fact that Tattersall&#39;s supplies a sufficient outlet for the gambling spirit. . Yet the Commonwealth sets its face in the most rigid fashion against this institution. But, although it will not allow the Post Office to be used to enable people to invest In Tattersall&#39;s. it is now seriously proposed, and, indeed, the principle is enforced, that when a citizen draws a prize from this lottery, he shall pay taxation upon it. In this connexion, I recall the fate which overtook a man who acted practically as the secretary of a little syndicate, from the members of which hedrew ls. per week, which he forwarded to Tattersall&#39;s, for a very long time. Eventually, he gained a  &#163;10  prize. He distributed the money amongst the members of the syndicate, and, a little later, as the nominal drawer of the prize, was called upon to pay taxation to the Commonwealth Treasury. That was a hypocritical action. Until we permit those who desire to invest in Tattersall&#39;s to send their applications for tickets through the Post Office in a legitimate way, we shall be acting hypocritically if we seek to levytaxation upon the prizes drawn from that, lottery. I will lend myself to no such hypocrisy. I admit that the prizes drawn from Tattersall&#39;s would be quite a legitimate subject for taxation if we recognised that form of gambling as an institution, and permitted men to send their applications for tickets through the Post Office without hindrance. I quite agree with&#34; the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> that, in the present financial  5270 <inline font-style="italic">Income Tax</inline> &#91;SENATE.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Assessment Bill.</inline> exigency, it may yet be necessary to institute something in the way of a State lottery. I do not see any particular harm in that. But I do see harm in men absenting themselves from their employment in order to play cards for high stakes. I fear, however, that I am wandering somewhat from my subject. But I confess that I did experience a certain contempt for the Commonwealth Legislature and the Commonwealth Government when this proposal to tax prizes drawn from Tattersall&#39;s was first mooted. I know a man who drew a <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5,000</inline> prize from one of these sweeps. The gain to him was less actual than nominal, because he had laid off <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1,000</inline> of it with the owner of the winning horse. But the Taxation Department called upon him to pay to it no less a sum than <inline font-style="italic">&#163;600.</inline> I saw the receipt for the payment of the tax. </para>

          <para>. - This is a very old question. I recollect that within two or three years of the period when the first Senate assembled here, we had under consideration a section in our Postal Act which prohibits people from using the Post Office as a medium to forward money to gambling institutions. Upon that occasion I took up an attitude very similar to that which has been taken up by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> today. Although I have never been a &#34; State righter,&#34; I stressed the rights of the States then, and I emphasized that the proposal which we were then considering was intended to accomplish indirectly what this Parliament had no power to achieve directly. We have no power under the Constitution to interfere with the forms of gambling that ob tain in any State. Each State - including Tasmania - has its own legalized forms of gambling. The form which is specially legalized in Tasmania is Tattersall&#39;s. The provision in our Postal Act to which I have referred, constitutes an infringement of State rights. It infringes the rights of Tasmania, but does not attempt to infringe the rights of other States in connexion with gambling.. When it was under consideration in this Chamber, bookmakers were countenanced! in some States in which the totalizator had not been legalized. In other parts of Australia both bookmakers and totalizator had been legalized. In certain States only the totalizator was recognised, and in others only the bookmaker was allowed to ply his vocation. It was thus entirely within the province of each State Legislature to control the forms of gambling that were carried on within its own State borders. At that time, Tasmania had legalized the totalizator, and also the institution known as Tattersall&#39;s. The provision in our Postal Act indirectly sought to crush that institution by prohibiting the public from sending money for tickets through the Post Office. On that occasion, those who knew something of human nature, pointed out that the result of such legislation would be that all over Australia there would spring up a number of illicit institutions - a number of agencies which would break the law, and which it would be impossible to suppress. I am now alluding to agencies which will accept the price of a ticket in Tattersall&#39;s from anybody and which - after they have secured a large sum of money - contrive to find some means of forwarding it from the mainland to that lottery. In Tasmania, too, there are similar agencies in every town. In Hobart the public are at liberty to purchase tickets in Tattersall&#39;s over the counter. I repeat that the Commonwealth said to Tasmania, &#34;You shall not&#39; carry on gambling in this form.&#34; The Tasmanian representatives pointed out that if the Commonwealth desired to be consistent it should lay down the same dictum in regard to every other State of the Union. The Government of that day acted the part of the flagrant hypocrite by inserting this provision in our Postal Act. What has happened since? From that time onward, the volume of business connected </para>

        <para>It is true that money for tickets cannot be forwarded through the Poet Office. It is breaking the law for any person to send a letter through the post to Tattersall&#39;s, which is a prohibited address. Hundreds of reputable business people in Hobart have during the last few years, at one time or another, been put to enormous trouble because they have innocently put into Tattersall&#39;s a small amount sent to them by some friend on the mainland or in New Zealand, with a request that, as a personal favour, it should be so invested. These business people have made nothing out of it. They have not acted as agents for a commission, but have simply obliged a friend or customer. As soon as it is discovered that this has been done, I do not say once, but, perhaps, a few times, the Postal Department has gazetted them as prohibited addresses, and, on dozens of occasions, to my knowledge, they have had to get Tasmanian members of the Federal Parliament to intercede for them with the Postmaster-General. </para>

            <para>- Never, in the recognised meaning of the word agent, for a commission; but on hundreds of occasions I have complied with the request of a friend, who has sent me a letter, and purchased a ticket for him. In doing so, I have not broken any Tasmanian law. Those business people have been caused tremendous trouble and inconvenience and loss through the Postal Department refusing to deliver letters to them, and members have had to see the PostmasterGeneral, pointing out that those people are not recognised agents, and pleading with the Postmaster-General to remove the prohibition. Dozens of wires have sometimes had to pass between the prohibited person, whose business is suffering, and the Postmaster-General before the prohibition has been removed. All this shows the hyprocisy of the whole business; and now the Government propose to make the promoter of the sweeps the tax-gatherer for them, while, at the same time, declaring in the Post and Telegraph Act that the lottery is illegal. The position is untenable from the point of view of honest legislation, and undoubtedly hypocritical. </para>

What they propose is to depart from the wellestablished custom laid down by the Federal Department of Taxation and ask Tattersall&#39;s to pay direct to the Commonwealth the amount that the taxpayer would probably be called upon to pay, although in some cases the taxpayer would probably be called on to pay a good deal more. . </para>

Probably  the man  receiving  one  of the higher incomes would welcome  it,  because he would not have to pay on  the  5s. in the &#163;1 rate, but smaller taxpayers, who are sufficiently fortunate to  win a  prize in Tattersall&#39;s - and they all hope  to  win one by-and-by - would not find  it to  their &#39;advantage.

Here is a provision which applies to another section of the community, placing a similar obligation on the banker to whom money is paid on behalf of an absentee.

          <para>. -  It was explained, I think, in  the  Senate some time ago that, when reference was made to a penalty, the words &#34; Fifty pounds &#34; did not necessarily mean  &#163;50,  but that it was the maximum amount permitted to be imposed. Now, however, we find that the Government propose an alteration by making the penalty not less than  &#163;5,  nor more than  &#163;50.  I should like to know whether  or  not the officers of the Crown Law Department were responsible for this alteration ? </para>

          <para>. -  I confess, now that attention has been directed to the clause, I am a little surprised myself to see the alteration in the penalty. However, I understand it has been inserted because ft was approved by the Conference of Income&#39; Tax Commissioners, whose decisions excited much admiration in certain quarters at an earlier stage in the debate on this measure, and which have called forth sharp attacks elsewhere. I understand it was decided that, in the interests of uniformity, the representatives of the Commonwealth should fall in with the proposal. </para>

          <para>. -I  do not know whether or not this is another of those suggestions made by the Conference of Taxation Commissioners. By the insertion of the proposed new section, additional powers will be given to the Commissioner to impose penalties on persons who may simply have overlooked the necessity for furnishing a return. One would imagine that this was a very serious offence; that taxpayers had nothing else to do except to be everlastingly filling in those complicated income tax returns; and that it was quite a simple matter to make up their lists. It is nothing of the kind. It is an extensive, complicated, tiresome, tedious, irritating performance, which is postponed as long as possible, and it is one of those duties which many persons quite innocently overlook. Many people do not pay much attention to parliamentary proceedings, and I have no doubt that many persons who will be liable for taxation under this measure have not the slightest idea that anything of the kind is being enacted bythis Parliament. Under the proposed new sub-section, the Commissioner will have the right to tax any person who fails or neglects to furnish a return the sum of &#163;1 for each month, or part thereof, during which he may neglect to furnish the return. It seems to me that this opens to the Commissioner a very prolific source of income, because all he will have to do will be to say nothing about it until such time as he deems it advisable to remind the taxpayer of his default, and then proceed to collect the penalty I have mentioned. If we were to reverse the position, and proposed to fine the Commissioner &#163;1 for every month during which he failed to notify a taxpayer that his taxation was due, it would not be entertained for one moment. I do not say that there should not be some slight additional tax in a case of default, but I point out that in the management of municipal affairs ratepayers who fail to pay rates within a certain time are liable to some slight punishment, which usually takes the form of an additional  4  per cent. or  5  per cent. on the amount of their rates. This penalty, however, is only imposed on ratepayers whose rates have been outstanding for some time. The way in which municipal rates are collected, with their so-called inferior machinery, is an eye-opener compared with the trouble and inconvenience, and the apparent slipshod manner in which the income-tax gatherers perform their work. Does it not seem strange that a municipality with only one paid officer, and sometimes an assistant, can collect practically every shilling due from year to year, while the Income Tax Commissioner, with a great staff at his disposal, is unable to attain this desirable end? Throughout the whole of New South Wales I suppose there are not anythink like 500 shire clerks, but yet I venture to say that they collect, almost to the last shilling, the whole of the rates due every year, while, as we have been told by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> in New South Wales the Income Tax Commissioner is unable to collect, within some millions, the amount that ought to be gathered in. There is something radically wrong. Perhaps it is the basis of taxation. Whether this is so or not, the proposal to give this additional power to the Commissioner will not have my support. </para>

          <para>. -  I think the Committee might, with advantage, review the clause, because it puts a man in the position of being found guilty before he is tried. Anyone might forget, for various reasons, to furnish a return within the specified time, and in my judgment it is not fair  5274 <inline font-style="italic">Income Tax</inline> &#91;SENATE.&#93; <inline font-style="italic">Assessment Bill.</inline> to  say that because a taxpayer may overlook his obligation, he shall be penalized in the manner proposed by the clause. It goes too far, and does not make any allowance for human frailty. I can quite understand that a penalty should be imposed if a man or woman intentionally neglects to furnish a return, but there is no loophole at all in the clause. It simply says that if a man neglects to furnish a returnhe may be penalized.. It might happen that a taxpayer has not the necessary data handy to complete the work. </para>

          <para>. - We have dealt with the machinery clauses of the Bill, and are now considering the penal provisions, and I must express surprise at their harsh, arbitrary, and autocratic nature. The Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> just now advanced as an argument the suggestion that if any of the Alterations proposed in this Bill were approved by the Conference of State Income Tax Commissioners we should have less hesitation about accepting them than otherwise; but it is interesting to note that the penal provision in this clause is an interpolation entirely by the Commissioner himself. That is to say, in the draft uniform Bill there is no such penal clause as clause 39. To my mind, the whole clause is absolutely unnecessary. There are other provisions that set out <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> penalize the taxpayer if he is late in making his return, or if he fails to do so; and with respect to this and those other clauses, I shall very carefully consider (the matter of placing the Commissioner in an arbitrary position. In view of the unsatisfactory reply from the Minister I intend to move that the clause be eliminated. </para>

            <para>- Then I intend to move for the deletion of the clause, for the reason that the State Income Tax Commissioners have not found it necessary to impose any penal clause such as this. It is giving power to the Commissioner which is autocratic and arbitrary. The penalties are excessive. They would enable the Commissioner to fine a man who received over &#163;156 per annum at the rate of &#163;1 per month. if he did not send in- his return. Suppose it was discovered that an itinerant individual was earning &#163;4 or &#163;5 a week. </para>

          <para>.-I urge upon the Committee that, if it is not satisfied with the clause, it should leave it out altogether in preference to adopting the amendment. Honorable senators seem to think it was inserted to give the Commissioner some additional horror to wave over the heads of recalcitrant taxpayers. This has been inserted largely in the interests of taxpayers themselves, who have preferred to be fined rather than be dragged into the Courts. If the clause is left out, the Commissioner can fall back upon his redress of prosecuting in the Courts. If the Committee thinks that in no circumstances should a man be permitted by the payment of a small fine to make amends for his breach of the law, well and good; but, there are circumstances under which many people choose to pay a fine rather than be dragged before the Courts. The deletion of the clause will not hamper the Taxation Commissioner very much, but the insertion of the words proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> might do so. </para>

There should be some stipulation regarding the knowledge of the defaulter. He might not furnish a return in time, but he might have no knowledge of his duty in that respect. I know that on one occasion I was a delinquent myself; I was not aware that I had not sent in a return for the year in question. </para>

            <para>- No ; but the interpretation which might be put uponthe words &#34;knowingly and wilfully&#34;might make the situation hard for a defaulter who had been communicated with bythe Department and had failed torespond through no fault of his own.

            <para>- I forgot for rather too long, and was subjectedto a penalty. I suggest that theamendment is not unreasonable, and that thereshould be some sufficient safeguard for the Commissioner to get into touch with defaulters or negligent taxpayers, so longas the discrimination could be made to apply only to those who were guilty off negligence. But some definition asto wilful knowledge would be also necessary- </para>

          <para>. -  The amendment does not meet with my approval. My objection to the clause is that it might giveto any one man the power to punish another by a fine. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> states that the clause is toprotect certain persons; but it is a matterof principle. In connexion with the Customs administration there is a similar provision. I am opposed to the principle of conferring upon the Commissionerany more power than he possesses to-day.He holds too much power, so far as I can see; and I shall vote for the deletion ofthe clause altogether, rather than acceptthe insertion of the words &#34;knowinglyand wilfully.&#34; </para>

          <para>. -  There are two classes of defaulting taxpayers. There is the manwho, through stress of circumstances, may not bc able at the proper time to send in his return, or who may quite innocently forget to send it in. It may he contended that the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> will provide a loophole of escape from punishment for the other class of defaulter, who deliberately and defiantly refuses to send in any return. Honorable senators will readily distinguish between the two classes, and while they will agree, that the man who has no intention to send in a return should be punished, they will have no desire to penalize the man who, as the result of a temporary oversight, neglects to send in his return in time. It should &#39;be remembered that every Commissioner of Taxation, whether of the Commonwealth or of the States, has the power to inflict penalties upon defaulters. There is provision in the State Acts as well as in the Commonwealth law that a taxpayer who does not pay his tax &#39;before a certain date is liable to a fine. There can .be no objection to this, because its effect is to make the careless more particular. What I a  ni  concerned about is that every person liable to taxation shall not be placed in the same category with the man who wilfully defies the law. This provision places all in the same category, and that, in my opinion, is not fair. I should at the same time be sorry to see the porvision struck out, because it supplies a necessary safeguard. I think by the insertion of the words &#34; knowingly and wilfully&#34; the Commissioner of Taxation will be placed in a position to meet the case of the taxpayer who is innocently guilty of neglect. We are all disposed to regard the Commissioner of Taxation as a man of iron, who makes no allowance for the defaulter, and we should do well to make him less unpopular. </para>

          <para>. -  During the progress of the Bill through Committee we have been enlarging its ambit. As a result a very much larger number of persons will require to furnish returns under this measure than have been required to do so previously. Many persons are, therefore, very likely to be quite unintentional defaulters. We are proposing here to doubly penalize, it may be, a quite innocent defaulter. If a man neglects to send in a return he is liable to a penalty, and as he will naturally be late in paying his tax, he will on that account be liable to. a fine of 10 per cent, on the amount of the tax. We are importing into our system of taxation the human element, -and while I do not wish that anything I say should be considered unduly harsh upon the Taxation Department, we may have a Commissioner of Taxation who will exercise his powers in a very harsh way, and as a result a defaulting taxpayer may be doubly and trebly penalized. If we require additional taxation, let us say so, but do not let us make the police court, a medium for collecting taxation. I do not agree with the clause as it stands, because I here are many reasons why a man may fail, without any deliberate intent, to comply with the provisions of the law. Owing to the change in connexion with the collection of taxation from one period of the year to another, I entirely overlooked the fact at the time that r was a taxpayer in South Australia..

At the present time, if the Arbitration Court gives an award in regard to the plaint of any union connected with our Public Service, it has to lie upon the table of both branches of the Legislature for a period of thirty days after the meeting of Parliament. The object of the Bill is to remove that disability, and to enable the Court to give a decision which will become operative straightway. </para>

            <para>.- This Bill, as I have previously observed, seeks to amend the Arbitration (Public Service) Act 1911, by deleting section 14. Before coming to a vote upon it, I desire to reply to a few remarks which were made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> in addressing himself to the measure on Thursday evening last. He stated, amongst other things, that the Crown Law authorities bad advised him that the  President  of the Court had power to make his awards retrospective. If that be so, I have only to say that the  President  of the Court, who is also a Justice of the High Court, has never, to my knowledge, exercised that power. If I were convinced that under the principal Act he can legally exercise it, a great deal of my objection to section 14 of that Statute would be removed. But he has not, as far as&#34; I know, yet exercised any such power, and knowing as I do that every organization within the Commonwealth Public Service, and registered under the provisions of the Arbitration (Public Service) Act 1911, has suffered on account of that section, I am anxious to remove the disability under which they at present labour. All the organizations of which I have any knowledge have obtained awards of the Court, and, in every instance, whatever benefit they might otherwise have derived from those awards has been vitiated by the delay which has occurred - a delay ranging from one month to five months - before the awards became operative. An entirely different system obtains under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Under that Statute, the Judge certainly possesses the power to make his award retrospective, and on  more than one occasion he has exercised it. All that I am seeking to accomplish in this Bill is to place organizations within the Commonwealth Public Service upon the same footing as organizations outside of it. In connexion with the latter what happens? A number of men band themselves together as an organization. They submit their claims to the Court, which makes an award. Generally, that award operates at least from the day on which it is given, and it is within the discretion of the Judge to make it retrospective. I fail to see why employees in our Public Service should be treated differently from employees outside of it. The Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> argued that if this Bill be carried, it will rob Parliament of the control of its own public servants. I say that it is impossible to deprive Parliament of that control. Parliament never loses control of any of its own functions. Even if the measure were carried, Parliament will still exercise the right of review. I repeat that Public Service organizations should be treated in the same way as outside organizations, and when an award is given by the Arbitration Court it should become operative at least from the day upon which it is given. Hitherto that has not been the case. Parliament, perhaps, goes into recess for a period of twoor three months. In the meantme, a plaint by one of these industrial unions 5278 <inline font-style="italic">Income Tax</inline> &#91;SENATE.&#93;Assessment <inline font-style="italic">Bill.</inline> is heard by the Court, and judgment is given. Then the organization interested in that award has to wait until Parliament re-assembles, and the award itself has to lie upon the table of both Houses of the Legislature for thirty days before it can become operative, thus depriving the members of that organization of the benefits conferred by the award for, probably, a period of four or five months. </para>

          <para>. - When the sitting was suspended I was pointing out that there were cases in which, conceivably, persons might neglect to furnish a return to the Income Tax Commissioner with justifiable cause. We all know that in Australia very many persons are frequently absent from home for considerable periods, and it is just possible that during their absence letters may arrive for them demanding that they shall immediately fill in their income tax schedules. It is clear, therefore, that a comparatively large proportion of our population may be prevented, by absence, from furnishing returns within the prescribed period. A comparatively large proportion of the population are prevented from complying with the requirement to send in returns, although: they are not unwilling to do so. I am not speaking of those who are persistently determined not to comply with the law. Seeing the heavy fine imposed for failure in this case, it is incumbent on. the Department to prove wilful or intentional neglect. Even a fine of &#163;1 might represent 50 or 100 per cent. of the tax, and it is also objectionable to have a cumulative penalty of &#163;1 for each month, or part thereof. The penalty is out of all proportion tothe offence. I agree that all persons liable to be taxed should furnish a return, but when penalties are to be imposed, the Department must furnish some proof that defaulters have been communicated with, and have failed repeatedly to comply with the law. In addition to this penalty the man will be necessarily late in paying his tax, and so will incur an additional fine. The clause is a sweeping innovation, and I. do&#39; not remember anything equal to it in any other Act we have passed. The Minister should consider whether it does not give almost unlimited power to the Taxation Department. I shall support the amendment, which will be a modicum of comfort, but I should like to see some alteration made in the amount of the penalty.. </para>

          <para>.- I have great diffidence in putting on the statute-book anything that will impose a hardship upon the people, and particularly that will inflict punishment on the innocent. There seems ample room for innocent people to be punished under a clause such as this. People are expected to obtain forms themselves, and thousands overlook the fact. I have done so myself until a notification in the press has reminded me. </para>

            <para>- I am not at all sure that that request by some one other than the taxpayer would be entertained. The result was that the employee was not able to make up the return until after the time had expired. I have known people who, through sickness, have overlooked the necessity of sending in a return. Under this clause they might be fined. A great number of people do not understand what is expected of them. Only a few days ago a man was under the impression that he had not to send in a return under the State Act because he had a dependant. He received a demand from the Commissioner, and a notification that he would be fined. I put the case to the Deputy Commissioner, and got him off. Under this clause, thousands of innocent offenders can be fined, and I am loath therefore to see it made law. </para>

            <para>- Not quite. I feel myself in somewhat of a difficulty on this matter. It would be almost better to knock the clause out altogether. Had those responsible for drafting the Bill not gone so far with regard to the penal clauses, most of them would have passed through without debate, but we have to consider, not only this clause, but two 5280 <inline font-style="italic">Income Tax</inline> &#91;SENATE &#93; <inline font-style="italic">Assessment Bill.</inline> others that are even worse. If the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> will accept some modification of this provision, and show a sweet reasonableness so far as penalties are concerned, we may get on. </para>

Any one who purposely evades that duty should be punished.  I  wanted to make sure that no one who failed through forgetfulness, and without wilful intent, should be punished. </para>

The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> suggests as an alternative that the Committee should wipe out the whole clause. I would rather see it wiped out than passed in its present form, but I would much prefer to see it retained with the words I propose to put in. It will assist the Department responsible for the collection of the tax. If we wipe out the clause altogether people will be able to do as they like. </para>

          <para>. - It is obvious that we must have either this clause or section 59, which the Bill proposes to amend. Otherwise we shall have no penalty at all for persons failing to furnish a return. I do not think there is a great deal in it either one way or the other. In my opinion the Commissioner can be trusted to act in a common-sense way. I feel sure that if a man inadvertently, and with a decent amount of excuse, forgot the actual date for furnishing a return, the Commissioner would probably pass over the offence. I cannot see how we shall be able to prove anything if we agree to the insertion of the word &#34;wilfully.&#34; </para>

          <para>.- The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> recognises the difficulty of proving &#39; that a man may inadvertently fail to furnish a return, but in this clause he intends to allow the Commissioner to occupy the position of a Judge. He also quoted the case of a taxpayer liable to pay income tax to the amount of &#163;1,000, and showed how the interest on that amount would more than meet the departmental fines; but I point out that included in the section proposed to be struck out is provision for a penalty of 10 per cent. This provision will bear more heavily upon a poor than upon a rich man. Suppose that a man in receipt of &#163;180 a year has several children, with the result that his income is below the exemption limit, but that he loses one child by death, and is brought within the taxable area. If he failed to furnish a return he would be fined &#163;1. The clause, therefore, would bear heavily on him. I think the wisest course would be to strike the clause out altogether, or substitute 10 per cent, instead of &#163;1. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lt.-Colonel</inline>O&#39;LOGHLIN (South Australia) &#91;8.44&#93;. - I do not know if the proposed amendment is the best way of overcoming the difficulty, but I would like to quote my own experience of the State income tax in South Australia. There is, no notice given the taxpayer. There is&#34; simply an advertisement in the press stating that the returns must be in by a certain date. Last year, when, these notices were published, I was some thousands of miles away on military duty, and the announcements escaped my attention. Some months later, upon my return, I sent in my papers, and explained the circumstances. When my assessment was sent back, however, I was mulct in 10 per cent, on the tax, together with a fine. I protested, and brought the matter under the notice of the Commissioner, with the result that the penalty was remitted; but I still had to pay the 10 per cent, interest. In such a clear case there should be provision for the penalty to be remitted. I find that in section 58 of the Act, which is proposed to be amended, there are the words &#34; Any person .who fails or neglects to send in a return..... shall be guilty of an offence.&#34; </para>
        <para class="block">So, even if the clause is struck out altogether there will still be provision for the punishment of any person. On the whole, with the provision already existing, the best course would be to leave out the clause. I shall vote in that direction. </para>

          <para>.- While a number of honorable senators are objecting to the penalty, we all know that the majority of us are more or less careless, and are apt to leave our obligations, to the last possible moment. I do not know what better course can be adopted, seeing that those who have objected to the alleged drastic penalty have proposed nothing more equitable. We know that there is a big loss to the Treasury annually through people neglecting to pay their dues. We should remember the great expense to which the Department is put in its efforts to secure the full amount of taxation due. The simple fact that Federal returns are due on the 30th June of each year should be sufficient for the public. But I think the Commissioner should have the power to spur the public to their duties in this matter. Honorable senators should look at the position from the view-point of the National Treasury. I admit that the sum of &#163;1 per month by way of fine is rather heavy upon a small income; but a penalty should remain, in order to enforce upon the attention of the public a recognition of their responsibilities. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I had been considering the proposal to fix a specific date; but the fact would still remain that the public would take advantage of it to&#39; the last possible moment. In Queensland, a month&#39;s extension of time may be secured upon communicating with the Commissioner. I believe, also, that under the original Federal Act, if a person requests an extension he may be granted a further term without undue difficulty. Failing a more suitable or equitable proposition, I feel constrained to support the clause, even though it may inflict an unfortunately heavy penalty in certain cases. </para>

          <para>. - The taxpayer of small means who fails to make a return under this clause is to be fined &#163;1 per month. That would be considerably more than the amount of his tax, and as the months&#39; fines accrued he would probably have to pay very many times that total. But the individual who is called upon to pay a substantial amount of income tax would find it pay him handsomely to furnish no return at all, but take it out by way of the fine of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> a month. One might well ask if the clause has been inserted to provide wealthy taxpayers with an avenue of escape from paying any taxation whatever. All they would be called upon to pay would be the sum of &#163;1 per month; and I should think many of them would adopt that course without a murmur. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>There are other clauses following this which give the Commissioner more than sufficient power to inflict penalties upon taxpayers who are negligent. What surprises me most is that the fine should have been merely <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> per month. I wonder that the mathematical brain was not brought to .bear upon the case again, so that some complicated and graduated scale, with any number of kinks and curves in it, could be introduced, which, although no honorable senator could understand it, would probably pass through Committee without protest. Later, after the amendment has been dealt with, I propose to move for the deletion of the clause. </para>

          <para>, - If honorable senators turn to clause 41, they will note that there is a penalty imposed on those who fail to furnish information; that is, &#163;1, or 10 per cent, of the amount of the assessable tax, whichever is the greater. I suggest that the Committee negative the clause under, discussion, and then&#39; that when attention is given to clause 41 - which applies only to information - we should insert also the words &#34;return or&#34; - thus making the one  common penalty apply both to the individual who fails to furnish a return and to him who fails to give information necessary for taxation purposes. That would get over the difficulty raised as to the tax being excessive in one case and not sufficient in another. </para>

I direct attention to the fact that by sub-paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> of paragraphb of this clause it is proposed that the words &#34; knowingly and wilfully,&#34; which are included in the section proposed to be amended, shall be left out. The effect of this amendment will be to put the taxpayer into the position of having to prove his innocence. I heard an honorable senator this afternoon say that the basis of British jurisprudence is that a man is assumed to be innocent until he is proved to be guilty. If this clause is carried as it stands the taxpayer will be assumed to be guilty untilhe can prove his innocence. The clause deals with matters that have to come before a Court, and with penalties up to &#163;100, and I therefore feel very strongly that the words &#34; knowingly and wilfully &#34; should not be omitted from the proposed new paragraph c of section 58. Under this clause, if&#34; a taxpayer makes or delivers a return which is false in any particular, whether he does so innocently, inadvertently, or in any other way, he will become liable to all the pains and penalties which a Court may inflict upon him. In this case it is not a Commissioner, but a Court, that imposes the penalty. I say that before we risk a man&#39;s public, private, or commercial  reputation in a Court in a matter of this kind, the onus should be placed upon the Commissioner of Taxation to prove that the man intended fraud. The reason put forward for the omission of the words &#34;knowingly and wilfully&#34; is that it is difficult for the Department to satisfy a magistrate or a judge. I am sure that the Government do not desire to obtain revenueby imposing penalties. There are already several penalties provided for. There is a penalty for failing to make a return, for a late return, and for other things, and I direct the serious attention of honorable senators to the effect which the omission of the words &#34; knowingly and wilfully,&#34; as proposed by this clause, will have. In the Bill unanimously adopted last year by the Income Tax Commissioners the words &#34;knowingly and wilfully&#34; were retained. They have been deliberately omitted from the measure now before the Committee. I urge upon the Minister for </para>
        <para class="block">Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> the dire effect which the omission of these words might have were the administration of the law in the hands of an arbitrary Commissioner. We have made many references during the consideration of this Bill to the Commissioner of Taxation, and I am sure he will recognise that they have not been personal, and that the intention has been to refer merely to an official of the Commonwealth. I do not hesitate to say that I do not think the present Commissioner of Taxation would knowingly do an injustice to any taxpayer. But wedo not know who may in future occupy that position. To illustrate my point I may mention that a member of the New South Wales Parliament said to me last Saturday, &#34; What shocking things may happen if you omit the words  knowingly and wilfully &#39; from the Commonwealth Income Tax Assessment Bill. I made up my wife&#39;s return a little while ago, and forgot to enclose a certain income from an investment to which she was entitled. I sent in, therefore, a false return.&#34; </para>

          <para>- Yes, the wife signed it. This man is a solicitor, and under this clause, if carried as it stands, his wife will be liable to be haled before a Court of law and fined. If we take our own case, some of us leave the making up of our income tax schedules to accountants or secretaries. On their verbal assurance that they are correct, we sign them. If there is anything false in those returns, we have to stand up to it; and under this clause the position and prestige of an honorable senator would be at the mercyof, say, a vindictive official. I do not think that the taxpayers of Australia should be brought before a Court of law until it is proved that they have knowingly and wilfully made false returns. I ask the Minister to consider the importance of the proposed amendment. I repeat that if clause 39 whipped the taxpayers with whips, clause 40 would whip them with scorpions. The proposed omission of the words &#34;knowingly and wilfully &#34; has created in New South Wales a good deal of public discontent. </para>

In this clause it is proposed to omit those words, so that the law will be that any person who makes or delivers a return which is false in any particular, or makes any false answer, whether verbally or in writing, will be subject to certain penalties. Under this clause, the Commissioner may drag any taxpayer before a Court, and charge him with making a false return, when he may not have had any intention to do any such thing. I would ask the Minister to see whether some way out of this difficulty cannot be found. If a way out of it satisfactory to the taxpayers cannot be found, I shall personally be prepared to fight this clause to the last ditch. In the meantime, I move - </para>

          <para>. -  I think the amendment entirely reasonable. A man may make a certain statement in a return believing it to be absolutely correct. The Commissioner may disagree with it, and the taxpayer may then be haled before a Court and fined. It may subsequently be discovered on appeal to the High Court that the interpretation of the Department was wrong, and that the view taken by the taxpayer was entirely correct. He will then have been fined for doing something which the Court holds to be correct. This may be an extreme case, but it is one which might very well arise. Where a man innocently sends in any particulars which subsequently turn out to be false, he should not be penalized. The Commissioner of Taxation has the power to reverse the taxpayer&#39;s statement of his liability to taxation, and assess him accordingly. That is the proper method for the protection of the Department. If this clause is passed, very great hardship may be inflicted upon taxpayers which may be quite undeserved. By inserting the words &#39; &#39; knowingly and wilfully,&#34; as suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> that may be avoided. </para>

            <para>- I fancy that his guilt could be proved. But this is a very different position. A statement may be made in all good faith, and yet, according to the judgment of the Taxation Department, it may be false. The judgment of the Department may subsequently prove to be erroneous, but, in the meantime, the accused may have been punished. I think that this is an exceedingly bad clause to retain in the Bill. I can imagine the case of a woman, who is dragged before the Court on a charge of having made a false declaration, leading to most distressing results. </para>

          <para>. - While listening to this discussion I could not help thinking that there is somehow a lack of moral fibre running through the community. Everybody agrees that it is necessary to place certain obligations upon our citizens. But the moment a citizen fails to discharge those obligations, and punishment is hanging over him, everybody appears afraid that that punishment should fall. If we are going to leave it to citizens themselves to determine whether or not they shall discharge their obligations, I venture to say that all ideas of true citizenship will disappear. </para>

No doubt honorable senators will recall it. My sympathies are not so much with the evil-doer as with those who suffer from his ill-deeds.

But we shall help the guilty person to escape if we place him in such a position that we can never prove his guilt.

In that Act it was recognised that where a number of persons banded themselves together for the purpose of forming a trust or combine, it would be impossible to prove that they did so to inflict injury upon Australian industries. Consequently, the onus was thrown upon them of proving that they had no such intent. </para>

            <para>- The point is, the number of cases in which the Department is convinced that an offence has been committed, but in which it is impossible to prove that it  Was  committed knowingly and wilfully. Let me now deal with the other extreme. It would possibly be regarded as inequitable if. we assumed the guilt of an accused person. I propose, therefore, to submit an amendment which will largely meet the objections urged by my honorable friends, and  which, at the same time, will not leave the Department without some effective weapon&#39; of defence. I have sketched the defendant in Court merely holding his tongue and throwing on the Department the obligation to prove that he has committed an offence knowingly and wilfully. Instead of assuming that he is guilty, I propose to put that man in the position of proving that he did or did not - as the case may be - commit an offence knowingly and wilfully. I propose to insert as sub-section 4 of this clause the following: - </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <quote>
          <para>It shall be a defence to a prosecution for an offence against paragraph o of sub-section 1 of this section if the defendant proves that the false particulars were given or the false statement was made through ignorance or inadvertence. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">The accused is the only person who can prove whether the offence was committed inadvertently or in&#39; ignorance. The prosecution cannot prove it. If he has a good case, under the amendment which I have outlined, he will be enabled to present it to the Court. But, instead of taking his place there and holding his tongue, he will be called upon to give reasons why incorrect statements were made by him. I think that is a very fair half-way house. If a man has deliberately attempted to defraud the revenue, he ought to be punished. The amendment which I shall presently submit will afford him an opportunity to prove that he erred innocently. We have no right to go beyond that. I ask either <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> to withdraw his amendment or the Committee to negative it, so as to allow me to move the amendment which I have indicated. I think that honorable senator j may well regard my proposal as a fair attempt to meet the objections which have been urged by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> without leaving the Department utterly impotent against those who may seek to avoid the discharge of their obligation&#39;s. </para>

          <para>- They failed to carry conviction, to my mind, that the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> is not a reasonable one, and one that should be adopted. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has stated that the document concocted by the Taxation officers at the Conference between representatives of the Commonwealth and the States ought to be warmly approved. From that document I find that they purposely retain the words &#39; &#39; knowingly and wilfully,&#34; apparently because they thought it was not necessary to strike them out, and that they could get sufficient power elsewhere to recover all the taxation due. The Minister informs us, if not directly, at least by inference, that the very unsatisfactory and meagre amount of money collected under the Federal income tax is due to the use of those two words &#34; knowingly &#34; and &#34; wilfully &#34; in the Act. He has given no illustrations in support of that statement, and we are entitled to form the conclusion that he is drawing on his imagination. If he produces evidence to show that the revenue has been seriously lessened by the presence of those two words, we may give his proposal more favorable consideration. The proposed new paragraph simply reenacts paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> in another form, and the Committee would do wrong to entertain the Minister&#39;s suggestion. &#34; If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> is so ill-advised as to withdraw his amendment I shall immediately move it again. One would imagine that there were no fines provided for in the Bill, but clause 40 provides that any person making or delivering a return which is false in any particular, or making a false answer in relation to certain matters, shall be guilty of an offence, and liable to a penalty of &#163;100. That amount is so substantial that the Government now propose to make the penalty &#34; not less than &#163;2 or more than &#163;100.&#34; Let me here again express my surprise that they have not put one of those kinking curves into the clause. As the Government are anxious to get the Bill passed, I would suggest to them not to endeavour to depart from the excellent resolutions arrived at in some cases by the Taxation Commissioners in Conference, or to make people liable to heavy fines when they act unwittingly. Very few people, especially those with incomes derived jointly from property and personal exertion, are capable of correctly filling in their own returns, especially if their businesses extend over a number of States, so that under the Minister&#39;s proposal most persons of that class could be proceeded against. The Committee should adopt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten&#39;s</inline> amendment, which is in&#39; accord with the views of most people who have given the matter any consideration whatever. If the Minister could show us that the revenue had suffered severely by the inclusion of the words &#34; knowingly &#34; and &#34; wilfully &#34; in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c,</inline> he would be on more convincing ground, t&#62;ut he has not shown that the revenue has suffered even to the extent of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1.</inline> That being so, the right thing to do is to carry <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten&#39;s</inline> amendment. </para>

          <para>. - My conception of the functions of the members of this Committee is that it is our duty to act as umpires between the taxpayers and the Taxation Department. While we should be very keen to prevent any opportunity of injustice being inflicted upon the taxpayer, it is, nevertheless, necessary for us to have a full appreciation of the national needs, and of the difficulties which undoubtedly confront the Taxation Department from time to time. It was my intention to vote for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten&#39;s</inline> amendment. I say that frankly, because there has been a considerable public outcry against the language of the clause as it stands, but the amendment suggested by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> meets the case. In practice the Commissioner would never be so ill-advised as to bring an action against a taxpayer unless he was convinced that he was really a transgressor in intention. In practice also the same evidence  would have to be adduced whether the clause was passed as it stands, or whether the Act was allowed to remain as it is. For the real satisfaction of a magistrate, and to constitute &#39; an offence in the eyes of the Taxation Department, I take it that the act of the taxpayer would have to be wilfully and intentionally fraudulent. It would be an unheard-of thing if, because a taxpayer made a mistake, the Commissioner came down on him and prosecuted him straight away. A Commissioner so lacking in discretion would not very long maintain his position in the Public Service. At the same time a defaulting taxpayer, really believed by the Commissioner to be an intentional defaulter, should be compelled to make his defence. If the Commissioner really believes that a taxpayer has wilfully and intentionally attempted to falsify his return, he should be in a position to successfully prosecute him. If the taxpayer is not inten tionally fraudulent, he ought not to b&#169; ashamed to enter on his defence, and an innocent man nearly always has a sufficient defence. I shall vote against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten&#39;s</inline> amendment with the intention of supporting that which the Minister has foreshadowed. I would point out to the Minister representing the Commissioner &#39; that the mistakes are not always on one side. I have been giving more attention to our taxation legislation lately than I have done hitherto, and it has dawned on me recently that for two years I have included in my return substantial sums which were not strictly and legally derived from Australian sources. It is my intention at an early date to apply to the Department for a refund. No doubt a good many  mistakes have been made in that way. The taxpayer is not altogether as unpatriotic as some people assume him to be. </para>

Income tax legislation is necessarily complex, and I am not sure that, unless one has some knowledge of accountancy, one rightly comprehends the meaning of all the directions in an income tax return. It is not our &#34;duty to be continually attempting to withdraw the taxpayer from the ambit of the Department&#39;s operations. It is our duty to give him proper protection, but it is also our duty to see that the national needs, which the Commissioner typifies, are met. So long  as  they are properly and honestly met, and provision is made for all the exigencies of the case, nothing &#34;more need be said. The proposal in the  Bill  is a sort of innovation, and I do not like to see the principle of making a charged man prove  his  innocence creeping into our jurisprudence. The onus ought really to be on the person &#39; bringing the charge to prove that he is guilty, and this is an innovation in the British system of jurisprudence that ought to be very carefully watched. </para>

            <para>- That is so. I believe that in practice the Commissioner would not bring an action against a taxpayer unless he honestly believed he was guilty of some fraudulent action, and that the magistrate would not care to inflict a heavy penalty unless he was persuaded that fraud existed. The needs of justice, theoretically and practically, will be met by the amendment foreshadowed by the Minister. I therefore hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> to whom a great deal of praise is due for the careful application he has given to the measure, will not press his amendment. </para>

There is at least this comfort in it, that the defendant will have a chance to prove his innocence. That is a concession. I admit the need of protecting the revenue, and as the Minister has shown that we have already initiated in other legislation the system of throwing the onus of proof on the suspected party, I feel that he has met the Committee reasonably. In the absence of an amendment such as the Minister has indicated, I should certainly have supported <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten.</inline> I am prepared to support the Minister, and suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> withdraw his amendment. </para>

This is a principle which was introduced by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston.</inline> The Acts Interpretation Act makes it quite clear that where a penalty is stated it means the maximum.

            <para>- I understand that the proposal has been negatived. I do not think that after the Minister made his announcement any honorable senators earnestly attempted to do anything further; but now the Minister seeks to alter what is a most vital provision, which states that the maximum penalty shall be &#163;100, and that the penalty shall grade down to &#163;2, according to the enormity of the offence. It is now proposed to strike out paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c,</inline> and the inference will be that as the penalty is stated at &#163;100, the offence must be enormous, because it will go out to the public that the Committee struck out the words fixing the minimum penalty at &#163;2. I hope the Minister will reconsider this matter. </para>

What do the magistrates throughout the length and breadth of New South Wales know about that? They will look up the Act, and find the words &#34; penalty, &#163;100,&#34; and assume that it means nothing more and nothing less, so they will be in a difficulty.

            <para>- Even if the Acts Interpretation Act does say that, I would have no hesitation whatever in departing from stereotyped expressions laid down in Acts of Parliament. We are not here to follow precedents of that kind, but for the purpose of making precedents, and I think it would fit the case exactly if the words &#34;not less than1s. nor more than &#163;100 &#34; were inserted. We are assured frequently that magistrates only impose a fine of1s. If it is true that a penalty of &#163;100 means any penalty down to1s., why not say so in the Bill, so as to make it understandable to any one? I give notice thatI will move to strike out the words &#34; Two pounds,&#34; with a view to inserting the words &#34; One shilling.&#34; </para>

          <para>. - Concerning the amendment of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen),</inline> the minimum penalty of &#163;1, in its application to the man who receives a little over &#163;3 per week, is equivalent to about one-third of that salary for the week. It may not seem much to honorable senators, but it is actually a very heavy penalty upon persons of small means. I agree that there should be some amount of penalty, but previously it was 10 per cent. A fine of &#163;1 would not be too great in the case of failure to furnish information. The Commissioner might require, by way of information, the presentation of a person&#39;s books of account, in which circumstance the minimum penalty of &#163;1 would not be excessive. But here we are classing a minor offence with a major offence. </para>

          <para>. - I view with some concern the proposal that the minimum fine under this clause should be &#163;1. That is a mere unconsidered trifle to honorable senators on the other side, but it should not be forgotten that men receiving &#163;156 a year, and, if unmarried, men receiving only &#163;100 a year, will come within its operation. They will be liable to a fine of &#163;1 if they fail to fill in their returns correctly, or to furnish information which will enable the Commissioner of Taxation to extract the last penny for which they may be liable under this Bill. It is very significant that in the case of persons in receipt of higher incomes the fine is to be 10 per cent, of the tax payable by them. I hope that the Minister will agree to leave out the words &#34; One pound or,&#34; and later on the words &#34; whichever is the greater.&#34; If that is done, the small taxpayer will be brought under the same condition as the man who is assessable to a larger amount, and the fine he will have to pay for default under this clause will be 10 per cent, of the amount of his tax. </para>

            <para>- We may be sure that the Commissioner of Taxation will treat the taxpayer, at least for a first offence, in the most lenient manner. If a man continues to offend, the Commissioner will be justified in using the whole of the machinery of the Act against him. I hope that the Minister- will be reasonable, and will agree that all taxpayers shall be treated alike. I do not care whether the percentage charged as a fine be 5 per cent. or 10 per cent., but certainly a minimum fine of &#163;1 will represent a very heavy penalty upon some persons who will be called upon to pay income tax under this measure.

          <para>. - In many phases of legislation it is very difficult to submit a proposition which is entirely logical, and which assumes the uniformity of a mathematical proposition. There would possibly be a difference in the percentage penalties proposed by the clause if allowed to pass as it stands; but honorable senators have to bear in mind that there are other things to be considered besides mathematical uniformity. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant&#39;s</inline> amendment to strike out the penalty of &#163;1, and leave the only penalty which could be imposed, 10 per cent. of the amount of the tax, would confront the Taxation Department very frequently with this position : A man whose tax amounted to &#163;1 would be liable to a fine of 2s. </para>

          <para>.- The refusal of the Minister to accept my amendment was based upon the assumption that it would in certain cases cost more than 10 per cent. to collect a fine of that amount. He urged that a fine of 2s. only upon a defaulting taxpayer whose tax amounted to &#163;1 would not be sufficient to justify the Department in going to the trouble and expense of proceeding against the defaulter. That leads me to believe that the honorable senator does not desire to be unreasonable and to do any injustice to the small taxpayer. I therefore ask him to accept an amendment to strike out the words &#34; One pound,&#34; and insert in lieu thereof the words &#34; Ten shillings.&#34; </para>
