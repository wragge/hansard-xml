                    <para>Some time ago <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> asked a question as to the approximate net earnings of the Commonwealth Government Line of Steamers for the year ending 30th June, 1918, and as to whether any depreciation had been allowed for since the purchase of the steamers. </para>
                    <para>I have now ascertained that some time ago the net earnings for the year mentioned, after providing for interest and one year's depreciation, were estimated to be about £659,000. No depreciation was provided for in the balance-sheet for the period ended 30th June, 1917, but at a conference held in January last regarding the accounts of the Commonwealth Government Line of Steamers it was decided to make provision for depreciation by writing off annually a sum equal to 10 per cent, of their original cost in the ease of the Austral vessels, and 15 per cent, in the case of the wooden vessels and the sailing vessel <inline font-style="italic">John Murray.</inline> This decision will be given effect to in the balance-sheet 'for the year ended 30th June, 1918. </para>

It is presumed that the honorable senator's questions refer to the <inline font-style="italic">Cethana.</inline> Certain repairs were carried out in connexion with this vessel, as is almost inevitable in all ships, and especially to be expected in such a vessel as the <inline font-style="italic">Cethana,</inline> which is believed to be the  first of her kind ever built. It is hardly possible to give a list of all repairs. The main portion consisted of caulking the hull, which, of course; was expected to be required in a ship of this description, and the fitting of wireless gear in accordance with an arrangement that this work should be done in Australia. 3 and 4. The donkey boiler was replaced. Cost of the new boiler is £475. This matter is being taken up with the builders. </para>

                    <para>The object of the measure is to alter the rate of the entertainments tax. Up to the present the tax has been levied on all payments for admission to entertainments exceeding 6d. Hitherto sixpenny and threepenny tickets have not been taxed, and it is now proposed to levy a tax of1d. on all tickets not exceeding1s.; but the tax upon the higher-priced tickets will stand at. the existing rate. At present the tax is not charged on tickets of admission to entertainments if theCommissioner is satisfied that the entertainment in question is intended for children, and that the rate of admission does not exceed 6d. This is provided for in the Entertainments Tax Assessment Act, which is untouched fay this measure. It may be of interest to honorable senators to know that the corresponding tax in Great Britain is as follows :  - On tickets not exceeding 2½d., the taxis½d. ; between 2½d. and 4d.,1d.; between 4d.-and 7d., 2d.; between 7d. and 1s., 3d.; between ls. and 2s., 4d.; between 2s. and 3s., 6d. ; between 3s. and 5s., 9d. ; between 5s. and 7s. 6d.,1s.; between 7s. 6d. and 10s. 6d.,1s. 6d. ; between 10s. 6d. and 15s., 2s.; exceeding 15s., 2s. for the first 15s., and 6d. for every 5s. or part thereof above 5s. In the Commonwealth, if this Bill is passed, the tax will be1d. on tickets not exceeding1s., and½d. for every 6d. or part thereof by which the payment exceeds ls. </para>

                            <para>- In 1917 and 1918 the entertainments tax yielded £245,890. A decrease is anticipated this year on account of the curtailed schedule of rating that has been promulgated by the Government, as a result of which we estimate that only £205,000. will be collected. Under the operation of this Bill it is estimated that an additional £275,000 will be received. </para>

The taxation proposed in this Bill is not of a retrospective character, and, consequently, the Government are anxious to bring it into operation without delay. Unlike the land and income taxes, these imposts cannot be made retrospective. </para>

                            <para>- I would remind' honorable senators that additional taxation is necessary, and the method outlined in this Bill is regarded by the Government as one means of raising extra revenue. Consequently, it should not be judged by itself , but as part of the policy which the Ministry have put forward. When that policy is regarded as a whole, it will be seen that what is proposed is justifiable as a tax on luxury - a tax upon non-essentials. </para>

It has been suggested that  we should also increase the impost that is levied on the higher-priced entertainment tickets. Now it is pretty sure - just as sure as that two of the most certain things in life are death and taxation - that when wo reassemble here in the new financial year additional taxation will have to be imposed. It has been necessary for the Government, therefore, in reviewing its taxation proposals as a whole, to leave some forms of taxation untouched, so that the whole field will not have been exploited before next year. </para>

That will allow the " kiddies" to attend their picture shows every week. It is a concession which, I am sure, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> will appreciate. Having satisfied him in that regard, I look forward to his enthusiastic support of the Bill. </para>

                            <para>- I am not convinced of that. I have attended matinee performances in country towns on Saturday afternoon. The position indicated by the honorable senator may obtain in the benighted State from which he hails, but in practically all the country towns of Western Australia picture shows are open on Saturday afternoon. I think it is a fair tiling to say that amusements of all kinds are luxuries. Certainly nobody can claim that they are necessities. The principal Act imposes taxation upon all forms of amusement, and it seems to me that there is no logical reason why tickets of the lower denomination should escape taxation altogether. </para>

                        <para>. - I have very little to say upon this Bill. I listened attentively to the speech delivered by the Minister in explaining its provisions, and I gather that it is intended to remedy the evil cf allowing large manufacturers to pay smaller licence-fees than they should pay. In other words he affirmed that its object is to make the big corporations pay more in the future for the supervision which they will get. Apparently it is a Bill which can be best dealt with in Committee, and when that stage is reached I shall have a few amendments to submit. From my point of view, the most objectionable feature of the measure is that the graduated scale of the licence fees embodied in it is not sufficiently severe. Under that scale the large manufacturer will still get off in too easy a way. Another evil is that even if we penalize the large manufacturers they will merely pass the tax on to the consumers. No provision is contained in the Bill under which the tax will be collected from the proprietors of these factories in order to prevent them from passing it on to the consumers. If such a provision had been embodied in it, I would have no objection whatever to offer to it. I see no other very objectionable features in it, and therefore I shall not delay its passage. </para>

                        <para>. - I should like to say a word or two about this Bill, which has for its object an amendment of the machinery under which Excise duties are collected. I take it that it is intended to deal not merely with the licences for the manufacture of tobacco, but also with spirits and other excisable commodities. Generally speaking, it may be said that the measure provides amending machinery in connexion with duties ou imported goods, which are to be increased by about 25 per cent., while the increase in the duties upon goods made within the Commonwealth ranges from 33 to 50 per cent. [ do not think that any exception can be taken to the proposals of the Government so far as alcoholic liquors are concerned. But there is one proposal in connexion with the new Excise duties to which I desire to direct attention. </para>

Therefore, in dealing with a machinery Bill of this character one should also be able to deal with the suggested duties that "will be imposed under it. </para>

That being so, it would be mere" waste of time and contrary to parliamentary practice to attempt to discuss them before they came before us. The honorable senator will lose no opportunity of debating the proposed Excise duties to which he refers. </para>

I am under the impression, however, that, following precedents established since the war began, the schedule of those duties has been laid on the table of another place, and the duties are being collected accordingly, without any obligation resting on the Government to push them, through Parliament at any early date. </para>

                            <para>- I am not concerned with- the question whether the Government will introduce the proposed amendments of the Excise duties early or late. My duty is to see that the discus sion of any motion or measure proposed in this chamber is in order, and that the discussion on no proposal is anticipated. . The honorable senator must know that it is entirely out of order to discuss on this measure a matter which is not properly included in it. The only assurance I can give the honorable senator is that none of the duties to which he refers can become law without every honorable senator having a full opportunity to discuss them. They may be collected in the meantime, but if they fail to become law the moneys so collected must be refunded. </para>

                        <para>. -  The Bill has nothing whatever to do with taxation. Its object is largely to bring the Excise Act up to date. In 1901, owing to the transfer of the Customs Department from the States to the Commonwealth, various anomalies were left in the Act, and special provisions in regard to taxation for a number of years were included in the case of Western Australia, as were certain border duties. Much of that stuff is now mere dead matter in the Act, and this Bill practically effects a cleaning up. The one exception is the increase in the licence-fees payable by big tobacco manufacturers. The Bill has nothing to do with whisky or other spirits. It covers tobacco, rice, starch, and one or two other items. The licence-fees are not being increased in order to raise revenue. In the old days, the maximum licence-fee was . £250, but tobacco was then manufactured in many factories. Since then, there has been a concentration of effort in the trade, with the result that, whilst we employ Excise officers to protect the revenue and supervise the work of large factories, the fees charged do not pay the expenses of supervision. We have no desire to make any profit out of the licence-fees, but no one can disagree with the principle that large factories, representing big combinations of capital, should find sufficient licence-fees to pay the cost to the country of the Excise officers engaged in them. </para>

                        <para>. - I disagree with the Minister's explanation that the proposed alteration of the existing Act involves a decentralization of power. Under the existing Act this authority may be delegated only to  a  Collector of Customs for a State. But the Bill proposes to give the authority to the Comptroller, and, in fact, will give him power to override the authority of Collectors of Customs for the different States. The tendency of that is not towards decentralization, but rather towards concentration. </para>

                        <para>. - The honorable senator will recognise that in a place like the Northern Territory there is not sufficient Customs and Excise business to  warrant  the employment of a Collector of Customs, who is an officer occupying a very high position in the Department. There are times when the Customs officer in charge at such remote places should be in a position to exercise all the powers which might be delegated to him by the Comptroller, who would, of course, be responsible to the Commonwealth Government for any action he took in that regard. It will  he  seen that such a delegation of power might prove to be a very great convenience. The purpose of the clause is to make the machinery of the Excise Act operate more easily and effectively, and to  prevent  the hanging up of disputes which might arise in such a place as the Northern Territory. </para>

The clause provides that the authority may be delegated to the Comptroller, any Collector of Customs for the State, or any principal officer of Customs. I agree with the principle of the clause, but I think there should be some limitation to this power of delegation of authority. Under this provision it might extend to an officer of the lowest grade in the Department. I agree that Australia, being so vast in area, some power of delegation of authority is necessary. </para>

The Customs or Excise officer in the Northern Territory might be a man very low down on the list of officers of the Department, but it may be assumed that the Comptroller will have such a knowledge and experience of the officers in charge of the different ports as to be able to decide what power he would be safe in delegating to them. </para>

It will affect persons who contravene, sometimes deliberately, and sometimes not deliberately, Customs and Excise regulations, and are prosecuted therefor. Personally, I have no objection to persons, who try to swindle or rob, or beat the Government through the Customs being prosecuted with the utmost rigour of the law. This clause proposes some comparatively extensive alterations affecting urosecutions, and I should like to hear the reasons for it, and some statement of the difficulties and defects of the existing provision! </para>

In the event of evidence being brought forward in defence, it is proposed that the Department shall have the right to call its officers to give evidence in rebuttal of the statements of the defence. It is not desired to bring the whole army of inspectors and Customs officers into Court for every small prosecution; but, if it is necessary in the interests of the Department, they, in giving evidence, can be subsequently added to the averment already made. </para>

                        (New South Wales [4.7]. - I am not quite clear on the point now. When an amending Income Tax Bill was before the Senate, it was desired to make a very drastic amendment in connexion with the prosecution of persons under that law in the direction of omitting the words, " wilfully and knowingly." I think it is right that the commercial community should have some protection in the matter of prosecutions which the Government must necessarily institute from time to time. But I trust this clause does not go too far. I would ask the Minister to specifically state that it is not intended to take any technical advantage of an individual who has made a breach of the Customs or Excise law, and that this amendment does not place a defendant in a worse position than was previously the case.

                        <para>This clause provides for an amendment of section 144 of the principal Act, which section, it may he mentioned, is similar in terms to that of section 255 of the Customs Act and section 15a of the Australian Industries Preservation Act. The section provides, in effect, that in any Excise prosecution the averment of the prosecution contained in the information shall he deemed to be proof in the absence of proof to the contrary. </para>
                        <para>In recent Customs cases it was held by the High Court, first, that in any case in which this section was availed of, reliance must be placed entirely upon the averment, that is to say, the Department could not call evidence on matters in regard to which proof was available and rely upon the averment in regard to other matters. (Coal Vend case, 15 C.L.R., p. 102.) In a more recent case, <inline font-style="italic">Whitton</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Schiffman,</inline> where reliance was placed wholly upon the averment, it was further ruled that the averments in the information were not averments of fact, but of mixed fact and law, and that the averment was consequently bad, as the term " averment " in the section was confined to a pure allegation of fact, and did not include an allegation of mixed law and fact. </para>
                        <para>So long as the present decision of the High Court stands, section 144 of the principal Act, as also the corresponding sections of the Customs and the Australian Industries Preservation Acts, is practically useless. Theamendment how proposed has been drafted by the Law Department to remedy the defects mentioned. </para>
                        <para>Under the amended section it will be possible to supplement the averment by the testimony of witnesses, and also at the same time to use a form of averment which would be an averment of mixed fact and law. </para>

                    <para class="block">I do not think the graduation scale, as set out in the schedule, is sufficient. A man who manufactures 1,000,000 lbs. of tobacco pays £500 for his licence to manufacture; but for every additional 1,000,000 lbs. he pays only a further £100. That is giving the big manufacturer too great a pull over the smaller man. The graduation is not fair or scientific. </para>

                        <para>. -  I trust the Committee will not be under any misapprehension. This is not a Bill to raise Excise taxation. If its object were to impose additional taxation upon tobacco companies, the honorable senator would have my sympathy. But this measure has merely to do with the necessary provision of supervisors in the form of Excise officers; and each industry is required to pay the expenses attached to the duties of those officers. The Government, recognising the growth of the big factories, has placed an additional licence-fee on the larger companies, which equals an increase of from 100 to 200 per cent. This is merely machinery, and the Government holds that machinery should be provided for in every industry, by means of which to pay the full and complete expenses of each Excise officer required. The proposition, as set forth in the schedule, is both fair and scientific. </para>

                    <para>.- When the Bill was last under consideration, I pointed out that it would be better if, instead of appointing three directors, the Government appointed one controller for the present, so that full inquiries might be made before the three directors were selected. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell),</inline> in his second-reading speech, and also in the earlier stages of the debate in Committee, . said it was the desire of the Government to exploit the scientific brains of the world in order that the very best' men obtainable could be secured. If, however, the appointments are made immediately, it will mean that certain directors will be appointed, and probably, at a not distant date, other men far more suitable for the position will be available; but, unfortunately the positions will then be closed against them. Furthermore, I would like to know from the Minister who is going to be the judge in appointing these scientific men? Will the Minister in charge of the Department decide what scientists shall be appointed, or will some advice be given by the various State Boards already in existence? </para>

                        <para>- Because, if the Minister were a scientist he should not be looking about for directors to control this Department, but would undertake the work himself. I understand the Minister takes the stand that the administrative head of the Department will be the right and proper person to make the appointments; and I would like to know what steps have already been taken to obtain the most suitable men; whether applications have been invited from other parts of the world - a course which I consider should be taken - or whether the matter is all cut and dried. The Committee is entitled to more information. </para>

                    <para>. - I quit© agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> that the very best men available should be procured regardless of expense. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gellatly</inline> has been mentioned. I do not know anything about that gentleman, but  there is a good deal in what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> has said. We would like to know whether the Government, who, I suppose, will appoint the directors, have their eye upon certain men already, or whether they are - going to invite applications from other parts of the world. If we are going to do any good work at all we ought to get the very best men available; but as I have already said, I am afraid that, by establishing this Institute, we shall only interfere with good work that is already being done. Still, if the measure is going through, we want to see that the men selected for the positions possess the very highest attainments. I do not know anything about those -whose names have been already mentioned. They may be the best that can be obtained, but I think considerable time should be taken, over this matter and the greatest care exercised before the appointments are finalized. Professor Lefroy is a man who, I should think, is most eminently suited for one of these positions if he can be induced to remain here. I urge the Minister to do nothing in a hurry. That is my fear in connexion with this matter. The directors, when appointed, will occupy positions similar to those of the Supreme Court Judges. They could not be turned out. And we do not want to see that. I think it would be nothing  short  of cruelty if the Government appointed men to 'these positions, and then had to turn them out because of unsuitability. I hope, therefore, that the greatest care will be exercised in making the appointments. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not know why it should be assumed that the Government are going to be more careless in making these appointments than in any other matters. As an indication of what is being done, I may say that I have a complete list of the names and qualifications of every scientist in Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gellatly</inline> has been appointed as a commercial member of the board of directors. I have no hesitation In saying that the Government are quite satisfied as to his ability, and that he will be one of the three directors. Many brilliant young Australian scientists are doing war service in the Old Country, and the Government have cabled to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> asking him to interview them and obtain their qualifications. In this matter I think the Government may be trusted to select the best men available. I have nobody in view, nor have the Government. The only desire is to secure the most suitable men available, and I feel confident that the appointments will reflect credit upon Australia and do much for the scientific development of our industries. </para>

                    <para>. - This clause provides for the appointment of directors for -a term of five  years, and clause 8 deals with the manner by which their services may be dispensed with. I see no objection to the appointment of suitable men for five, seven, or ten years, so long as the clause whereby unsuitable men may be got rid of is sufficiently flexible. I think, perhaps, a five years' term is a reasonable minimum, and I have no objection to that term, although there are some arguments For a shorter period. When we reach clause 8, perhaps the Minister will so enlarge it that no term, such as five, seven, or ten years, will be arbitrary in the event of any man proving unsuitable for his position. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. My contention is that if they were obliged to submit their qualifications to the electors of this country we should know precisely what they were. What is there about the position of the directors of this Institute which should remove it from the domain of popular election as compared with the position of a member of Parliament? Nothing whatever. Under this Bill an effort is being made to establish some  really choice billets for certain gentlemen. </para>

                <para class="block">The passing of the Bill is a foregone conclusion, but the proposal to leave the appointment of the directors of the Institute in the hands of Ministers has not been assented to. Considering that Ministers recently had their numbers increased to enable them to cope with the work which they have to perform, I think that it would be wise to relieve them of the appointment of these directors. </para>

                        <para>- I quite agree with the honorable senator. I think it would be wise to insist upon candidates for appointment to the board of directors of the Institute submitting their claims to the electors and allowing the latter to vote upon them. I know that such a course would involve the expenditure of a certain sum of money, but that ought not to count, so long as we secured the right men. We ought to recollect that it costs a large sum of money to defray the election of members of Parliament for a limited term. But, under this Bill, it is proposed to appoint the directors of the Institute for a period of five years, with the right of reappointment. </para>

                        <para>-  I have no doubt that it is intended to secure for the proposed board of directors the finest suite of offices available in Melbourne. If one wanders through the Parliament buildings he cannot fail to notice that, with the exception of Ministers, very little provision is made for the convenience  of  honorable members. Our telephones, for example, are stuck up on the walls  of  the building. But in any public office, in Melbourne or elsewhere, the most up-to-date telephones are to be found. It is only fair, I  repeat.  that candidates for the office of director on the Board of the Institute should submit themselves for popular election. </para>

                        <para>- I can assure the Vice-President of the Executive Council that when I raised the question I had no idea of casting any aspersion upon him. I merely desired to insure the appointment to this Board of the very best men available. I feel very strongly in regard to some of the gentlemen who have been appointed to various Boards. We know very well that on the Business Board of the Defence Department there are men who are drawing large salaries and expenses - wealthy men, who are probably making more money owing to the war than they have ever made previously. At the same time, men on the Western and other Fronts are sacrificing their lives in the defence of our liberties, and are leaving their wives and families behind to maintain themselves on a mere pittance. While our soldiers are doing this, the individuals serving upon these Boards require a salary of £1,200 a year. It is because I feel strongly on this question that I spoke as I did, although I recognise that the board of directors of the proposed Institute will differ materially from the Business Board of the Defence Department. </para>

Seeing that every member of the Legislature is responsible to his constituents for the expenditure that is incurred by the Government of the day, we should most certainly have some voice in the salaries and expenses which are to be paid to the proposed board of directors.

In reply to the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll,</inline> I would point out that if, in this Bill, we fix the salaries be be paid to the directors, those salaries will be effectually removed from the control of Parliament for five years. On the other hand, if they are subject to an annual appropriation by Parliament, they will remain under our control the whole time. It will then be easy for honorable senators to express either approval or disapproval of those salaries by submitting a motion in thisChamber. </para>

                        <para>- If the Senate affirmed a motion in favour of the reduction of the salaries payable, the Government would be compelled to take action. The Bill permits of Parliament exercising the greatest possible control over the proposed board of directors, and my advice is that honorable senators should therefore accept the Clause as it stands. </para>

He lias assured us that we shall have complete control over the salaries to be paid to the directors of this Institute by virtue of an annual parliamentary appropriation. But I venture to point out that we shall have no more control over those salaries than we have over any other Department which is presided over by a Minister. As I understoodSenator Foll's remarks, he desires that Parliamentshall fix the salaries to be paid to the directors from year to year in accordance with the value of the work which they perform instead of the Ministerfixing them through the Governor-General . </para>

                        <para>- Yes. And sometimes the money is voted in a minute without any comment whatever. Only a few weeks ago a Bill was rushed through this Chamber in that fashion. The Vice President of the Executive Council has stated that the amount which will be expended on the Institute this year as £17,000. Now, so far as the Estimates are concerned, they merely disclose that £3,000 is to be expended on buildings, offices, and instruments for the institute. We know nothing whatever about  the  salaries which it is intended to pay to the directors, or as to how the sum of £1.7,000 is to be allocated. WhatSenator Foll wishes to learn is what salaries the Minister proposes to pay to the directors and staff of  the  Institute, and also what travelling expanses are to be allowed. His suggestion is  that Parliament may  very well deal with these matters instead of the Minister. </para>

                    <para>.- The Minister (SenatorRussell) told us that the expenditure contemplated was £20,000perannum,  but  I am afraid  that if we make i the  salary depend on an annual vote by Parliament, and fix the term of office at five years, we shall  not get  a high-class  man  to accept such a proposition. We hope to get the finest intellects available in the world,otherwisewecannot expect the Institute to do efficient work. If we tell them that they are engaged for five years, but  that  at any time during the term Parliament may reduce their salaries to next to nothing their position will not be satisfactory. I would rather see  the clause  left  out  altogether. </para>

                    <para>. - The clause, although it may never become operative, is most important. Through circumstances that the most prescient Minister cannot foresee, it may be necessary in the interests of the country to get rid of one or more of the directors. The clause provides the machinery whereby a director who is found to be incapable, incompetent, or misbehaving himself, can be charged and practically tried, but the language is not broad enough. A director may not be incapable, incompetent, or misbehaving, but may still be unsuitable, for other reasons, for the position he fills. </para>

He may be a fine scientist, and, theoretically, one of the best men Australia ever saw, yet he may still be absolutely unsuitable, for other reasons, to be. a director of the Institute.

                    <para>.- The clause provides that the Minister " may " at any time suspend a director, and the Governor-General "may'' appoint a Board of Inquiry. No obligation is placed on the Governor-General to appoint a Board. If the Government decide not to appoint one, the Minister in charge of the Department will have no authority to do anything to the director except to suspend him. Is the director to remain under suspension for all time, or will his dismissal be in the hands of the Minister? . The word " shall " should be substituted for " may ". </para>

                    <para>. -  I am afraid honorable senators  are  not taking the clause seriously enough. Men of the class  that  we hope for as directors are not cheap to-day. They have some soul,  and  brain power, and spirit of independence; and, whilst we  want  to protect the Government against  any  mistake occurring through a director becoming  unfit  subsequent to  his  appointment, it is not the wish of the Government or the Committee to hold a permanent threat over the heads of men whose minds should be easy to pursue their duties. Our object was to make the clause as wide as possible without being insulting. Men of science should have all the  respect  we can give them on account of their knowledge  and  ability. In the opinion of the Crown Law authorities, the present wording gives the Minister power to do everything reasonable to get rid of a director, if necessary. The. Minister, after all, has to interpret the cause of suspension. Where a man's reputation is at stake, Ministers do not act without conferring with their colleagues. It is not always possible to get hold of the ideal man for a position, and it may be necessary to induce a man already holding a position to come to us. There are many brilliant young Australians in the British Munitions Department whose claims, I hope, will be recognised. </para>

That' is not a power which Should be given to any Minister. Ministers have not' the power under the Public Service Act to' dismiss even a messenger boy without, inquiry. If it. has been, found necessary to afford! such protection to a letter carrier or a messenger boy, surely it is- not too much to ask that the same, protection should' be afforded to a man of science, who might ' be appreciated and' looked up t'o in the community?' If I were a scientist and an- applicant for a position, as a director of this Institute}, I should not dream of giving, up some other position for it if I found that I could be dismissed' from. the: directorate of the Institute at a moment's notice,,, without inquiry as to whether I was guilty of any ofIem.ce. with which I was charged: or not. The clause provides for a fair deal between the Minister and the directors. It also gives, full power to get rid. of any director, who. may be found not, to be up i to. the. standard required to make the Institute a. success or- who may be guilty of any misbehaviour. I ask honorable senators to- agree to. the clause as it stands. </para>

The Vice-President of the Executive Council has said that it is necessary that any person appointed as a director should have some assurance that he cannot be dismissed at a moment's notice, and if. my first amendment had; been accepted, a director would know that he would be entitled to a fair trial by a Board of Inquiry. As the clause stands, the appointment of such a Board is optional, and I should like to know what would happen if the Minister suspended a director, and, the Governor-General decided not to appoint a Board of Inquiry to investigate the charge made against that director. </para>

The intention evidently is that a director of the proposed Institute shall not be interested directly or indirectly in. any concern outside the work; of the Institute. A director might be a member of a syndicate, a shareholder of a company, or a partner in. a business, and whilst the clause says that he may not be a director of a company, it does not provide that he shall not be interested directly or indirectly in any operations outside those of the Institute. </para>

                    <para>: -  I think the clause meets all requirements. It gives reasonable protection that the Institute shall be. conducted: upon proper lines. Under our Constitution members of Parliament are not prevented from being members of companies, which may even: have contracts with the Government, provided there are more than twenty-five shareholders. Members of Parliament are called on. to vote away millions of pounds, without ever being; suspected of dishonesty, or that they were in any way influenced by the fact of their being members of any company. It would be wrong to hold, therefore, that a public official should be more closely hedged in with respect to his Government duties than is provided for in: the clause as it stands. We do not wish to prevent the directors from participating altogether in the affairs of life. It may be that the directors of the Institute are making experiments in connexion, with some flotation- process, say, after the manner of the De Bavay treatment. If one of those directors was holding twenty shares in. a Broken Hill company, surely, that would not necessarily corrupt his actions. The fact is that if a man desires to get past an Act of, Parliament, he wil do so despite all our laws. This clause, as it, is set out, is an indicator rather than being, in any sense, an attempt to control the personal actions of the parties concerned. The- clause goes as far as it should do. If members of Parliament can trust themselves, we should be prepared to trust our various departmental officers. </para>

                        <para>- This clause provides what the directors shall and shall not do. It would be better to leave out the words, " as a~ director, or be a director of a company," and to add, " or be interested financially, directly or indirectly, in the operations of the Institute." This Institute  is  for the very purpose of developing certain things, and of taking risks on them .with Government money for the good of the country. If the Institute discovers a specific for the prickly pear, or perfects an electrical prospecting machine, by reason of its activities having been subsidized by Government money, what is there - as the clause stands - to prevent any of the directors from making personal financial gain ? There are men who like to take a chance, not at Flemington or at Randwick, but on a patent, or upon a scheme  to  exploit this, that and the other. In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred their schemes may fail, but the hundredth may bring them a fortune. It is fair that the directors shall not be tempted to be either members of a syndicate or members, as ordinary shareholders, of a company, or partners in any concern, that may be subsidized by Government money through the interests of the Institute.

                    <para>.- The amendment would undoubtedly clarify the clause. A man may be the largest shareholder in .a company, and yet not be a director. Because an individual is a director, he is not necessarily the controlling influence. There are -many companies where the man having control does not come into the limelight at all. He exercises his influence on policy through the preponderating proportion of his snares. </para>

                    <para>.- I hope the Committee will accept the amendment. I have supported the Bill throughout,  but  it is capable, here, of improvement. I think the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> failed to grasp the purport of the amendment, because he instanced the position of members of Parliament, who are called upon to pass votes for the disbursement of millions of pounds sterling. The Minister remarked that the public evidently trusted our honesty, but his comparison was not analogous. There is nothing in the clause to prevent the directors from being tempted to do something which might be construed into an act of -misbehaviour. In the House of Commons, two or three years ago,  a  gentleman named Isaacs was charged with having an interest in a certain company. That gentleman afterwards became Lord Chief Justice of England. He was practically arraigned on the floor of the. House of Commons on a charge of having been a member of .the -Government which had let a contract of some kind to a firm in  Which  he was interested. Now,  the  directors of the proposed Institute will be in a somewhat similar position, and the Committee would be well advised to accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten's</inline> amendment, so as to prevent the slightest suspicion of any corruption. I do not know who the directors will be, but I am quite confident that not one of them would lend himself to anything of a suspicious nature. But we are here to mould the Bill in the  be3t  form possible, and it  would therefore be wise to adopt the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- I will say,' then, that in spite of the apparently party character of the division, I hope the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> will insert some provision in this clause whereby the directors of the Institute will be removed from many of the temptations that will inevitably be' pre-  sen ted to them. There could be no objection to omitting the words, "as a director  or be a director of a company " ,and substituting for them the words that have been rejected in the  recent division. Though the Minister is silent I think he will agree there is some risk, if the clause is allowed to stand, of the directors feeling that they would be perfectly justified in being holders of some syndicate shares or shares in a company which may be formed to exploit the development of certain inventions that will come under the <inline font-style="italic">aegis</inline> of this Institute. My only reason in raising this question is to see that provision is made by Act of Parliament to guard against this position. </para>

                    <para>. - This clause deals with the State Advisory Councils. . I do not know whether the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)"</inline> has considered the draftsmanship of the first paragraph in clause -4 in connexion with these Boards, but I do not wish to dwell upon that now. I point out that the present Advisory Committees in no sense carry out the representa.tion of the primary and secondary industries as intended under this Bill. This clause places in the hands of the Minister, through the directors, the exclusive right to appoint the State Advisory Councils, and for the sake of that co-operation about which we have talked so much in connexion with this Bill. I should like a slight amendment made whereby the councils must be appointed in consultation with the States. It has been suggested that the word " in" should be omitted, and the word " by " inserted, but I think that would be too drastic, as it would take all authority from the Minister and the directors of the Institute, and make it obligatory on the States to appoint the State Councils. My amendment does not go so far as this, and yet it will meet some of the objections that have been raised by several pf the State Premiers to the Bill as it stands. I move - </para>

If an unsuccessful attempt be made to consult the State Governments, the appointments will then rest with the Minister who is charged with administering the Act. </para>

                        are absolutely valueless. Anybody with experience of negoti ations of the character suggested knows perfectly well that in the past the cause of all the bickering between the States and the Commonwealth has. been that final power has not rested with some Government Department. Prior to the war nearly all the difficulties that we experienced resulted from our. constitutional limitations. It was not so much a question of what job was to be done as of what authority was to do it. That was one of the curses of this Parliament. The. Bill under consideration should be either a Federal measure, or a State measure. This Parliament has decided that it shall be a Federal' measure. Yet we are now told that it must provide for the States being consulted. The Minister charged with administering the Act will unquestionably consult anybody who is in a position to afford him1 valuable information. Bie would be a fool to- do otherwise. But if he is- compelled by Statute to consult the States he will probably send a letter to. them, and consign- their- replies to. the waste-paper- basket. I repeat that we. mu'st either make this- a Federal, or a State Bill. I have had' disputes ia regard to similar matters- before. In this connexion I recollect a- very unsatisfactory correspondence with one State- Government which extended' over quite a long time. That- Government has since admitted that it was in error. . But it took, twelve months te* gain that admission, and what we most urgently require in connexion with the. work  of  the. proposed Institute is. finality. I have had nominations from a State Government that would not. have reflected credit, upon the Institute.

                    PRATTEN  (New South Wales) the doctrine that either the Commonwealth Government or this Parliament is sacrosanct. Let me tell honorable senators what is going on just now. In connexion with the establishment of the proposed Institute much prominence has been given to the need for the manufacture of cheap alcohol for power purposes. Yet in the other branch of the Legislature a Bill, has been circulated in which it is proposed to levy an Excise duty of ls. per gallon on methylated spirits, which are the base of a great many industries, and which are largely used in' our hospital?. Upon the one hand the Government are saying, " We want this Bill to cheapen the cost of alcohol for industrial purposes," whilst, on the other, they are proposing to levy an Excise duty upon cheap alcohol which was not previously dutiable. To my own- personal knowledge, they are handicapping the manufacture of anaesthetic chemicals which formerly came from Germany. It seems to me that w&amp; require co-operation in- respect of these matters. I appeal to the Vice-President of the Executive Council
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline>
                    to- recognise that if the State Governments are approached in connexion with matters upon which they haw expended large sums- of money during recent years-,, much valuable information' for the guidance of the new Department will be- f forthcoming

While the States do exist, the Minister ought to consult them.

                        <para>- I do not expect them to do anything of the kind, and I doubt very' much if it is wise to trouble to consult them about appointments by the Federal Government. The Government are at their wit's end to find positions for the great army of skilled scientists who are anxious to place their services at. the disposal of the community. The States are in the same position. Those gentlemen will do anything but engage in useful productive work. They are a very substantial army, and the Government have been so pressed in various directions that they are obliged to insist on the Senate passing this Bill to create and impose on the community an additional army of parasites. The Government, having determined on that course, will appoint the men who most persistently press their claims, but I cannot see what they will do to increase the productiveness of the community. I hope they will justify their existence, but I doubt it. I am tired of the actions of the Government, when I consider the vast army of committees and commissions of various kinds that they have appointed. I suppose they will continue as long as the war continues. </para>

                        <para>- It would make no difference to me which party was appointing them. The idea of fastening armies of non-producers upon the backs of the workers is exceedingly distasteful to me. I am not surprised at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie backing it up, because he must do so as Whip of his party. If he were on this side of the chamber, with a free hand, he would oppose the measure at every point of its passage. The Government having determined to appoint their own men, it would be a waste of effort for the Minister to consult the States, which will appoint an army of their own to do their scientific research work, and to' work independently of the Commonwealth just as the Commonwealth police are working independently of the State forces. I support the Government in their determination to do this business without reference to the States. </para>

He ought to move that we should submit our Bills to a State Premiers' Conference, and ask their permission to go on with our business, because that is really what his amendment means. This Parliament is quite competent to manage its own affairs without consulting the State Premiers. According to the honorable senator, after the State Premiers have considered the matter at a caucus meeting, we should be humbly permitted to proceed with our own ideas, but not before.

                        <para>.- On the 25th September I asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Navy certain questions in connexion with the purchase and sale of the launch <inline font-style="italic">Francisca.</inline> The answers to my questions were unsatisfactory to me, and I am informed by men in a position to know that some of them were untrue. I do not say that the Minister personally is aware of this; but the officers of the Department who furnished the answers were guilty of misleading, and an inquiry should be held, in the interests of the departmental officers concerned. The Minister informed me that the vessel was purchased from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> E. Morgan, of St. George's Terrace, Perth, for the sum of £1,500. I am told, however, that, for a considerable time before the Navy Department purchased it, it. was hawked all over Australia, and could have been bought for about £1,000. I believe it was brought from America on the deck of another vessel, and the owner thought he would get rid of it in Australia. To arrive at the actual figure this bad bargain has cost the Government, there must be added to the £1,500 the sum of £177 15s. 6d. expended in repairs and alterations, as follows: - Repairs, &amp;c., May to August, 1913, £110 7s. 2d.; refloating, July and August, 1913, £67 8s. 4d.; thus making a total expenditure on the vessel of £1,677 15s. 6d. Although the Minister stated, in reply to my question as to how long the <inline font-style="italic">Francisca</inline> was in commission, that it was purchased in September, 1912, and sold in November, 1914, I am informed by one who is in a position to know that the vessel did not do any work for the Department. I asked the Minister whether the engines and boilers were taken out and sold separately, and, if so, why. He replied - </para>

                    <quote>
                        <para>Hull, machinery, and fittings, and small water-tube boiler were sold separately; machinery and fittings were removed when the v esselwas damaged and sank. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">As regards the latter portion of the answer, I have been told, on reliable authority, that the vessel never sank. It made only three trips between Fremantle and Cockburn Sound, about 30 miles in all, and on each occasion a breakdown occurred, the tubes of the toilers being blown out. The officer in charge at that time was then, ordered to take the boiler out and send it to Melbourne to be re-tubed. After this was done, orders were  issued by the head office, Melbourne, that the vessel "was to be 'towed to . the Base and moored in a certain position, where she would be exposed to the north-west winds. This the officer in charge refused to do, and subsequently his services were dispensed with. A foreman carpenter was then placed in -charge, and instructions were "issued that a -mooring was to be placed at a certain spot north-west of the Quarantine Jetty. The place indicated had but 1'2 feet of water, with a grassy, bad-holding bottom, and was exposed to the full fury of the north-west winds. The officer in charge of moorings, to whom the instructions were issued, suggested that the launch be moored to the southward of the spit, so 'that -she would have some protection. The carpenter, however, had written instructions regarding the -matter, and there was nothing left for the officer in charge of moorings but to carry them out. This he did, but with some alterations. Instead of placing the moorings in 12 feet of water, he placed them in IS feet, .laying down a 4-cwt. anchor and 60 fathoms of chain, and also an additional anchor weighing l£ cwt., with 40 fathoms of chain, both being laid to the "north-west. It was at these moorings that the <inline font-style="italic">Francisca,</inline> in the first stiff blow, dragged her moorings, owing to the grassy nature of the bottom, as had been pointed out must happen. And it did happen. I' want to know -why this was done. </para>
                    <para>Another question I asked was whether the vessel was unsuitable .for the work, and who was responsible, for  the  'purchase. The Minister's reply was - !The <inline font-style="italic">Francisca,</inline> while , lying .alongside "the jetty in Cockburn Sound, "was 'badly damaged on 13th- July, 1913, by a heavy northerly gale, and sank. On examination it .was found 'that the vessel was damaged beyond repair and she was stripped. The Naval Board finally approved df hull, -machinery, and fittings "being sold. The Minister approved of the  purchase  on the recommendation of the Naval' Boa-rd. </para>
                    <para class="block">According .to the information I have, that answer, given by the officers of the Navy Department, is untrue. I.-am given to "understand,  first  of all, that the vessel was not lying alongside the jetty in Cockburn Sound, but "was at her "moorings, and when it began to blow she dragged her -moorings and collided with the jetty, breaking her port quarter; "but she -was not damaged beyond repair. After she hit the jetty she was patched up with  canvas  and -towed into Fremantle through a Stiff gale. As a matter of fact, the hull of the vessel, which I was informed in answer to my question was absolutely useless, has been fitted again with .engines, and. is now the hull of one of the best boats on the Swan RiveT. The Minister, in  reply  to my questions, did not answer my inquiry as to whether this vessel was unsuitable for the work for which she was purchased. "The <inline font-style="italic">Francisco,</inline> was a gentleman's steam yacht. She was fitted with triple expansion engines, Thornycroft bailer (containing 142 tubes of Swedish iron)., dynamo for electric light, dining room, sleeping compartment, pantry, and barroom, and every modern convenience. I think that honorable members will readily agree that a vessel of this description was totally unfit for the work for which it was required at the Henderson Naval Base. The officer in charge at the time of the purchase, and "who has -since been dismissed, is said -to be a very clever engineer and to .possess engineering knowledge superior to the  Director  of Naval Works at the time. He objected to being saddled with this launch. He said that it was only =a toy, unfitted for the work for which it was to be used, and that he wanted something with which he could do some work. .The objection ret :this practical man was  overmled,  .and the toy was purchased. </para>
                    <para>I now  come  to consider what was derived from the sa'le of the vessel As the Minister stated in his replies to me, the hull realized £75, and the beautiful fittings of this gentleman's yacht realized the magnificent sum  of £10. Tenders were invited for the boiler, but none was received. That was no wonder, because it was not worth anything. Instructions were issued that the boiler should be disposed .of at an auction sale, and it would be very interesting to know what it brought- "This means, according to the information .given me 'and the figures supplied by the  Department,  that, leaving out the .amount received for the boiler, the receipts -amounted to £85, whilst the vessel  cost £1,677 15a.6d..  This represents  a  total loss  to the  Commonwealth  -of  £1,592 15s. 6d -without taking dato . consideration the overhead* charges aad  . expenses  during  the two  years in which  Ithe <inline font-style="italic">Francisco</inline> wa-s the properly  : of  'lie department. </para>
                    <para>I- have <inline font-style="italic">. &lt;m mows</inline> than  one  -occasion  : xecerved  misleading answers to -questions which I have asked  from  my place in this ahamber.. I received misleading answers to my questions . concerning this vessel, . and if  there  wer.e  . an  inquiry into the matter it wuld be proved -that the answers given ibo my questions were antnte. I do not blame &amp;e Minister,  "but -the  officers  Ksf  (his Department,  for  this. After the vessel  was  purchased, site did  no  work at  all  for two yoars, 'and she was then sold to a private person for. the amount I have stated, and by that person the hull was  repaired,  and the vessel is mow running in  the  'Swaii Ewer. I  am  enticed  to  receive itirothful (replies  to  any questions I put  from <inline font-style="italic">my</inline> plaoe im this dbamber. I have  had ito  wm plain  on  previs'tts occasions that T I have received ndsfeadawg 'and  untrue  replies te questions I 'have asJtied. I repeat that ray 'questions concerning  the  fWcncwea were replied to in -a way which was misleading  ito mie  . and to -the people ovf this country. I was in Perth recently in . connexion  with  -an  inquiry by a . certain Ooiwmittee, and while I was -there  Tumours icoTOSBmimg tihe <inline font-style="italic">Franciaca</inline> reached  me.  I tried to seen  re  . ev3dan;ce *&gt;n the tftrbject,  tout  the witnesses bluffed the  questions put  'to  -them,, and I was unable to obtain satisfactory replies. I Irnve since been' enabled te -obtain information  on  the subject  from  a man  on  the job. at 1/he time,  who  is . prepared at any time  to  substantiate what  he  says. If what  he <inline font-style="italic">has</inline> 'stated to  me  is true,  tihe <inline font-style="italic">Francisca</inline> was -moored, "where she was  Jot  a certain purpose, and that purpose was that  -She  should drag her -moorings the first time a north-west wind came -up. That is a serr&amp;us allegation, tout that is what my information amounts  to.  If I had received ' proper answers  to  the questions I put, I . could have allowed 'the (matter . to rest there, but, as I did  »ot  : receive truthful replies, I have taken advantage  of  this opportunity  to  ventilate  'the  TOattw, <inline font-style="italic">tmi</inline> I hope that. in future misleading replies will not' be given to questions put in the Senate. </para>

                            <para>- That is certainly a serious statement, and one which 1 shall bring under the notice of the Acting Minister for the Navy, who, I have no doubt, forwarded to me in all good faith the answers to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall's</inline> questions, which were supplied to him hy the office is of iris Department. One important feature of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator M-cDougalFs</inline> statement is that he alleges . that this launch was deliberately exposed in such a place -as practically  . to  -.assure her sinking and destruction. That is a very serious charge to make, and I venture to say that if any officer of  the  Navy Department has been  guilty of an act of thai  kind,  it is  the  honorable senator's duty to - and I am  sure  fee will see it -himself in that light - give the ActingMinister '-for the Navy  the  name pf <inline font-weight="bold">Ms informant,,</inline> In order that the allegation may he sifted to the bottom.

I can promise  . that  the -remark made 3rySenator McDougall will be brought under the notice -of  the  Acting Minister for . the Navy, and I invure him to supply myself or the Acting Minister for the Navy with the name of <inline font-weight="bold">Ms informant</inline> who makes this serious allegation against an officer of the Navy Department - of exposing this vessel  to  certain destruction. . I shall bring <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall's</inline> remarks  'wider  the notice of the Acting Minister  for the Navy,* in  order . that he may . satisfy himself as to whether his- officers -have or have not given 'fcruthfnl replies  to  the questions put by  the  ItonoraMe senator in this chamber. </para>
