                            <para>- The terms of the armistice provide that British and other Allied prisoners of war interned in Germany are to be at once released, but the arrangement is not reciprocal,, and the destination and treatment of German prisoners of war interned in Allied countries are questions to be remitted to the Peace Conference. The Commonwealth Government will naturally await a communication from the British Government on that matter before taking any action. </para>

                        <para class="block">I do not think any apology is required from me for having submitted this motion. The time is opportune for the discussion of this subject, seeing that, the armistice has been signed, and that the Empire, including the self-governing Dominions, and our Allies, having come to the conclusion of this terrible conflict, are now preparing for the Peace table. I have noticed in the press during the last few days that some anxiety has been felt as to whether or not Australia would be  represented, and it is imperative, I think, that we should give consideration to this question now. We have been informed that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> is somewhat anxious about the matter himself, and is not altogether pleased that Australia was not represented at the Versailles Conference. But it is of greater importance that the Commonwealth should have a place at the Peace table. I do not think there will be any disagreement in the Senate. on this subject, because the peace to be determined will, we hope, endure for all time, and prevent a recurrence of the awful carnage we have gone through in this war. It is only right also, in my opinion, that both sides of political thought in Australia should be represented at that Conference. Every honorable senator will admit that both sides of political thought in Australia' have been- represented in every theatre of war - on Gallipoli, in France, in Palestine, and in other places. That being so, both sides of political thought should be represented at the Peace Conference. "We have contributed freely of our blood and treasure in order to help the Motherland and the Empire to secure victory. As the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> remarked yesterday, in one of the finest utterances I have heard him make in this Senate - and he has made many - when the call came from overseas Australia immediately responded to it. I have said that both sides of political thought were represented in that response. So they were. But I venture to say that the majority of our Australian Army consisted of Australian workers. When we know that the conditions of peace will have a very important bearing upon the future of the workers of this country, it will be recognised that <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> is essential that they should be represented at the Peace Conference. </para>

But it is impossible to ignore the fact that not only restitution and reparation, but also certain territorial, adjustments are required.

I have quoted those which I have already put upon record for the purpose of showing that the Australian Labour party has always been anxious to see the war fought to a victorious conclusion, and that with that object in view, members of its organizations have given of their blood freely. I say now that the whole social and economic system of the world will have to be revised. The old system has broken down and has been cast aside, and just as the workers of this young nation played their part in the destruction of the old system, it follows that they should have a voice in the construction of the new.

It is because of this that I hold that not only should Australia be represented through its Government, whatever member of the Government may be deputed for the purpose, but the opposite side in politics, who, after all, have a responsibility in the government of the nation, even though they may disagree with the policy of the Government of the day - that is, the Opposition in the shape of the Australian Labour party - should be represented at the Peace Conference also. </para>

                        <para>It may be objected that we did not favour the conscription of manhood. It is true that we did not. I opposed it myself, and would oppose it again tomorrow. But whilst it is true that the Australian Labour party determinedly and strenuously opposed the conscription of Australian manhood for this great war. they were backed up by the majority of this nation on two occasions within fourteen months. Should not that other portion of this nation, those who are supporters, not of this party, but of the Government sitting opposite, be represented at that Conference? I think they should. No one in his sane senses can claim that all those people who formed the great majority against conscription on the 20th- December, 1917, would have voted in favour of candidates of the party sitting on this side of the Senate. </para>

I venture to say that when the Peace Conference assembles there will be at the table representatives from other countries who, in their respective Parliaments, are opposed to the Governments, of the day. I have moved in this matter to-day in order to ask the Senate to give consideration to the justice of the claim I am making. I have put the matter forward without heat, and I hope I have refrained  from introducing party politics. I have put the matter in its true national sense. </para>

                            <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham's</inline> statement is capable of division into two unequal portions. A very small portion was devoted to showing the desirability of  Australia being represented at the Peace Conference, and a very large portion to showing the necessity which appears to exist in the honorable senator's mind for the representation of the party to which he belongs. The honorable senator claimed that as both sides of political thought were represented on the battle front they should therefore be represented at the Peace table. I would remind him that those workers, to use his term, who took their places on the battle-fields of Europe, did so, not as workers, but as Australians. No evidence is yet forthcoming that, although they may be associated with the honorable senator by means of their Labour organizations, those men have in the slightest degree indorsed the leadership given by the Official party to which the honorable senator belongs. When the honorable senator speaks of that section of political thought, he refers, of course, to the Official Labour party. Has not that Official .Labour party forfeited all right to speak for the workers of this country in this matter? </para>

An Official Labour party which takes up that attitude has no right to speak for the great body of loyal workers of Australia. </para>

                        <para>I now turn to the much more important matter, which was only rather casually alluded to, as a matter of fact, by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham.</inline> That is, in reference to the desirability of Australia being represented at the Peace Conference. It , is surely unnecessary for rae to state that the Government have this matter in hand; that the subject, indeed, has their closest consideration; that they are not indifferent to all that is involved in it; that there is no justification for supposing that upon a matter of such gravity the Government are either indifferent or negligent. I think that the Senate - even allowing for the political differences of opinion within its walls - would never seriously assume that' the Government have not given that deep thought to the matter which it demands. But I hope that the Senate will understand the full significance of the statement that the Government have the subject in their very closest keeping and consideration. However, with a knowledge of much which it would not (be justifiable at this juncture to make public - with a knowledge, indeed, of all that is involved - the Government feel that, in the interests  of Australia, in common with the interests of the Empire, they cannot allow their hands to be forced by the springing upon them of a motion of this character, in regard to a matter of so grave and delicate a nature'. On behalf of the Government, 1 have already given notice of our intentions, dealing with one very important phase of all these matters, one which it may be assumed will occupy the attention of the plenipotentiaries at the Peace Conference. The Senate may accept my assurance that the Government are equally alert regarding those other matters in which Australia is interested, and which will similarly be the subject of discussion at the Peace Conference. But the" Government are not prepared at this stage to embarrass the situation by any statement with respect to the representation of this Dominion, or of the Dominions generally. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> as the Senate knows, is in London. The Government are in constant and regular communication with that gentleman. The Prime Minister knows what is taking place ; and the Cabinet here is freely communicating with the Prime Minister, as the Prime Minister is with his colleagues in Australia. And - knowing that all steps are being taken which may be regarded as being in the best interests of this country  - the Government will reserve to a more fitting time a full pronouncement of what is- taking place and of what is in contemplation. The Government are not unmindful of their duty;- and I am convinced that not even party prejudice will suggest remissness on the part of the Government in regard to these matters. But the Government, conscious of the critical character of this present moment, and of the times ahead of us, feel that they can make no more definite pronouncement at this juncture than has already been made, coupled with the full and frank assurance that . they are alive to the importance of this whole matter, and will take every step that may be deemed necessary and desirable in the best interests of Australia. </para>

                                <para>- That was Labour's decided attitude with respect to the  Avar,  as defined at the conference. The conference also passed peace proposals, which I intend to read to the Senate. And then, if my time permits, I shall deal, next in order, with the attitude of Labour towards recruiting. I wish to be . perfectly candid, seeing that the subject can be so dealt with, and in a way, indeed, that no man need be ashamed of. I propose to refer to the attitude of Labour upon recruiting, as it was presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall, Senator Grant,</inline> and myself, and other members of our party who took exception to the action of the Perth Conference. But I particularly point out that the attitude of Labour towards recruiting was not determined at the conference, but that it was there decided . to put the whole posi-' tion before members outside, to see what their attitude would be on the subject. We have the fact to fall back upon, that in two of the States the Labour movement refused to deal with the question, and that many of the big unions and nearly all the leagues absolutely repudiated the conference attitude by refusing to participate in the ballot. I am stating our case without party bias or feeling. I have read Labour's war attitude ; I propose now to read a statement showing Labour's peace attitude as taken up at the conference - a statement that compares most favorably with the peace utterances of  President  Wilson. It cannot be denied that the peace utterances of the  President of the United States greatly accelerated the peace that we have at last secured. </para>

                                <para>- The strength of arms certainly accelerated peace, but it must not be forgotten that German arms, solidly backed up by the German people, would have continued the fight much longer if the people had been allowed to remain under the impression that the object of the Allies was to absolutely crush their country. The first intimation that the German people received which was sufficiently strong to justify those opposed to war in withdrawing' their support from the German army was the wise, statesman-like utterance of  President  "Wilson that the Allies wished to crush the makers of war rather than the people of Germany. </para>

Now that the war is over, it would be wise for the governing party in Great Britain not only to take care that no offence is given to Australia, but to guard against even a suspicion arising in the minds of the people that a deliberate snub has been offered the Commonwealth-. The Prime Minister's statements, as published in the press during the last few days, are such as to cause his most ardent supporters - and I am not amongst them - the deepest and most grave concern, since he declares that he was absolutely ignored when the peace terms were being considered. I object, not to the ignoring of  the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> but to the ignoring of Australia.  While <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> remains in England as Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, the Government of Great Britain should have regard for his official capacity.

There are at stake Great Australian interests - the Leader of 'the Government in the Senate has this evening referred to one of them - which will have to be considered at the approaching Peace Conference. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> hit the nail on the head when he interjected, " This is a national, not a party matter."

                            <para>. - Every one who has watched the position in which honorable senators opposite have found themselves for some time past can quite appreciate the purpose of this motion. Happily, the conclusion of the war has put the country right, whether the Official Labour party are right or not. We . are in a position to-day to say that we may secure a peace quite different from that outlined and apparently desired by those responsible for the resolutions of 'the Perth Conference. There is no need for us to bother about our representation in London, because there is a very good representative of Australia's war policy there at the present time. On the subject of the war, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> can represent the public opinion of Australia very well on his own. We may well shake hands with ourselves because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> is in London at the present time. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> has suggested that there should be representation of both sides of political thought in Australia, but I remind him that there was only one side to political thought in Australia on .the subject of the war when the war broke out, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> can very well represent Australian  opinion on the subject. "We know that, so far as the party opposite is concerned, a very great change has come over the scene since the beginning of the war, and it is really in order that they may escape from an awkward position that this motion, which is only the forerunner of many similar motions likely to b.e submitted in the near future, has been moved to-day. If the party opposite had shown during the last year -or two any earnest desire to strengthen the hands of the gentleman who has the best right to speak for Australia in London to-day, we might have believed that the motion had some honest purpose behind it. But what has been the position ? From time to time honorable senators opposite have been hurling every "kind of insult at the Prime Minister, and have persistently worked to belittle his mission to London. Interjections by members of the party during speeches made in another place have shown their utter hostility to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes.</inline> If the Prime Minister had been standing up for Free Trade in the Old Country, we could have understood the hostility of honorable senators opposite to his utterances. He has, on the contrary, been endeavouring to give expression to the Protectionist views held in Australia, in order to prevent a recurrence of. German influence in trade affairs. In the circumstances, the Protectionists on the other side might very well have adopted a non-partisan attitude towards him. But no; everything they could possibly say to weaken his influence has been said, and, in the circumstances, I hold that we have no right to consider the views of men who have taken up that attitude towards the Prime Minister. What else is there to be represented in London or wherever the Peace Conference is to be held? Do honorable senators opposite think that there is to be a discussion at the Conference on the merits or demerits of conscription versus the voluntary system - the great question which divides them' 'as a political party from honorable senators on this side? It would be making only a laughing-stock of Australia for us to go to the Peace Conference and parade there our ideas on the voluntary system of enlistment, or parade before the" world the war policy of the Official Labour party? </para>

The country is anxiously watching to learn the result of that ballot, which will reveal the attitude of the Official Labour party on  the question of the war. In my opinion, this motion is merely a red herring drawn across the track to distract attention from that ballot, because of the position in which honorable senators find themselves. </para>

If it is suggested that there is another view, which has been hinted at without being explained, and that a representative of that view should go to the Peace Conference to discuss the anti-recruiting resolutions of the Perth Conference, let me say that it is altogether too late now to refer to that matter, as the war is over, and we do not need to trouble any more about recruiting. We have no need to appoint any other representative to the Peace Conference than the Australian representative who is now in London. </para>

But, recognising that any argumentative note struck yesterday would  De  discordant in the midst of the chorus of jubilation which was ascending to the skies from the whole of Australia, I refrained from submitting a similar motion.

                        </talk.start>
                        <para>In regard to representation at the Peace Conference, it has to be understood that, although Australia has performed a most creditable belligerent part in the war, she is not an independent nation, but a Dominion of the British Empire. The representation of Australia at the Peace Conference can only be secured through the courtesy of the nations that have been in alliance with the British Empire in the conflict, or who have acted as co-belligerents. We are within the Empire, and the Empire's representatives appointed by the Imperial Government are perhaps the only ones to which the allied nations will consent to a status being accorded. But we can secure - indeed, we have secured and are in the possession of- - indirect representation at that Peace Conference. What I wish to urge on the consideration of the Administration was foreshadowed in the question that I put without notice to-day. It is urgently necessary that the people of the Commonwealth should, through their Parliament, make such representations as will establish beyond all doubt the right of the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth to make articulate Australia's aspirations in regard to peace conditions. </para>
                        <para>The Prime Minister has made certain complaints; and at this distance it is hard to say whether or not they are well founded. I think it is well understood that I am not one of the fulsome admirers of the Right Honorable W. M. Hughes; but I recognise that .he has in him, at least, some of the qualities of a great man; he has force and a certain individuality of character, which are most valuable in a man who has attained the position of a statesman. I may say that, on the evidence - even on ,the Prime Minister's own statements - I am personally prepared to accord him full-souled support. The Imperial Government, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has said, will make a great mistake if it does not call into close consultation representatives of all the overseas Dominions which have substantially contributed to what has happily proved the Empire's successful efforts in the war. I suppose that the terms of the armistice were very largely governed by the  opinions of the military leaders of all the successful belligerent armies ; but we have an undoubted right to be consulted by our Imperial Mother in regard to peace conditions. I am well aware that peace must be largely conditioned by the fact that it has to be based on President Wilson's fourteen points, or at least on thirteen of them, one having been very sensibly excluded for consideration at the instance, I suppose, of the representatives of the British Empire. It would have been suicide for us to have consented to a discussion of the maritime supremacy of our Empire - that supremacy which has created the Empire and keeps it in being. Happily, as I say, that matter has been excluded from consideration in the fixing of . peace conditions; but it is well for British statesmen to remember that the Empire is what I may call an exceptional empire: it is <inline font-style="italic">sui generis; -there</inline> never has been, and probably there never will be, another empire like it. The conditions which bind tha Dominions to the Empire are, in themselves, most remarkable. Because of the mistake in connexion with America more than a century ago, we have been practically enabled to obtain the legislative status of independent peoples, though outside nations only recognise us diplomatically as being within the ambit' and circle of the British Empire. </para>
                        <para>The Prime Minister . at the present time is in such a position in London that an important newspaper has most insolently - and I. use the term after great consideration - stated that he does not represent the people of Australia. But on "the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> himself, the Prime Minister does represent the people of Australia. If the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth does not represent the people of Australia, who does? </para>

                        <para class="block">For weeks past I have listened intently to expression's of opinion from responsible men in public places; and since the Prime Minister made his complaint, I have heard dozens and dozens of such men, who are perhaps not very ardent admirers, as they have not been long followers, of the right honorable gentleman, say, "I am with Hughes in this thing." The Imperial Government had ' better remember that, with the full strength of the Empire exerted, it would probably be impossible to destroy it by means of a war, but that it might very easily and almost unconsciously be disintegrated by an unsatisfactory peace in which any of the great overseas Dominions regarded themselves as having been cavalierly treated. The Imperial Government should remember, and I take opportunity to ask the Australian Government to most seriously consider at the earliest possible moment, the position of the Prime Minister and his utterances. It is high time, in my opinion, that it was intimated to the people of Great Britain, and of the world, that the Prime Minister in his present position is supported by the people of the Commonwealth. </para>
                        <para>There is one other matter with which I desire to deal before I sit down. We must not forget that the terms of the armistice, imposed by military men, and apparently very severe, aro only preliminary to the peace which is to be conditioned by thirteen of  President  Wilson's fourteen points. Does the question of reparation exclude Australia from making a claim for a financial indemnity - hot a penal indemnity, but a recouping of the expense that we have incurred in connexion with the war? I am doubtful about the matter, but I hope that  President  Wilson's thirteen points do not exclude Australia from consideration. America and the Old Country may repair very quickly the losses they have sustained, because they are fully equipped with most valuable machinery, which can be readily adapted to modern industrial needs. That is not our position. We do not manufacture our machinery here, and we have withdrawn large sums from those financial resources that are necessary to develop this young country of ours; and it is only fair that a claim should be made on" our behalf for financial reparation. I do not say that we should make one penny profit out of the war, out the loser must pay the winner for having successfully defended his national life and his rights. That is not an unjust demand; and I hope it is one which will be added to the catalogue of requests which, I am sure, will, before long, be made and supported by the Government. </para>
                        <para>We should also be recouped the cost of repatriating our men. Are our children, and our children's children, to be saddled with this debt simply because we stood up to the German people who menaced our national life? It may be said that the German people are now ashamed of what they have done. Not they ! Had they got to Paris, every German, as I interjected, would have been a supporter of the Kaiser, licked his boots, and exalted him to the highest. Let Deutschdom be anarchistic or socialistic; let Germany be a republic or an empire; let the German people retain or restore the Hohenzollerns, or do what they like - they should be made to pay. On behalf of Australia, the Prime Minister should be empowered by this Government to make such a demand, to see that Australia's economic independence is respected in every particular, and to - deal satisfactorily with the matter in respect of which the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> lias given notice of motion. The Peace Conference cannot be expected to allow the representation of political parties. It could hardly be expected to allow representation of a Dominion within the Empire. Are the Philippine Islands to be represented in connexion with the American delegation to the Peace Conference? And is Honolulu to be so represented ? I do hot ask that, but I do ask that the Imperial authorities be told, and in no measured terms, that the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth does represent the Australian people, and that it is .most urgent for them to take him into their councils, and consider his undoubtedly just requests. </para>

Therefore, I think this would be a convenient time to suspend the sitting, as, no doubt, honorable senators would like to be present and listen to what might be said. I shall be glad if as many honorable senators as can find it convenient will accompany me to present the address to  His Excellency.  I shall resume the chair at 8 o'clock. </para>

                            <para>.- The question raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> is a very important one, and one upon which the Senate may well spend the whole of the period allowed by our Standing Orders for its discussion. The Government ask somewhat indignantly why Labour has any desire to be represented at the Peace Conference. Apparently they "are content to assume that at that Conference their own representatives will be able to speak for Australia in such a manner as to obviate the possibility of complaints from this side of the world regarding the decisions at which it will arrive. Possibly they are right. But I think they are wrong. They have already sent <inline font-style="italic">&lt;to</inline> the Old Country two 'representatives, in the persons of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook, confident that these gentlemen would be able to speak for Australia upon any question which might arise in regard to bringing the war to a successful termination. But we have recently learned from the' newspapers - and I do not believe that anybody will question the accuracy of the statements -which they have published - the opinions which are held of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> by responsible persons in Great Britain. When he left our shores we were led to believe that he was to be invited to attend all the Conferences to be held in the Old Country at which the *  terms of peace would be discussed. But we have now learned, through the medium of the press, that, though he was in England all the time the proceedings in relation to the armistice were in progress, his presence there was quite ignored. He was not invited to attend the Conference which determined the conditions of the armistice, and at which the Government thought he would have been at liberty to express their views. In other words, he has been treated in England just as any ordinary citizen has been treated. He is thought no more of there than the commonest citizen. </para>

                        <para>The terms of peace will probably be arranged by a Conference of representatives of the Allied countries, and Australia will have no opportunity of enlightening them as to the real views of this Commonwealth upon many important questions. It has been asked, "Will the Conference discuss conscription?" I do not suppose that that question will come before it. But it will certainly consider many other questions in which Australia is vitally interested, and upon which she has a right to be heard. I venture to say that the Peace Conference will be composed almost entirely of persons who represent the elements that governed Europe prior to the outbreak of the war. We may be quite certain that they will not voice the opinions of the Democracies of the world. As a matter of fact,, the British Ministry was elected before the outbreak of hostilities, on a particularly restricted' franchise, and, consequently, its members cannot claim that they represent the views, which are entertained by the people of the Old Country. </para>

                                    George may be all right. I have no desire to de tract from his meritorious services, but I say that to' insure proper representation at the Peace Conference, 'even of the heart of our own Empire, delegates to it should be elected from the Imperial Parliament after a general election had been held in Britain. That would afford all the men who will have returned from the Front, the men who have saved the Empire, an opportunity to record their votes - an opportunity which they were denied prior to the outbreak of war. The women ~ of England, too, who have done so much in the Empire's cause, will, 'under existing conditions, not be represented at the Peace Conference,, because they have never yet been allowed to exercise the franchise.

                                <para>- After all, whatever politics we may have in this country reflect the voice of the people, and that is the only thing which, "in my judgment, is entitled to count. It is always pretty safe to trust the majority. But unless Australia is represented at the Peace Conference, not merely by delegates who will express the views of honorable senators opposite, but also by representatives from this side of the chamber, the real opinions of this country will not be voiced. I venture to say that, during the last two or three years, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> has said so many foolish things upon important questions which will be discussed at the Peace </para>

In this connexion, it should be recollected that we represent at least one-half of the people of Australia, and, consequently, our opinions are entitled to be heard at the Conference equally with those of honorable senators opposite. It is not a fair thing that supporters of the Ministry who won the last election on a sort of catch vote on a question, which, I hope, will never crop up again in this country, should be permitted to send <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> to that gathering for the purpose of instructing delegates from other parts of the world upon some of the subjects that be has talked loosely about. Need I remind honorable senators that he has advocated the boycott of German commerce rafter the war - a most stupid thing for him to do. He was going to bottle  up eighty or ninety millions of people, and to exclude them from participating in the world's commerce.  His  statement has been repudiated absolutely by men of much greater eminence in the persons of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George and  President  Wilson, who recognise the impossibility of giving effect to it. </para>

                        <para>Other matters will come before the Conference in regard to which this party's opinions might have a big influence. I think that there cannot be a permanent peace unless every country represented at the Conference is prepared to pledge itself to give its people a proper opportunity to express their views. When England entered the war, half her people were without the franchise, Australia being the only country that went into the war in possession of a proper franchise,, under which every man and woman of twenty-one years of age and upwards can give effect to his or her views through the ballot box. There can be no permanent and satisfactory settlement of national affairs unless every country that becomes a party to a League of Nations pledges itself to give a franchise to its people, and to educate them up to a certain standard. To do that would be to lay the foundation of a world peace securely and well; because I cannot think that any civilized people would willingly plunge itself, or any other nation, into war. </para>

It has been complained that the German Socialists did not sufficiently make their views felt within Germany. They did not do that because the war lords of Germany did exactly ' the same things as the war lords of this country have done.  Liebknecht,  one of the leading intellectuals of the country, when he dared to voice his opinions concerning the war, and to say how peace might be brought about, was first sent to the Front, and then committed to gaol, and he has only recently been released. Every man in the country who dared to say that the war was criminal, and ought not to continue a day longer than was unavoidable, was similarly treated. The  people  had " not an opportunity to make their voice heard, because of the military despotism, which gaoled them for doing so, as people were gaoled in this country. </para>

                            <para>.- With the purpose of the motion I am in accord, though <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> has submitted it prematurely, because what he asks shall be done will be done, or insisted upon, in any. case by both Chambers of the Legislature. It is superfluous. </para>

                        <para>To begin with, I wish to set <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> right iri some matters. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is in error in supposing that the* German people or the German Government were largely influenced in accepting the armistice by the opinions of the Allied countries concerning Democracy in Germany.  President  Wilson stated his famous fourteen points in January of this year. But what was the attitude of Germany towards the Allies in the following March and April? Never was there such a superhuman effort as that made by Germany during that fateful period to crush the Allied armies. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> would have us believe that the German people were merely waiting to find out what was in the minds of the Allied peoples before offering peace; but as a matter of fact, Germany made every effort to bring to the dust the might of the Allies , long after she had heard the declaration of  President  Wilson. </para>

                            has suggested that  President  Wilson was influenced in what he said by the opinions of the Official Labour party of Australia. That statement may be accepted if we credit  President  Wilson with a magical power of divining the thoughts and intentions of the Official Labour party of Australia months before they were uttered.  President  Wilson made his speech months before even the present shadowy policy of the Official Labour party of Australia was published.

The piecing together of a Chinese puzzle would be child's play compared with .the effort to arrive at an authoritative statement of the party's war policy. The last opportunity that the Official Labour party had of making its policy known occurred at the Conference in Perth last June, nearly six months after President Wilson's famous speech. </para>

                                <para>- The position of every intelligent elector is that he does not know what is in the mind of the Official Labour party, because they themselves do not know. Delegates assembled at the Perth Conference and formulated a set of resolutions. Neither honorable senators opposite nor the Perth Conference gave a lead to their party. But they lead that party from the rear. In regard to recruiting, the Perish Conference decided to adopt and shape Labour's attitude to recruiting according to whether or not certain things were done. What were the conditions that were stipulated? The first was that immediate peace by negotiation should be sought, based on a policy of no indemnities .and no annexations. </para>

                        <para>Peace by negotiation was one of the conditions to be fulfilled before the Official Labour party would further participate in recruiting. The thirty-six gentlemen who sat in the Perth Conference earnestly " recommended " their followers throughout Australia to vote for the immediate suing for peace by negotiation without annexations and without penal indemnities. Almost like the perfume of attar of roses came the news that eastern States members of this Parliament headed. I am glad to say, by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> in equally solemn and earnest fashion, asked Labour followers throughout Australia to vote " No " on the Conference recruiting resolution. Then, in the central State of Australia, Labour representatives, under the leadership of our old friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frank</inline> Lundie, with equal earnestness, urged their supporters to vote neither "Yes" nor "No," but to leave things as they were - to say nothing at all. This, then, is the attitude of the Official Labour party to the Conference resolutions - " Yes " on the western side of the continent, "No" on the eastern side, and nothing at all in the centre. That party has not made up its own mind on the most vital question connected with the war, namely, the peace terms that so vitally affect the people of Australia. </para>
                        <para>In regard to- the condition of no annexation and no penal indemnities, I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> whether he desires that the German flag shall be hoisted once again in New Guinea and Samoa and the other islands which are at Australia's front door? I would ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> O'Loghlin  to say whether he would have the British flag hauled down and the German standard hoisted instead. </para>

Peace by negotiation based on no annexa-' tions and no penal indemnities ! How can we concede those conditions unless we allow the German flag to float at Australia's front door, and the Australian flag to be hauled down ? Is that what honorable senators opposite desire? If not, what do they want? They ask to be allowed to send delegates to the Peace Conference to obey the behests of their masters at the Perth Conference, which means that the German flag shall. again float over every island which Germany dominated before the peace of the world was disturbed. They will not admit that that is the logical meaning of the conference resolution, and therein lies the blatant hypocrisy of their attitude. I defy any man in this country to stand up and boldly proclaim that they desire the German flag to again float right at Australia's door. </para>

                        <para>As to the plea for no indemnities which comes from men safe in their seats in this Senate, I remind the Senate that after the failure of the mighty German offensive against the Allied line on the Western Front, the only two parties in the world who wanted peace by negotiation were the Official Labour party in Australia and the Kaiser and his military autocracy in Germany. I am led to contrast the attitude of these so-called leaders of the Labour party in Australia with the attitude of Labour in the United States of America and Canada, and will these " Johnny-come-latelies, these so-called Labour leaders in Australia, deny that the men in the forefront of the movement in America and Canada are just as intensely and vitally concerned about the true interests of Labour as they themselves are? The pronouncements of the American leaders ring with the true note of Labour, not the false note that has rung of late and rung for over long  in  this country. According to the daily press of the 10th October last - </para>

Such a peace it would be if entered into with the military caste of Germany, with the praise of militarism still upon their lips.

What  we lack in  Australia is plain speaking and straightforward action -  the  President  deems it his duty to say, without any attempt to soften what may seem harsh words, that the nations of the world do not, and cannot, trust the word of those who have hitherto been the masters of German policy, and to point out once more that in concluding peace, and attempting to undo the infinite injuries and injustices of this war, the Government of the United States cannot deal with any but veritable representatives of the German people who have been assured of a genuine constitutional standing as the real rulers of Germany. </para>

It might, therefore, be just as well to state a fact or two. The honorable senator had a good deal to say about the attitude of Labour on the question of "no indemnities and no annexations," and carefully omitted the word " penal " before " annexations," until an interjection by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> compelled him to include it. He tried to make the Senate and the country - through so much of the reports of the Senate's proceedings as get into the columns of the newspapers - believe something that actually did not take place. He tried to put into the mouth of the Official Labour party, as he calls it, or the Australian Labour party, as it really is, words that it did not use. </para>

Great Britain should not be delayed or embarrassed in the negotiations by the statement that Australia insisted on the retention of the captured Pacific Possessions. Do honorable senators opposite mean to say that if things had not turned out as they have, with such splendid victories as we have had of late, and that question had been the only bar to a just and honorable peace, a howl would not have gone .up from Australia in absolute indorsement of that policy ? </para>

On the second occasion, on the most vital issue that the people were ever asked to decide, he said to them,- " Without this power the Government cannot continue to govern this country, and will not attempt to do so." Within twenty-four hours of finding that he was defeated he resigned, but he walked out of one door and came in the next. He resigned, and had himself reinstated. It is only because of the most flagrant violation of the public word of a public man ever made by any prominent statesman in the world's history that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> is Prime Minister to-day, and that his present colleagues are sitting on the Ministerial bench with him. That is well known to the people, and is well known to .the gentlemen sitting behind him in both branches of the Parliament, and they do not like it. Not one of his own supporters was found " so poor to do him reverence." Not one of them dared to attempt any reasonable justification for the attitude which he and his Government adopted, and which made him Prime Minister again, enabling him to go to London as the so-called mouthpiece of the </para>

It cannot be too often repeated that he was twice decisively defeated on the greatest question ever put to the Australian people, the second time by a far bigger majority than the first. On the second campaign he told the people, " Defeat me on this question, and I resign," and their votes showed that they wanted him to resign. He tried to make it appear that he was keeping his word, by crawling out of one door as Prime Minister and crawling in at another, and then got himself sent to London as the mouthpiece of the Australian people. </para>

However, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> cannot claim to represent the Democracy of Australia, seeing that, when he took a vote of the people in December last on the biggest question that could be put to them, the majority voted against him.

                                <para>- The National party has done its best to win the war, and as a consequence of that best has added to the sum total of the might of the Allies in bringing about the present satisfactory position. In recalling the various public pronouncements made from time to time in connexion with what the Allies had been fighting for, one commences with a statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Asquith</inline> very early in the conflict concerning Great Britain's main object in entering into the great struggle. Speaking from memory, I think his pronouncement was that Great Britain had been loath to unsheath the sword, but that she would not sheath it again until German militarism had been destroyed for ever, that there could be no compromise by meeting Germany on terms of equality at the conference table, that there could be no peace by negotiation, and that the world had to choose between the doctrines of " might is right " or " right is might." Following this pronouncement, we had a statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George on his accession to office, and which was made practically on behalf of Great Britain and France, that the rights of the small nations had to be protected, that Turkey in Europe had to disappear, and that various other international adjustments had to be made. We next had pronouncements by the British Labour party and the  President  of the United States of America, and 'ultimately we had the Perth Labour Conference resolutions, which, in my opinion, were but a plagiarism or a hotchpotch of the various public pronouncements that had been made from time to time since the beginning of the war, added to by a good slice of wind pudding in order to tickle the ears of the electors of Australia. This was done at a time when the position was most depressing. When the Labour party met; in conference in June last the world was trembling, not knowing where the next blow of Germany would fall, and it did seem that the  "bitter-enders" and those who would make no compromise with the enemy would possibly have to give way, and it may have been in the minds of some of the delegates at that celebrated conference that they might have to hedge a bit and make some sort of prophecy of policy that might turn out true, so that in some future election they might say to the Win-the-war party, " If you had taken our advice you would have saved thousands of lives and millions of pounds." In any case, no matter what might .have been in the minds of the delegates, there was no mistaking what they meant, for, as reported in the columns of the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of 22nd June last, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Arthur</inline> Hae - I do not suppose my friends opposite will say that he is not representative of the Official Australian Labour party - speaking immediately after the conference, said - </para>

                                <para>- I have been honest in regard to my opinions of the actions of the Prime Minister in England. I witnessed much of the impression which he made upon that stolid, solid race in 1916. I had the honour of being attached, as a volunteer, by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George, to the Parliamentary Munitions Committee; and I was sent ,to many of the munitions factories throughout the Midlands, Lancashire, and Yorkshire, and I spent much time among the miners of South Wales, in order to help stimulate the workers in the great munitions campaign then being conducted. Portion of my duties also was to assist as best I could in the settlement of small disputes as they might arise. I was present to hear addresses delivered by the Australian Prime Minister before the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, and before the London Chamber of Commerce. I heard what he then had to say, and saw much of the stimulation which our Prime Minister had upon the British community in what were then very depressing times. We had but recently evacuated Gallipoli. Bulgaria had come in against the Allies. Greece was treacherous; and, altogether, the fortunes of the Allies were at a low ebb. When William Morris Hughes came among the British community, and, by directing the thoughts of the people along the proper channels, by enunciating the " bitter end " policy, and by insisting that we could not end the war until Germany had been defeated, he did a great deal to help forward the proper spirit of England. Many of us in England at that time thought that, whatever could be said with regard to the use made of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> by the Northcliffe press, our Prime Minister did more than any other individual to pave the way for the displacement of the Asquith Government and the incoming of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George, who has brought us now to -this glorious end. No man, knowing the conditions of England in 1915-16, could well have conceived that this great change could have been brought about, and that the British public could have been held to the grip of victory all the time, despite the many other influences at work. And, if we are to give the man his due, and take the proper perspective of the whole situation, "William Morris Hughes has done more than any other individual outside of England to win the war. I speak with some personal experience of what was going on in the Old Country at that dark time; and I repeat that the Prime Minister of Australia, by now insisting upon a Monroe doctrine for the South Pacific, and by claiming that we shall have economic independence in Australia in order that we may give preference to whom we like, and how we like, is voicing the opinions of 95 per cent, of the electors. And those opinions will carry weight, if pronounced at the Peace Conference, by the voice of William Morris Hughes, who has been consistent right through. It was he who was responsible for the Paris Conference economic resolutions; and I ask honorable senators opposite, do they agree that Australia must have economic independence? Do they agree that the German flag shall not again fly in the Pacific? Do they agree that Germany shall have no further jumping-off place from which to threaten our national safety ? If they agree with all that, then they must realize that the principle of the freedom of the seas has been already achieved under the present armistice terms. If ever there was a man who could voice our sentiments, by the strength of his grip on the British public, and by the strength of his personality and his clear sight, it is William Morris Hughes. He, I hope, will be the representative of Australia ; and he will represent Australia well. </para>

                                    as to my views upon two questions. First, however, I desire to indorse entirely the peace and war proposals of the Perth Labour Conference. Honorable senators who twit the Labour party for its advocacy of peace by negotiation forget to mention that the Labour party also laid down the conditions on which that peace should be entered into. Those conditions were the evacuation of invaded territories, the freedom of small nations, and reparation for injuries done. Those are practically the conditions upon which the terms of the armistice are now established, and I am not ashamed to stand upon any public platform in Australia and advocate them. The honorable senator also quoted Canada. Australia has no need to be ashamed in comparison with Canada or any other of the British Dominions as to what she has done towards the attainment of the termination of the war.

                                <para>- W - With regard to German New Guinea, and to the Pacific Islands generally, I favour the dictum pronounced by the Prime Minister of England, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George, and indorsed, practically, by  President  Wilson, namely, that those Possessions should be placed under the control of an International Commission. And when I remember the number of interests in the Pacific, and the number of nations having Possessions there - France, Japan, Holland, America - it appears to me to be rather a large order to say that our little island should claim a dominant position in the disposal of those Possessions. Concerning Canada, I point out that that Dominion, with 70 per cent, more population than Australia, has sent only about 25 per cent, more troops. Canada has lost only 50,000 men - and that, after all, is the great test, because casualties are based upon different methods of calculation in different Armies. Canada has lost by death in action, and from wounds. 50,000 men. </para>

It is true that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> put forward the contention that the Labour party had not, as they claimed, any inherent right to separate representation at the Peace Conference. He pointed out the difference between the expressed opinions of the Canadian Labour party and those of the Australian Labour party, but he went no further. He did not attempt to compare the war efforts of the two countries, which have nothing to do with the representation of Labour at the Peace Conference. </para>

                                <para>- T - There are only four members of the British Labour pa.ty in the British Coalition Government, and they have been requested to withdraw from it. They do not represent the great Labour party in Great Britain, and on the eve of a general election it remains to be seen whether the British Labour party will not insist upon being represented at the Peace Conference. If they are, surely the Labour movement in Australia, which has done so much to bring this war to a successful termination, is also entitled to some representation. I do not claim that it is entitled to the same representation that the great British Labour party, which is so far more numerous, should have, but it certainly should be represented. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> in respect of great issues that he has put before the country on two occasions, has been turned down by the majority of the people, and I do not think he is entitled to claim that he represents Australia, since he represents only a section of the people. </para>

                            <para>. - I do not propose to discuss the general question, since it has already been ably dealt with by the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen),</inline> but I shall "deal with certain phases of it arising out of the claims put forward, in the course of this debate, for the representation of the Official Labour party at the Peace Conference. I use the word " Official " deliberately, and with that distinction I assert that Labour will be represented at the Peace Conference, and represented by one of the greatest men that the Labour movement in Australia has ever produced. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> is still a Labour man in a broader sense than any of those who now masquerade under the guise of Official Labourites, and he carries with him, moreover, the support not only of the Liberal electors of this country, but of thousands of sterling Labour voters who never vote but for Labour, and who followed the lead of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> and others of us because we were true to our country. </para>

                        <para>Let us examine some of the contentions that have been advanced as to why the Official Labour party should have special representation at the Peace Conference. Dealing, first of all, with the last honorable senator to advance that claim, I would point out that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin,</inline> in defending the various conditions laid down by the Perth Official Labour Conference as to the terms upon which peace negotiations should proceed, put forward the singular argument that one of those terms was the evacuation of invaded territory and that that had been secured as a condition of the armistice. It is true that it has been laid down as one of the conditions of the armistice in the sense that the Allies have said to Germany, to Turkey, and to Austria, "You shall  evacuate within fourteen days all invaded territory." But the Allies have gone further, and have said, " We claim the right to invade and hold your territory until the peace terms are adopted." Will <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> have the temerity to tell me that that ig what the Perth Official Labour Conference urged as a basis for peace negotiations. What that Conference urged was that the British troops must withdraw from Palestine and hand back Palestine to Turkey; that we should withdraw from German New Guinea, and also from the German colonies in Africa. </para>

                                <para>- In what respect am 1 wrong ? Are we again in the fog to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> referred? Does not the Official Labour party know what the Perth Conference really meant? Did it mean that Germany only was to evacuate invaded territory? If it did, why did it not say so? T rely upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> as an authority upon the question, and he has told us that under the terms of that resolution all invaded territory was to be evacuated. I take it that he meant that to include territory invaded, not only by the Germans, but by the Allies. The difference between that condition and the condition as to evacuation, which forms .part of the terms of the armistice, is as different as day is from night. </para>

                        <para>It was also said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> that the British Labour party was to be represented at the Peace Conference. It is to be represented in exactly the same way that Labour in Australia will be represented - it will be represented by Labour men who, putting their country before their party, stood behind the British Government in its determination to see the war through to victory. If any Labour representatives are at the Peace Conference it will be those who are to-day in the British Cabinet. I make that statement on the authority of a speech made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lloyd</inline> George, and reported in to-day's newspapers. British Labour representation will consist, not of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Henderson,</inline> who left the British Cabinet, but of Labour men who remained in that Cabinet, who are in it to-day, and who were determined to see the war brought to a victorious close. </para>

I would advise honorable senators opposite to make themselves familiar with the meaning of the words they use before they commit themselves to such statements. If honorable senators desire to have the technical meaning of the word " indemnity," then, according to <inline font-style="italic">Webster's International Dictionary,</inline> it means, "Protection or exemption from loss or damage past or to" come; compensation or remuneration for loss, damage, or injury sustained; penal punishment or pertaining to punishment; designed to impose punishment." That being so, the Official Labour party are against an indemnity which is compensation for injury- or damage done and is in the nature of a punishment. That, [ take it, is their meaning. </para>

                                <para>- The plain English meaning of indemnity is, " Compensation in the nature of punishment." Let us examine this matter. Australia did not commence this war, or seek it, but she went into it, and there is not an honorable senator on the other side who will say that she was not justified in doing so. They all say that they believe that Australia was justified in taking up the sword in this war. We have in  this country, as a result of our participation in the war, involved the taxpayers in a debt that will amount to from £300,000,000 to £400,000,000 before we are through. </para>

For the sake of my argument, 1 will assume that they are identical. That ought to suit <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes.</inline> Now let us examine the difference between the attitude of  President  Wilson towards the war, and that of the Official Labour party in Australia.  President  Wilson put forward his fourteen points, and said, " These are the principles for which America is fighting in this war." And when the March offensive failed, and Germany saw disaster coming, she said, " We are prepared to negotiate on the basis of your fourteen points. We are prepared to accept them."  The Official Labour party of Australia put forward their fourteen, or forty or fifty points, as the basis for negotiations for peace. Now let us see the vital difference between their attitude and that of  President  Wilson. When Germany said to  President  Wilson, " We are prepared to negotiate with you on the basis of your fourteen points," he said, " I refer you to Marshal Foch " ; and when they went to Marshal Foch, he replied to them in the terms of the armistice, " Unconditional surrender." </para>

                                <para>- What do the terms of the armistice mean ? It is possible to include the whole of them, in those two words. The difference between  President  Wilson's attitude and that of the Official Labour party in Australia is that when the latter's terms were put forward Germany was advancing and winning. Germany was getting near to the heart of France; her armies were close to Paris, and had the Allies then said to Germany, " We are prepared to negotiate on the basis of  President  Wilson's points, or on the fourteen points of the Official Labour party of Australia," what would have been the reply of the German Government? It would have been exactly similar to the reply which  President  Wilson gave to them. Germany would have said, " If you want to negotiate, we refer you to Field Marshal Hindenburg." That would have been their reply. If the Australian Official Labour party's attitude had been adopted by the Allies, to-day instead of an unconditional surrender by Germany, we should have had an unconditional surrender by the Allies, 'and Germany dictating terms to the world. That shows the difference between the two positions. </para>

                        <para>The fatal error, blunder, or insanity which the Official Labour party of Australia committed on that occasion was that by proclaiming their willingness to negotiate with the German Army that was victorious at that juncture they showed that they were prepared to place themselves under the heel of the militarist class in Germany. Honorable senators opposite denounce militarism, and yet by their own action the party to which they belong was prepared to hand over the world to the power of militarism for ever. They said that there should be peace by negotiation. Germany said that there should be peace by negotiation. She has it. Is that the sort of peace that we wanted for this country ? Russia said that she wanted peace by negotiation, and she obtained it. If we had negotiated with Germany, is there any doubt as to what the terms would have been ? We have been told by German statesmen what the terms would have been. They have told us in unmistakable terms that were flashed throughout the length and breadth of the world what their terms were - Belgium must never again be allowed to be a threat to Germany; the Channel ports must be held; a considerable portion of Eastern France must be attached to Germany; Palestine must be restored to Turkey; the German colonies must be restored to Germany, and the most important British Naval stations throughout the world were to be handed over to Germany. Those were the terms that were announced by a responsible German Minister at the time. </para>

                            <para>- I wish to remind honorable senators on the other side who endeavour to ignore the Labour party in Australia that only a few days ago the Kaiser arrogated to himself the right to speak for the people of Germany, and to-day the people of that country are speaking for themselves in an unmistakable manner. If the party opposite proceed in the way they are doing it is very doubtful what may take place in some British communities that we know of. If they think that the workers of this country will tamely submit year after year to their kind of legislation they will be as much deceived as the Kaiser is to-day. Only a few days ago kings, dukes, and other persons of that description were plentiful in Germany. I think there were twenty-two of them, but where are they to-day ? You can buy them for a few pence each. If honorable senators opposite think that the workers of this country can be ignored in the way they suggest, they will find themselves very much deceived, possibly in the near future. </para>

                        <para>The men who left Australia, not to talk, but to fight, were mainly drawn from the workers. We all know as a fact that the union element which is the basis of the Labour movement here has been the most largely represented element in the Australian Imperial Force. One union alone - the Australian Workers Union - has sent more than 30,000 members to the Front; and yet honorable senators opposite propose that Labour shall have no representation whatever at the Peace table. If the figures can be obtained, as I dare say they will in the near future, it will be found that the members of the Australian Imperial Force included possibly 250,000 members of Australian trade unions; and yet we are told that after all their sacrifices they are to have no representation. I trust that the Government will see the folly of attempting to put a proposal of this kind into effect, quite regardless of what the British Government or any other Government may do. </para>
                        <para>Some question has been raised here as to the attitude of honorable senators on this side on the question of disputed territories. </para>

As I say, honorable senators opposite are anxious to know our attitude in regard to New Guinea, the Pacific Islands, and the German Possessions in Africa. So far as I am concerned, I believe in getting all I can, and holding on to all I have got; and that, I think, is the policy of Great Britain. Shortly after the war broke out. Great Britain annexed Egypt for good - 1,000,000 square miles of country - and I think that, when the war terminates, although we cannot say what the Allies may agree to, we shall find Great Britain holding fast to New Guinea, nearly all l.he Pacific Islands, German East Africa, and South- West Africa, together with a few other places. Personally, I- hope that Alsace-Lorraine will be restored to France, and I should not mind if Luxemberg were also attached to that country. Further,  it might be well if the Allies held on to the neutral zone on the right side of the Rhine; but later on, when the workers in that part of the world develop the same opinion as I hold, they will compel the land-owners there- </para>

                            <para>It was decided not to accept the recommendation of the Perth Labour Conference regarding a ballot of members of affiliated organizations, and, as far as South Australia is concerned, no further action will bc taken in this matter. The consensus of opinion here is that the taking of the ballot cannot produce any tangible result, and members generally were opposed to the idea of voting on a ballot slip which contains a recommendation as to how the individual should vote. </para>

                        <para class="block">That decision, I think, crystallizes the position in South Australia. I have seen reports in the press, and I think, also, in a circular issued by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy,</inline> as secretary of the Tasmanian Labour party, to the effect that no action would be taken in that State with reference to the ballot. It will be seen that in South Australia and Tasmania the Labour movement has taken no part in the ballot. We must remember that Tasmania has all along sent a very fair proportion of Labourites into this Chamber and the other branch of the Legislature, and the same may be said of South Australia. </para>

I am inclined to think, however, that on occasions the facts in regard to the ballot have been wrongly reported. I was present at a meeting of the Annandale branch of the Labour League when a vote was taken, and I know the figures. In the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Times</inline> report of that proceeding, it was stated that there were 222 on the " Yes " side and 1 on the " No " side ; and I have no hesitation in saying that that report was absolutely incorrect, inasmuch as the figures given did not represent the actual figures in the slightest degree. </para>

                            <para>.- 1 have listened attentively to the arguments of honorable senators opposite, and I must confess that they have not been at all definite. The Peace Conference will settle great international principles, but, so far  as  I can see, no principles of either the Nationalist or. the Labour parties are at stake. It seems to me, therefore, that a demand for the representation of party views at the Peace table is asking a great deal too much. But I think honorable senators opposite are not very much in earnest  when they suggest that the interests of Australia cannot be adequately represented by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes).</inline> As a matter of fact, with the exception of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes'</inline> references to the economic resolutions of the Paris Conference, they have not attempted to show that the attitude of the Prime Minister is inconsistent with the interests of Australia, I suppose, however, thai the motion before the Senate will serve its purpose; but I should like to say that it would have been a great calamity if the resolutions of the Perth Conference had been given effect to, because those resolutions were passed at the very time when our national life seemed to be hanging by a thread; when everything seemed- to be going against the Allied Powers, and. German propaganda for peace by negotiation was being distributed through the Allied countries. Happily, character is discovered when th« severest strain is placed upon a people, and, in my judgment, the Official Labour party of Australia evinced a lamentable weakness at that particular time by their " No-yes " attitude on such a vital question. Personally, I have always been totally opposed to any negotiation with Germany- </para>

The retention of Samoa is necessary for the safety of New Zealand, and likewise our occupation of New Guinea is necessary for the safety of Australia, and I am strongly in favour of this course. As a Democracy we endeavour to pass just laws for our own people, and I am satisfied that whatever Government may be in power, they can be trusted to do justice to the natives of New Guinea. It is a burden that we should willingly shoulder, not only for -the benefit of the native inhabitants of the island, but for the welfare of Australia. </para>

He is vigorous enough and courageous enough to speak on behalf of Australia in the centre of the Empire when he. believes that our interests are being overlooked. I agree with the views which he has expressed on Imperial matters, and I think that his presence in London will make, not merely for the benefit of Australia, but for the benefit of the Empire. Australia has no better friend than he is. However much honorable senators opposite may disagree with him on matters of domestic policy, they cannot question his Imperial outlook. </para>

                                <para>- I do not think that he has interfered with the Imperial authorities in any of their negotiations. We have to bear in mind that there is always a disposition on the part of British statesmen to adopt an insular view. Many of the members of the present Government are unfortunately afflicted in that way. In my judgment we ought to experience a feeling of pleasure in the knowledge that the Empire will be so strongly represented at the Peace Conference. It has earned that right, and it has paid for it. Consequently the Empire will be in a position to speak in the name of freedom on behalf of the races which, I hope, will be brought under its protection. I trust that not only Palestine, Syria., and Mesopotamia, but all that Eastern country, will be brought under the protection of the Union Jack. My honorable friends opposite are loyal enough, but they view, this matter from a wrong angle.' If the countries to which I have referred are brought under the British Crown, they will have more chance of working out their own destinies than will otherwise be the case. </para>

Or they may select Canada, or Egypt which  proved one of the saviours of the Empire by providing bases for us in this terrible crisis. The British race is the only race which is capable of establishing self-government amongst the people of Palestine, Syria, and Arabia. </para>

                            <para>. -  Our Standing Orders will not permit me, in the limited time at my disposal, to reply to all the criticisms which have been directed against this motion. I shall, therefore, content myself with a brief reference to one or two of those criticisms. If this discussion has accomplished nothing else, it has placed a few honorable senators opposite on their defence. It has caused them to urge excuses for having left the Australian Labour party, and associated themselves with a party which, if it had its way, would have prevented the Government accomplishing half as much in the prosecution of this war as it has accomplished. In his speech this afternoon the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> very adroitly attempted to compare the conditions laid down in the armistice which has been con- ' eluded with Germany with the fourteen points affirmed by  President  Wilson in regard to peace terms. In that way he sought to cloud the issue. My motion refers specifically to the representation of Australia at the Peace Conference. Australia was not represented at the Conference which took place at Versailles to determine the armistice conditions, and there is no man who knows better than does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that, at the Peace Conference, the whole of the points determined by the armistice will have to be worked out in detail. Why, then, did the honorable gentleman seek to confuse the issue in the way that he did? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch,</inline> too, who has . left the Australian Labour party, and who arrived here to-day, addressed himself to this question. We were all glad to again hear his sonorous, if not mellow, voice. He has just come from a campaign in Western Australia, in which the resolutions of the Perth Conference were a vital issue, yet the electors of Swan returned the Official Labour candidate. </para>

                            made the statement that the resolutions of the Perth Conference  savoured of plagiarism; 'but over two years ago the New South Wales Labour Conference drafted practically the same proposals as were indorsed by the InterState Labour Conference at Perth. Senators de Largie, Pearce, and Lynch referred to the State Conferences as representing only sections of the Labour movement; but it is not much more than two  years since those senators would have regarded the State Conferences differently, and would have bowed to the will of the Inter-State Conference. I have merely to add that, on moving the motion, I was careful not to introduce party feeling, and I am sorry that acrimony was shown by some of my ex-colleagues. I hold that when the Peace Conference assembles, representatives of Australian Labour in this Parliament, elected by the people of Australia, should have a voice in its decisions.

There is justification for this course in the fact that the Bill contains no principles that are new to the community. All its principles are well understood, and many of them are in operation in various States of the Commonwealth. Honorable senators are, in fact, thoroughly familiar with the provisions of the Bill, and the debate on the second reading may therefore very well proceed to-morrow. </para>

                <para class="block">Wales) [10.3].  -  I ask the Minister not to adopt this unreasonable attitude in regard to such an important measure as a Bill providing for the representation of the people. After 10 o'clock at night we are asked to suspend the Standing Orders in order to allow of the Bill being passed through all its stages with the rapidity desired by the Government. The Minister, in moving this motion, gave no information which would justify such a drastic action. The existing system of conducting elections has stood the test of sixteen years' experience, and surely at 10 o'clock at night the Government can well afford to deal with an alteration of the system in the ordinary course of parliamentary business without resorting to the extraordinary procedure of suspending the Standing Orders. The Minister said that the Bill introduces no new principle. I venture to say that the explanation of the Government's desire for expedition in dealing with the Bill is that it contains a new principle which they wish to hurry into adoption in time for a coming by-election. That is the very great principle of securing the representa'tion of majorities, a principle with which I am in accord, in so far as it aims at insuring that in future members of the Commonwealth Parliament shall not sit as the representatives of a minority of the electors in their constituencies. Has the <inline font-style="italic">CSMinister</inline> overlooked the fact that it is because he desires this new principle to operate in an election that will take place in a few weeks he has moved for the suspension of the Standing Orders ? Is it not beneath the dignity of the National party and of Australia's Parliament that the Standing Orders should be suspended at this hour of night in order that for party purposes a split vote at the coming election may be avoided <inline font-style="italic">1</inline></para>

                        <para>- The objection is to Parliament altering the system of election after the issue of the writ. I think that common-sense supporters of the Government will admit that, but for the result of the Swan by-election, there  would have been no motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders in order that an Electoral Bill might be dealt with in a hurry. The Government are very much concerned, because the gentleman who will enter another place to represent the Swan constituency was elected on a minority vote; but is there any reason to believe that even had this Bill been in operation, the National party would have won the seat? </para>

                        <para>- On the election figures it is clear that the result of the election under a system of preferential voting would have been the return of either the Labour candidate or the Country party's candidate, who came second at the poll. But assume that a minority of the electors is represented, and although there have been minorities represented in every Parliament since Federation, the Government now propose to suspend the Standing Orders in order to avoid a repetition of such happenings, and in the hope of preventing the tide of victory turning against them at the Corangamite by-election. </para>

                <para>The Bill contains more than 200 clauses; many of its provisions are new to the people of the Commonwealth, and there are many proposed amendments of existing law that every honorable senator should have an opportunity of reading before even the motion for the second reading is made. Many of us have availed ourselves of the opportunity of getting copies of the Bill from another place, but we have had no opportunity of considering the measure as it has reached us, and surely the Senate does not intend to surrender its position as a deliberative assembly bv suspending the Standing Orders after 10 o'clock at night in order that the Government may place the Bill before us immediately. If the Minister, in moving the second reading, puts all the provisions of the Bill before us to-night, those that are new, those that are old, and those that revert to old conditions, shall I be in a position to speak on the second reading to-morrow after a sitting that has already been protracted? Is there any reason for the suspension of the Standing Orders? If the Senate cannot do its business in the ordinary sitting days, let the Government add to the number of sitting days. </para>

                        <para>- 1 may- have supported <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> in complying with the Standing Orders, in asking for a discussion on a most important and urgent question. No analogy can be drawn between the two cases. The Standing Orders provide that the discussion on a motion such as that tabled by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> can last only for three hours. Therefore it cannot interrupt the business of the Senate for a longer period, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is now asking the Senate within five minutes of receiving a Bill of 220 clauses to suspend the Standing Orders hurriedly in order that it may be passed through all its stages without interruption. He proposes to make one concession to honorable senators on that side as well as on this, bec'ause, after all, this is no party measure. I venture to say that on the question of securing the effective representation of majorities, as many proportionately on this side as on that support it. If the Bill stopped at that, we could well settle it at a sitting, but it goes infinitely further. It deals with the most difficult questions affecting the representation of the people. Behind all that is a point that we must not lose sight of. I understand that a writ has been issued to-day to conduct a certain election. Is the Senate going to suspend its Standing Orders in order to pass a Bill that will enable one party to win that election? If the Government secure the suspension of the Standing Orders, we do not know what amendments they may introduce, not to enfranchise, but to disfranchise the people. Even if. the suspension of the Standing Orders would give us a model Electoral Act, the principle is altogether bad. </para>

                        <para>- I have not been speaking seven minutes on the most important and serious question that we have yet had to deal with in this Parliament, and I meet with that almost insulting remark. When the honorable senator knows me better he will realize that there are times when my duty calls on me to debate questions most seriously, and those times generally come when I see an attempt made to effect an inroad on the liberties of the people. If ever an attack was made for infamous purposes on the law dealing with the election of members to this Parliament, that attack is being made now by a Government which, after the issue of the writ, deliberately moves to suspend the Standing Orders in order to alter the conditions under which the pending election is to be held. We may yet have a Government which, following the bad example of the present Government, in suspending the Standing Orders and preventing a discussion to which we are entitled- </para>

If the Government's experience of this side of the Senate has been such that they have been subjected to unreasonable opposition, if we have ever interfered with the proper conduct of business, if we have not met the Go- ' vern ment more than half-way in all their business proposals, if the Government have found it necessary to take this step because they cannot get their business through, I  say  to them, " Continue what you are doing/' but the records will show that the Government have never reasonably asked on any occasion for the suspension of the Standing Orders during the life-time of this Parliament without having it granted by us without a word of complaint. Possibly the Government, sure of the subservient following of their own party, are absolutely certain that they can reckon on every member behind them voting as a piece of machinery when they press the button. </para>

                <para>It is because of the existence of a subservient following behind the Government that such an impudent motion is moved. I say. this because I cannot imagine any Government taking such a course if they had a party of independent thinkers behind them prepared to protect, as it should be the duty of every member of Parliament to protect, the purity of the Act by which men are elected to Parliament. Nothing can be more important. The very basis of our representative institutions is that the electoral law shall not be manipulated for party purposes. This is the first time in the history of the Federal Parliament that I have ever heard of an attempt to alter the whole machinery by which members are elected to Parliament, merely to meet the case of a by-election. Let us suppose, for the sake of argument, that the Government lost the Swan election on a minority vote. I am not conceding that point; but in order to meet their argument, let me assume that the Government may lose the Corangamite seat under the same conditions. Even if they do, the Government party is big and strong enough to suffer a loss of that kind under an unsatisfactory Electoral Act, and when the general election comes they will prevent anything of the kind taking place. The fact is that the Government feel they have the power and are going to use it. They propose to suspend the Standing Orders within a few minutes after the Senate has received a Bill, which it is entitled to consider for at least a week before being asked to dis- cuss it, unless parliamentary business has become the art of rushing legislation through without due consideration. If that is what Parliament meets for, the Government are justified in suspending the Standing Orders. </para>
                <para>The Government are in the happy position of having considered the Bill time after time. The Minister in charge of it has had it before the Cabinet more than once, and the Government have had the advantage of a good deal of discussion upon it. When it comes to a question of Parliament being asked to consider it - and it is the duty of the Government to protect the liberties of Parliament and the rights of its members - instead of asking Parliament to devote to it their best energies, brains, and thought, they say, " We will give you no time to develop your ideas on the measure, and not even the opportunity to read it. You must vote on it before you have had time to read its provisions." I say that advisedly, because there will be no time to read it before this motion is dealt with,, because if this motion is carried, we shall only have the time between the Minister's speech and when we meet to-morrow in which to peruse the most important Bill that has been submitted to us during this Parliament. </para>

                <para>If the best brains of this Parliament were directed for two months to this measure, which contains 22© clauses, there would still be room for further consideration, yet immediately <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President</inline> announces the receipt of a message from another House stating that the Bill has been passed there, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> rises and asks us to suspend the Standing Orders. I am not inclined to agree to the suspension of our Standing Orders upon the explanation which he has given us. I challenge any one to look up the records of this Parliament for the last eighteen months that it has been in existence, and find where I have ever raised my voice against the manner in which the Government have conducted the business of the Senate. I have always allowed Ministers to suspend Standing Orders at will without any protest. I have left the transaction of business in the hands of the Government, but the proposal we have now before us has a more important bearing upon the rights of the people than any of the other Bills we have dealt with have had. Furthermore, it is an important precedent that the Government propose to establish. One constitutional writer has said that as we cannot without horrors from which the imagination recoils use physical force as a check upon misgovernment, it is our duty to maintain in their integrity all the principles of constitutional government as they exist. The suspension of the Standing Orders upon a Bill of this kind is a direct inroad upon all that we consider worth maintaining in regard to the purity of elections. This Government ought to be the Simon Pure ; it ought to be above suspicion. Though it may be considered by its followers as a Government that cannot possibly do any wrong thing, or any mean thing, or anything that ought not to be done, nevertheless, it is not justified in upsetting principles which should be observed by every Government. Its proposal to alter the electoral law while an election is proceeding and after a writ has been issued is a most serious attack upon those principles. If it be accepted as a sound principle that after a writ for an election has been issued the electoral law can be altered in order to improve the representation of the people, or make it wide enough to secure the return of the successful candidate on an absolute majority, the opposite principle may hold equally good, and a Government with evil intentions may, after a writ has been issued, pass .1 Bill in. order to narrow the represent! don of the people. It is only a matt', r of difference of intention. Here the Government are blazing the track that future elections may be manipulated after writs have been issued. To them the winning or losing of a Victorian seat in the House of Representatives is a most serious business. I know that they have the numbers to secure a majority for the suspension of the Standing Orders, but even if the Standing Orders be not suspended the passage of the Bill will not be delayed beyond the time which they propose to allow for its discussion, for there is certain machinery in our Standing Orders which can be used. In the hands of a Government backed by a brutal majority, backed by stupidity, and backed by thoughtless numbers, that machinery will be employed. </para>

                <para>We are asked to suspend the Standing Orders to hasten the passage of a Bill which we have not yet seen. If this were a measure which we could grasp by merely listening to the Minister's" speech it would be a different matter. If it were some such Bill as comes before Parliament frequently - for instance, having to do with the payment of civil servants, and in regard to which it might be claimed that any delay in its passage would cause serious inconvenience - honorable senators generally would not object to the suspension of the Standing Orders. When we are faced with a measure, however, which strikes at the taproot of all our electoral principles, we should at least demand that we be given every opportunity for its study, consideration, and debate. Some honorable senators may insist that this is a good Bill, and to that I can only reply that we should be given time to examine it. If honorable senators on this side were given that time which they have a right to ask, it would pass, no doubt, without undue debate or criticism. Standing Orders are provided for the protection of minorities in just such circumstances as these. Parliament has devised a means by which minorities may be protected from the actions of strong and unscrupulous Governments. What is the urgency of this Bill? The Government claim that its urgency is that under the old system they lost a byelection. </para>

Personally, I take no exception to the system under which we have been working. But for that system I should not have been here; and I must say that it has worked well for the people of Australia, owing to the fact that I am here, and that all of us are here. But, with the awful example of the past few days before us, will not honorable senators take warning, and leave well alone'* We learn that the "All-Highest," who would have been in a secure position still had he been wise enough to let well enough alone, is now flying from his country. He was not satisfied ; he wanted to alter things, and he used a brutal majority to bring about his purposes until he came up against a liberty-loving people; wherefore he is now a fugitive without a crown. The Government should take warning by the example of that distinguished deserter from his own country, and should leave well-enough alone. </para>

The Government, in their haste to pass this Bill, would not even give their own supporters an opportunity of moving amendments. Under some new standing order which was introduced, the debate had to -close at a given signal. All criticism, all consideration, was  guillotined  The rights of the representatives of the people in another place were taken from them.

Instead of the Government displaying such frantic anxiety to rush this Bill through in order that it may apply to an approaching by-election, it would do better to consult its dignity and show its regard for the trust which the people have reposed in it. If they would pass a Bill providing that on 1st July next there should be a general election for the House of Representatives and for the Senate in respect of senators who will shortly have to retire they would do well.

                        <para>- The last general election was to provide for the return of a purely war party. Now that the war is over, the sooner the domestic requirements of the people are attended to in this Parliament by men who are in actual touch with them, the better it will be. A Parliament elected under the conditions which prevailed on the occasion of the last appeal to the country cannot pretend to represent Australia when it becomes once more an industrious peace loving country such as it was before the outbreak of hostilities. Instead of asking now for the suspension of the Standing Orders so that this Bill may be rushed through in a few hours, the Government would be acting with some regard for its dignity and the best traditions of the public life of Australia if it brought down such a measure as I have suggested, and gave the Opposition ample opportunity for its consideration. </para>

                </continue><para>This Bill did not officially come before the Senate until after 10 o'clock this evening, and although I shall not say I had not seen it before, the fact remains that I then had it officially brought before me for the first time. The Minister now proposes that the Standing Orders shall be suspended in order that we may proceed with the first and second reading stages to-night. I am not disposed to impute wrong motives either to an Administration or to individuals, but when one finds the Government departing from its usual practice or trying to cover up something, one is inclined to grow suspicious. We have transacted a considerable amount of business to-day, and it was not until after 10 p.m. that this Bill was received from another place. In the circumstances, the Government should not have done more than ask for the first reading, leaving the motion for the second reading to be moved to-morrow. A wise Government would have said that the debate on the motion for the second reading of this Bill, dealing, as it does, in a broad way with the representation of the people, should be delayed for at least one month, in order that it might be properly considered. It will be urged that that would be hastening slowly; but my reply is that we can well afford to hasten slowly in dealing with a measure of this kind, consolidating, as it does, the whole of our electoral laws. Some one has inquired why there should be a general election before the war is over. One reason why we should have a general election is that, although there was no definite statement on the subject in the National party's manifesto, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> in practically every speech that he made during the last campaign said that if his party were returned to power not one stone in Labour's edifice would be interfered with. Labour won its way into this Parliament under the present electoral law, and now it is proposed that the very corner-stone of Labour's edifice shall bc tampered with. </para><interjection>

As the Bill was officially before the Senate only about five minutes before the motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders was moved, I think I am- perfectly in order in reading the measure for honorable senators, that they may know exactly what they are being asked to suspend the. Standing Orders to do. I hope that there is no standing order that will prevent me from making clear what the Senate is being asked to do. </para>

                        <para>- Now that the permission which I obtained to remain seated while speaking has been withdrawn I shall make a brief explanation. Nothing is more disagreeable to me than to parade in public any infirmity from which I might happen to suffer, but in justice to myself I must- mention that about a fortnight ago, just as I was leaving my bath, a sudden rush of blood to the head caused me to become faint and to fall. A day 01' two later I had a similar experience, and on the following day, while hurrying upstairs, it occurred once more. While I was standing on the second step in the Senate to-night a somewhat similar feeling came over me, and I therefore asked the indulgence of the Senate. It was graciously extended to me. It has now been ungraciously withdrawn, and I shall not ask for it. I feel physically as fit as ever, but I do not regard as a laughing matter an affliction -which might possibly overtake me at any moment. I asked for this indulgence, not for the purpose of gaining any unfair advantage, but because of a feeling that momentarily came upon me. </para>

                            <para>- I rise to a point of order. I base my point of order on several of our Standing Orders. In the first place, I direct attention to standing order 406, which provides that no honorable senator shall read his speech. I was present in the chamber for at least half-an-hour before the suspension of the sitting, and have been present since its resumption, and during the whole of that time the honorable senator continued to read the Bill. We know that quotations are allowable, but they should have some relevancy. The motion before the Senate is for the suspension of the Standing Orders. </para>

In fourteen or fifteen years' experience in this Chamber I cannot remember an instance of a Government considering it necessary to move the suspension of the Standing' Orders after 10 o'clock at night in connexion with a Bill of the volume and importance of the Electoral Bill. </para>

We are asked to suspend the Standing Orders to allow the Bill to pass through all its stages without delay, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is entitled in every way that is not inconsistent with the Standing Orders to show why the Standing Orders should not be suspended.

The Bill is so important that the Standing Orders should not be suspended to hurry its passage until such time as every member of the Senate has made himself fully conversant with every clause in it, so that he may be able to follow the Minister in charge of it during his second-reading speech. The Minister for Defence must, in the circumstances, admit that his objection on the score of irrelevancy falls to the ground. </para>

I am not suggesting that if the Deputy President was wrong you should buttress his ruling by another wrong ruling, but it will be admitted that it is difficult to conduct a debate when one is subjected twice in the course of his speech to an interruption by the raising of the same point of order. </para>

                    <para>With regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> objection, on the ground that I said I would read the Electoral Acts passed in other parts of the world, I may say that I can read them in my own room and have no intention of reading them to the Senate. My remark was merely a flippant reply to a statement made by the honor' able senator. The motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders was submitted within five minutes after the time that the Bill came into the possession of honorable senators, and I contend that I am in order in letting honorable senators know what they are asked to vote for. I venture to say that if the motion  had been put without debate - and, so far, I- am the only honorable senator who has spoken against it - the Senate would have agreed to the suspension of so much of the Standing Orders as would have prevented the passing without delay of a Bill which had been in its possession only five minutes, and the contents of which honorable senators did not know. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has spoken of my reading the Bill clause by clause without comment. If that is an objection, I ask, what comment is necessary on a measure of this kind? None; and I am reading the Bill because I am sure that when honorable senators realize its importance as a measure which goes to the basis of our representation, they will refuse to suspend the . Standing Orders. The honorable senator also described my action as unparalleled; but so is his own action. I challenge him to find one case in all the Parliaments of Australia since constitutional government where a measure of first-class importance dealing with the franchise has been made the subject of the suspension of Standing Orders within five minutes of its introduction. </para>

                            <para>- I feel that I am quite justified in reading the Bill so that honorable senators may have full knowledge of it, and not, by accepting this motion, deprive the minority of their rights. If this motion be passed, we shall be asked to vote on the measure blindfold. If we were asked to pass a simple motion of, say, one or two lines, would I not be in order in reading it? The motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders affects this Bill, and makes the Bill part of the motion; and for that reason I read it. I do not see that my action is in any way inconsistent with the Standing Orders. </para>

I am prepared to close the debate if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> will give us a reasonable opportunity to discuss the Bill when we have had time to read it. I do not remind you, sir, of the ruling previously given by your  deputy  in order to influence your judgment, but that ruling is certainly an answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> statement that I am taking unprecedented action. I am merely exercising rights which I believe I have, and which the  Deputy President  believes I have, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator.

The reading of written speeches, which has been allowed in other deliberative assemblies, has never been recognised in either House of Parliament. A member may read extracts from documents; but his own language must be delivered bond <inline font-style="italic">fide,</inline> in the form of an unwritten composition.

                    <para>I hold that the practice followed to-night by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is undoubtedly " repugnant to the true theory of debate." Indeed, it is not debate at all, but simply the reading of a Bill for a very apparent purpose. The honorable senator is not reading extracts, but deliberately reading a Bill through for the purpose, as must be quite evident to the blindest, of hanging up the business of the Chamber. </para>

I do not know, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> whether you were in the chair at the time, but I remember that during a session <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> read a speech from the table, and when he was asked whose words he was quoting he replied, "I  am  quoting my own." The honorable senator for two hours read a typewritten document, from which he  did  not lift his eyes, and neither <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> nor <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie raised a point of order. Now, however, because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is taking what perhaps might be termed an unusual course, honorable senators opposite try to have him " gagged." It is remarkable that, although you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> will be the adjudicator on the point of  order, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie has taken upon himself other duties in addition to those of Government Whip, and, constituting himself both judge and jury, has declared <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> guilty. As to the procedure adopted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> there is a very old saying that desperate cases require desperate remedies; and I believe that we have now  a  desperate case that requires a desperate remedy. I dare say it is because of the nearness of the date of  a  certain election that the Government have determined to ask the Senate to suspend the Standing Orders to allow this Bill to go through all its stages without delay. This is not the first time the Government have asked for the suspension of the Standing Orders for such a purpose. </para>

                            <para>-  Only a portion of it. I was listening to it so that, as a senator, I might gain some knowledge of what it contains, and I am surprised that a point of order should be raised to prevent me becoming more informed in that regard. It is quite true that, in our correspondence, and in other ways, this Bill may have been circulated, but that is in the individual sense; in any case, that was the Bill as it went to the House of Representatives, and not the Bill as it left that House. Before the motion to suspend the Standing Orders was submitted, every senator should have been supplied with a copy of the Bill as amended in the House of Representatives, and on that ground I regard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> as quite correct in the course he has taken. I wonder why, under all the circumstances, there is so much turbulence on the other side. I venture to say, sir, that when you have heard the case from both points of view, you will, with your judicial knowledge, give a verdict in favour of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline></para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> in taking the point of order, quoted one standing order in reference to " tedious repetition." I fail to see, however, where there can be any " tedious repetition " when the Bill is being read to us for the first time. The honorable senator also spoke of obstruction, but he cannot base that objection on the standing order he quoted, unless he knows what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is going to say. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was proceeding to do what the  Clerk  ought to do, namely, read the Bill a first time. The Bill has not been read a first time, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> contends that it should be, and I submit that under the Standing Orders he is at perfect liberty to read it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, on the telegraphic signal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> has quoted from <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> in reference to the reading of speeches. When I first entered this Parliament I was stopped reading my speeches, though since then we have repeatedly seen- Ministers reading typewritten documents on the introduction of Bills without being called to order; and, therefore, I submit that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is perfectly right in his contention that he may read this Bill. </para>

                            <para>- Order ! No honorable senator may interject while the  President  is giving a ruling. It is quite true that the Standing Orders are emphatic and mandatory that no senator may read his speech. There is nothing in the Standing Orders to prevent any honorable senator making lengthy quotations to illustrate his speech, or buttress his argument; that is quite permissible, and has been done over and over again. It is only permissible to an honorable senator to refresh his memory by referring to an extended note. The point taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was reading his speech. Of course I cannot decide that, not having heard <inline font-weight="bold">.Senator Gardiner</inline> during the time I was being relieved by my deputy; but since I resumed the chair I have been waiting to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> connect the extracts from the Bill with the motion, and I intended to ask him to explain to me and to the Senate why he was making these extended quotations. I hope that before he proceeds much further in this direction he will do so. I rule that, so far, he has been in order; but I shall expect him .to show the relevance of his quotations to his argument that the Standing Orders should not be suspended. Again, I want to point out, with regard to the question of tedious repetition, that in one respect <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has been guilty, because to each 'clause there is a marginal note giving a <inline font-style="italic">precis</inline> of the clause. This is intended for reference by the  Chairman  of Committees, and to obviate reading the whole clause. I shall ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> to refrain from reading the marginal notes, because it is somewhat needless repetition ; otherwise I rule that the honorable senator is quite in order. </para>

I might easily have been accused of this if I read a clause of the Bill ,and then commented upon it; but I wish to expedite the business of the Senate. I merely want honorable senators to know what Bill it is in respect of which they have been asked to suspend the iS banding Orders. Therefore I have not been making comments on clauses that are .quite clear. I think honorable senators have appreciated this fact. My one desire is that, before honorable senators .give their Vote, they may know what it is they have been asked to vote for. Clause 51 reads - </para>

All my efforts are in the : direction of observing the Standing' Orders." My desire is to accelerate the business of the Senate, and to see that our Standing Orders, which are made for our guidance,, and, shall I say, the protection of minorities against the impatience of the Minister or a Ministerial follower, are not misused. It is the duty of any member of this Senate to take all reasonable and  legitimate means provided by the Standing Orders to let the public know how business is being conducted here. At 10 o'clock last night this Bill was introduced, and I challenge any honorable senator to say that he was aware of its provisions. I have read the measure as it was introduced in the other House, because it was my duty to do so; but I am not aware whether or not the other House made any alterations in it. </para>

                            <para>- If it is in the existing law, and if any honorable senator can show that the principle is bad, there can be no objection to drawing attention to it before the Standing Orders are suspended. Let us imagine the case of a miner working, say, 10 or 12 miles from his subdivision. It is possible, under this clause, for any person to lodge an objection against his name being on the roll on the payment of a deposit of 5s., and if the person who lodged the objection fails to substantiate it the deposit money is forfeited to the King, and not to the individual who may have been put to all the expense of defending his position. It is possible that some .organizer of a party may, under this provision, harass and inconvenience voters, and rob them of their right to vote. This will apply to all parties, and yet we are asked to suspend the Standing Orders, to alter the normal procedure of the Senate, in order to expedite the passage of this Bill. </para>

                    <para class="block">I call attention to the last phrase. If half-a-dozen different magistrates were asked to give a decision on it, the chances are that we would get four or five different interpretations. One might say it meant the last four weeks, another that it meant a calendar month. If I went into an electorate on the 20th July, and lived there until the 28th August, and then applied to enroll, the electoral officer might say, "You cannot be enrolled, because the month last past was July. You must wait until the end of August." Under ordinary conditions that would be no hardship, but what if the writ was issued on the 29th July ? I have a strong objection to putting into a Bill phrases which are not the ordinary coin of the realm so far as language is concerned. We have seen too many quibbling straw-splitting appeals made because of legislation passed in this way. I have noticed this peculiar phrase several times while reading the Bill, but have discovered no definition of it. If there is none, the Minister should certainly bring one down, especially if he intends to persist with his motion to suspend the Standing Orders, instead of allowing us to deal deliberatively with the measure as men trying to do their duty by putting the electoral law beyond the possibility of litigious disputes. </para>

                    <para class="block">That clause shows me that I was wrong a little while back in saying that a person objected to would have to go into Court to prove his case. I made that mistake because I did not know what the Bill contained. That is an illustration of the danger of passing Acts of Parliament in panic fashion. The country has managed to struggle along under the old Act for seventeen years. That old Act has sent to this Parliament the honorable senators whom; I see taking such an intelligent interest in the debate, particularly Senators Reid, Fairbairn, Lynch, Bakhap, and Russell. When I see their present recumbent attitude, and know that they are determined to force this new law through by suspending the Standing Orders,- I ask if any one thinks the new law will send into this Chamber men more fitted for their legislative duties than they are? Do tbev think the system which they are going to alter has failed because* it sent them- here ? Do they think it will send a better type of men here? </para>
                    <para class="block">I doubt it, because past experience shows that whenever a Reform Bill has passed through Parliament the result, in nine cases out of ten, has been the very opposite to that expected by the governing party which passed it. </para>
                    <para>After the few minutes which I have been speaking,- and the little longer time I have been reading, the Bill, I find honorable senators opposite tired aud anxious to suppress me by putting me to the physical strain of reading whilst standing on my feet, and by taking points of order. Contrast this impatient Senate, anxious to get the Bill through, with the Parliament that passed the Reform Bill of 1830, 1831, and 1832. Think of the tremendous struggles of that great Democracy from which our forefathers came ! Yet that Reform Bill nearly brought disaster to the people of Great Britain. I knew one venerable old man who, then a boy of fifteen, pinned the badge of reform in his coat, and swore that it should remain there until the rotten boroughs were wiped out of existence. Thousands of others pinned that badge to their coats also. Remember the tremendous convulsions which occurred at the birth of that young Democracy in those days. Up to that time the Government of Great Britain had been the Government of the power holding classes. The voice not only of the masses, but of the great middle classes, had not been articulate until these resolute, brave-hearted men determined that Democracy should at least be heard in the Parliament of the country. In this Parliament we now have the spectacle of a Government so eager to rush their legislation through that they will not listen to the voice of reason, or harken to any appeal for time to deliberate on a measure of this magnitude. They want the measure, as settled in Caucus by the National party, passed without debate in either House. They want us bound, gagged, and tied, and will not permit us even to voice our opposition to any parts of the Bill that we consider objectionable. In the days of the Reform Bill of 1830, men were determined to fight for a better franchise. We know what they dared, and what they did, and we know the great benefits the nation derived from their action. There was a Russell in those days whose name will live in history. He was not sleeping on the cushioned benches when reform was in the air. He defied his class, and fought for the Democracy against the Aristocracy of Great Britain. He was not a. soft, smooth, ease-loving, cushion haunting Russell, who, when an attempt is made to take from the .people and from Parliament those liberties to which a Democracy is entitled, snugly snores on cushioned seats while a Government, lost to all sense of responsibility to the people, a Government without any capacity to measure the work they are doing, endeavours in a high-handed manner to stifle the voice of Parliament by suspending the very Standing Orders which give us the right to speak here. </para>

                    <para class="block">Have honorable senators considered the enormous powers which it is proposed  to place in the hands of an officer or a clerk? If we had ample time to consider this measure we might discover ,that there were just grounds for the proposed change from ordinary Courts of justice to special Courts to be created on the mere whim of a Minister. Ministers, after all, are only human, and in this case they display a remarkable anxiety to rush the measure through. Is it to be said that their object is to apply it to an approaching by-election for the House of Representatives? If the Standing Orders be suspended we shall not have the intervals that usually take place between the consideration of a Bill in its several stages. The motion for the first reading is formal; and not open to discussion. As a rule, between the first and second reading of a Bill we are given time to read it and to grasp its effect; but if we suspend the Standing Orders the several stages of this Bill may be dealt with in the one sitting. No serious objection is taken to the suspension of the Standing Orders to enable a Supply Bill or any measure of urgency to be passed through all its stages without delay. This measure, however, demands our deliberate judgment, and we should devote to it our best intellectual efforts, since it is a codification of all our electoral legislation. In these circumstances, surely it is reasonable to ask the Ministry not to use its majority to compel us to relinquish our right to claim that we are members of a deliberative assembly. </para>
                    <para>This measure transcends all others in importance. Our electoral law is the bedrock upon which our Democracy must rest. If the foundation be not well and truly laid we cannot expect the Democracy of Australia, through its elected representatives to erect an edifice in which their liberties will be preserved in a way worthy of the rights we have inherited. That is one reason why I object to the attempt of the Ministry to compel us to deal with the measure as if it were of uo importance. If the Standing Orders be not suspended, we shall have time to carefully study it, and so to avoid the making of any mistake. The Senate makes few mistakes; but an error in a Bill providing the basis of election to this Parliament would be far more material than a mistake made in any ordinary piece of legislation. </para>
                    <para>I propose later on to point to a remarkable provision in this Bill, but at the moment I cannot lay my hands on it. If it be carried at it stands, then an elector, on entering a polling booth, may be called  upon  to vote for six candidates for a House of Representatives division by marking the ballot-paper " 1," '2," "3," "4," "5," and " 6" in the order of his preference, while in the event of six candidates standing for the representation of any one State in the Senate, he will merely have to put a cross opposite the  names  of three candidates. In the excitement attaching to an election^ a voter might confuse his ballot-papers, and put a cross opposite three names on the ballot-paper for the House of Representatives division, while in the case of the Senate ballot-paper he might proceed to 3et out the order of his preference. If he discovered his mistake before he had deposited his ballot-papers in the ballot-box, and attempted to  correct  it by substituting crosses for the figures .in the ca3e of the Senate ballot-paper, that  ballot-paper  would be declared informal under this provision, since it would have more than one mark upon it. Should we not adopt a system which is not likely to cause any confusion in the minds of the electors? Why should we rush this Bill through? Owing to the rushing tactics adopted by the Government, .1 have not had time to carefully go through it, and I am therefore compelled to read it almost line by line in order to prove the statement 1 have just made. </para>
                    <para>Since the inception of this Parliament the electors of Corangamite, at every Federal election, have had to place a cross opposite the name of the candidate for whom they wished to vote, but on this occasion, if this Bill is applied to the by-election for that constituency, their ballot-papers will be informal if they mark them in that way. They will not have had an opportunity to read this measure, and so to make themselves familiar with the rigid and drastic changes for which it provides in the method of voting, and the suspension of the Standing Orders so as to permit the Bill to be rushed through will not give us time to acquaint them of those changes. </para>
                    <para>As the result of the disaster which befell the National party in the recent byelection for Swan, where their candidate was 'only third on the list, the Government are anxious to bring this measure into operation at once, so that they may not have the same bitter experience at Corangamite. They wish to save their party from a repetition of the humiliating experience which befell them in connexion with the Swan by-election. Western Australia has always been held up as the State which stood out from all others in its anxiety to win the war. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> will bear me out in that statement. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad to have the honorable senator's approval. After being in office for eighteen months, this Government, which was returned to power to help to win the war, has met with a humiliating experience in a Western Australian constituency, the electors of which never swerved in their loyalty to the late Lord Forrest, who was a member of the Nationalist party. At the first opportunity given to the people in the premier win-the. war State in Australia their verdict was that, amongst the candidates offering, the candidate of the Labour party had their first preference, the candidate of the Country party their second preference, and the candidate of the Win-the-war party their third preference. </para>

                            <para>- The Nationalist candidate did not get 6",000 votes, and if he had secured all the votes not recorded at the election he would still have been in the position he occupied at the close of the poll. As over 19,000 votes were recorded at the election, there could not have been many left to be recorded, and the Nationalist candidate would have required a good many thousand votes more than he polled before he could claim to be a representative of the majority of the electors of Swan. That electorate since the establishment of Federation had proved loyal to the Conservative and reactionary for(ms. Time after time it returned a member in whom the electors had trust and confidence, and for whom they voted possibly because of his personal qualities, and notwithstanding his political principles. But now, because the  Government  have wakened up to find that in that premier Conservative constituency of the premier win-the-war State, their candidate was only third on the poll, a new Electoral Act is to be brought into existence to make conditions better for the Nationalist candidate in Corangamite. If the prohibitionist candidate had not stood for the electorate of Swan, the Nationalist candidate would have occupied the unenviable position of last on the poll in the premier National constituency of the premier win-the-war State of Australia. That is a serious thing for honorable senators opposite to contemplate, and I can quite understand that the Government and their followers should be very much concerned about it. The Government have been suddenly awakened by a peremptory order from the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> office to get a move on, and not to permit the same thing to happen in Victoria that happened in Western Australia. I am not surprised at the defeat of the Government in Western Australia, because a discredited Government must sooner or later experience the just anger of the electors. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> is not very afraid, because it will be some time before he has to meet them, unless both Houses have to go before the country, as they did in 1914. The honorable senator may find that the very measure which he will not allow Parliament an opportunity to discuss may cause him to lose the position which he holds with so much distinction and credit to the Win-the-war party. The honorable senator has the distinction of securing his present position by the sacrifice of every principle he ever had. He has the distinction of holding that position by becoming the most bitter opponent of the old comrades with whom he was associated for years. He has the distinction of using his position in such a way as to try to discredit his opponents, with the result that he only discredits himself. He may live to regret his action in endeavouring to hurry on to the statute-book a measure which will give a majority the opportunity of deciding  whether he has  been  right or wrong. </para>

If we should provide that no member of another place shall be elected by a minority vote, and the principle is so essential that the Standing Orders must be 'suspended to secure it, surely it is equally applicable to the Senate.

                            <para>- And rightly so. The Senate is elected by the States, and fitly represents the States. The framers of the Constitution, decided that the smaller States should have equal representation with the larger State.3, and the people of Australia indorsed that principle. The people of the larger States were sufficiently generous to say, " We will give the smaller States equal representation with us in the Senate, in order that they may not be afraid that the majorities in the more populous States will do any injustice to the people of the less populous States. </para>

                            <para>- I thoroughly agree with the honorable senator. I know the suspicion, distrust, and fear of consequences in the minds of the people of the smaller States would have made Federation absolutely impossible if that concession to them had not been made. But I venture to say that seventeen years of Federation have removed such feeling from the minds of all thinking people in all the States. There was suspicion in the minds of the people of the larger States, as well as of the smaller States. I can remember that I frequently voiced the objection to New South Wales, with five or six times the voting power of Tasmania, having only an equal vote in the Senate. Seventeen years of  Federation  have removed those doubts and suspicions from the minds of all classes of electors in all the States. During the last seventeen years Federation has justified itself, and the people are to-day willing to be governed by Australians, no matter in what part of the Commonwealth they may live. They do not now contend that State boundaries and geographical lines should necessarily be taken into consideration in determining  the representation of the people in this Parliament. This Bill may not make any alteration in this  respect;  but I have not yet had time to read it, and I am, therefore, anxious that the Standing Orders should not be suspended to hurry it through. </para>

                    <para>I have not had time to compare that provision with the existing Act, to  see  whether there is not a departure proposed from the principle of the representation of the States; but I am inclined to think that, under the existing law, the issue of the writs and the return thereof is a matter purely for the State Governors. If a sudden change in this respect is introduced, we are entitled to some explanation from the Minister in charge of the Bill. The suspension of the Standing Orders will prevent honorable senators having the opportunity to circumspectly and microscopically consider the provisions of this measure which affects the representation of the people in the Senate and in another place. I wish I could fan into a blaze some spark of independence prevailing in the minds of honorable senators opposite, which has been wet-blanketed by their slavish adherence to party. They were not elected upon any principle of reform of the electoral laws, or to change the whole basis of representation in this country, but for the one purpose of winning the war. It was not political principles which gave honorable senators opposite their majority at the last election. It was by the very sacrifice of political principles that they secured their present position. It was by such a huge sacrifice as we witnessed when a Tory . and Conservative like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton,</inline> without one democratic idea in his mind, ran in conjunction with such a democratic candidate of the days gone by as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Plain.</inline> In South Australia we had a most Conservative and aristocratic candidate like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rowell-</inline></para>

                            <para>- We do not know what the Bill provides in this respect, and for that reason I am going through the clauses as carefully as possible, in order to see that the rights of the people aru not infringed. I was pointing out that the system of voting for the House of Representatives will be different from that for the Senate; and, if this Bill passes without that full and free discussion which the Standing Orders are designed to insure, we may find Senators Bolton, Fairbairn, and Plain going out again for election, not to win the war, but to win seats or something else. I take it that when an elector enters the booth under the provisions of this Bill he will be given a Senate ballot-paper on which he will have to place a cross opposite the names of the candidates he favours, and in the same booth, perhaps with the same number of candidates as for the Senate, he will be asked to place preferential numbers against the names of the candidates for the House of Representatives. I dare say that under the proposed new system there may be more candidates for the House of Representatives than for the Senate, because every one will feel assured that if he does not get the first preference he will have a good chance of getting the second. The power of the party machines in the selection of candidates will be very much interfered with, if not gone altogether. </para>

                            <para>- It is questionable ; the machine sent both the honorable senator and myself here, and I dare say we are both satisfied with the result". I am not sure whether the dangers that I am anticipating are in the Bill, and, therefore, I am compelled to read the measure in order to find out. I have not had time to compare the Bill with the principal Act so as to ascertain what are the provisions in regard to the issue of the writ for the selection of senators. I am of opinion that the issue of the writ should be a matter for the Governor of a State, and if it is to be one for the Returning Officer, it is a great inroad on State powers. </para>

For seventeen years those electors have voted by marking a cross, and yet, with the writ issued to-day, the nomination on the 28th November, and polling on Saturday, 14th December, they are to be asked to make this great change in the system, although thousands will never hear of this discussion in the Senate. </para>

                            <para>- I think the Minister is making a mistake to the extent of some ten days. However, I do not so much complain of that as of the fact that in this one particular electorate a system of voting is to be forced on the people of which they have heard nothing and know nothing. It may be asked what these remarks have to do with the motion to suspend the Standing Orders, but if the Standing Orders are suspended, the Bill may be rushed through all its stages without those intervals which are a safeguard and an assurance of proper discussion. Just imagine going through the second reading and the Committee stage of a Bill of this size and importance at one sitting! </para>

If the Government will give me an assurance that they will put in the Bill a special clause to say that where, as in the case of Corangamite, only one candidate is required, a voter's ballot-paper will not be declared informal if the intention of the voter is clear, I will offer no further objection to the suspension of the Standing Orders. </para>

                            <para>- Not at all. This only emphasizes the danger of passing a measure without careful consideration, for the simple reason that the Bill provides only for preferential voting for the House of Representatives, and if there were seven candidates, as there may be for Corangamite, and one voter marked his paper with first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth preferences, but omitted the seventh, his ballot-paper would be declared informal. </para>

                    <para>Another reason why we should object to the suspension of the Standing Orders is that the Minister himself may have an opportunity of reading the Bill. In the original copy presented to the other House there was provision that if  the  full preference was not exhausted a ballot-paper would be declared informal. This is a serious matter, and from the statement made by the Minister it is obvious that it should be discussed at considerable length. Even if the press will not report these changes in our electoral system, we might, perhaps, be able to circulate the records of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> among the electors, so that they may know how far-reaching and drastic have been the alterations under which electors must return members to Parliament, and how an unscrupulous and reckless Government have shown an utter disregard for the electors themselves by determining to get this Bill through Parliament in this way after the issue of the writ. The Minister, when I asked that provision should, be made against declaring a ballot-paper informal where the intention of the voter was clear, said, in his innocent way, that the provision was already in the Act. But it is not there. </para>

But there is a doubt about the marking of the ballot-paper under the preferential system, and, therefore, the Bill should be dealt with carefully, so that these things may be made plain. </para>

                            <para>- Why should we tie ourselves down in this hard and fast manner and really subsidize the newspapers? It appears that for years we have simply been following, step by step, the draftsmanship of the first Act, and have been inventing nothing for ourselves. This is a big Bill. It furnishes to men like myself, who have had long experience in parliamentary life, an opportunity of giving other members of the Senate the benefit of some of the knowledge collected during all those years. Yet, when the time comes, we find the Minister wishes to suspend the Standing Orders in order to rush the Bill through without delay. </para>

We now have a splendid opportunity. We could devote practically months to the consideration of this Bill, and the country would profit by our deliberations. Instead of that, this measure, which is supposed to be non-party, is to be rushed through the Senate by the will of one party. What has been happening in the last eighteen months that we did not have an opportunity of dealing with this Bill then? If it is urgent, then by their failure to introduce it earlier the Government stand convicted of being negligent of the interests of the country. But even without the suspension of the Standing Orders the passage of the Bill could be expedited, if any honorable senator on the other side cared to move " That the question be now put." I have no hesitation in saying that no member of the Senate has read the Bill from cover to cover since it has passed the other House. I believe that during the last few hours I have read more of the measure than has any other honorable senator. </para>

                    <para class="block">We should distinctly define all the conditions, instead of leaving it to the Returning Officers to say what is satisfactory and what is not; but the motion leaves the Government open to the suspicion that they do not care what happens so long as they get the Bill through. There may be a number of different decisions by different Returning Officers, and, instead of having a uniform electoral law, we may have a mongrel system. Ordinarily, any honorable senator has the right at different periods of a Bill to point out its defects. Surely we are entitled to that opportunity on this measure. The Government are forgetting their dignity and what is due to the Senate by moving that the Standing Orders, which represent the wisdom of Committee after Committee of the Senate, shall not apply to so all-important a measure. The system of preferential voting ought not to be suddenly forced on the electors of Corangamite. If it is applied, there are sure to be five or six candidates, and party lines and party pre-selections will, to some extent, pass away. The electors who have always marked their ballot-papers with a cross will be called upon, on the 14th December, to mark their preferences by means of numbers. If a man marks his preference against the names of five candidates, and fails to mark the sixth, his vote will be declared informal, although his intention is perfectly clear. If is scarcely a month to the election, and it will be impossible to fully inform the people of Corangamite as to the new law under which they are to vote. One of the purposes of the debate which the Standing Orders provide for is to let the electors know what is taking place. There is no provision to accept as formal a ballot-paper where the intention of the elector is made clear by the preference he has marked in . regard to the first three candidates.

After the first reading was passed, the Minister might well have agreed to move the second reading on the following day. An intelligent debate on the principles of the measure could have followed, as we would then, have been given an opportunity to read the measure through, and digest it.

In Tasmania, proportional representation, or some system approximating to it, is in vogue. Having worked under that system, Tasmanians are perfectly familiar with it, and there is no just reason why the Senate should not have the benefit of the experience of Tasmania's representatives with regard to it. If the discussion is continued under the Standing Orders, we shall obtain it; but if the Standing Orders be suspended there will be devoted to the consideration of this Bill only such scanty time as Ministers may be prepared to allow. I shall be able, at all events, to point out later on that I made an effort to prevent the Bill being carried through the Senate without honorable senators being afforded a reasonable opportunity to gain some knowledge of its provisions.

                    <para class="block">Is there any reason why that clause should not be fully discussed? I shall not say that the experience of the National party at the recent by-election for Swan is responsible for the introduction of this Bill, but it certainly is responsible for the anxiety of Ministers to get it through as quickly as possible. Probably the most public-spirited man amongst those who submitted themselves at the Swan by-election - the man who stood, perhaps, for the greatest moral principle - was the prohibition candidate. He had as much right as any other candidate to submit himself, but because he espoused an unpopular cause - a cause in respect of which the people have ,not yet been educated - he secured something like 1,000 votes, whereas the successful candidate polled about 7,000 votes. The result is that he will forfeit hi3 deposit. In other words, we are going to fine him £25. Surely such a provision needs to be" reasonably discussed. It is iniquitous to impose such a penalty upon a man merely because he espouses an unpopular cause. What the majority rejects to-day is often granted with acclamation tomorrow. That is the history of development, and the prohibitionist candidate for Swan, unless he is a very old man, may live to see the principle for which he fought accepted by the people of Australia. I should like an opportunity to make a vigorous protest against the continuance of this iniquitous provision. There is ample time before the 14th December, the date of the by-election for Corangamite, to discuss the Bill without suspending the 'Standing Orders. I should be prepared, if necessary, to sit every day in the week if the Minister in charge of the Bill .would agree to deal with it in easy stages. Clause 76 involves a big question of principle, it practically applies a property qualification, since it provides that a man who cannot lodge a deposit of £25 shall not be allowed to become a candidate. Some people will say that a man who has not behind him a party that is prepared to supply him .with such a deposit should not be a candidate. But why should a man be dependent upon any party? If we had ample time I am sure we should be able to adduce good arguments in opposition to this clause, which goes on further to provide as follows : - </para>

                            <para>- I made the request in the interests of honorable senators opposite, but the Minister remains inexorable. He insists upon the Standing Orders being suspended so that the Bill may be rushed through. I would point out to him that this clause does not apply equally to both Houses, a3 it should do. Later on there will be cause to complain if we neglect our present opportunity to provide for a uniform system of election to both Houses. With the preferential system of voting we are likely to have more than one candidate standing in the interests of each party. The old system of one candidate for each party will pass away, because with preferential voting it would be impossible to accuse a man of splitting the vote of his party by submitting himself for election. Very often the approved candidate of a party machine will ,not secure a majority of the votes polled. I fail to understand why we should provide for a penalty of £25 being paid by a candidate who does not secure one-fifth of the number of the first preference votes polled by the successful candidate. If the Government are anxious to collect £25 from a man seeking election, they should look to the successful candidate as being best able to pay it. The proposal to inflict this penalty upon unsuccessful candidates is certainly most harsh. </para>

                    <para class="block">Suppose there are three vacancies for the Senate and four candidates are nominated. If after their nomination two of the candidates die, that would be a partial return, and the two candidates who had fulfilled every provision necessary for their legal nomination, and who might have expended the full limit of expenditure allowed by the law to secure their election, would have to go through the whole business again. I venture to say that, in such a case, to penalize candidates who were legally nominated would be un-' fair. It may be said that I am suggesting an exceptional case; but it is not very improbable, and we should make provision for it. </para>
                    <para>I shall now leave that part of the Bill and refer honorable senators to Part XII., dealing with voting by post. The Labour party can take credit for having first introduced the system of voting by post. Our idea was to make voting as convenient as practicable; but we were driven by the corrupt methods adopted in using the postal vote to repeal it, so far as its general application was concerned. I have not had time to see the extent of its application under this Bill, but if I may judge from some comments on the subject in another place, there were two complaints made concerning it by different sets of individuals. One complained that the postal vote provided for by the Bill does not go far enough, and the other that it goes too far. Although the law was carefully administered by our electoral officers, my experience of the postal vote was most unsatisfactory. I was in hearty accord with it and yet found myself, after some years of experience of its operation, reluctantly compelled to vote for its repeal. This Bill proposes to reinstate a system which Parliament, after practical experience of it, decided to wipe out. "We should not hurry it through now by suspending the Standing Orders when the advocates of the system have been thoroughly satisfied that its manipulation led to such corrupt practices that it was -necessary to repeal it. I agree that Parliament has a perfect right to change its mind, but when a grave change of this nature is proposed, it should be fully debated, and the Standing Orders should not be suspended to give effect to it hastily. </para>
                    <para>This is a Bill which should be discussed,, not only for day?, but for weeks. It contains over 200 clauses and about fifty distinct principles, and yet the Minister desires that it should be put through this week. Honorable senators have in the different States had experience of varying electoral provisions, and have accumulated information on the details of voting. Queensland has a system of compulsory voting in force which has not yet been tried in any other State, whilst the electors of that State have had experience of several elections under the system. I am quite in doubt as to the benefits or effects of it. I have a natural objection to compulsion, and I have still grave doubts as to whether even compulsory enrolment is wise. </para>
                    <para>I have no doubt at all that the provision under which an elector who changes his address from one subdivision of an electorate to another is liable to a fine unless he notifies the change of address to the Returning Officer is often the cause of very grave injustice. There might be some justification for penalizing an elector who removes from one division to another without notifying the Returning Officer, but there is no justification for fining an elector who moves from one subdivision to another of the same division. Some electoral officers administer this provision in accordance with the strict letter of the law, whilst in some divisions there is scarcely ever a ease in which a penalty is inflicted under it. I think that we should have an opportunity of saying all that we desire to say about such a provision at every stage of this Bill, but once the Standing Orders are suspended we are subject to the caprice of the Minister in charge of the measure. I recognise the responsibility of party men, and I know that it is only upon matters of very considerable importance that members of Parliament will vote against their party leaders, especially when the Government are anxious that their business should be hurried through. Can any claim be honestly put forward for the urgent passing of this Bill? </para>

                            <para>- No, because the Corangamite election will not take place until the 14th December. There is no reason why the Minister should not make his second-reading speech on the Bill now, and grant an adjournment of the debate until next Monday. If he is willing to give time to honorable senators to read the Bill and reasonable time for its discussion, there will be no attempt by ' honorable senators on this side to unduly prolong debate upon it. As the date fixed for the Corangamite election is the 14th December, why should this Bill be hurried through before the 20th or 30th November? There is no reason why a second-reading speech on this Bill should be attempted by the Minister at this hour of the morning. I venture to say that he could not do justice to the provisions of this Bill in a speech of less than three or four hours. If he commenced the second-reading speech at half-past 4, he might conclude at half-past 8 a.m. He might allow an adjournment then until 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and we might continue the discussion of the measure until the time agreed upon for adjourning in the evening. My fear is that unless the Minister intended to rush the Bill through he would not bother about suspending the Standing Orders. He cannot say that he expected any undue opposition from this side or any undue delay in the passing of the measure. With the hopeless minority of the party on this side it would be absurd to suggest that we might delay the passing of the measure until 14th December. The reason why I have made a somewhat prolonged address on the motion now before the Chair is that I desire to emphasize my strong opposition to the suspension of the Standing Orders after the first reading in order to expedite the passage of a measure of this character. It is only the urgency of a measure that can justify the Government in asking for a suspension of the Standing Orders in dealing with it or can justify their supporters in voting for such a motion. </para>

                    <para>There is not one honorable senator opposite who is not in his heart at variance with the Minister on this question, but I expect that honorable senators will give a party vote upon the motion. I do not think I have ever complained of that, because I realize that loyalty to party is essential under the highly organized system of ' party government we have at the present time. I have never wittingly done anything to make political capital out of that loyalty. As a member of a Government for a time, I found that nothing made the government of the country so difficult as the free-lance who could not be depended on whenever the Government required his services. Whilst I recognise that party loyalty is essential for the successful conduct of party government, I realize at the same time that Governments owe a duty to their supporters. Surely it is one of the chief responsibilities of a Government that they shall not put their supporters into the unenviable position of having, for party reasons, to do unnecessary things, to their own discredit, to the discredit of the party to which they belong, and of the Senate. </para>
                    <para> I have discussed this Bill, and I hope that senators opposite will discuss it at equal length, realizing, as they must, that this is an opportunity to show the Government that their supporters should not be expected to do unreasonable things. It ought to be made quite clear by the Government that there is real urgency and  real need for the exceptional steps now proposed in regard to what is the most important measure we have had to consider. </para>

                    <para class="block">I am not able to show the difference between this clause and the provision in the principal Act, and it is quite possible that there is no difference or change. I can only repeat the complaint that the motion before us will, if carried, deprive us of that interval of rest and quiet in which we could make ourselves familiar with the measure, and thus really save time in the discussion. It is quite clear that candidates should not be authorized witnesses, but when we find it provided that all justices of the peace are eligible, we might as well include all those who are not justices of the pence. </para>

                            <para>- I thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> and will get back to the reasons, one of the chief of which is that the Bill is very far-reaching, and that the suspension of the Standing Orders, if agreed to, would deprive us of the opportunity of learning what is . really in it. If the suspension of the Standing Orders meant that. the rights which those Standing Orders give us would be in charge of the  President,  I should not have made any protest, certainly not at what may seem undue length; but if the Standing Orders are suspended, it means that we shall have to appeal to the Minister, and not to the  President.  It may be said that even if the Standing Orders are suspended, the Government majority may be trusted not to force the measure through with undue speed ; but if there is that good intention, why do honorable senators opposite publicly advertise the fact that they wish to force the measure through? Why should they exhibit the Senate in the light of factious scheming for some petty advantage? There is no need for the motion, and if it be not carried, I venture to say that the Bill will be put through at whatever minute the Minister desires. The Standing Orders give the Minister all the powers that are necessary to have the Bill passed when he chooses. If there were any doubt as to this, there might be some justification for the novel procedure on the part of the Government in regard to so important a Bill. I defy the Minister, when replying, to cite one instance in the history of the Commonwealth Parliament when the suspension of the Standing Orders has been moved immediately on the introduction of a measure of the kind. To me it seems unthinkable that the Government should attempt such  a thing, and have sufficient supporters behind them to see it accomplished. </para>

As the Bill must go through Committee, every honorable senator must have the opportunity to discuss it clause by clause, as it can be put in no other way. The honorable senator has, therefore, given no good reason for reading the whole Bill on the motion now before the Chair, to which he cannot hold that his remarks are entirely relevant. The Standing Orders which will not be suspended will provide ample opportunity for the honorable senator to bring each clause under notice. </para>

                            <para>- I have had no more and no less latitude than the Standing Orders provide for me. I should be reflecting on you, sir, if I claimed otherwise. The length at which I have read the clauses line by line must not only be wearying to yourself and other honorable senators, but it is still more wearying to me. Accepting the hint, you have so kindly thrown out, I wish to make it quite clear why I have deliberately made such a lengthened protest against this procedure. My protest is called for by the fact that the Government have introduced absolutely a new procedure. It is novel, and contrary to the spirit of the Standing Orders to ask for their suspension, unless urgency can be proved. The Corangamite election cannot be claimed as a matter of urgency, and the Government have not attempted to show where the urgency lies. The Minister who introduced this novel, extreme, far-reaching, and unparalleled innovation upon bur customs and procedure did not condescend to explain the reason for such extreme haste. If only the advantage that the Government think they will get at the Corangamite election was involved, I should never have put on honorable senators the strain of keeping them up all night ; but I have always seen more in the Standing Orders than mere party advantage. I have never, in this House or in the New South Wales Parliament, heard it suggested that the Standing Orders should °be suspended unless there were good and sufficient reasons for that course. We must not allow practices to creep in unchecked that will take from us those rights which we have held for so long,  and  the time to protest is when the attempt is made. It is absolutely a new procedure to ask for the suspension of the Standing Orders without showing urgency. </para>

I suppose it is of no use to ask the Minister to allow us those two extra days. Evidently he will not agree to it.  His  attitude with regard to the Bill has been altogether unreasonable, and has driven me to the extreme measures that I have taken. Through my action in reading so many of the clauses, honorable senators have now a much greater knowledge of the far-reaching importance of the Bill than they had when the Minister moved this motion, so that they will be able to vote with a clear understanding against the suspension of the Standing Orders. No reasonable member of the Senate will support the Government in this innovation. I have at least enabled honorable senators to realize the importance of this measure, and since I do not desire to prolong the debate one moment longer than is necessary, I shall make way for others who desire to exercise their rights. Before doing so, I wish again to ask the Minister in charge of the Bill to give us his assurance that between the first reading and the second reading of the Bill we shall have the opportunity which the Standing Orders provides for its consideration, and that between the report stage and the third reading &gt;of the Bill we shall also have the usual interval. If he will give me that assurance, I shall promise that the debate on the motion for the second reading, and also in Committee, will not be unduly prolonged. The Minister makes no response to my request. He is content to wield his strength in his own peculiar obstinate way. He is intolerant of the comfort, convenience, and rights of those who are opposed to him, and has no regard for the contempt into which the Senate may be dragged by reason of his action. If he were in Opposition he would forcibly protest against the very procedure that he asks u3 this morning to adopt. The whole of the Ministerial supporters are at heart opposed to this proposition, but  he is forcing a reluctant following to support him in this outrage upon the Standing Orders. </para>
                        <para>This Bill is divided into eighteen parts, and it is reasonable to assume that the motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders has been submitted to enable it to be applied to the coming by-election for Corangamite. The result will be that we shall have one member of the Parliament returned under an Act entirely different from that under which the remaining members were elected. That alone should be sufficient to induce the Minister to stay his hand. It may be said that the people are tired of a system under which it is possible for a man to be returned on a minority vote. It may be said that the successful candidate at the by-election for Swan represents only a minority of the voters, and that it is undesirable that we should have a recurrence of that experience in connexion with the forthcoming by-election for Corangamite. The application of this Bill to the byelection for Corangamite will mean that the successful candidate will be returned under conditions entirely different from those which operated in connexion with the recent by-election in Western Australia. For the last thirty years it has been the practice of the British Parliament to appeal to the new constituencies as soon as possible after the passing of a new Electoral Bill, so that the whole Parliament should be elected on the basis of uniform legislation. That is a very wise provision. We should hasten slowly in changing from one system to another. Bound as it is by a rigid and written Constitution, this Parliament occupies a position entirely different from that of the United Kingdom. We find it difficult to try to give effect to many desirable principles which we should like to have embodied in a measure of this kind. The Government would be well advised in withholding the passing of this legislation until the Constitution is so amended as to give us fuller and ampler powers to deal with the matters covered by the Bill. The Minister, however, makes no response to my appeal. T am not at liberty to refer to what' happened recently in another place, but the experience of the supporters of the Government in the House of Representatives - an experience quite fresh in our minds - offers the best reason I can give in support of my plea that the Standing Orders should not be suspended. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad to have that expression of approval from the honorable senator, who has held office as  Chairman  of Committees, and so is familiar with the Standing Orders. I am glad to hear that he considers I have taken up a right attitude. The Government are simply obeying the direction of the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> that this Bill should be pushed through. It was not until the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> had spoken, a little more than a week ago, that the Government began to realize that it was necessary to treat this as an urgent measure. They recognised then that the master's lash was being applied to them, and, as with highly trained horses that are prepared, without the use of the whip, to maintain an even swinging pace along good roads, the sudden application of the undeserved whip caused them to fly off at a tangent. I venture to say I am inclined to resent the readiness of the Government to go on their knees and to say, " Yes, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Leader</inline> Writer of the <inline font-style="italic">Argus;</inline> you are right, and we shall hurry along with the Bill, in order that what happened in Western Australia shall not occur in Victoria." But for the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> article the Senate would not have been asked to rush this Bill through. The struggle for position and power is always going on in politics, and the press is pleased to have in office a Government which will show" absolute readiness to obey its dictates. That is the position of the present Administration and of its supporters. The Argus said, "This Bill must be pushed through," but gave no reason why it should be regarded as urgent. Scared at the figures of the Swan election, and finding that the policy it has dictated to the Government for months past has met with the disapproval of the electors in a quarter in which that disapproval was least expected, the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> now advises the Government that it is necessary to pass a new Electoral Act, in the hope that, by a sudden change from one system of voting to another, which the electors are not to be given time to understand, it will be possible to stave off another defeat. </para>

                    <para>I have dealt at considerable length with the provisions of this measure. I think I have exhausted almost every reasonable argument that could be submitted against the motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders. If I spoke for five or six hours more, I could not make it more clear than I have done already that there is no occasion for this motion.  For  eighteen months since the Government were elected, honorable senators on this side have the record that they have not been responsible for one hour of unnecessary delay in the passing of any measure submitted by the Government. We have permitted the policy of the Government to be given effect as they willed; but, in spite of the generous treatment they have received at our hands, now, when a measure of vital importance to the whole of the electors of the Commonwealth is submitted, we are met with such treatment as the Senate has never previously permitted any Government to inflict upon those opposed to it. I am afraid that a Government so unreasonable as to desire to suspend the Standing Orders in connexion with a measure of this kind must intend to prevent its discussion at other stages. If it were only for the fact that this Bill provides for one system of voting for the House of Representatives, and an entirely different system for the Senate, it should receive the fullest consideration. I am not prepared to give the Government the power they ask for under this motion. I am not sure that I ought not to say that I am not prepared to give <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> this power, because I cannot believe that it is the proposal of the Government as a whole to rush, this measure through all its stages in one day. The Leader of the Government in the Senate is absent, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> intoxicated with the power he is exercising for a brief period, probably desires to show how. splendidly he can keep the team opposite up to their work. He is going to do wonders, and will do in a day what any other leader of the party would take a month to do. I have no doubt that he will accomplish what he desires, but we shall all suffer as a result. I feel sure that honorable senators opposite, against their better judgment and common sense, and the excellent arguments I have submitted, will support the Ministry. I am prepared to sit down now if any of them will undertake to answer the arguments I have brought forward. </para>

                            <para>- I am sorry that the honorable senator is not prepared to express his opinion on the motion for  the suspension of the Standing Orders. When we reach the second-reading stage, we shall have before us for consideration only the principles of the Bill, and the honorable senator may not then have the opportunity which he thinks he will have. We are asked now to consider, not the principles of the Bill, but the unprincipled conduct of the Government, who do not desire to be governed by the Standing Orders. If the Standing Orders are not sufficiently elastic to permit of the reasonable despatch of business, that might be a fair reason for proposing their alteration; but it is not a good reason for their suspension to secure the passing of such a measure . as this in one day. We have a Standing Orders Committee, who could meet to-morrow and propose any amendment of the Standing Orders considered necessary to reasonably expedite the passage of this or any other measure which could not be passed with reasonable despatch under the Standing Orders as they exist at present. That would be the proper procedure to follow if the present Standing Orders are not considered satisfactory. We might abolish all Standing Orders, since that would be quite as reasonable as to suspend the operation of those we have without a just cause. If our existing Standing Orders are not to apply in dealing with a. measure of this kind, to what class of measures should they be applied? Our Standing Orders are the result of the experience of the best intellects of the Senate, and those best qualified to decide the procedure under which institutions of this character should be governed. </para>

                    <para class="block">Honorable senators are asked to carry that motion, and I ask honorable senators opposite  if  they mean to give it effect when it is carried, because, if they do, there will not necessarily be the delay of one interval between the different stages. "When honorable senators who desire to address themselves to this motion have spoken the Minister in charge of the measure will move the second reading of the Bill ; then will follow the Committee stage, then the report stage, and then the third reading, and thus, I suppose, without the .Senate having "risen, the Bill will be passed through all its stages. It may be that what is intended is to have the measure in a satisfactory position for its application to the election which is to take place on the 14th December. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> as Leader of the Government in the Senate, put this contingent notice of motion on the business paper, and now another Minister - I take it without instructions -from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> and without his authority - moves the motion. I recognise that I cannot discuss the ruling on that point, which, I think, is absolutely correct," but I am of the opinion that had <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> been in charge of the business, if we had asked him to give us two days for its full consideration - one at the beginning of the discussion on the Bill and one at the report stage - he' would have been prepared to do so. I do not believe that when he put this contingent motion on the business paper he ever imagined that it would be used by his eoi-- league in the way it is being used on this occasion. I hope that other honorable senators will take my view of the matter, and will keep the discussion going until <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> appears in his place, and is made aware of what his first lieutenant is doing on this occasion. Since he has been Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has on very many occasions moved motions similar to that we are now discussing, but he has never moved such a motion in connexion with a Bill similar to this. I have a very good memory for the legislation' we have been asked to consider, and I do not remember one occasion upon which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has so abused the power which his majority has given him as Leader of the Government in the Senate. However, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> taking advantage of the contingent motion, notice of which was given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> has moved it. I do not know what the motive of the honorable gentleman may have been; perhaps he thought to save time and trouble in considering the measure. If the Standing Orders are suspended, thus leaving no way of securing the rights of the minority, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> will be in such a position that he will not 'be called upon to give any explanation, and the public in turn will be without knowledge of the provisions of the Bill. Once the motion is carried <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> may well claim that he has properly interpreted the feeling of the Senate, and that the desire is to pass the measure through all its stages in one day. I have no doubt that in his hurry the honorable gentleman may deem it quite unnecessary to make a second-reading speech of any length; he will simply tell us that it is an Electoral Bill, -though I do not think he will be candid enough to say that it is a Bill to enable the National party to get a better result at Corangamite than they got at Swan. </para>

On an occasion of  thi3  kind, when I have been called on to deliver an impromptu address on a most important matter, I do not think it would 'be deemed out of order to attempt to concisely recapitulate the points. However, if that be ruled as repetition, I must bow to the ruling. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps those sleeping senators are quite innocent of the injury of the vote they would be called upon to give if I happened to sit down now. However, we have this motion submitted by a tyrannical Minister dressed in a little brief authority; and the responsibility is  that  of the Ministry and not mine. I feel that in taking the course I have to-night I may have run some physical risk, but I should like to continue, and raise my voice, if only to awaken the sleeping senators opposite to some shred of decency, and some spark of a. desire, even if they are a powerful majority, to respect the rights of an alert minority. I venture to say that many of those who will support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> on this occasion will regret it only once, and that is for the term of their natural lives. From habit or indolence - from the habit of letting the Government think, act, and work for them, and of unquestioning obedience to the will of those charged with the business of the House - those honorable senators, who are now sleeping, seem, to my mind, to lose all sense of the importance of the question we have been discussing for a few- hours. I do not know why, for the first time, there should be this proposed infringement of the rights of minorities; and perhaps the Minister will give the reason he failed to give in submitting the motion. It may be that he concluded he had only to move a motion of the kind to have it passed unquestioned by his own side. But now it must be seen by honorable senators opposite that the Government are not wisely meeting the House - that they cannot be trusted without the Standing Orders, and that they  are  not really expediting business by their procedure. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> himself must admit that he is no further ahead with the business than he would have been had he decided to stand by the Standing Orders. I know that the honorable gentleman would be reluctant to see honorable senators on this side forced into a position of prolonged opposition to this measure, with many of the provisions of which we are in accord, but some of which we think should have adequate discussion at the various stages, as the Standing Orders provide. But the Minister's tactics would lead us to suppose that, in his opinion, he alone knows what the measure contains, and is satisfied that it is a good thing for the Government, and, I will be charitable enough to say, for the country, and that, therefore, the rest of us should accept his opinion. "We are asked to be satisfied with one stage only for the measure; in other words, we are asked to pass all the stages in one hurried sitting. If his idea were not. such as I have suggested, he would not have insisted on a motion of the kind before us. </para>

                            <para>- The last reference 1 made to the Bill was on clause 114. There are about another 100 clauses, but, judging from the hint that you, sir, gave me, I should not be allowed to read them. I am also aware, without instructions from you, that I shall not be allowed to discuss the principles of the Bill, or the effect of the clauses, until we reach the second-reading and Committee stages. I am quite sure, however, that between where I left off reading and the end of the measure, there are quite a number of  provisions full of interest to honorable senators; and I ask them, in any leisure hour they may have between this and the future stages of the Bill, to give particular attention to the more important provisions. There are clauses dealing with bribery and undue influence, electoral offences, Courts of Disputed Returns, <inline font-style="italic">illega.1</inline> practices, qualifications and vacancies, and the schedules, and some of those are of such importance us to demand  consideration of this Bill one stage at a time, even if they formed the whole of the measure. I shall not deal in much detail with them now, because I believe that the  President  is right, and the Government will find it difficult to prevent my discussing them at the Committee stage. We can, at this hour of the morning, transact our business in daylight, and this symbolizes the fact that the same conditions which obtained when I commenced my address do not obtain now, inasmuch as there is not absolute want of knowledge on the part of honorable senators of what is contained in the Bill. </para>

                            <para>- But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> seems to miss the point that, between the 8th November, when the Bill was introduced into another place, and the 13th November, when we received it, the measure was subject to amendment. Of course, it is quite  reasonable to suppose that no very great alterations would be made in a Bill of this character, consisting, as it does largely, of machinery clauses; but that is quite apart from the point I raise. I have been trying to make honorable senators understand that the Senate should have ample time to deal with a measure of this kind, and, until we are assured that that opportunity will be given, we should not be asked to agree to a suspension of the Standing Orders. Let me take as an illustration the question of proportional representation. I know that the Bill of 8th November, as it was introduced in another place, contained no reference to this subject, but I am equally well informed that a very strong party in the other House are favorable to this principle, but up to the present I have had no means of ascertaining whether they were sufficiently strong to incorporate the provisions in this measure. If, when the Minister introduced the Bill, he had stated that, the first reading having been accepted and the Bill printed, he would next day expect honorable senators to. agree to the suspension of the Standing Orders in order to expedite the passage of the Bill, my grounds for complaint would have been removed. But that is not the position. Within five minutes of the receipt of this measure, the Minister in charge of the Senate moved the suspension of the Standing Orders. The motion has not been agreed to yet. The attitude adopted by the Government, so far from accelerating their business,- has merely added to the discomfort of honorable senators, and has really unfitted them for the work they should do, namely, concentrate their clearest intellects upon this measure, so as to insure that it will be the very best that this Parliament can devise. The Minister has missed this opportunity. And opportunities like this do not come often in the life of honorable senators, so they should not be missed. I suppose the average parliamentary life of an honorable senator does not exceed ten years. That means that once in our parliamentary life we have an opportunity of dealing with really big questions, free of the atmosphere and prejudice of party, measures upon which broad-minded men can come together in the discussion of important principles. </para>

                    <para class="block">This is the only chance that I have had of dealing in a really comprehensive manner with our electoral laws, and I am reluctant to let it pass without endeavouring to secure for honorable senators the fullest opportunity of a free discussion. Honorable senators represent huge constituencies. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle,</inline> as the representative of 40,000 or 45,000 voters, may have gained richer experience than any other honorable senator on this important question of securing representation for the views of minorities. I am told that very much may be said for the experiments that have been carried out in Tasmania, and I believe it would be a distinct advantage to the Senate if, instead of adopting the motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders, we approached the discussion of this measure by the ordinary stages of debate. Apart from being able to give consideration to all their Bills, the Government have scarcely time for the business of Cabinet, and I am confident that the drafting of a measure of this character will . have been left largely to officers of the Electoral Department. I am not suggesting that the Government have surrendered their responsibility, but I do say that neither the House nor the Government have had sufficient leisure to give sufficient attention to this Bill. The action I have taken has been rendered necessary by the relentless attitude of the Government, by the callous indifference of the Minister in charge to the reasonable request I have submitted, and by the evident determination that the Bill instead of being the act of Parliament, should be the measure of the Government. If the Government who are responsible for the business of this Parliament are satisfied with it, perhaps there is no reason why I should complain. If there is such complete accord amongst Ministers that they are prepared to take the word of one member of the Cabinet, content to allow him to be the judge of the manner in which the measure shall be carried through Parliament - a manner different from that adopted in regard to any similar Bill - then all 1 can say is that that is a further reason why honorable senators should give the whole subject very grave consideration. It is a scandal, and a most serious reflection upon Parliament, that the Government should attempt <inline font-style="italic">bo</inline> get a Bill of this magnitude through at one sitting. That is what it amounts to. </para>

My intention since I rose has been to persist deliberately in discussing the Bill until the slowest understanding in the Senate realized that the suspension of the Standing Orders to deal with such a measure was unwarranted and unprecedented. The first Electoral Bill, in the discussion of which I participated in 1891, abolished the old bad system of plural voting. At the election at which I was first returned, a man so wealthy as to own property in all the 141 electorates of New" South Wales could, if it had been physically possible, record 141 votes at the one election. .When .we, as a parity, advocated one man one vote and one vote one value- </para>

                            <para>- The analogy I proposed to draw was that the reform we advocated was so drastic and far-reaching that the power-holding classes firmly believed it would absolutely ruin the country, but there was no attempt to suspend the Standing Orders. The Government of the day were Conservative almost beyond imagination, but they had such a proper estimation of the position of Parliament that they never tried with their majority to take advantage of the minority, although that minority was new to parliamentary procedure. Rather, they gave the fullest and freest opportunities for the most ample discussion at every stage of the Bill. Now, when most of us had begun to think that the days of parliamentary tyranny had passed for ever, and fondly hoped that w'e would never again see a Government trying to rob the people of their just rights, this proposal is sprung upon us. I use the word " rob " advisedly, because the Government cannot, without robbing the people of their rights, have two stages of a Bill of this nature taken on one day, and so forcibly deprive other honorable senators of the right to speak on each stage of the Bill, at the same time refusing them an opportunity to make themselves acquainted with the provisions of the- Bill itself. This procedure is unreasonable and undreamt of. "We imagined that in 1918 we were more advanced than were the people of 1818, but I am beginning to think we are advancing backwards. Instead of Parliament becoming more liberal and more tolerant, growing, broadening, and widening, we have a Parliament which is not- prepared to concede to the minority the ordinary rights of parliamentary discussion. A cause that rests on force alone is doomed, and a Government that resorts to methods of conducting business which depend on continuous sittings to sap the physical strength and endurance of its opponents, will meet a day of reckoning. This Government, attempting to force the Senate to deal with all the stages of this Bill at one sitting, is doomed to hear the Bill threshed out at just as great length as if it were dealt with in the ordinary course of business as laid down by the Standing Orders. Force will always fail if resorted to in an unintelligent manner, but it must be resisted. I shall certainly feel the effects of this strenuous use of my strength to prevent this glaring innovation upon our procedure. </para>

I have read the schedules relating to the two systems of voting, and showed that if the desire of. the Government was to obtain an intelligent expression of the wishes of the people, it was quite inconsistent to have two distinct systems of voting in the same polling booth on the same day. </para>

                            <para>- I think the clause provides for a number of new penalties. If the Standing Orders were suspended honorable senators would not have an opportunity to read this Bill carefully. They might fall into the error of voting for this motion to enable the passing of this Bill through all its stages "without delay, notwithstanding that it provides for the most drastic penalties. Those who err, often from sheer ignorance, or because -of over zeal in the cause they have at heart, will find . themselves under, this Bill responsible for penalties for which the existing legislation does not provide. The Vice-President of the Executive Council (SenatorRussell) assures us that all these penalties are to be found in legislation in the passing of which I have assisted. I am sure he would not try to mislead the Senate, but I would remind him that if this motion be agreed . to 1 shall not have an opportunity to examine the Bill, and to compare it with the existing electoral law so as to determine the correctness or otherwise of his statement. The honorable senator, I am sure, believes his statement to be absolutely correct, but in all these matters we must shoulder our " own responsibilities. If I were accused later on of having allowed drastic penalties to be provided for without offering any objection I could not shelter myself behind the statement of the Minister that they were taken from the existing law. I am expected to exercise my own individual responsibility and to compare this Bill with the electoral legislation which it is supposed to codify. Honorable senators opposite, who are in a majority today, may be in a minority to-morrow. I would say to them, "Even if you are strong, be merciful." I ask for no further consideration than that there should be no suspension of the Standing Orders which were framed for our guidance. </para>

                            <para>- If you, sir, had permitted me to complete what I desire to say, though I have to thank you for the patience you have exhibited, you would have learned that, although I made use of the same figure of speech, I intended to apply it to a new argument. I was intending to suggest that an honorable senator, who left the Senate last night in the belief that under the Standing Orders this Bill if presented would reach only one stage, would be disgusted to find that the Standing Orders having been suspended, not merely one, but all stages of the measure had been passed, by the time he arrived next day. I can imagine his feelings towards his colleagues if that kind of thing took place in his absence. A few years ago, we had the </para>

We know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> gave very great attention to that measure, and, with his intimate knowledge of navigation in all parts of the world, was in a position to enlighten the Senate as to its provisions. I ask what would have been the feelings of the honorable senator if, before that Bill came from another place, he had gone home assuming that, under the Standing Orders he would have ample opportunity to discuss its provisions, and had, on returning to the Senate, found that a complacent majority had assented to the suspension of the Standing Orders, and rushed the measure through in one sitting? </para><interjection>

He may condemn it now, but time will justify me. I am afraid that honorable senators are not aware of the provisions in this Bill dealing with petitions, and I think it well to read them. They are as follow :  -  186. Every petition disputing an election or return in this part of this Act called the petition shall - </para>

I hope to induce the Minister to give honorable senators, in common with myself, the opportunity to make ourselves acquainted with this aspect of the Bill. The Minister is very anxious that the Standing Orders should be suspended, and if his object is that the Bill should be passed through all its stages forthwith, I cannot comment upon the clauses of the Bill at this stage; although the mere reading of them may induce honorable senators not to commit the injustice of hurrying this measure through Parliament. </para>

The reason I do not wish the Standing Orders to be suspended is that I may have the opportunity of reading this Bill at my leisure. If I left off speaking now, not only would the Standing Orders be suspended, but the Electoral Bill would" be put through Parliament before I got back from breakfast. But with the Standing Orders unsuspended it is impossible for the Government to put that outrage upon us. </para>

                            <para>- The Standing Orders, which protect the majority as well as the minority, prevent the Government getting a Bill through at one sitting; but suspended they will in this instance leave the minority and a good many members of the National party at the mercy of the Government. I do not propose to take any risks, and so, perhaps, enable <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to become so much the master of the Senate that his will will prevail over that of all other honorable senators. </para>

I think, however, that I am in order in reading the clauses, so that honorable senators may know their grave responsibility in preventing other honorable senators having time to read them. I recognise that my attitude is quite an unusual one for me, but the attitude of the Government and their supporters is just as unusual. </para>

                            <para>- The first intimation I had of it was after 10 o'clock, and I was then prepared that the first reading should go without debate. What I desired as my right was that, before the Minister made his second-reading speech, I should have an opportunity to' read the Bill. Is that an unreasonable request? Had my desire been carried out, with an interval between the first and second- reading, the Minister could have made his speech, and I could have asked for an adjournment of the debate until next week. If that were refused, there might have been an adjournment after the Committee stage; but the Minister would give no concession; he would not conduct the business in accordance with the Standing Orders, but preferred the unusual course he took. The usual breakfast hour having been reached, may I appeal to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> for the ordinary suspension of the sitting? </para>

                            <para>- This is another unparalleled procedure; not only are the Standing Orders to be suspended, but the ordinary breakfast adjournment is denied to honorable senators. I am not asking for an adjournment in. order that I may breakfast in the House, because I can get my meals elsewhere ; but this show of hands is a most extraordinary procedure. However, I appreciate the generosity of honorable senators opposite who have given me an opportunity to call attention- to other clauses in the Electoral Bill. I hope I shall not be deemed out of order when I say that if I hear honorable senators opposite - either on the platform or in this Chamber - discussing the brutality of the Germans, I shall suggest that they cut the mote out of their own eye. </para>

                            <para>- The candidate Murray, polled 5,795 votes ; Hedges, 5,635 ; and Watson, 884, showing, with 179 informal votes, a total poll of 19,033. T am not going to evade the ruling of the  President.  I leave these figures with.honorable senators, and ask them to say whether the reason for the haste of the Government is not due to the fact that their representative did not poll a third of the votes at the Swan election. My point is that there may be a good party reason for the proposal to suspend the Standing Orders; but no reason why this Parliament should lose all sense of its own dignity, and, because the Government have suffered a crushing party defeat, make a frantic effort to alter the whole of our electoral machinery. The Government, with their majority, can get this Bill through if they wish to exercise their power, and prevent me from making any appeal to the Senate to prevent the business being conducted along the lines now being taken. It looks as if the party opposite are willing to set aside the procedure of this Senate in regard to the ordinary time for adjournment, and that it would be useless for me to appeal to honorable senators in their present frame of mind. I have exhausted any hope of appealing with success to the Minister to come down from the high pedestal upon which he has placed himself, but I remind the Government that the smooth working of the parliamentary machine depends upon their attitude towards opponents. I have no desire to unduly prolong the debate. So far as I can see, no human being would be foolish enough to expect that this course would affect the position of the Government, but it may happen that the people will learn how business is being conducted by the Government in this Parliament, and, if so, they can be depended upon to revise their estimate of the present Ministry. But perhaps I should say that the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> is solely responsible for this state of affairs, though I do not know what purpose he has in persisting in his present attitude. I take it, however, that most honorable senators will exercise their right to speak upon the motion. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, it consolidates the existing law, -and also does what I feel sure honorable senators are not aware of, namely, it repeals certain sections of the following Acts: - The Commonwealth Electoral Act 1902, the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1905, the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1906, the Disputed Elections and Qualifications Act 1907, the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1909, the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1911, the Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902, and the Electoral Divisions Act 1903. All the Electoral Acts are thus brought into one comprehensive measure, yet the Minister desires the second reading of a Bill of that importance to be taken without an interval after the first reading, and without giving honorable senators an opportunity to consult the Acts that are to be consolidated. I believe, now that honorable senators are aware of what the Bill does, that they will insist on being given time to study them before the Minister delivers his second-reading speech. That can be arranged as soon as the Minister becomes aware of honorable senators' wishes in the matter.  I shall be very much mistaken in my estimate of honorable senators opposite if they agree to suspend the Standing Orders in the circumstances. The important Electoral Act of 1902, or such of its provisions as the Government and the departmental officers consider necessary, will hereafter be embodied in the Act of 1918. This Bill may deprive that Act of some of its best provisions, and I demand the opportunity to compare the two. The first Electoral Act of this Parliament incorporated the best features of the existing State Acts. It was prepared and passed by many of those great intellects which drafted our Constitution. They were masters of the art of drafting, and masters also of the broad outlook that enabled them, from their wide experience, to bring into existence what they considered a perfect piece of machinery for conducting elections. Now, sixteen years afterwards, without any reference to their work, and without time to refer to it, we are called upon to pass at one sitting a measure which may repeal the best provisions their wise statesmanship left us. </para>

                            <para>- I accept the Minister's assurance, but he cannot expect me to rest my responsibility to the people who sent me here upon his statement. I have still the right to ask whether the best of that Act has been left out of, or incorporated in, this Bill. The Minister is in close touch with the Electoral Officers, but if this motion is carried, I shall have no opportunity of knowing the fate of the Act of 1902, except by what he tells me. I did not come to the Senate to believe that things were all right. I came to assure myself beyond reasonable doubt that the measures I helped to pass were in accord with my best judgment. The Minister forgot to mention a far-reaching provision which does not relate to the soldiers' vote, ana which did not appear in the Act of 1902, but is incorporated in this Act. It is part of an amending Electoral Act passed in war time, and its effect is to disfranchise a large number of Australian-born. </para>

No one expects a Bill passed in time of war, for party purposes, with a view to disfranchise people who, the . Government thought, would vote against them, to find support in these times, with the possibility of a prolonged peace before us. I do not suppose <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Shannon</inline> wants to disfranchise any large section of the Australian-born. That Bill was passed in time of war by a Government anxious to secure a majority for itself, and the actual effect of its working was to disfranchise those who, in the opinion of the Government, would vote against it. </para>

The Senate, having come to a decision at my request, I do not feel at  liberty to depart from it. The long sitting is quite as much an inconvenience to me as it is to every other honorable senator. </para>

                            <para>- The responsibility for this prolonged debate rests with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> and not with me. I am sure honorable senators will not suspend the Standing Orders when they learn that many Australians born of British mothers will be disfranchised if the Bill passes in its present form. If Australians are to be disfranchised because of their names and descent, what country are they to claim as their own? Are we to tell them that the land that gave them birth, and to which they have been loyal - the only land they can call home - will not recognise them as electors? The only land they have lived in, the only land they know, denies them, through its Government, a right which it will give to an alien from any other part of the world once he has become a naturalized British subject. I see opposite me Senators Henderson, Plain, and Lynch, who for years have been a distinct ornament to the Senate. Not one of them is Australian born, and yet they will deny to Australian-born citizens the right to vote. That is an extraordinary attitude for them to assume. I do not believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> is Australian born. All those senators have come to this country and have been placed by the Australian people on the highest pinnacle of preferment.

There are in this -community men who would vote to-morrow to deprive all of

                            <para>- And I want the honorable senator to secure his opportunity. If the Government will accept my offer, I am prepared to agree to the first reading of the Bill being taken now, and to the second-reading stage being taken as far as the Minister pleases when we resume at 3 p.m. They can then suspend the Standing Orders, if they are prepared to accept my offer. I merely put forward this proposal because I can see that the obstinacy of the Government in persisting in a course which will deprive us of the intervals, between the various stages of the Bill, for its careful examination and consideration, will be productive of no good. The Government will gain nothing by their present attitude. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> says that the provisions of the Act under which certain Australian-born citizens were disfranchised at the last general election will not appear in this Bill </para>

                            <para>- In any case, Germany, by signing the armistice, has put herself in a worse position in her anxiety to save herself from a further beating, and the Allies are unquestionably able to enforce their wishes. The three Acts to which I have referred, being passed in war time, were passed at a time when the community was not in a normal state of mind, when weight was given to suspicions which, in ordinary times, would not be seriously considered by a Parliament. Men were disfranchised, not because of their nationality, but because of that of their fathers. We have now an opportunity to repeal this - shall I call it panic? - . legislation. One of these Acts was passed deliberately to secure for the governing political party a majority of votes on its referendum proposal. The in justice that, for party purposes, an unscrupulous Government inflicted in war time on good Australians should be removed immediately. I have met Australianborn men, whose mothers were English but whose fathers were German, who have been disfranchised and humiliated by the legislation of which I speak, although they were as patriotic Australians as ever breathed the free atmosphere of this country. Hundreds and thousands of such men, instead of being judged on their personal merits, were unjustly disfranchised by a brutal and unscrupulous Government and its servile following. There is not a man in this chamber who has not in his mind persons upon whom this injustice has been inflicted. </para>

Do I understand that, under the guise of making quotations, he is entitled to read the provisions of an entire Act? I would direct attention to the fact that when this question was discussed last night, the  President  pointed out that it has been laid down by <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> that ,  " extracts" mean "extracts," and not whole documents, and that the quotation of lengthy extracts is not in order. The honorable senator is apparently intent upon reading whole Acts of Parliament which this Bill does not propose to amend. </para>

                        <para>- I merely wish to make my position clear. We are now dealing with a Bill to consolidate and  amend the law relating to parliamentary elections. We are asked to consider it, without first being afforded an opportunity of reading its provisions. Within five minutes of the measure reaching this chamber, and after 10 o'clock last evening, the Minister moved the suspension of our Standing Orders to enable the second reading of the Bill to be moved. After  a  long discussion the honorable gentleman  has  assured me that the Bill does not pretend to consolidate the existing electoral law, and does not seek to repeal certain Acts of Parliament that are a disgrace to Australia. If the Bill does not seek to consolidate those Acts it becomes my duty to do everything in my power to see that they are consolidated. No voice can be raised in this chamber to affirm that there exists any good ground for disfranchising an honest Australian because of his name. </para>

                            <para>- I was referring to my desire during the second-reading stage to bring under this Bill all the existing Acts regarding voting. If they are not included in this Bill the Electoral (War-time) Bill will expire by effluxion of time six months after the final signature of peace. There are not likely to be more than a couple of elections during that period, and we now have ample grounds for believing that the Government desire, this measure to be passed at a lightning speed unprovided for by the Standing Orders, in order that the Electoral (War- time) Act, with, all its iniquities and injustices, may prevent a few Australians from voting at the elections. They cannot afford to take chances. If it is the Government's intention to take the good parts out of measures that will expire by effluxion of time in a few months, and include them in this consolidating measure, while wiping out the bad sections of that legislation, let them do it in an open and manly way. Then they, can go down to the Corangamite electorate, and reply to the charge that they have been  mani&gt;pulating  the electoral law for the purpose of a by-election. Otherwise they will have to face the enraged electors, and meet the charge of having been the first Government in Australia which, for its own purposes, has altered the Electoral Act after the issue of -a writ. Ministers could give no denial to that charge. To-day, because they fear disaster to the National party,- they propose to retain the worst provisions of these measures to which I have just referred, so that possibly a few good Australians who might vote against them may be disfranchised. One cannot foresee all the machinations of a Government which is engaged in manipulating the Statutes, one cannot tell where its manipulations begin or end, but I cannot imagine the electors of any part of Victoria giving any advantage to a Government which, for its own miserable mean party purposes, would use its majority to suspend the Standing Orders of the Senate. I cannot imagine any standard of intelligence in Australia that would concede a single advantage to a Government in such circumstances, as we shall make known on every platform. Not only do they manipulate the franchise of the people, but Ministers are not satisfied to do it in the ordinary course of the conduct of parliamentary business. They have introduced a new system of conducting business in another place. Deprived of that added power in this Chamber, they use their majority in order to suspend those Standing Orders which protect the rights of honorable senators. They have the numbers to do it, and they will do it, and the moment they suspend the Standing Orders they will use those same numbers in order to force the Bill through. But there will be an echo from the -bills of Corangamite. Every decent man in that electorate will repudiate a Government which is so lost to a sense of its own importance and the dignity of the position it occupies, and which is so lost to a sense of justice and fair play that it will seek to get measures through not only by suspending the Standing Orders, but also by denying to honorable senators the ordinary adjournment for refreshments. </para>

                            <para>- I have no desire to make it a personal matter. Like most men guiltily conscious that they are doing something nefarious, they are anxious to get through with a business which is so distasteful to them, not only by suspending the Standing Orders, but also by depriving honorable senators of the ordinary custom which has always, been observed in this Parliament, namely, reasonable adjournments, so that the business of the Senate may be conducted without danger to the health of any honorable senator. The Corangamite electors will understand all this. I shall have great pleasure in going into the electorate with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Plain</inline> when he goes there to defend this action which now, by his silence, he is not only condoning, but also supporting. I shall be there when he is endeavouring to explain to his constituents how a man of his standing and reputation in the community ever became such a mean, miserable party tool that he would seek to alter the whole proceedings of the Senate simply because he happens to be sitting with the majority. It is well to be possessed of giant strength, but it is ill that that strength should be used. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator has been enjoying the comforts of home while others have been attending to their duties in the Chamber, and, having had an excellent rest, he now asks us to shake hands with him. I promise that I shall do so. That is the spirit in which we should deal with this matter - the spirit of manly consideration despite the attitude which our opponents may take up. Let me remind the Government that six months hence they may be in Opposition. Their distinguished leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> may be so offended at his treatment by the British Government that he may come back to Australia a red-hot, rampant republican, and he may get behind us and bring some honorable senators across with him. With such a leader honorable senators supporting the Government cannot see a month ahead. If it should so happen that they may find themselves in a minority how keenly would they feel the injustice of altering the procedure of the Chamber, and how affected would they be if the unfair practices initiated by them and served out to us were applied to themselves. However, I promise them that if ever we become the majority we shall restore to the Senate that fair and reasonable consideration for the Opposition that will give to all honorable senators the opportunity to conduct the business of the Chamber without having to submit to unusual conditions specially applied to particular occasions. I do not complain now on the ground of personal convenience or inconvenience, because the measure we are discussing is of such importance that honorable senators would be willing to submit to a good deal of inconvenience if in doing so they could improve the Bill. We could improve it by amendments if we had the opportunity of preparing them, but if this motion is carried no such opportunity will be afforded to us. When my colleagues finish speaking somewhere about this time to-morrow morning the motion may be carried. I do not suppose that the Senate will try to cut the privileges of other honorable senators any shorter than mine. If, by some time to-morrow morning, the Senate has passed the motion, what will happen? Will the Government be any further forward because of endeavouring to force the measure through at the one sitting? </para>

The rules of debate will not now permit me to read the whole of that Act It appears that. the Electoral Bill now about to come before the Senate does not propose to suspend the operations of the war-time Statute, which provides for the taking of the votes of soldiers at the Front. I take it, therefore, that, at the Corangamite by-election, the Government will make provision for soldiers from that electorate to exercise  their franchise. It is apparent that the Government, not having considered the repeal of the War-time Act, will certainly not refuse to grant to the Corangamite soldiers their full rights. The section covering the soldiers' votes reads as follows :  -  . . . in the case of a general election for the House of Representatives, a vote for a party shall be counted as a vote for the candidate who has been recognised in the manner hereinafter prescribed as the candidate representing that party in the Division in respect of which the member is entitled under this Act to vote. . . . </para><para class="block">Then there is this provision, that - </para><quote>

The Government can do no less. No one desires to deny the soldiers their full and perfect rights. That being the case, the Bill should make it perfectly clear that the soldiers shall have their rights maintained. It should be made not only optional but compulsory for the Government to take such action as may be necessary in that direction. All that may be required could be easily brought about if the provisions of the war time measure were incorporated in the present Bill. There may be as many as 4,000 or 5,000 soldiers from that electorate at present at the Front or elsewhere beyond the boundaries of Corangamite - quite enough electors to weigh down the balance one way or the other at the polling. I am not sure, indeed, but that it will be compulsory for the Government to give the Corangamite soldiers their votes at the by-election. As to what occurred in connexion with the Swan by-election, I am not clear ; but I am under the impression that the soldiers from that electorate were not given their rights. Apparently they were not entitled to vote. </para><interjection>

He must certainly be more familiar with it than would have been the case had the Government been permitted to follow their proposed course uninterruptedly. </para>

I am not insinuating anything, but am merely stating a fact, seeing that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> by his own protracted actions, has continued when he could have ended his remarks long ago if he so desired. I do not say that he ought to have done so or should not have done so. That is a matter entirely within his own discretion. But I am bound to remark that if I had exercised my duty to the full I think I would have ended the honorable senator's speech before now. 1 have given great latitude throughout. I am mindful of the fact that upon a certain occasion I suspended a sitting of the Senate without being requested so to do by the Senate, and for which I was taken seriously, to task by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline> The honorable senator said that  he objected then to my action and would always do so in future. </para>

I have not at my fingers' ends the exact provisions of the War-time Electoral Act which I should like to incorporate in the Electoral Bill, but they include those which provide for the voting of our soldiers who are abroad. Every one of our soldiers who went from the division of Corangamite has the right to vote at the coming by-election, and there is no reason why provision should not be made for their doing so. </para>

                            <para>- Not having been here, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> does not know  that the night's debate was not one of the most, entertaining, instructive, and enjoyable that the Senate has ever known, though, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foil,</inline> the guns of the war vessels at Gallipoli were not more nerve wracking. It cannot be urged as a reason why our absent soldiers should not be permitted to vote at the Corangamite by-election, that it would be too costly to make the necessary arrangements. Nor can it be objected that they were not given that opportunity in connexion with the recent Swan election; because at the Swan election the Labour party's candidate was a returned soldier, and it would not have suited the Government to risk getting him a bigger support in the votes of his fellow soldiers abroad. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> is as desirous as I am that our absent soldiers may be permitted to exercise the franchise, and that he will be annoyed with the Government that he supports if they are denied the exercise of the franchise at the Corangamite election. I know that he felt keenly their denial of the exercise of the franchise at the Swan election. I ask now for an opportunity to provide for the voting of our soldiers at all future elections. Although an armistice has been signed, it may 'be three, or even six, months before 'peace is declared, and as the presence of big battalions on the enemy's borders is a good argument for peace, we shall have to keep our forces there for a considerable length of time. In any case, our men cannot be brought to Australia within a month or two. The world's shipping has been greatly reduced, and must be used largely now to feed the starving populations of Europe, including our defeated enemies. </para>

I was reasonably acquainted with the provisions of the measure introduced into the other House, but I have had no opportunity to study the amendments made in it there, and it was not until -daylight this morning that I learned from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> that the Bill does not consolidate all our electoral legislation. The provision of our electoral law relating to the voting of soldiers is not covered by the Bill, and the Bill does not repeal that wicked provision under which honest, straightforward, Australians were disfranchised merely because of their German descent. </para>

For the War-time Electoral Act of 1917 I have no responsibility. That measure contains most wicked and iniquitous provisions disfranchising sons of British mothers and German fathers, who are true Australians in every sense of the word. The Government which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> supports put that iniquitous  Act on the statute-book. I ask that opportunity be given to move for its repeal. I do not think that the Act should be allowed merely to become inoperative six months after the termination of the war, and to remain on the statute-book as a record of the wicked intentions of a wicked Government. </para>

                            <para>- If what I have said does not. apply to South Australia, it certainly applies to the other States which I visited. I know of a mos't reputable citizen who was not only disfranchised on the occasion of the last referendum, but who, for party purposes, has been interned. He is a man who, for two years, did his best to influence the German section of the community to remain loyal, and yet he was interned on the reports of partisan Nationalists. He is still interned, and if he were resident in the electorate of Corangamite, he would not be  allowed to vote at the approaching election. As a good soldier in the party to which I belong, I take my orders from it, just as does anybody else, and I am sorry that it has decided that I must not continue this debate any longer. I am very pleased to have had an opportunity of making honorable senators aware of the responsibility which they will shoulder by agreeing to suspend our Standing Orders. It will be the first time in the history of the Commonwealth Parliament that those Orders have been suspended in connexion with a measure of this character. The object of their suspension is to enable the Government to apply the Electoral Bill to the approaching election in Corangamite. They are welcome to their victory. Theirs will be a victory of the force of numbers in this Chamber, but ours will be a victory upon election day at Corangamite. </para>

                    <para>That this Bill be now read a second time. </para>
                    <para>This is largely a consolidating measure, grouping in one Bill all the electoral laws except those special Acts which stand apart, such as, for instance, the Electoral (War-time) Act and the Act which extended the life of the Senate for a few months. Those Acts are not included in the Bill because they were passed for special purposes, and some of them have ceased to operate. The Franchise Act has been embodied as a whole. The Bill makes only one addition to the Franchise Act, and that is for the purpose of enabling members of the Australian Imperial Force to vote at elections irrespective -of their age. I do not think that that concession will be greatly contested. Except for two main principles the Bill is really a reenactment and a co-ordination of existing legislation which has been scattered through many Acts. Those two principles are preferential voting for the House of Representatives, and the reintroduction of postal voting in a modified or more restricted form. The Bill as a whole is one of which the Senate may reasonably be proud. It is submitted at a time when autocracy throughout the world is falling, and I believe that, despite small differences of opinion upon some of the principles involved, honorable senators will agree that no better or freer electoral law has ever been introduced in any Parliament in the world. I again affirm that the Bill, apart from co-ordinating existing laws, embraces only two new principles, namely, a genuine attempt to secure majority rule, at any rate so far as the House of Representatives is concerned, and an honest endeavour through the postal vote to extend the franchise to people who can vote by no other discovered means. </para>
                    <para>In regard to preferential voting, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> asked what will happen in the event of only two candidates contesting a seat. In that case all that will be required of the elector will be to mark the numeral or a simple cross against the preferred candidate; any other indication of preference will not be necessary. But when more than two candidates offer themselves the usual and! well understood! conditions of preferential voting will operate. The candidate who receives the smallest number of first preference votes will drop out and the second preferences on the ballot-papers marked in his favour will be distributed amongst the other candidates. This operation will continue until one candidate secures an absolute majority. Any candidate who secures an absolute majority on the first count will be declared elected. In the event of two candidates at the bottom of the poll tieing for last position in respect of first preference votes the chief returning officer will give a casting vote in the same way as he does when a tie takes place in an election to-day. No Democrat can seriously oppose the right of the majority to rule. Upon that principle all Democracy is based, and although the majority may at times make mistakes they cannot do injury to the country without injuring themselves. Therefore, a system which insures -majority rule is justified if only as a protective measure. I do not wish to associate the machinery of Democracy with liberty. It is quite possible for the two to be distinct and divergent at times. There are occasions when even Democracy can be tyrannical towards itself and towards the common people, but, nevertheless majority rule is the greatest popular safeguard that has been discovered. The Bill represents a genuine attempt to make that principle effective. I make no apology for the introduction of the preferential voting system, because all Democratic bodies have accepted the principle of majority rule. I do not say that it is a perfect, system ; like every human device, it is subject to abuses. I have known cases in which the preferential system, instead of voting men up has voted them down, 'but at the same time it is not capable of as grave abuses as take place under the present system. Therefore, this method should be accepted as a means to insure majority rule until a better method is devised. </para>
                    <para>In regard to postal voting, I am not unmindful of the fact that there has been a good deal of criticism in regard to its operation in the past. I ask honorable senators to dissociate the provisions in this Bill from the previous system under which a person had only to believe that he would be five miles away from a booth on polling day to become entitled to a postal vote. In the case' of others it was necessary for them only to affirm that they would be sick on polling day. Abuses resulted, especially in connexion with women electors. Another doubtful provision in the old system of postal voting was that the elector had to hand over his vote to an authorized witness, and, although I am not prepared to mention instances, it has been said that on occasions the authorized witness had a convenient memory and forgot to post the vote. The Bill now before the Senate provides that an elector must be definitely more than fifteen miles from a polling booth on election day before he shall be permitted to vote by post. At a later stage I intend to move an amendment to reduce that distance to ten miles. The postal vote is given also to infirm persons, those who are physically incapable of going to polling booths, those who are sick, and those who are inmates of hospitals, and there is a special provision to meet the circumstances of females in connexion with approaching maternity. All persons voting under this provision must be genuinely ill or physically incapable of going to the polling booth. The list of authorized witnesses is as wide as we can safely make it, but power is given to extend by regulation the list throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth. Always there have been risks in connexion with postal voting, and I am not prepared to  say that there will be none under the system now proposed, but I believe that it has been so effectively safeguarded that the danger is reduced to a minimum. </para>

                            <para>- I voted against their repeal. I agree that plenty of abuses took place under that system, but, knowing the convenience it was to women and invalids and to those who were living in remote parts from which it was impossible for them to reach a booth, I believed that democracy should extend the franchise so that it would be possible for every individual in the community to vote, and I refused then, as I refuse now, <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> believe that it is. not possible for Parliament to devise an effective, safe, and honest system of postal voting. </para>

                    <para>Under the most perfect system of electoral enrolment there are always clerical errors when a Department is dealing with hundreds of thousands of names, and I know of nothing more annoying to a man who has taken the necessary steps to secure enrolment than to find, when he presents himself at the polling booth, that his name is not on the roll. The percentage of such cases is not great, but these omissions are a real grievance to men who, through no fault of their own, are disfranchised. The Bill provides that any man who has taken the necessary steps to secure enrolment, no matter what subsequent mistake is made by the electoral officers, or the printer, or anybody else, shall, on making a declaration that he has filled in his enrolment card and lived in the electorate for one month, be allowed to vote in the same way as an absent voter does now. This provision will prevent people being deprived of their vote simply because their names have been omitted from the roll through inadvertence or through a rush of work in the Electoral Office. No principle is involved in the other provisions of the Bill. The measure is a good clean Democratic one, which could not be improved from any knowledge ' we possess of electoral systems in force in other parts of the world. </para>

                    <para class="block">Sub-clause 2 is particularly objectionable, and it will be impossible in thousands of cases for prospective voters to take the steps necessary to secure not only ballot-papers, but also authorized witnesses, and they will be very much handicapped compared with others, who, because of their financial position, and by means of the conveniences at their disposal, may get to polling booths.  The Act of 1911 contains a provision for voting by post, but after a trial it was found to be so unsatisfactory that the Commonwealth Parliament, I believe almost unanimously, repealed it. The present Government, in trying to restore this discredited system of voting, are acting very wrongly, because at the time the system was in operation the disclosures which were made were of no credit to any one. I have not copies of the evidence which was taken, and which resulted <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> this Parliament deliberately omitting the provision dealing with postal voting, but I know that it was such that the condemnation of this method of voting was almost universal. I am disappointed at the present- Government's proposal to enforce this objectionable system once more upon the people. In individual cases it may be a hardship to be deprived of the right to vote, and if I were so unwell as to be unable to go to the polling booth I would be considerably annoyed if I were robbed of my vote; but, as a general rule, the person who is ill is not very much concerned about election matters. When people are at death's door it is no time to worry them with the relative merits of political parties; but if the Government are determined that voting facilities should be provided for the inmates of hospitals, I would not oppose any effort which would attain that object without the risk of fraud. If  Returning  Officers were appointed to visit hospitals accompanied by scrutineers from both sides, possibly a considerable number of votes could be secured, but it is quite unfair to worry people who are ill with matters appertaining to elections. I feel quite certain that in the near future we shall have a repetition of the disgraceful disclosures we have had in the past in regard to this method of voting, and that we shall take the first opportunity of repealing this clause. The Minister has given notice of an amendment to  reduce  the mileage to 10 miles, which will render the provision even more objectionable. Any system of voting which permits of ballot-papers leaving the polling booth lends itself to unfair practices, and it is to be regretted the Government have decided to insert such a provision in the Bill. At present men who are going to sea are entitled to vote after the issue of a writ and before polling day. That enables nearly all seafaring men to exercise the franchise; but that method of voting, while it permits the vote to be cast before election day, has this great advantage, namely, that each individual voter must present himself in person in order to exercise his franchise.  Thus  the objectionable practices which in the past have disgraced postal 'voting are absent. </para>
                    <para>Another clause, which, I understand, is a new one, has to do with fixing the age of persons qualified to vote. I have held the opinion for years that the age of twenty-one is altogether too old in this respect. In Australia almost every boy is earning his own living before he is eighteen. Frequently he is doing the work of a man by that time. Thousands of our troops enlisted before they were eighteen, or during their nineteenth year. But this Bill does not provide for the enfranchisement of any person under  twenty -one. </para>

                            <para>- But that is a further provision. Great trouble has always been experienced by electors when they have found that their names are not on the rolls. So far as clause 52 is concerned my objection is that it is not necessary for the Electoral Officer to deposit 5s., and, consequently, he may enter an objection against any name without running financial risk. I understand that postmen are entitled to a nominal fee in' respect to the removal of names from the roll, but that they are not entitled to be paid when they secure the enrolment of any person. I see no provision in relation to that within this measure, although, possibly, it is covered, by the numerous regulations governing our electoral laws. </para>

Recently I made inquiries respecting new rolls for New South Wales, and was informed that their printing was left to the Minister's discretion. I do not infer that the Minister does not perform his duty as he should do, but it would be much more "satisfactory if the officials were instructed under the Act to periodically reprint existing, rolls. In our large cities, during the course of three years, between the time of the publication of one roll and the publication of another, at least one-third, and sometimes a half, of the electors will have removed into other districts. The printing of the rolls should be governed specifically under the Act. </para>

                            <para>- I protest against the action of the Government in seeking to force through the Senate a new Electoral Act, when so many of Australia's adults - our fighting men - are still abroad. This is a measure in regard to which, in the main, very little objection need be urged. The objections which might well be raised at this stage are chiefly on account of the inopportune time at which the Bill is submitted. But I regret that no provision appears to have been made for our men abroad to exercise their franchise. I trust that steps will be taken during the Committee stage to remedy that defect. </para>

                    <para> In this measure the Government propose to introduce a new system of voting for the House of Representatives. It is not quite clear from the Ministerial statements so far. made in the Senate what will constitute an informal vote. I wish to be informed whether, in the event of a person exercising only his or her first preference, that vote will be regarded as formal. I would like to know, also, whether a vote .will be deemed informal if a person places a cross by the side of the name of a candidate under the preferential system. Altogether, for the reasons I have given, I shall vote against the measure. </para>

                            <para>- Then I must address myself directly to the Bill, which is, perhaps, the most important measure that has been submitted to the Senate during this Parliament. I do this after the refreshment of a night's sleep. With the occurrences of the past twelve hours, I have no sympathy. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gardiner),</inline> a little after 10 o'clock last night, made to the Government what I considered a fair offer. He promised that if the moving of the second reading of the Electoral Bill were postponed until to-day, the consideration of the measure should proceed with reasonable expedition, and that the time lost by the postponement would be thereby made up. That offer the Government declined, and, as a consequence, there has been an exhibition which is not creditable to the Senate. </para>

The members of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff have been at work for over twenty-four hours continuously, and so have the officials of the Senate; and honorable senators, who have not been in bed for nearly thirty hours, are not in a fit and proper condition to discuss the measure now before the Senate. Primitive passions have been aroused. The irresistible has met the immovable, and an atmosphere has been created in which the discussion should not be continued. Yet, as this is the only opportunity which honorable senators will have for speaking to the measure generally, I must perforce avail myself of it. All interest in the Bill seems to have evaporated. No one seems to care what may happen, so long as he may get to sleep at the earliest moment. </para>

I extremely regret that on the morning of a victorious peace there should have been exhibited in this Chamber a spirit of party altogether contrary to the best interests of Australia, because this has prevented the calm consideration of a measure of grave importance. When I became a member of the Senate I was gratified to find that .the  party r  rancour which I had been led to believe was extreme in previous Parliaments no longer existed, having been repressed by the war, and I regret the more that it has again broken out. </para>

                    <para class="block">All electoral reform affects the basis on which Democracy is founded. Electoral legislation is the root from which Democracies must grow. Our representative system came to us from the traditions of the Mother Country, modified and extended by the complex requirements of modern society, but at its best it is yet a very Crude system. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gardiner)</inline> has, rightly or wrongly, accused' the Government of endeavouring to force through this Bill in order that some of its provisions may be applied to the election that is to be held in the Corangamite Division for the choosing of a member to replace the late lamented <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Manifold,</inline> and to save the seat for the Nationalist party. That charge contains the admission that on a straight-out vote a majority of the electors of Corangamite would return a Nationalist candidate. - In the present state of political parties in the other House, it matters not greatly whether the candidate returned is a Nationalist or a Labour member, but the temper in which honorable senators discuss proposals striking at the root of our representative system matters very much indeed. What will be the result of the occurrences of the past twelve hours, of which the outstanding feature was the marvellous physical endurance of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gardiner)</inline> ? The general public will not be fully informed of the circumstances. Throughout the length and breadth of Australia the newspapers will dwell on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline> feat, and the people will think that he would not have shown so much tenacity of purpose had he not on some matter of principle been engaged in protecting the rights of Australian Democracy. When I entered the chamber this morning, the first remark that I heard concerned the marvellous endurance of the honorable senator. That is what will be blazoned all over Australia to-day and to-morrow, and the public will neither care for, nor remember, the importance of the occasion. I do not think that this Bill is of sufficient importance to warrant the Government in endeavouring to get a twenty-four hours' lead upon it, in view of the physical and mental tension which have been exhibited in this chamber, and which have practically placed  a majority of honorable senators <inline font-style="italic">horn de combat.</inline></para>

                            <para>- No. I am merely repeating the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition. But when the suspension of the Standing Orders was moved after 10 o'clock last night by the Minister for Defence, he assigned no reason whatever for his action. Upon several occasions during the present session, Ministers have moved the suspension of our Standing Orders to expedite the passing of some Bill of an admittedly urgent character. I do not think that any' exception can be taken to the adoption of that course in such circumstances. Nobody- will seriously object to expediting;, for example, the passing of a Supply Bill when  payments  are about to fall due to members of our Public Service. But I do not think the Government are paying that respect to honorable senators to which they are entitled. </para>

                            <para>- I thank the Vice-President of the Executive Council for his interjection, because it recalls to my mind at least one occasion in this Chamber upon which a Bill was declared to be of an urgent character and yet the following week the Senate was obliged to adjourn because it had no business to transact. I do not think that the leaders of the Government here are paying that respect to honorable senators to which the latter are entitled when they so frequently interfere with the arrangement of the Business Paper. As a matter of fact, it very often happens that honorable senators do not know what business is to claim their attention until a Minister rises and makes an announcement. In this connexion I would remind Ministers that there is a limit to our patience, and that some respect should be paid to the generally loyal support which they are receiving. </para>

                    <para>Upon the question of electoral reform, I am very pleased that the Ministry have brought forward a Bill which is designed to improve the present position. I believe that preferential voting is a reform in the right direction, but I do not think it is a reform which, in the years to come, a Democracy will regard as complete. Nevertheless, it will constitute a great improvement upon our existing methods of voting. To some extent it will weaken the power of the party machine, prevent the election of an unpopular candidate, and confer an enlarged freedom of choice in connexion with the election of representatives for single-member constituencies. Preferential voting provides for safeguarding the rights of majorities, but in my judgment no electoral system will be complete which does not also safeguard the rights of large minorities. I believe that there is a considerable section of the people of Australia who regard the question of electoral reform as being of a more pressing character - after war problems have been settled - than is any other question. In New South Wales there is a large body of much respected opinion upon both sides of politics, which believes that the time for electoral reform has now come. The question of proportional representation is making great headway. Not only is it moving in Australia, but it is moving in more conservative England, and I believe that, if not during the life of the present Parliament, certainly in the not distant future, the electors of Australia will demand that a complete reform shall be made of our electoral laws so as to provide, as far as possible, for that mathematical representation which they desire. </para>

I am glad that the Government have introduced the Bill, and I am specially pleased that it will provide for a standard of uniformity with the States in that it will unify at least one of the duplications which now take place as between the States and the Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para>I need not say again how much I approve of the principle of preferential voting. There is no method of voting which will insure majority rule in single member constituencies, save the numerical preference which is provided in this measure. I do not think it can be argued with any semblance of reason that the Government should be expected to immediately redistribute the constituencies constituting the other branch of the Legislature so as to permit of proportional representation being adopted, in view of the very many urgent war problems which lie ahead of us and in view also of the pressing matters claiming attention by reason of the advent of peace. Proportional representation cannot, be applied to single member constituencies, and consequently the Government, in bringing forward a Bill to provide for preferential voting, have done the next best thing possible. At all events, the measure will safeguard the rights of a majority of the electors in single-member constituencies, and the country will be spared the possibility of representatives being elected upon a minority vote. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that the honorable senator can have closely followed my argument. I have already said that there can be no proportional representation in the case of single member constituencies. Consequently, the next best system to apply to such constituencies is that of the preferential vote. I have remarked that the Government cannot be expected at present, even if they favour the application of proportional representation to elections for the other branch of the Legislature, to raise the big problems of the re-adjustment and rearrangement of treble-barrelled or five-  barrelled constituencies for that House. Consequently, I am fully in accord with what the Government propose to do in connexion with elections for the present single-member constituencies for the House of Representatives. I favour preferential voting as the best method which can be adopted for such constituencies, and I believe that the Bill will be passed by the Senate without very much discussion. </para>

                            <para>- I am speaking of the principle of preferential voting. I am endeavouring to get down to the hones of the Bill and to divert its discussion from that tense, personal atmosphere which has hitherto characterized this debate, to a consideration of what the Government propose in connexion with it. The preferential system has been favoured by the Labour leagues themselves. I believe that, generally speaking, elections in connexion with trade union and Labour league positions are conducted by means of the preferential vote. It is also in operation in other directions, and the Government have met the enlarged view of the Democracy of Australia in regard to elections for single member constituencies by introducing a measure of this sort. Although nothing but approval can be given to the terms of the Bill wit]* regard to the present single member constituencies for the House of Representatives, the Bill itself further complicates and renders more unsatisfactory the position so far as elections for the Senate are concerned. I think it is unquestioned that the Senate in certain circumstances would not be a fair representation of the will of the people. In fact, the Government have admitted that when this Bill passes into law and the next election takes place, if no further amendments of the electoral law are made in the interim, the position of the elector will be greatly complicated if he has to go into a polling booth and receive an electoral slip for the House of Representatives to be marked in a certain way, and another for the Senate to be marked in a different way. There is bound to be endless confusion. It is the duty of Parliament to make voting as simple as possible. The fewer the informal votes recorded the better for the people, and the more accurate will be the reflection of the opinion of trie majority. I do not think honorable senators have realized how complicated the next election will be if the electoral system remains as this Bill will leave it, and I am glad to have read the assurance of the Acting Prime Minister in another place that the Government will take into serious consideration the anomaly that will arise under this Bill. It is my intention to move in Committee a couple of short amendments that will bring voting  for  the Senate into line with the voting for the House of Representatives, and also provide that the counting for the Senate shall be done in . accordance with the principle of the single transferable vote. That will make the procedure consistent, and in consonance with the latest features of electoral reform that have been so exhaustively dealt with in both England and Australia. </para>

Those points summarize the reasons for proportional representation, and I wish to attempt to show what a great improvement would arise in connexion with the representation in the Senate if this Parliament were to adopt that system for Senate elections. There can be no objection to the principles I have summarized. Research into electoral systems in order to ascertain what is taking place in other countries is extremely interesting. An electoral system consists of three elements- (1) The method of recording the vote; (2) the method of determining the successful candidate; and (3) the number of mern.bers returned by each constituency. That is the elementary electoral system in all Democracies, and it is extremely interesting to see what methods various countries adopt in order to achieve the end in view. I wish to show that electoral systems have been evolved throughout the world, and with the experience of other countries to buttress my argument that our electoral system is not yet complete in so far as it lacks proportional representation for the Senate. </para>

                            <para>- Because there are so many more pressing problems to be dealt with. Various electoral systems throughout the world have evolved, and are not even yet considered perfect. Therefore, it cannot be argued that we have a system that cannot be further improved so far as the election of the Senate is concerned. In Great Britain before 1872 voting was public. The Ballot Act of that year introduced the secret ballot system, which is now in force. Successful candidates are determined by relative and not absolute majorities. For a candidate to win an election it is only necessary for him to secure more votes than any other candidate does. The single member system dates only from 1885. The twenty-four two-member constituencies seem to have been retained solely because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone,</inline> from personal sentiment, did not wish to wipe out the last vestige of the historical type of constituencies. A Committee has recently been sitting in Great Britain in connexion with further electoral reform. For some time this has been found to be urgently needed in view of the rearrangements and re-adjustments rendered necessary by an increasing and peregrinating population. This Committee has strongly recommended that under certain circumstances proportional representation should be introduced in connexion with elections for the British House of Commons. </para>

                            <para>- A more conservative institution than the British House of Commons in regard to some matters could not exist. By a very narrow majority it did reject the recommendation of the Committee in this respect. I can quite understand members of Parliament rejecting a system under which they may perhaps run some risk of losing their seats, but personal matters should not be introduced when dealing with important matters of State. We should endeavour to discuss this matter dispassionately and from the stand-point of what is best for. Australia. There are many systems of election in force all over the world. The relative majority system is in operation in the United States,' in the United Kingdom, and in Denmark for the Lower House. The second ballot system exists in Austria, France, and Germany. There is a limited voting system in Portugal and in several of the smaller countries 'of Europe. The proportional system was in operation in Belgium before the war. It is practically the French Republican system whereby representatives are elected in France. It is also in operation in Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland, and, coming closer home, in our small bub in some respects more progressive State of Tasmania. The party system has been the growth of hundreds of years, from the days of the Roundheads and Cavaliers through generations of Whigs and Tories and Liberals and Conservatives, down to these days of Unionism and Radicalism, and it seems to be almost as sacrosanct as is the British Constitution itself. I am not an extreme party man. . In my opinion the Senate is not a party Chamber. The Federal Constitution intended that it should particularly represent the States and not parties. By the establishment of proportional representation for the Senate elections we should be able to get closer to what the Constitution originally intended. </para>

                            <para>- 1 do not wish to enlarge upon the point. I am  merely  dealing with it in relation to the establishment of proportional voting for the Senate. Under the present method of electing senators it is quite possible that at the next election for this Chamber there may be a continuing Nationalist wave. The whole eighteen senators returned may represent the National party. Thus there would be thirty-six Nationalists in the Senate and no representatives of the Official Labour party. That is the risk we run under the present method of election, and if such a situation arose this Chamber would be the laughing-stock of the community. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly not. That is the reason why I dissociate myself from extremely party measures in this Chamber. It was never intended by the Constitution that there should be thirty-six senators representing one party only, with no representation in the Chamber for any other party. Honorable senators will remember that for some years the Senate contained twenty-nine Labour senators and seven Liberals, and, later on, thirty-one Labour senators and five Liberals. I do not think that any honorable senator would be prepared to argue that those numbers were a fair representation of the votes that had been cast. In 1910 the total votes recorded for the Labour party for the Senate numbered 2,106,521, the total votes cast in the Liberal interest being 1,913,789, or in the proportion of 8.1 to 9.9; yet eighteen members of the Labour party were returned and not one Liberal, notwithstanding the huge number of votes which had been cast in favour of Liberal candidates. In 1913 the votes recorded for Labour candidates for the Senate numbered 2,895,043 as against 2,857,152 cast for Liberal candidates, the proportion of </para>

Thirty-one Labour candidates were elected to represent the 6,234,878 votes cast by supporters of the Labour party, while only five Liberals were returned representing the 5,499,231 votes cast for Liberal candidates. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- There is no suggestion under the system of proportional representation that av minority can te given the power of a majority. All that proportional representation sets out to achieve, and will achieve with mathematical accuracy, is that minorities shall be represented as well as majorities in the proportion of the votes polled. The figures I have quoted show that the existing electoral system for the Senate is hideously unfair. Reference has been made to Tasmania. We have among the members of the Senate an ex-Premier of that State, who has had considerable experience in connexion with the proportional system. I shall quote briefly what has actually occurred in Tasmania since proportional representation was adopted in that progressive and intelligent State. In 1909, the Labour votes polled amounted to 19,067; the Liberal votes totalled 29,893. The approximate proportion of the votes polled, Liberal to Labour, was as 18.31 is to 11.69 ; and the seats actually obtained were, Liberal to Labour, as 18 is to 12 - the nearest exact proportion that could have been secured te the aggregate of the votes polled. In the 1912 election, Labour polled 33,634; the Liberals polled 40,252. The proportion of each side to votes polled was, as Liberal to Labour, in the ratio of 16.34 to 13.66, and the numbers ultimately elected were as 16 to 14 - again, in almost the exact ratio to the votes polled by both sides. In 1913, Labour polled 31,633; the Liberals polled 36,157 votes. The Independents polled 977 - a negligible quantity. The ratio of votes polled, as Liberal to Labour, was as 15.78 is to 13.77; and the members actually elected,' again, were as nearly as possible in the exact ratio of the votes cast by both sides. Labour elected 14, and the Liberals elected 16. </para>

                            <para>- No ; the proportional system will reflect mathematically as nearly as" possible the opinions of the electors. We have no right, in a Chamber of this character, to dictate to the electors who shall and shall not be candidates for the Senate. The only objection that can reasonably be lodged against this system is as to the matter of the somewhat, complicated method of counting. But I am informed on unimpeachable authority that 100,000 votes per day can easily be counted. Seeing that under present circumstances the final returns for the Senatorial elections throughout Australia are not usually published within three weeks of polling day, there will be ample time to count the votes under the proportional system, if they are to be counted at the rate of 100,000 per day; and no delay will occur in announcing the final returns. </para>

                            <para>- More so even than to the House of Representatives, because proportional representation cannot be applied to single-member constituencies, and no alteration is necessary in senatorial constituencies to apply the principle of proportional representation forthwith. I hope that the Government, even at this late stage, will favorably consider the question of voting at the next elections for the Senate.- No senatorial election can take place for nearly two years, unless there be a dissolution. The Constitution provides that, should there be any unexpected vacancy, it is to be filled by the State Parliament concerned. But, regarding the next elections, which, perhaps, will be the most important in the history of Australia, I suggest to the Government that if this Bill is now carried without an amendment of the system of voting for the Senate, needless confusion will be caused at the poll, and a state of things brought about- with which the Government will not be pleased. "We can now, by a slight amendment of the Bill, bring the method of voting for Senate candidates into line with that of voting for candidates for the House of Representatives, and by another small amendment we can make the count of the Senate voting in accordance with the principle of the single transferable vote, a necessary reform, which would be acceptable, I think, to the majority of the electors. These amendments will make it impossible that the representation of the people in this Chamber shall be anything but reasonable. </para>

                            <para>- My _ honorable' friend misconceives the position. Proportional representation will not allow minorities to rule; it will provide for the representation of majorities and for the representation of large minorities as well. With proportional representation, if the electors were divided as they were at the last election, it would be impossible to have less than twelve senators of one party and more than twenty-four of the opposing party. The present state of affairs is undesirable, and we should not risk the return of eighteen more Nationalist candidates at the next election , </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend is not going to get me. into a cornet. At the last election there was a straight-out fight between Nationalists and Labourites, and every man was bound to be loyal to the ticket of his party. But the anomalies of the past should not continue. It would be better for the country if our electoral law were amended so as to give a fairer representation in the Senate of the political views of the electors. Surely it will be conceded that it would be better to have in this Chamber twenty-four members of one party and twelve of another than to have the whole thirty-six members of one political party, and have the opposing political party totally excluded from representation. </para>

                            <para>- I have said what I think of what occurred last night, and I hope that I have not added fuel to the flame. I have endeavoured to bring back the minds of honorable senators to the Bill. I have urged, to the best of my ability, the adoption by the Senate of the principle of proportional representation. I have shown how that long-needed reform can be obtained by two small amendments. At every election I have pledged myself to secure proportional representation, and some of the members of this Government are similarly pledged. I see no objection to that system of voting, and I urge the Government, if it is not prepared to allow this Bill to be amended, to promise to give careful consideration to the reform before the next election, so that in the future there may not be a danger of the Senate being in the ill-balanced condition of the past, and that the method of voting may be fairer. </para>

                        <para>- The first reason that I shall advance against the reading of the Bill a second time is that a writ has been issued for the election of Corangamite, and I have always understood that the issue of a writ entirely governs the course of . the election to which it applies. Once a writ has been issued, no names can  be  added to an  electoral  roll. </para>

                            <para>- When the sitting was suspended I was referring to the fact that at the present time more than 100,000. of our citizens are absent from this country. It is not right that we should amend the electoral law during their absence. Before any drastic alterations are made in existing electoral methods, the opinion of the electors themselves upon those alterations should be obtained. Had the Government made electoral reform a plank of their platform at the next election, by that time the men who have boon fighting our battles overseas would have returned, and would have been afforded an opportunity of voting upon this question.' That is my reply to those who urge that, even if these men  were  in Australia, they would not be permitted a chance of voting upon it. It cannot be claimed by any reasonable person that this Bill has received that amount of consideration to which it is entitled. In another branch of the  Legislature  I know that a certain procedure has been adopted to secure the limitation of debate. Hitherto it has been the boast of the Senate that our debates here cannot be guillotined. I have discovered, however, during the past twenty-four hours, that there is another method by which discussion may be shortened, namely, by physical exhaustion, and I candidly acknowledge that I have just about reached that stage. I have also learned that we have a standing order which sanctions the application of the "gag." I refer to the standing order which allows an honorable senator to move, " That the Senate do now divide," immediately any honorable senator has concluded his speech. </para>
