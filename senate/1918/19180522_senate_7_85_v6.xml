                <para>This  report affects, not only myself, but the Senate, and I, therefore, desire on this, the earliest opportunity, to move, as a matter of privilege, that the report be removed from the records of the Senate. I take this action without any personal feeling, and because I am absolutely of the opinion that if the record to which I refer is allowed by the Senate to stand without alteration, it will not merely do an injustice to myself, which it is my privilege and right to prevent, but what  is  much more important, will do an injustice to the Senate. That I may put the matter before honorable senators without passion or feeling, I may be permitted to read the whole of the report to which I take exception. It  will  be found at page 4747 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for 15th May. A discussion was going on in connexion with the report from the Select Committee on Intoxicants. A motion of dissent from a ruling of the . President had been moved. There then follows this report of the proceeding, which I shall read without comment: - </para>

                        <para>- It is very accurate. I have taken the precaution to read the whole of the report bearing on this unpleasant incident, so that when I am commenting on any part of it rib honorable senator will be in a position to say that I am commenting upon a part and holding something back. </para>

                    <para>I wish to approach this matter with no personal feeling, although I do feel - as any honorable senator in similar circumstances would feel - the indignity that has been placed upon me. But.I feel even more keenly the fact that, perhaps quite unintentionally in its conduct towards me, the Senate made a grave mistake. I propose to point out what that mistake is, and I am going to ask honorable senators who claim, as I do, that the Standing Orders are for the guidance of the Senate, to see that they are carried Out, even though an honorable senator like myself sometimes becomes objectionable. Standing order 440 has reference to " Proceedings on report of offence." I ask honorable senators to mark that marginal note. The standing order reads - </para>

Consequently, I am going to ask the Senate to expunge this record from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> because of the injustice which has been done to me. Unfortunately, I was not sufficiently acquainted with our Standing Orders at the time to know that I had the right to speak. But when the  President  read the standing order which prevented me speaking after the, motion had been carried, I saw the weakness of his position. I saw that, had he carried out the Standing Orders in their entirety, immediately before reporting me to the Senate, I should have been called upon to make an explanation or any apology I thought fit. I tried to get in that explanation, but wa9 prevented from so doing. I propose, therefore, to give the explanation, and I trust that I shall do it in the same frame of mind that I am in now. </para>

                    <para>I have had a long parliamentary career, thanks to the forbearance of the electors, and this is only the second occasion upon which I have been removed from the House. Upon the previous occasion, in the New South Wales Parliament, there was a proposal to construct a north coast railway. I rose to discuss the question, and the  Chairman  of Committees immediately called me to order. I made what he considered to be an impertinent remark. I said, "I represent a town on the western line, where we are agitating for lower freights. If we add to the cost of the New South Wales railways a railway which, the report shows, will involve us in a loss of £2,000,000 a year, surely I am in order in pointing that out." The  Chairman  replied that I was not in order, and thereupon I said, " That is just the sort of ruling which I would expect from you." I was at once removed from the chamber by the Serjeant-at-Arms. I may say that the Gloucester Company made a fortune by running that railway through their own land. They won their point by one vote. Had the standing order been strictly carried out that evening, had <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President</inline> called upon me to make an apology or explanation, my explanation would have been that I understood his ruling to mean that he had closed the debate. I never doubted that that was his ruling until I read the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report. If honorable senators read the record of the incident they will see how easily an honorable senator could act on that opinion. Honorable senators may ask me, " Why persist in these things?" The oldest and ablest parliamentarian I ever met advised me on one occasion never to let irregularities, though harmless in themselves, pass unnoticed, lest they acquired the force of precedents. I have followed that advice all my life, and even with the indignity of the Senate sitting in judgment on me, and removing me from my place, I am prepared still to follow it. I appeal to honorable senators to follow closely the record of the incident. If they then say that the standing order was carried out, they will adhere to their judgment, and refuse to take the action I now ask them to take. If you, sir, with the standing order before you, say that it was carried out, you are, of course, entitled to your opinion; but I venture to say that if that attitude is taken to-day by the Senate, which is, after all, the High Court of Parliament, and stands higher than all other Courts, and it refuses to reverse its decision with facts before it upon which in any other Court in Australia a reversal of such a decision could be obtained, a very bad precedent will be established. I base my claim that the report of these proceedings be expunged from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> on the ground that standing order 440 was not given effect to. I move - </para>

                        <para>- Before the Senate proceeds to consider the question, I should like to remove one misapprehension under which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> seems to be labouring. I wish to follow exactly the same course as he has followed - to speak entirely dispassionately on the matter, and allow the Senate to arrive at an unbiased judgment, without any reflection on any honorable senator whatever. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> seems to think that under the standing order it was my duty, after reporting him to the Senate, to give him an opportunity of making any explanation or apology that he thought fit. Neither <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> nor any other honorable senator will find that in any part of the Standing Orders, or in any part of the practice or procedure of this or any other House of Parliament. My duty ended when I reported the matter to the Senate. That is all I was required to do by the standing order. The usual practice has been for the Leader of the Senate, or the Leader of any other House in which a like incident occurred, to give the honorable member offending the opportunity referred to. Perhaps in the excitement of the moment, the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> did not make the usual pause before moving the motion. Honorable senators will see that under the standing order that opportunity must be given before the motion is moved, and not afterwards. </para>

                            <para>- I am not imputing anything, but stating a simple fact. What I wanted to lead up to was this, that clearly it is not the record about which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is concerned, because he has taken steps to preserve it. What he is asking the Senate to do is to reverse the judgment it arrived at the other night. Does the honorable senator take any exception to that way of stating the case? </para>

I say that on the previous day <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was acting in exactly the same manner as on the Thursday, and, when given an opportunity of explaining his attitude, he took advantage of it. So, after all, he was not inexperienced. He was experienced.  His  experience was less than twenty-four hours' old. On the previous day, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was invited by you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> to withdraw, he took advantage of the opportunity, and withdrew the words objected to, and put himself right , with the Senate. On the Thursday he was given the same opportunity on three occasions, but, right throughout, his attitude was one of defiance to the Chair. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable senator wants to escape on technicalities, he may do so. But, in a matter like this, I take the opportunity of reminding the Senate of the absolute necessity of maintaining the authority of the Chair. I had no wish to revive this matter - it has been revived by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> himself - so he must not blame other honorable senators if they take a view different from that which he holds in regard to this matter. I say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline> whole attitude throughout the debate was one of defiance to the Chair, and he had carried it to such an extent that it was impossible for you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> to ignore him. The Senate now has to make up its mind whether it will support the authority of the Chair, and require, even from its most distinguished senators, that they obey the Chair and the Standing Orders, or whether they will allow the authority of the  President  to be whittled down until it disappears altogether. There is one point which you, sir, have referred to, and upon which I differ from you, namely, that it is the duty of the Minister, or whoever may move the motion of suspension, to invite the honorable senator concerned to make an explanation or apology. I do not quite share your view on this point. Our standing order states - </para>

                            <para>- I have no more authority in a matter of this kind than is given to any other honorable senator, though it may be the usual practice of the Minister to move a motion, because he is responsible in this Chamber for insuring adequate support to the Presiding Officer. But the standing order leaves it open for any other honorable senator to move the motion. Can <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> say that he regards himself as being free of any responsibility for not having called upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> to obey the Chair? The obvious conclusion is that it is the responsibility of the Presiding Officer to see that the Standing Orders are carried out. On that point, therefore, I differ from you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President.</inline> I want to say, however, that it is the invariable practice, when a Minister is placed in the regrettable position of having to move such a motion, to make an appeal to the honorable senator concerned to withdraw the objectionable words It is the invariable practice, and I might have done so on the last occasion ; but I ask honorable senators to remember that when I did so on the previous day I did not receive a very graceful response from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline> Honorable senators must not lose sight of the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is asking the Senate to reverse the judgment passed upon him for his disobedience to the Chair.. </para>

                        <para>. -As one who was not present when this heated discussion took place, I may be allowed, in a few words, to approach it without any exhibition of partisanship. I have obtained my information from the newspaper report of the incident supplemented by the full <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report, and it appears to me that the speech just made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> is special pleading which ought not to come from the Leader of the Senate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has given what was simply a <inline font-style="italic">resume</inline> of what appeared in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and I am confident that if standing order 440 were placed before any tribunal in Australia, its judgment would bo that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was deprived of his right, which is also the right of every other honorable senator. I am pleased to know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> acknowledges that you, sir, failed in your duty in not, at the proper time, carrying out the letter of the standing order. It may be, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> hassaid, that the spirit of the standing order was observed, but it was not carried out technically; and I think that, when altercations occur between the  President  and any honorable senator leading to a suspension of an honorable senator, the standing order should be observed by you, sir, in the strictest letter, and to the end. Any honorable senator who reads the report of the debate will recognise that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> wa3 not allowed by you, at the proper time, in the proper place, and in the prescribed manner, to put himself right with the Senate. That is absolutely clear; and the honorable senator says he would have been able to show that his alleged defiance of the Chair on that afternoon, which has been made so much of by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> - or his actual defiance of the Chair - was due to the fact that he was resenting the position that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> had not been allowed to speak, because he felt that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> had not interpreted the Standing Orders properly. </para>

                        may have been right, and he may have been wrong; but the fact remains that he was not given an opportunity of making his explanation at the right time, or at any time. And it was that fact which led to his suspension. I can understand

                        or any other honorable senator, feeling the. matter so keenly that he might be led to continue in defiance of the Chair, and break the Standing Orders, because he has this excuse: that if he broke the Standing Orders by his continued defiance of the Chair, then, if there is any meaning in the English language at all, you, sir, also broke a standing order. You did not give
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline>
                        that opportunity which the Standing Orders plainly say must be given at the right time. You did not give him that opportunity to put himself right with the Chair. There is a standing order which, if there is any meaning in the English language, must be plain to every senator. It is a pity that, on an occasion like this, a standing order, which, if it is put into effect, becomes vital to every member of the Senate, should have been broken, even if only technically. And, therefore, whatever our party feelings may be, it would be well if you,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline>
                        concurred, and the Leader of the Senate also, that the records of the whole incident be expunged.

There is a most remarkable phase of the debate this afternoon to which I desire to draw attention. That is the statement of the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen),</inline> who justified the action of the Senate last Thursday, not upon what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> did on that occasion, and which is alleged to have been defiance of the Chair, but because of what he had done the day before. </para>

                            <para>- Any honorable senator who has listened carefully to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen's</inline> speech this afternoon knows that he pinned his faith, with respect to the action of the Senate last Thursday, on the attitude which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> had adapted the day before. I can only say that that is a most remarkable kind of justice. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> came into conflict with the Chair on Wednesday evening. He made use of a term which is not supposed to be parliamentary. He was called on to withdraw. He did not, at that time; and the assertion which he made, by the way, was against a statement of the Leader of the Senate. Then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was placed in a rather curious position, because, in that capacity, he had to move for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline> suspension. But, in doing so, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> to take another view of the matter. And in  such a way did he put it that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> made the <inline font-style="italic">amende honorable</inline> to the senator and to the Senate, and thus that matter ended. But because another incident occurred on the following day - a matter of an entirely different nature, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was asking for the right of another honorable senator to address himself to a question arising out of a ruling by you, sir, and which honorable senator you would not allow to speak at that juncture - then, because of the events which happened around that incident, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> this afternoon justifies the action of the Senate in the light of the attitude of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> the day before. What a wonderful point of view! In an ordinary Police Court in any part of the Commonwealth, if a man is charged with an offence, and pays the penalty, they dare not adduce that against him if he comes before the Court again. </para>

                            <para>- Will the honorable senator please resume his seat. The question which the Senate is discussing now is a motion for expunging from the records of the Senate and <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the incident connected with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline> suspension. The records of that incident have been fully set out this afternoon. They have been read over by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> who, I think, did not omit a single item. Every honorable senator will have a perfect right to discuss the motion, and everything connected with that incident; but every honorable senator has not the right to discuss the proceedings of the Senate which preceded the matter in question, or something that took place elsewhere, except, perhaps, by way of a ruling, or an illustration to a point desired to be made. Otherwise, the discussion would become interminable, and there would be no opportunity of arriving at a distinct judgment on the matter before the Senate at the present time. </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly that is the duty of the  President.  No private member can stand up in his place - not even a Minister - and call upon any honorable senator to do something at a certain juncture. What is the  President  for? What are the  Chairman  and the Temporary  Chairman  of Committees for? Undoubtedly - and I am not making this any personal reflection on yourself, sir - the Chair did not give <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> the chance he should have got under standing order 440. You can take that statement whatever way you like. The  President  did not on Thursday evening last give effect to standing order 440 and afford <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> an opportunity to explain his position before he was suspended. That is all I have to say. I hope the Senate will review the matter, and expunge the record of the incident. </para>

I am glad to learn that he was labouring under a misapprehension on the occasion upon which his conduct caused his suspension.

In my view, the standing order upon which he bases his claim for the removal of the record of the incident' from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> and from the <inline font-style="italic">Journals of thu Senate</inline> has been slightly misread. </para>

                            <para>- I have said that standing order 439 provides that in case of disorder in Committee the  Chairman  of Committees shall suspend the business, the  President  be called in, and the  Chairman  report the disorder that has taken place. Then the  President  immediately calls upon the disorderly senator to make his explanation. That is necessary, in that case, otherwise the  President  would not know what all the fuss was about. After the explanation, if it is not considered satisfactory, the Leader of the Senate moves the motion for the suspension of the "disorderly senator. That is the practical application of the standing order, and we must take a practical view of what was intended by those who framed it. When the  President  has been driven, we may suppose, to 'report an honorable senator for disorderly conduct, is it not absurd to suggest that the same  President  should then ask the of- fending senator to make an explanation? I have given my view of the matter. I was very sorry for the whole incident, but I can see no reason for expunging the record of it from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> or the <inline font-style="italic">Journals of the Senate.</inline> If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> sets up any claim, apart from his rights under that standing order, that he was unjustly treated - </para>

                        <para>.- I intend to vote for the motion. I shall do so because I believe sincerely that a grave injustice has been done to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> by his suspension from the sitting of the Senate on the occasion referred to. I did not wish to interrupt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> when he was speaking, but. I say now that the standing order upon which he relied to justify his objection to voting for the motion has not anything whatever to do with the real point at issue raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline> That is governed exclusively by standing order 440. You, sir, were good enough to allow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> plenty of latitude to deal with standing order 439, which refers solely to disorder which may arise in Committee. </para>

                            <para>- There is no doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> came into conflict with the Chair. That the honorable senator has admitted. He has not attempted to run away from that position for a moment. He claims, and I agree with him, that he did not receive the protection which the Standing Orders afford him, in common with every other member of the Senate. You, sir, in your explanation, have told the Senate that you took a certain course, and that your responsibility ended there. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> in his explanation, told us that he was bound to give effect to your report by moving that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> be suspended. If honorable senators will read the official report of the dispute - if I may use that term - between <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> and the Chair, they must come to the conclusion that there seemed to be undue haste on the part of the  President  and on the part of the Leader of the Senate in moving the motion of suspension. </para>

                    <para class="block">That is briefly the history of this very regrettable incident; and any impartial person, upon reading the official report of it will, I venture to say, agree with me that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was harshly treated in being subjected to the indignity of being suspended from the sitting of the Senate for the alleged offence of continued disobedience to the Chair. If honorable senators are prepared to calmly consider the case upon its whole merits, they will see that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is perfectly justified in the application which he is now making to have this record expunged from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and from the official records of the Senate. Without any hesitation whatever, I shall support the motion, and I would accord the same support quite as freely to any other honorable senator who found himself in the same position as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> occupies today. </para>

That being so, it appears to me that, having started upon a wrong basis, the whole of the subsequent proceedings are entirely vitiated. The rights of honorable senators are amongst the most precious things connected with our parliamentary system, and one of the rights of any member of this Chamber is that, before judgment is passed upon him, he shall have an opportunity of putting his position and of stating his case. </para>

A very ingenious, but rather far-fetched, argument in connexion with this matter has been advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle.</inline> He has put it that the rights of an honorable senator vary according to whether he commits an offence in Committee or in the Senate itself. He has urged that, under standing order 339, a disturbance having occurred in Committee, the circumstance is reported to the  President,  who calls upon the offender for an explanation, for the reason that the  President  has no previous knowledge of the incident. But I would point out to him that it is not the  President  who has to pass judgment upon an honorable senator who is accused. It is the Senate which has that right. Of course, the responsibility of taking action devolves upon the Leader of this Chamber, and it is for him to move that the honorable senator in question be suspended. But it is then for the jury, which is represented by his fellow senators, to pass judgment upon the alleged offender. It is not to the  President  that an explanation is due, and consequently the argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> falls entirely to the ground. Holding that the whole of the subsequent proceedings were vitiated by a breach of our Standing Orders in the first place, I do not think that the Senate would be exhibiting any lack of dignity by acknowledging its error, and taking the action for which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has pleaded. From the reports which he has read, it seems to me that he did not treat this matter - at any rate in the final stage - in a refractory manner. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot forget his attitude towards the  President  on that evening. All those honorable senators who have spoken appear to have entirely forgotten one point which appeals to me very strongly. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> rose to speak, the  President  intervened, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> had to give way. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> then got up, and objected to the  President  taking <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy's</inline> place. I did not object to him doing that at the time, but afterwards it was made quite clear to me - and the statement which he has read this afternoon emphasizes the point - when during the debate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie remarked across the table to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> " This does not finish the debate," that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> was not being thus deprived of his right to speak at a later stage. </para>

                            <para>- As the official head of this Chamber, the  President  was not allowed to put the case to honorable senators in a dispassionate way. In my opinion, he rose to stop an acrimonious debate, and, as the guardian of the rights and privileges of this Senate, to state his view of the matter. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> never allowed him to exercise that right. The honorable senator was told by the  President  that he was merely going to explain the position, and that his action would not prevent other honorable senators from having their say afterwards. That point, I repeat, was emphasized by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie's remark across the table. That is why I disagree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline> contention, and why I cannot vote for this motion. It was distinctly stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> had not been deprived of his right to speak, which was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline> contention all the time. </para>

                            <para>- The  President  is in his place to carry out the Standing Orders, and, in my opinion, has done so very impartially all through, especially ou the occasion on which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> defied him. It was the worst case of defiance towards a Presiding Officer which I have seen in my experience in any Parliament, and I have been in a few. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Gardiner's  attitude was so strong that he "would not allow the  President  to make his statement. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has raised a mere technical point now as to when he should have been offered a chance to explain. He was given a chance three times by the  President,  and my opinion is that the  President  was just a little too lenient with him. </para>

I believe in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> fighting for all he thinks is worth fighting for, but I have always felt very strongly that every official should be treated on all occasions with respect. Although I have defied Speakers and Chairmen of Committees over and over again, I have always resumed my seat as soon as those officials rose to their feet, because that is the right attitude for members to assume towards any official who has been placed in the chair to preserve order in a deliberative assembly. However much -we may disagree with them, and however much we may fight them - and it is the privilege of members to fight them as much as they like - they should bo treated with respect when they rise to their feet, and allowed to give their ruling or judgment without interruption. On the night that he was suspended <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was not in a frame of mind to listen to anything. </para>

                            <para>- It was not the honorable senator's remarks. There was nothing particular in his words, but it was his attitude. According to the report which the honorable senator read just now, the  President  gave <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> three opportunities to apologize. He was rather lenient, in my opinion, in making three appeals to the honorable senator. The honorable senator had assumed in his own mind that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> could not speak, and that the  President  was robbing him of his opportunity. I was with him up to that point, because I did not think the  President  had the right to rob any senator of his right to speak. </para>

                    <para>SenatorREID. - As soon as the  President  said that he was not robbing <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy,</inline> or anybody else, of his right to speak, because he had not closed the debate, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline> attitude to the  President  should have been one of silence. He should have listened to the President's statement, because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> was not robbed of anything. That is why I have no sympathy now with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> when, on a mere technical point, he asks the Chamber to expunge the record from the <inline font-style="italic">Journals</inline> and from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> had been then in the frame of mind that he is in now, he would have listened to the  President,  and there would have been no suspension. It was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline> frame of mind, and the words he used, that led <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> to move the motion, as he said, without comment, because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> had defied the  President  right up to the very minute, and finished up by saying, " I have done nothing that can be considered offensive to the President." </para>

                            <para>- Yes; because all the evening the honorable senator had been taking up an attitude that was most offensive, and outrageous, and discourteous to any, official presiding over a deliberative assembly. I thought <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was quite justified in moving the motion without a word, and that the  President  was quite justified in putting it through. We should always treat officials in the chair with respect, and if I had been the  President,  instead of giving the honorable senator one night's suspension, I would have suspended him for a week or a month. </para>

It is not that I have any feeling about <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> personally one way or the other. I am speaking simply as one who believes in the preservation of order in a deliberative assembly. We cannot have order unless proper respect is paid to the Chair. Because of the continued disrespect that was shown to the Chair, I thought a lesson should be taught, so that honorable senators on either side of the Senate would remember that the  President  and other officials must be treated with respect. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was very leniently dealt with, and if the  President  has no power to suspend an honorable senator for a month, I would be prepared to amend the Standing Orders to give him that power in similar circumstances. </para>

                            <para>- The Standing Orders of the Senate are a little different from those of the House of Representatives, and as I was for a number of years in the House and am a comparatively new member of the Senate, I am influenced a good deal by the procedure of the other place. I take it that the whole question is whether or not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> had the right before a vote was taken to make an explanation of his action. I did not know until I read standing order 440 that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> had the right to make an explanation, and I do not remember hearing <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> given the right to explain what he had done. I do not say that it did not take place, but all that I heard was the opportunity given to him again and again to apologize unreservedly. That, however, is not the point. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> says that, according to standing order 440, he should have been given an opportunity either to apologize or make an explanation before he was condemned. I confess that I was not aware of the existence of such a standing order in this Chamber. I know that in the other place we have no such standing order ; and I speak feelingly on this matter, because on one occasion I was removed from the House of Representatives, and I felt it very much for a long time. Had there been an opportunity on that occasion to explain my attitude, I feel sure the incident would not have happened. The question is whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was given this opportunity or not. I admit that he had an opportunity, half-a-dozen times, to apologize, but he wanted to explain his attitude; and I understand, now, that he was defending the right of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> to speak, under the impression that the debate was being closed by the  President.  We are perfectly justified in taking <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline> word for that. I thought the same, though I may have been wrong. </para>

                                were the greatest criminal that had ever lived, and had been elected to this Senate, he would still have every right, under our Standing Orders, that is accorded to any other honorable senator. I have heard the  President  again and again, when giving a ruling, declare that he had nothing to do with the Standing Orders, that he was only the custodian of them, and it was his duty to see that they were carried out. In such circumstances, the  President  is quite right. An opportunity for explanation was not given to
                                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline>
                                before his suspension. We ought to be very careful of our Standing Orders, because what happened to

                                on Thursday last may happen to any other honorable senator tomorrow. The standing order referred to by

                                gives an- honorable senator an opportunity, amidst the heat of debate, to explain his position in a few words, which perhaps may have the desired result. I have not heard yet that such an opportunity was given to

                                was given the opportunity that should have been extended to him under our Standing Orders.

                            <para>- I am always sorry when a conflict occurs between any senator and the Chair. I think we ought to support the ruling of the Chair, wherever possible; and I have always voted for the suspension of an offending member except in the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> and, in my own case in another place, because I thought that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was being removed unfairly. In the other place, the motion for my suspension was only carried on the casting vote of the  Speaker. </para>

What occurred subsequently may, perhaps, have been somewhat in conflict with the Chair, but as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> did not hear the closing sentence uttered by the  President,  I, for one, am going to vote to have the record expunged from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>

                        <para>.- As the innocent cause of what happened on Thursday last, I may be permitted to say a few words. On the occasion referred to, I was present throughout the whole sitting, and, as usual, gave the debate my closest attention. When I rose to speak on the question, the  President  also rose, and intimated that he thought that the question had been discussed sufficiently. My first impression was that I was shut out. How this was going to be brought about I did not know, but I thought that some standing order with which I was not familiar would prevent me from speaking, or that possibly there was a time limit to the debate. At all events, that was my first impression, but soon afterwards the  President  cleared the matter up by saying that I would not be prevented from speaking later. I think that there was a misunderstanding, and I honestly believe that all through <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was under the impression that I was to be prevented from speaking. We all admire a man who fights for his rights when he thinks he is being imposed upon, and I make an appeal to honorable senators to sink all party differences in this matter. </para>

Evidently the  President  thought that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was defying him, and, apparently, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was labouring under a misapprehension. While persistently disobeying the Chair he ought to, have been rebuked, but, under the circumstances, he was doing quite right, so I am going to appeal to honorable senators to remove the record from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> Do not let it remain on our records that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was put out without recourse to that standing order, and without an opportunity to make an explanation; for I verily believe that had he been given the opportunity he could, in two or three words, have explained the whole situation, and it would have been seen that there was a misunderstanding. In fact, there were misunderstandings all round, so let honorable senators start <inline font-style="italic">de novo,</inline> and remember that standing order, since it is a very good one. Its purpose is clear. It is to provide against misunderstandings of this kind, namely, that whenever an honorable senator has been reported as having committed an offence he should be called upon to stand up and make an explanation. That, in this instance, was not done. </para>

I have read the report of the proceedings, and I heard the debate at the time ; and I must say that I hold a directly opposite opinion from that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid.</inline> I am convinced that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was anxious to make an explanation, and I feel sure that it was because he was smarting under that disability, and felt that an injustice was being done him, that he adopted such an attitude. Most other honorable senators, if they felt that an injustice was being done them, would, at any rate, resent it. Had <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> been given an opportunity to make an explanation he would have made it clear to the Senate. Unfortunately, however, not one honorable senator knew there was such a provision in the standing order. I, at least, did not. </para>

                    <para>A very lame case was put before the Senate this afternoon by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle,</inline> in quoting the preceding standing order as an excuse for what arose. I could not help smiling, for the honorable senator had evidently mistaken it for something else, and was trying to read into the situation a standing order which applied to a distinctly different position. No honorable senator who has yet spoken has made it clear that the provision in standing order 440 was carried out. Even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> whom we can all admire for his ability and alacrity in getting hold of a point, admitted that technically it was not carried out. </para>

I trust that we shall sink any feeling that Honorable senators may have and wipe the whole business off the records. I thought at first that I was going to be prevented from speaking to the motion. As I have indicated, that was certainly my first impression from the statement of the  President.  But be subsequently removed that, and indicated that I would have another opportunity. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> did not hear that. He still laboured under the misunderstanding that I. was prevented from speaking, and he felt that an injustice was being imposed on me. The whole incident, therefore, rests upon a misunderstanding; and the quickest and best way is for us to agree that the record be expunged so that it may appear as if the incident had not occurred at all. </para>

                        <para>. - As one of those honorable senators present throughout the occasion which has given rise to this discussion, I want to say that I carried away a vivid recollection of everything that happened. I was very much interested in it because of the motion of dissent from the ruling which you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> had given upon another matter - because of" the bearing of the discussion on that particular motion. Consequently I was somewhat in sympathy with. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> when he rose at the moment that he came into conflict with you. Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy,</inline> who by the way has given a very fair account of how the matter appeared to honorable senators generally, I was somewhat under the same impression, and I could then see a very good reason for that impression being held by honorable senators, namely, that the rising of the  President  would have the effect of closing the debate so far as that other point of order was concerned. That was owing to the first sentence to which the  President  gave utterance. But as the  President  proceeded, and knowing as I did that his speech did not close the debate on the other point of order, I made a remark across the floor of the chamber - speaking at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> who was on his feet, but who did not hear me, I think. The reason why I interjected was to acquaint <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> with the point. I said, "The  President,  speaking at this stage, does not necessarily close the debate." Whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> heard me or not I am not going to say. </para>

                    <para>During this discussion the idea has occurred to me that standing order 440 is not quite so clear as it might he. It is one which requires a further standing order to fully meet a position such as has arisen. The procedure of putting standing order 440 into operation is not quite clear to honorable senators. I agree with the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> wherein he drew attention to the fact that one must read No. 440 in conjunction with standing orders 438 and 439. Then, any one reading the three together could come to no other opinion than that these are the standing orders which may be put into practice when disorder has occurred in Committee. The one follows on the other, and would lead. one to believe that that is the procedure for disorder occurring in Committee only, and that disorder when the  President  is in the chair is of such a nature that these standing orders do not apply to it. For that reason, therefore, I think No. 440 needs amending. But, if action is not taken to suspend an honorable senator under standing order 440, on the ground that it does not apply, then we are in the unfortunate position that we have no standing order whatever under which to suspend an honorable senator. </para>

                            <para>- I assure the honorable senator that I carried no party spirit into the vote which I cast. I was rather inclined to be sympathetic with him, but he deliberately came into collision, and so repeatedly, with the  President,  when he was on his feet, that he put himself out of court, and has now no claim, therefore, to ask that the decision of the Senate be set aside. I do not say that in any triumphant tone at all. But so far as the Standing Orders are concerned, they were undoubtedly given effect, and I have not heard any case made out for rescinding the motion, or for going back on the vote which I cast. </para>

Altogether, the decision of the Senate was arrived at with the full consequences of the case before honorable senators, when they had everything fresh in their minds as to what had transpired. I regret that I cannot see my way clear to reverse my vote. </para>

The terms of the motion are that there should be expunged from the records of the Senate and from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the account and report of the proceedings of Thursday night last in relation to this incident. Let that motion be carried, and the account and report be expunged from the records and from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and then what will be the position ? A much more elaborate record of those proceedings will take its place in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>

                            <para>- But not with satisfaction to the Senate. I was present on Thursday evening, and witnessed and heard the whole of the proceedings. T must say that I regretted to have had that experience in the Senate, and I sincerely hope that there will be no repetition of it. My sympathy at first went out to a large extent to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline> I realized that he, perhaps, had misunderstood the position. But there was no reason why he should have misunderstood the position the  President  was taking after the interjection by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie to the effect that the President's interposition in the debate at that time did not close the debate. Notwithstanding that, I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> will agree with me that he was during the next quarter of an hour repeatedly in defiance of the Chair. The Senate took its action afterwards when the  President  reported the honorable senator. The Leader of the Senate moved, under standing order 440, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline> suspension from the sitting. I recognise that it was the duty of the  President  to call upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> for an explanation or an apology. I recognise, further, that notwithstanding what has been said this afternoon, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> did not get an opportunity  for an explanation. He was given an  opportunity  for a withdrawal and an apology repeatedly, but I do not think that he got an opportunity for an explanation. What was the position? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> moved the motion for suspension, and it was then open for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> or any one on his behalf, at that time to take a point of order that the motion was out of order, inasmuch as the condition precedent to it had not been fulfilled, namely, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> should be given an opportunity, after report and before the motion, to make an explanation or an apology. </para>

                            <para>- It would have been allowed. There is no reason to assume that the  President  would have disregarded the standing order. A point of order raised would have taken precedence, as a matter of privilege takes precedence, and all other business is suspended for the time being. But, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> has said, no one seemed no remember that a point of order might have been taken. I think, sir, that you slipped; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> slipped; we all slipped, and I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> fell.

                            <para>- Yes. I take the point that the time for raising the point of order was before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was conducted out of the chamber. This is not like a motion in arrest of judgment. This is taking a point at a time subsequent when no practical advantage can result from asserting, it. It is too late, in my opinion, to take the point now to secure any practical advantage from it. After all, what does it come to ? Are we, at this stage, to reverse the decision arrived at on Thursday, in the taking of which every one agreed? </para>

                            <para>- There is no obligation to do that thrown upon me. I wish we could get back to the time when the Senate assembled to-day. If, by moving a motion, I could bring that about, I should gladly move it. My contention is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is relying upon a point that has been discovered too late, and because of non-compliance with a technical requirement the Senate suspended him, he now asks that we should reverse that judgment, which was deliberately arrived at, irrespective of technicalities, upon what honorable senators considered to be the merits of the case. I cannot support his motion for that reason. </para>

The punishment, whether deserved or not, was not imposed under the laws of the Senate. The honorable senator was punished because he attempted to do something which he had a right to do. The spirit of the law has nothing to do with this case or any other, but only the law itself and the way in which it is interpreted. If a law is wrongly interpreted by a judge in addressing a jury the defendant has a right to redress, no matter what punishment has been imposed upon him. I know from what has been said by honorable senators on the other side that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline> motion will not be carried. Honorable senators opposite dare not do justice to the honorable senator. I would not have taken any part in the debate but for the explanation of the matter given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> and because I wished to say that his explanation has satisfied me that the punishment inflicted upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was not according to the Standing Orders, and he is now right in asking for the only redress that is open to him. </para>

The President's report under standing order 438 is the basis for action under standing order 440. That action does not arise under standing order 439 in any sense at all, because that standing order deals entirely with proceedings in Committee and a report from Committee. Standing orders 439 and 440 are distinct and separate. Coming to standing order 440 and the opportunity given to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> under that standing order, the honorable senator claims that he was not given the opportunity he was entitled to. </para>

How can it be said that he was denied it when the  President  asked him to withdraw and apologize on four different occasions during the course of the debate ? He was given that opportunity. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> is sufficiently familiar with our Standing Orders to know that after he had withdrawn he would have been at liberty, on our next day of sitting, to give the reasons which had prompted him to do so, as a matter of privilege. He would thus have obeyed the Chair, would have shown himself what he usually is, namely, an honorable man, and would have cleared himself. Now he cannot do that. When an honorable senator disobeys the Chair he must either withdraw or continue in his disobedience. </para>

                            <para>- The Judge does not ask a pickpocket to explain why he put his hand in another man's pocket and endeavoured to take out his purse. The whole question at issue is " Was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> guilty of disobeying the Chair or not?" <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> says that he was. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President</inline> says that he was. The Senate says that he was. Thus we have three witnesses in this matter. As the honorable senator was guilty of an offence, there was only one course open to him, namely, to withdraw and apologize. The Senate cannot stultify itself by reversing the verdict which it gave on Thursday evening last. Nothing can conceal the fact that four times <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> was asked to withdraw and apologize, and that four times he declined to do so. </para>

I shall certainly not allow a point of order, such as was taken against me a week or two ago, to pass unchallenged again, and I think that this debate might be well settled by our giving way a little all round. </para>

                        <para>. - I am not going to apologize to the Senate for this debate. To me it has been very interesting. Further, I am going to relieve honorable senators of the impression that I have asked for their sympathy. I have not. They gave a wrong decision under our Standing Orders, and I ask them to do what they can to put themselves right. I should like to make that point perfectly clear. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has very well put it, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> slipped, the  President  slipped, and I fell. </para>

                            <para>- Let us view this matter without feeling. Necessarily we view it always in the light of how we interpret our Standing Orders. Having listened to the debate, and having noted that it followed the line which it did, I took the trouble to turn up <inline font-style="italic">Chambers' Dictionary</inline> for the purpose of ascertaining its definition of " apology." Several meanings are given : " Something spoken to ward off an attack; a defence for justification; a frank acknowledgment of an offence." Those are all different definitions of " apology." If I hold a different view of the meaning from some honorable senators, am I to be blamed ? I said I was willing to withdraw anything, but I would not admit I was wrong, and when this debate is over I shall still stand as firm in my conscience as I was then, that I was absolutely right in every step I took. Yon, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> gave the ruling that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy-</inline> was not to speak. Let me give your exact words, because, after all, this is where the whole trouble came in. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> rose and said, <inline font-weight="bold">"Mr. President."</inline> You said - </para>

                            <para>- I am not going to debate whether it was or was not. On a recent occasion <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> was quoting from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I took the point that he was out of order in quoting <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of an earlier part of the session. You upheld that point of order. It was no business of mine to interfere with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> on that occasion, because he was attacking the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> and as Leader of the Opposition I should have revelled in that attack ; but I took the point of order in the desire that not even the slightest irregularity in debate should pass without question. I am not claiming that what I have just read was not your full statement. I simply say that I did not hear it, and Senators Thomas, de Largie, and Guy were under the same impression. It is, therefore, quite easy to understand that I was of the opinion that you had ruled that enough had been said, or, in your own words - </para>

                    <para class="block">I was quite startled at such a ruling. I have never claimed to be too well acquainted with the Standing Orders, and when the question of dissent from your ruling came up suddenly, I went to you and asked you if the motion was open for discussion, and found that it was. I believed' then that you had given a ruling that would take from the Senate its rights, and I admit that I was most persistent, but I was not offensive, with the exception of one unfortunate sentence to which I plead guilty. When you, sir, said I was offensive in interrupting you when you were on' your feet, I said " Good gracious, but you are never off your feet." That was one of those flippant remarks that should, not have been made. I admit it, but can any honorable senator who has been in the hurly-burly of parliamentary life truly say that he has never uttered one sentence that is wrong ? If he can, he is welcome to vote against me on this motion. </para>

                            <para>- That is the point. I am not- pleading here as a criminal. I am putting before the Senate the right of honorable senators to protect themselves. What will happen if honorable senators give their votes on party grounds? Let me first clear away <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle's</inline> far-fetched argument, that matters happening in Committee, and not matters happening in the Senate, 'are covered by standing order 440. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> argue that there is one line of procedure as regards asking an offending senator for an apology and explanation in the Committee, and another in the Senate ? </para>

                            <para>- That is very easily answered, because the  President,  after putting up with what honorable senators are pleased to exaggerate into defiance on my part, very properly  gave me an opportunity  to apologize. If standing up for our rights is defiance, honorable senators will find that I am fairly defiant whenever our rights are being taken from us. The  President  gave me that opportunity after the matter had gone some considerable distance, and after refusing to hear me on a point of order. I say this with all due respect to him. I rose to a point of order, and was not given a hearing, and he also refused to accept from me a motion to dissent from his  ruling. All these things, that are called " defiance," are the mere step-by-step statements of what I did. On that occasion not one defiant or angry feeling entered my mind. All I wished to assert was that the  President  had no right to close the debate. When you, sir, found I had gone so far, and when you took my remark as offensive, you threatened me; you said - </para>

I appeal to you, sir, and I feel sure that you will answer my appeal justly, to say whether the opportunity was given to me to make any apology or explanation I might think fit. You did give me an opportunity to apologize, but I think you will be just enough to say that the opportunity to explain was not given." I may well take your silence, sir, as an admission that I have fairly stated that incident. The Senate said I was guilty of an offence, but my only offence on that occasion was to stand up, not for my own rights, but for the right of the Senate as against what I took to be your action in closing the debate. Your words that I heard on that occasion meant that you were closing the debate. Had I heard your next sentence, nobody would have more readily accepted it than myself. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> said I was offered three opportunities of exercising my right under the Standing Orders.

                    <para class="block">Instantly you interrupted me. I got no further. My intention was to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> had risen to speak, and that you, in quite an improper way, declared that the matter had been sufficiently debated by honorable senators, and refused him that right. I can quite understand that those words, taken by themselves, annoyed you. I make every allowance for your irritation at my conduct; but if any man can see anything offensive in that, all I can say is that I do not envy him his frame of mind. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> with his flippant " You have fallen," suggests that my fall was due to a slip by the  President  or the Leader of the Senate, but he says it is too late now to remove the injustice. I take also <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milieu's</inline> statement that I should have moved to rescind the resolution, and T reply that the only way that I could bring this matter to a debate to-day was by producing <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and asking that the question be again considered by the Senate. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> has said, we have excellent Standing Orders, which  provide that when there is irritation between the Chair and honorable senators, and when the dispute has been carried to such an extent that the  President  says, " I shall report the honorable senator to the Senate," time should be given for deliberation and consideration before the indignity of being removed is placed upon any honorable senator. Let me read standing order 440. </para>

                        Largie asks did I rise and ask for an opportunity to make an explanation ? I can say, openly and honestly that I sat in my place waiting for this measure of justice to be meted out to me. But it was not given to me. What happened ? When

                        moved the motion of suspension, I thought the  President  would call upon me to make any explanation or apology, but he did not. The motion was moved by

I knew that under it no drastic action could be taken without the honorable senator concerned being heard. And I remind the Senate that quite a number of other honorable senators have been in the same position; and I believe that while the Senate exists there will be found members sufficiently strong in their beliefs to fight for their lights when occasion demands. I appeal therefore to honorable senators not to allow -a wrong interpretation to be placed upon this standing order. I recognise that, on. many occasions, I may have said things offensive to honorable senators. We have had <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> reminding me that because I had taken a point of order upon him on one occasion, he was justified now in taking one upon me. That is a nice judicial frame of mind to bring to bear upon a question of this kind! On the other hand, there are. those who, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> say that because the  President  or the Leader of the Senate had made a slip, and I was suspended, it was too late to remedy the matter now. But I will be quite satisfied if the Senate will carry the motion I have submitted, in order to secure for other honorable senators in the future this right which is extended to them under our Standing Orders. </para>

                            <para>- I say that not only was I not offensive, but that I offered an ample apology to the  President.  It stands there in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> There can be no getting away from it. It was as full, ample, and as earnest an apology as has ever been offered by any honorable senator ; but that was not sufficient. And now I bring additional evidence in substantiation of my manly and straightforward statement, and. to show that the action of the Senate in expelling me was not in accordance with standing order 440. If honorable senators are prepared to smile, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> is smiling, or if they are prepared to wriggle out of the difficulty as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> wriggles out of it by suggesting that the standing order refers to procedure in Committee, I can say no more. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> maintains that the standing order refers to the Committee, I will ask him to read other standing orders as to the Committee, and see if they can be applied to the Senate. I say I was removed under a misapprehension' by honorable senators, who, in their hurry, or in their excitement - I do not care what they call it - did something which the standing order does not permit them to do. I decline to accept the narrow interpretation which some honorable senators wish to place upon the apology that was expected of me. I regard an apology made by me as a defence, or explanation, if need be, of my conduct. If, however, honorable senators want to drag the Senate down to the level of a bully, or an overseer of a gang of slaves who recognises no restriction, they may do so; but I can assure the Senate that while I am here I will use all the powers I possess to object to any course of action that is fraught with danger to the Senate. </para>

                    <para>The  President  himself admitted that standing order 440 had not been fully carried out because, according to him, I should have been called upon by the mover of the motion for suspension to make an explanation or apology. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> disputes this with the  President.  He denies that this is the duty of the Minister submitting the motion. I say that if, by my action, I have made clear what standing order 440 means, so that in future any other honorable senator may not slip, or be pushed out, something will have been achieved . It is clear and . unmistakable in its language, and definite in its direction. I never dreamt that when the proceedings had reached the stage of my being reported to the Senate, I would not be called upon to make an apology or explanation. Had that been done, I believe that my explanation would have removed any necessity for the subsequent action of the Senate, which thus placed an indignity upon me. I feel, as every other man feels when suffering an injustice, and I shall carry that sense of injustice to my grave. That may not concern some honorable senators very much; but I am satisfied that if any honorable senator who is listening to me now, and with all the knowledge of. the facts before him, puts party bitterness before judicial judgment, he will be committing a grave wrong. That, at all events, will be the interpretation which the public will place upon this incident. What other construction can be put upon the whole affair than that party bias overruns honest judgment, when the public read such facts as these: First, that the  President  acknowledged that the Standing Orders were not carried out, but that it was not his fault, and that the Leader of the Senate should have done so; second, that the Leader of the Senate held that the  President  should have done it ; and, third, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> with his legal mind, held that both the  President  and the Leader of the Senate slipped, but that he could not remedy it? </para>

                    <para>The knowledge that I have been fighting for the rights of all honorable senators against what I consider a wrong ruling, is strengthened by the fact that, in the course of this debate, no honorable senator has denied that I was removed from this chamber outside the Standing Orders. No honorable gentleman has dared to say that the Standing Orders were complied with. I appeal to the laws of the Senate, which you, gentlemen, yourselves have made, and which you insist upon the  President  carrying out. If you have found fault with my attitude outside of the laws governing the debates of this Chamber, and have unwittingly punished me, then, though you must realize that you cannot withdraw the punishment, you can still admit the justice of my claim that I was condemned unheard. I ask you, therefore, to reverse that verdict - to remove it. I would ask for an even more complete removal, but that I know that I would not be in order in doing so now. However, this would be ample for myself. There has not been an honorable senator who has spoken but who has admitted that a wrong has been done me. </para>

                            <para>- I will except <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle</inline> from all other honorable senators who have spoken, and who recognise that that part of standing order 440, which makes it imperative, when a charge is levelled against a member of the Senate, that he shall be given an opportunity to make an explanation or apology, was not carried out. There is no other honorable senator who will say that I was given such an opportunity. That being so, I leave it entirely in the hands of the Senate to do what little justice it can. It should remove the injustice which it did me on Thursday last, not that that will benefit me - for I do not ask for sympathy - but that this Chamber shall say that outside the Standing Orders no man shall be punished. I ask that the Senate, apart from personal feeling or party bias, shall sit , in judgment as to whether, under the standing order by which I was removed, I was given the full rights to which I was entitled. Honorable senators are in no way excited now. There is no argument between the  President  and one whom honorable senators might consider a defiant member. If honorable senators are not prepared to undo the injustice to myself, or to do themselves the credit of saying that they gave their judgment, not on the merits of my conduct - for I have been punished for that - but that I was adjudged guilty outside of the Standing Orders, then the responsibility must rest with them throughout the years. If the Standing Orders were not complied with, and if honorable senators refuse to amend their action in the matter, they will be setting , a precedent the effect of which they may ignore to-day; but will not be able to do so for ever. Never had a body of men a better opportunity of reversing an unjust verdict. The injustice of that verdict is not hurtful to myself, but to the men who have given it. </para>

If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> therefore, can shelter himself behind the statement that I did not take the point when opportunity was afforded me, he has done me another injustice. The injustice of the original decision was that it was contrary to the Standing Orders. My conduct does not come into the matter at all. </para>

                                <para>- What the honorable senator states is a fact, for the reason that we must not send officers back to the Front unless specially requested to do so by the General Officer Commanding. Obviously, if officers are invalided here and we send them back in the absence of such a request, we may find on their arrival there that they are not required, in which case they will be again returned to Australia. But the General Officer Commanding has, at different times, requested that an officer who has been sent back to Australia should be returned. Obviously, it is better that he should do that than that we should send back officers without reference to him. </para>

We Italians now feel that we are helpless to express our protestation against the introduction for Italians if our right of petition is to be taken from us. We appeal to you to assist us to retain this right, which, we believe, is recognised as an institution in the Commonwealth of Australia."

The honorable senator then stated that the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> and myself were taking certain action to make ourselves right with the temperance people, because we had voted in favour of the censorship of the <inline font-style="italic">Fiddler</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Defeat.</inline> But I would point out that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline> motion dealing with those publications was submitted on the 25th September last year, and that I had given notice of my motion for the appointment of the Select Committee on the 13th September of that year. As a matter of fact, that motion appeared upon the business paper of the Senate on the following day. It will be seen, therefore, that I had anticipated by twelve days the vote which I cast on the 25th September. I mention these facts in order to remove from your mind any suspicion that I moved for the appointment of the Committee merely for the purpose of whitewashing myself with the temperance party and also to make myself right with my temperance friends. I thank the Senate for allowing me to make this explanation, and in anticipation I thank you for the name of the newspaper to which you referred in order that I may communicate with it. </para>

                            <para>- Arising out of the answer, the Minister has evidently misunderstood the question. I asked what was the cost of carrying wheat to London in 1916. The Minister gives me some answer about no steamer being chartered. All I wanted to know was the freights for carrying wheat. I direct the Minister's attention to that point. </para>

                        <para>. - I desire to have the last kick at this measure before it gets out of reach. I shall protest at every opportunity anywhere and anyhow against the taking away of park lands from the people by the Government. I know nothing at all of any dealing in connexion with this land that has not been perfectly honest, and am opposing the Bill purely on the principle that there are not enough breathing spaces around the thickly populated suburbs for the people who are there now. I have seen too much of this sort of thing.We have heard of a promise that the people of Leichhardt will get another piece of land. I have heard promises of that kind given before, but in not one instance have they been carried out, and that applies especially to the very district where this land is. I have seen these reclaimed areas - of which there are three, and this is one of them - dedicated to the people for all time, and handed over to trustees. We clapped our hands, raised a cheer, and said, "These are ours for all time." One of them has gone for good; there is not an inch left of it. The best part of another has gone for five years, and now this one will be gone for evermore. It has been argued that no protest has been entered by the Municipal Council of Leichhardt. Probably not, and even if the Municipal Council were in favour of the Bill,I would still consider it my duty to stand up and protest against it, but the council are favorable to it only for one reason, and that is that they think they will get a better site. No promise of any description has been given to lead them to that conclusion. They are only going on the word of an officer, who made a promise to them that other land would be made available. The town clerk of Leichhardt, after having seen certain New South Wales members on the subject, put the position in writing in this way: - </para>

                        <para>Referring to the interview of His Worship the Mayor and myself with you this morning respecting the matter of the acquisition of certain park lands in this municipality by the Commonwealth Government, I am directed to inform you that this council did not formally protest against such resumption, as it understood that, at the date of the receipt of the first intimation thereof, the transaction had been completed, that is to say, the departmental  communication  covering such intimation was under date 10th April, 1918, whilst the specific proclamation of the acquisition was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Gazette</inline> of 18th March. Some day or two only before l'Oth April an officer of the Government interviewed the mayor on the subject, and gave him to understand that due compensation would be made by the Government in respect of the area thus taken. For these reasons the council did not consider that a protest would be effective. Although it waa, and is, most emphatically of opinion that the Commonwealth should provide another area for. public recreation purposes in lieu of that resumed, so that the park lands of this closely populated municipality shall not be curtailed. When it is remembered that the population of the municipality is over 30,000, and that it now has but one recreation ground (exclusive of the one under notice), and that at the extreme northern end of the area, the importance of this aspect will be apparent. It is recognised that difficulty may be experienced in securing another area of the size in the municipality, and I am. therefore, to suggest that the substitution might take the form of the conversion of the area known as the Balmain Cemetery into a recreation ground. That area comprises some tcn acres, situated at Norton Street, Leichhardt, in about the centre of the municipality. For many years the cemetery has been closed against burials, and the grave's and area generally are in a dilapidated and unkept condition. It is in a main thoroughfare traversed by a tram-line, and is right in the heart of dense population; so that from all points of view its continuance is very detrimental to the locality. The area is at present %'ested in this council, subject to certain restrictions as to its use, which might possibly, in the hands of the council, require adjustment by State legislation, and, further, the removal of bodies therefrom would have to be provided for; but, on the other hand, the purchase of land would be avoided. It is felt that such matters should not be incapable of adjustment, and I am, therefore, to suggest it to you as a practical means of overcoming the difficulty referred to. </para>

                    <para class="block">If the Leichhardt council thought they were going to lose this site for good, and not get another one, I do not think they would be in favour of the Bill. I believe they are going to lose the land for good, and I do not think they will get the other site. If the Government will give me a promise that they will hand over to the council the other ground mentioned, or get it for them, my objection will cease, but I have seen too much of this grabbing of .the public parks. The first thought that some public men have is to take away public reserves, even though for years before they entered Parliament they proclaimed that the health of the people was the one thing above ali others that they would safeguard. "We must have breathing spaces for the people," they cried, but as soon as the people get a little breathing space, the Government come along and annex it - steal it - and I have never known one case where the people have been compensated. If the Government will say, "We will bear the expense of removing the bodies from the old cemetery, and give the land to the people for a park," I will raise no further objection, but so far no promise has been given by the Commonwealth Government, the State Government, or anybody else. I therefore protest against the passage of the Bill. I hope the people of Leichhardt will get another area. If they do not, my words will be on record as uttering a last protest possible against, the alienation of the public parks that are so essential to the growth of our young nation. It is only too sad to find the present difficulty of child-raising, and it is also sad to contemplate the amount of diseased life in this Australia of ours, where there should be none. The keeping of the children out of their playgrounds, their air spaces, is one of the things that tends to assist the spread of disease, and I shall never be one, no matter where I am nor what the consequences are, to assist any Government in purloining the public parks from the people, and injuring the health of their children. </para>

To-night the Minister has made a statement on the subject, but, in my judgment, it is not sufficiently definite. Under this proposal the Government intend to resume one of the few remaining 0,pen spaces surrounding the waters of the harbor in the municipality of Leichhardt. It is not proposed to appropriate the land for a limited period, but for all time, and I am satisfied that if the opinion of the residents of Leichhardt were asked on this subject they would give an emphatic " no " to it. The local council, I understand, are prepared to abandon the reserve on the understanding that the Government will agree to make available, for recreation purposes, another area nearer the centre of the municipality. </para>

                            <para>- This whittling away of our public parks is most deplorable. To-night we were told that a considerable area of Wentworth Park had been taken over for a period of five years. Does any one imagine that if expensive buildings are erected on that property they will be removed at the end of five years? Certainly not. We know very well, from long experience, that whenever a park land is taken temporarily for any public purpose it is gone for all time, so far as the people are concerned. I do not know of a single instance, in Sydney at all events, of a public park, taken for temporary purposes, that has not been lost to the people for all time. Many fights have been put up against this policy of appropriating park lands, but, despite all protests, bowling greens and other similar institutions have been allowed to encroach upon these areas until finally a very considerable portion of our parks has been appropriated. Only recently, and in spite of strong objections, an area of Hyde Park was resumed in order to make one of the city thoroughfares wider, and, following upon that, the Government of New South Wales fenced in an area, apparently for the purpose of constructing a railway line. But while the railway is not being proceeded with, the fences are still there, and the public are shut off from that section of the park. This policy has been pursued in connexion with other parks as well. I am entirely opposed to the area referred to in this Bill being appropriated for all time. It is an excellent site for a public park - one of the very best in the municipality - and at the present time it is not encumbered with any buildings. 1 shall vote against the third reading of the Bill. At the <inline font-style="italic">same</inline> time I would like to get from the Minister a clear understanding as to the prospect of acquiring another park in the municipality and  how the money is to be disposed of. </para>

                    <para>There is just one other phase of the question which up to the present has not been touched upon. It will be within the recollection of honorable senators that it is not competent for local authorities to tax land belonging to the Commonwealth. The land upon which the head office of the Commonwealth Bank is situated, at the corner of Moore and Pitt streets, Sydney, is not liable to taxation by the Sydney City Council, but I understand that the Governor of the Bank has agreed, without prejudice, to pay to the council the sum of £1,000 annually. The Leichhardt Council, if this Bill is proceeded with, will have a considerable area transferred outside of their taxing authority, so I would like to know if the Minister for Defence is prepared to take the necessary steps to recoup the local council any loss in taxation, in somewhat the same way as has been done by the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. </para>

                        <para>. - As I happened to have been a mayor of the adjoining municipality, I regret I cannot go all the way with the opposition to this Bill. I know the locality very well, and, while expressing every sympathy with the opposition that has been shown, and which, I hope, will always be shown to the acquisition of park lands in any part of Australia, it seems to me that members of the Opposition are, in this instance, making a mountain out of a mole-hill. The area affected by the Bill has been reclaimed from a shallow part of the Parramatta River, or the Iron Cove section of it, and it has only recently been gazetted as a park. It has also been cut off from the centre of population by a railway. </para>

                            <para>- I am sure, if honorable senators could only see this section of land in Leichhardt which it is proposed to acquire, they would realize at once that it would be very much to the advantage of the local Municipal Council to have, as an exchange, a park area in the centre of the municipality, as has been suggested, by acquiring the cemetery area than by clinging to the land under review. I had some communication with the Leichhardt Council on this subject very early in the history of this movement. In their replies to me they said, in effect, that they noted the intention of the Commonwealth Government to resume the land, and were seeking compensation elsewhere. I understand that compensation was promised them, and that the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> to-night has also definitely undertaken, on behalf of the Government, that the money paid for this area shall be ear-marked for a further open space somewhere in Leichhardt. </para>

                    <para class="block">Whatever space is acquired in lieu of the area under review must be nearer the centre of population, as this site is practically in the western corner. There is a park in the adjoining municipality, called Robson Park, 10 acres in extent. This is one of the pretty points of the Parramatta River. While believing in the principle that public parks should not be taken by the Commonwealth Government unless under duress, I would ask honorable' senators to remember that we are at war, and that, in the case of portion of the Wentworth Park and the area under review, we are bound to do something, because this course of action is being forced upon us by the circumstances of the war. </para>

                            <para>- The Bill would not have been forced upon us but for the occurrence of the war, and, therefore, I ask honorable senators to get this matter in proper perspective. The area concerned is flat, reclaimed land, once part of a muddy area, in the extreme west of Leichhardt, and I am satisfied that, if an open space is given to the local governing body nearer the centre of population, it would be much more to the advantage of the people of Leichhardt and the western suburbs. I reiterate that, as I have created 20 acres of park land in the adjoining municipality, I can claim to have equal sympathy with any other member of this Chamber with the great principle of providing open-air spaces for the denizens of our crowded cities. But on this matter I believe that a <inline font-style="italic">quid pro quo</inline> will be obtained by the Leichhardt Council, and I understand that the members of that body, who are the responsible representatives in this matter, are not complaining. </para>

If the Minister will look up the history of New South Wales, he will find that the whole distribution has been done from Garden Island. There is another site, one of the best in the world for Ordnance Stores - the old Admiralty house at Kirribilli Point. Alongside that property there is a wool store eight or ten stories in height. I cannot understand why the authorities did not select that site instead of going on to a mud bank. This is one of the absolutely unnecessary expenses of the Commonwealth Government in maintaining that property whilst doing nothing with it. It is a site second to none in the world for the erection of Ordnance Stores, and we are making no use of it. But private enterprise next door has wool stores which contain a passage where barges go right underneath and discharge their cargoes inside the premises. </para>

                        when the relative merits of Dalgety and Canberra were being discussed as the site for the future capital of Australia, told us, out of the fullness of his experience as a builder, that it would not be possible for a building to be erected at Canberra, because foundations could not be put down there.

These will be probably four or five stories in height, if not more, and they will be built on reclaimed land upon which a foundation cannot be laid. , </para>

                            <para>- If we pass this Bill it will be a direction to the Public Works Committee that the Stores are to be erected on that site. That will be the direction of Parliament; and surely Parliament is a superior body to the Public Works Committee. There are hundreds of sites in Sydney Harbor without our having to touch the park lands at all - sites which would be far superior to that which is proposed. </para>

We are keeping a couple of soldiers there doing sentry duty, each of them costing the country 10s. per day, and the Government are making no use of that property. The buildings are empty. The Admiral is not resident there. The house is not in occupation. Nothing is being done with the grounds. Yet it is the best site in Australia for Ordnance Stores. </para>

If these Stores are to be built at all, let them be erected on our own property, which is not being used to-day, not bringing in a penny of revenue, and costing money for their upkeep. My particular opposition is that I am against the acquisition of any park lands at all. What would be said if it were proposed to erect Stores in Wynyard-square ? </para>

                            <para>- Even that would not be enough. But when  Colonel Light  laid out those park lands the land jobber came along and sought to get hold of them. The people of South Australia have a great deal to thank Governor Gawler for The dedication of those lands had to be sent to England, and, while that was taking place, the land jobbers were at work. Governor Gawler went personally to the Crown Lands Office with his own cheque for £3,500, and saved the park lands of Adelaide. I take up a similar position to-day in my desire to make the strongest protest possible against the alienation of any park lands in any part of Australia for the benefit of a few land jobbers. </para>

One was presented by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant,</inline> as to whether the Government proposed to make good the amount which the municipality would lose in rates as the result of the resumption of the private lands. That opens up a very big question, which has been repeatedly urged on respective Governments; and, so far, no Commonwealth Government have agreed upon it. Therefore, no such pro- mise can be made. </para>

Our representative saw the Minister for Lands, and he has informed us that the attitude of the New South Wales Government is that any money received from the Commonwealth as the result of the resumption of this land they are prepared to make available to secure another site for a park in a better position for the people of Leichhardt. It has been shown to the satisfaction of the council that if the site is secured which has been suggested, the people will be given a central spot for a park - one that has none of the disadvantages of Leichhardt Park, but many advantages which that place does not possess. </para>

                    <para>. - I have a few words to say concerning some improvements which I think might be made in this Bill in Committee. It is a machinery measure for the better adjustment of taxation, and to secure uniformity of taxation by the States and Commonwealth. I understood the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> to mention that matter in introducing the Bill. There is some controversy at the present time as to whether the States or the Commonwealth authority should collect all taxation. I think it would be the greatest mistake in the world for the Commonwealth Parliament to give up any of its rights to collect taxation. The Commonwealth Government should, in my opinion, be the only tax gatherers in this country, and this should be the only taxing Parliament. I hold very strong views on that point, as I consider it essential if the country is to be properly controlled. The Commonwealth Parliament has not the sole right to legislate upon many matters, and amongst them the levying of taxation.I hope that the time will come when Australia, so far as its government is concerned, will not be as it is to-day, the laughing-stock of the world. I hope that we shall soon see the day when rivalry between the States will be abolished, and we shall no longer have the sorry spectacle of seven different Australian agencies in London, and the representative of each State, not only pushing the wares of that State, but disparaging the products of all the other States. We have now the spectacle of a huge building, on which the Commonwealth has spent £800,000, on one of the finest sites in London, affording room for the accommodation of all the State agencies, and yet the State Governments refuse to take advantage of it because it does not give them an entrance of their own. The only State Government accommodated in the building is the Victorian Government, and really the reason for that is that the site was previously occupied by a building in which the Victorian agency was carried on, and the Commonwealth building has been erected over the top of it. The huge cost of government of this country is one of the things that is calculated to cripple the nation when the war is over. I believe that the Commonwealth Government should collect all taxes. We have to collect war-time profits tax, a land tax, bachelor tax, and other taxes, and if the States are to impose taxation as well, there must be separate taxation offices for State and Commonwealth throughout the country. Some of the State Governments claim that they can collect taxation more cheaply than can the Commonwealth Government, but I do not think that is so. Next year we shall have to raise £8,000,000 to pay interest on existing war loans. The States have no liability in respect of our war loans. Their only connexion with them is in assisting to spend the money. I hope that the time is not far distant when we shall have news that the war is finished, and in the way in which it should be finished. I trust that, in the near future, the man power, and the moral and financial power of the United States of America, will be fully felt, and will compel our enemies to ask for terms. I believe that that is what will occur, and I hope I am correct in that belief. But if the war continues for another two years, we shall have to raise annually a sum of £10,000,000 to meet interest on our war loans, and the Government will be faced with a very great difficulty to discover new fields for taxation. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>In this measure the Government have attempted to do something, but I think they have grossly misled their supporters who sent them here. From the information I have received, their supporters are now very much perplexed concerning the measure of taxation to be imposed upon them, the means to be adopted for collecting it, and the difficulties associated with the compilation of returns. One matter is deserving of special mention, in connexion with the interest on our war loans, and that is that it is a great consolation to know that the money will be spent in Australia, and may be the means of establishing important industries, lt is necessary that we should build up our industries in order that Australia may cany millions of population, as it is in that way only that our national existence can be secured.  Athough  this is not the time to utter warnings, it is a time when the Australian people should give some consideration to the means by which the country is to be kept going. Until we have sufficient people in Australia, it cannot be considered impregnable. We can not expect to hold the country with the handful of people we have here now. The one thing necessary to  enable  us to retain this country is a sufficient population, and that population must be a white population. By expending the interest on our loans in Australia, we can establish industries here  which will attract people to the country. </para>
                <para>If we are to build up our population it is necessary, that we should remove the obstacles placed in the way of the rearing of large families. The dwindling of our national population must have struck every thinking person. It is due in some measure to the fact that we have not given fair consideration to those who, in the past, have reared large families, and who, when they get into the sere and yellow leaf, have to resort to the old-age pension. The second generation offer the treatment their forbears have received as the excuse for not attempting to rear large families themselves. One cannot blame them altogether, and it is certainly the duty of this National Parliament to remove all disabilities from those who in this regard are prepared to do their duty to the country. </para>
                <para>There are a few objectionable clauses in the Bill which I shall endeavour to have amended in Committee. I have not much hope that I shall be successful, as the attitude adopted by the Government in all these cases is that they must have the Bill, the whole Bill, and nothing but the Bill. But very often the moving of amendments upon such measures  influences  those who have charge of them and leads to good results. Last year, when the Repatriation Bill was before the Senate, I moved eight different new clauses, and though the Government opposed them all, I am pleased to be able to say that the provisions of some of them are embodied, in a somewhat different dress, in the regulations which have been made under the Act. In the same way, some notice may be taken of amendments proposed to this Bill. If honorable senators point out deficiencies, inaccuracies, or the possibility of hardship under some of the clauses, a remedy for the matters complained of may be adopted later on. There is one clause of this Bill under which the Commissioner of Pensions is given the right to call upon the Commissioner of Taxation for information in reference to the income of an individual. I do not think that it is fair to give the Commissioner of Pensions any such right. The officers of the Taxation Department are sworn to secrecy in respect of the matters contained in a taxation schedule, and that secrecy will be violated if under this Bill the Commissioner of Pensions is to be given the right of call upon the  Commissioner  of Taxation to supply information concerning a person's income. This cannot refer to old-age pensions, because persons who have the pleasure of filling in income tax schedules are not entitled to old-age pensions. It may refer to war pensions, and if it does, I say that the man who has done his bit for the country and the good old flag, should not have his private affairs paraded before any Commissioner of Pensions. </para>
                <para>There is in the Bill a heavy penalty provided for neglect to properly fill in returns of income tax. This applied under the original Act to false returns made wilfully, but in this Bill  the  word "wilfully" is to be omitted, and! if a man happens to make a mistake  in  compiling his income tax return, he renders himself liable to a heavy penalty, which may be imposed, not by a Court of law, but by an official. That is not a fair thine. I have had several communications in reference to this matter from taxpayers in New South Wales. One of them says - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>There is one section of the Federal Income Tax Assessment Bill now before Parliament that will act in a manner harassing, vexatious, and unjust to many perfectly honest persons. I refer to the section altering the name of the offences "wilful delay" and "wilful neglect" to " delay " and " neglect," which means that a Deputy Commissioner of Taxation will decide whether or not a taxpayer has committed one of these offences; and the reason put. forward for this extraordinary power with which it is proposed to clothe the taxing officials - . and which, by the way, one would expect in a country like Germany orRed Russia - is that it is an offence upon which it is difficult for the Department to satisfy the magistrate or Judge ! </para>
                    <para>Are Australians in this way to be robbed of all British justice? Are they to be condemned without a trial, and, because of some inadvertent delay or honest mistake, convicted and heavily fined? Because, although the name of the offence is being altered in the way stated, the penalties are actually being made heavier. The police might just as well be given the power to decide whether a prisoner is guilty of the crime with which he is charged, on the ground that it might be difficult to satisfy the Judge or jury! The proposal seems preposterous and is altogether going too far. </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>The desire of the Federal Government would seem to be to enable the Taxation Departments to get revenue more by imposing penalties than collecting tax. There is already a penalty provided for not furnishing returns within a certain time, but, in order to get a conviction carrying the heavier penalties (such as, for instance, double the amount of tax and sums of £100, £200, &amp;c.), the Commissioner must show that the taxpayer has done wrong intentionally, and the law could very well be left as it stands in that respect; but in the Bill which went to the Senate at the end of last week, the heavier penalties may be imposed where the taxpayer does not act intentionally, but makes a mistake purely through ignorance, and in a perfectlybona <inline font-style="italic">fide</inline> way. I trust our senators will see that such an unjust provision is not allowed to remain in the measure. </para>

                <para>These are the opinions of some of the taxpayers who have communicated with me. I believe that we ought not to attempt to put too much power in the hands of officials. </para>
                <para>If a man possesses a property upon which he has expended £100 in repairs he is not allowed to deduct that expenditure from his income. If he does so, the Taxation Commissioner will send his return back to him, probably with an intimation that he must cut the amount down to £25. That official is vested with power to average the expenditure upon repairs to a dwelling over a number of years. </para>

The Minister for Repatriation might as well let me get along, because his interjection will make no difference to me. Perhaps my colleague from New South Wales <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pratten)</inline> will have something to say upon this matter, because I know that he feels it very keenly. I repeat that if £100 be expended by a man in repairs upon- a dwelling the taxation officials will not allow him to deduct it from the income included in his return. They will insist upon the expenditure being averaged over a number of years. </para>

                        <para>- Here I may be permitted to say a word in favour of the employer. There are some good employers. I have received a letter from my old "boss," for whom I worked for fifteen years, and for whom I put in some useful work. He has written to me protesting against the garnisheeing of employees' wages by employers and against the responsibility for the collection of the tax being thrown upon the employer. If a man is paid by the month it is all very well. But if he be in casual employment I do not see how his employer can be made liable for the tax due by him. If he is made thus liable he will have no option but to deduct it from the wages due to his employee before the time for payment arrives. That would be a very unfair thing to do. This gentleman says - </para>

                    <para>From our reading of the above Bill, we understand that this company (Mort's Dock and Engineering Company), as employer, may be declared the agent of any employee who, after sixty days, has failed to pay the amount due as income tax, and that the Commissioner may require the employer to pay same on behalf of the employee, and deduct the amount from the latter's wages; but that the responsibility to deduct from the employee's wages and pay the tax shall date from the time the Commissioner's notice is received. That is to say that the employer has no responsibility unless the taxpayer employee is still in his service, and a sufficient sum of money is due to him to enable same to be deducted and paid to the Commissioner. </para>
                    <para>In the report of the Acting Prime Minister's speech upon the second reading of the Bill, it is stated that - " An employer, to safeguard himself, would have to keep back part of the moneys coming to his employees," which seems to impose 'the greater responsibility on the employer of deducting from all salaries and wages paid, in anticipation of default, and involving a refund in most cases. </para>

                    <para>In the report of the Acting Prime Minister's speech upon the second reading of the Bill, it is stated that - " An employer, to safeguard himself, would have to keep back part of the moneys coming to his employees," which seems to impose the greater responsibility on the employer of deducting from all salaries and wages paid, in anticipation of default, and involving a refund in most cases. </para>

                <para>There is another objectionable feature in connexion with this Bill - I refer to the small amount of the exemption which is allowed to a taxpayer with a large family. The States are not niggardly in this respect. They allow men with large families to deduct substantial amounts from their incomes. As I have previously remarked, Australia will have to depend in a very few years upon its white population for its very existence. If we win this war, we shall be better able to maintain our national integrity ; but, if we lose it, great will be our responsibility. In such circumstances, we ought to remove every obstacle from the man who is doing his duty to this country. It is unfair to penalize a man with a large family, while allowing the individual with a small family to escape by paying a less amount in taxation. In Committee, I shall endeavour to secure an alteration of the Bill in the direction I have indicated. </para>
                <para>Then the measure provides for taking a large percentage from the winnings in connexion with Tattersall's sweeps. To me, it is very heart-rending to see this Government attempting to obtain revenue from Tattersall's sweeps. Those sweeps are illegal. </para>

                        <para>- I would not care if the Commonwealth took over the whole of the gambling interests throughout Australia, and thus secured the huge profit that is annually made out of them. So long as we permit gambling to proceed, we ought to get the most revenue that we can out of it. But we ought not to attempt to take it from the poor unfortunate individual who wins £100 in Tattersall's sweep. Why, a poor servant girl at an hotel where I am stopping had to pay £5 to the Government out of a £100 prize which she had won. If the Government wish to control gambling, let them run the sweeps. Let them control the totalizator which is run at Randwick Race-course to-day. Let them take over all the means connected with gambling, and then they will get a very substantial revenue. But it is absolutely inconsistent for them to condemn gambling, and at the same time to lay hands upon portion of the proceeds from this evil. To my mind, that is not a fair thing. I like to have a little flutter myself at times. I am not a "wowser," but I object to the Government condemning gambling on the one hand whilst on the other hand they reach out for a portion of the proceeds from this evil. One of their own supporters recently stated that he would rather we lost the war than that we should secure revenue from gambling. It is a wonder to me that he has not been arrested for having made such a statement. I repeat that the Government can get plenty of money by taking over the gambling interests throughout Australia. </para>

                <para>I come now to the proposal in the Bill to exempt charitable gifts in excess of £20. To my mind, that is grossly unfair. A man who gives £ 11s. to any charitable object should be allowed to deduct the amount in his income tax schedule. It is only the rich man who will obtain benefit under this provision in the Bill, which, in Committee, I shall endeavour to get amended. </para>
                <para>In conclusion, I merely wish to say I believe the Government are at their wits' ends to find money. Yet there is plenty of money in this country. So far, we have merely scratched the surface. Why, in Melbourne and Sydney to-day people are being called upon to pay £5 5s. for a pair of boots which cost only 32s. 6d. The same remark is applicable to clothes. Let the Government bring in a system of standardization in regard to clothing, boots, and food, and they will get sufficient money to carry on the services of this country, and sufficient to pay the interest upon our war loans, without penalizing unfortunate people who are not in a position to pay, and without interfering with the industrial life of the Commonwealth. To that industrial life alone can we look for our future salvation. Let us create markets by establishing huge industries here. Let us follow the example which has been set us by America and other countries. Let us look ahead now and establish these great industries, thus creating work for our own people. Let us get a good solid white population settled here, for by that means alone can we hope to keep Australia a good country for the white and British races. </para>

                    <para>.- The Bill before us is very largely a machinery measure, wherein changes only in the direction of collection of income taxation are proposed. Some of the clauses in it will have the effect of protecting the revenue, a few will operate towards the smoother working of the present complicated methods, whilst others will, to a certain extent, militate against the very generally recognised complicated and chaotic condition into which the Department has got itself. Personally, I rather regard the Bill as an attempt to caulk the leaks in the ship, nearly all the rivets of which are leaking, but being a Bill to protect the revenue it must have the sympathy of honorable senators. At the same time, it is our duty to see that it does not inflict an injustice upon any member of the community. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I regard income taxation as the mainstay of Australia's financial stability, and there is no doubt that the income taxpayers throughout the Commonwealth, as the result of the huge expenditure on the war, will have largely to bear the immense permanent debt that this country will have to carry, not only in the immediate, but, perhaps, in the distant future. In the United Kingdom for a generation or more the income tax has been regarded almost purely as a war tax. For many years the British income tax has been increased to meet war expenditure, and lessened in times of peace. The financial problems of Australia loom very large indeed. I am not sure that the financial problem is not the most important problem which the Commonwealth will have to face in our time. Income tax legislation affects a very large number of people, and I make no apology therefore for endeavouring to analyze, to perhaps an incomplete extent, the financial position of the Commonwealth. </para>
                <para>Towards the end of this year it can be approximately said that the States will have a public debt of about £400,000,000, and the Commonwealth of about £300,000,000, so that the total indebtedness of Australia - Federal and State - at the end of this year will probably approximate to the huge sum, for Australia, of £700,000,000. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The gross receipts from our railways and our other revenue-producing public services are about £29,000,000 throughout Australia. The expenditure on those services is about £20,500,000, leaving a surplus, to go towards the reduction of the interest upon the public debt of Australia, of about £8,500,000, a little over £6,000,000 of this coming from Australian railways. This sum of £8,500,000, being the excess of revenue over expenditure on Australian revenue-producing public services, will just about pay interest on £200,000,000 of the State debts, so we shall have at the end of this year owing publicly iu Australia a sum of £500,000,000 of non-producing debt, of which £1200,000,000 will represent the balance &gt;of the State debts, and £300,000,000 the Commonwealth debt. </para>

                <para>About three years ago a wealth census was taken throughout the Commonwealth. The returns are acknowledged to be incomplete, but sufficient data has been collected, and collated as to who and how many of our population have to pay income "tax, present and future. The Bill should affect about 350,000 of the adult population of Australia, and I make po apology therefore for proceeding further with the financial analysis. The net income of all persons in Australia, as given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs</inline> on the basis of the wealth census, is £257,000,000 per year. That is, probably, short of the actual amount, but is a sufficiently approximate total to figure on. Outside of Trust Funds and other matters of that sort, which do not amount to very much, and will not affect my figures, there are 2,200,000 adult persons in Australia, male and female, who have a total annual income of £240,000,000. This sum averages about £110 per head of the adult population of Australia, and according again to the invaluable <inline font-style="italic">Knibbs,</inline> the males average £150 per year, and the females about £50. Of those 2,200,000 adult persons in receipt of incomes, 1,800,000 have incomes of £156 per year or less, and can, consequently, be omitted from the taxable area. The incomes of those people who have £156 per year or less aggregate £120,000,000, or half the total income of the people of Australia. The remaining half is, according to <inline font-style="italic">Knibbs,</inline> obtained by 381,000 persons who have incomes of £156 per year or more, and are consequently within the Commonwealth taxable area. Of this amount of £120,000,000 which is taxable, about £30,000,000 is received by persons getting from £156 to £200 per year ; and under our exemption clauses, only about 25 per cent, of that £30,000,000 is within the taxable area. Persons getting from £200 to £300 per year receive about £28,000,000; and it is obvious, with our Commonwealth exemptions, that barely half of that sum is taxable. The net- annual income of all persons in the Commonwealth may be £240,000,000 or £250,000,000, but not very much more than £80,000,000 per year is within the Commonwealth taxable area; neither should it be, as exemptions must be made. The principle is sound that only surplus income should be taxed, and personally I think that the exemptions contained in this Bill are quite low enough. </para>
                <para>I have shown that the taxable surplus income of the people of the Commonwealth does not greatly exceed £80,000,000. This, then, is the annual wealth that will have very largely to bear the burden of present and future Commonwealth income taxation. This year the States will tax that wealth to the extent of over £4,000,000, or nearly 6 per cent, of its total. The Commonwealth will take from it £6,500,000 in income taxation, or over 8 per cent, of its total. Consequently, the combined Federal and State income taxation will take this year from the taxable annual wealth of Australia a sum approximating, on the average, to 14 or 15 per cent, of its whole. The only figures available show that in the Commonwealth 235,000 assessments were made in the last taxation year, and that those 235,000 persons paid, on an average £17 15s. per assessment. Under our graduated system, of course, the taxation is infinitely more on the higher incomes. The returns of. the wealth census, show that about £8,000,000 out of the £80,000,000 of taxable income belongs to persons having incomes of £5,000 per year or more ; and under £10,000,000 belongs to persons having incomes of over £2,000 and under £5,000. It is therefore reasonable to assume that incomes of £2,000 per year and more are now paying on an average, in State and Federal income taxation, over 20 per cent, of their total. </para>
                <para>In these circumstances, honorable senators will see how far the Commonwealth and the States have already gone in income taxation. On those figures, </para>
                <para>Commonwealth income taxation is by no means illimitable. There is a limit to what can be done; and although honorable senators may talk glibly about the wealth of Australia it seems to me that, when we get down to figures such as these, taxation is not endless, and its potentialities are not without limit. I do not think we can hope to make up our huge annual future budgets out of income taxation alone. There is a point at which the incentive to exertion is going to stop. </para>

                        <para>- No, I am speaking principally of personal exertion. Our conditions cannot be compared with those of older countries, such as the United Kingdom, where most of the income of the country is obtained from investments. Most of the annual income in Australia is obtained from the personal exertions of its people. If we overburden this section of the community with illimitable taxation, we shall be rapidly approaching the point where the incentive to exertion ceases, and where it will not be worth while for a man to work for the development of Australia as hard as he has worked before. Any excessive taxation in this direction will tend to slow up the development that we want so much. Our primary and secondary (production totals from £250,000,000 to £300,000,000 per year. This is the source from which all taxation must come to meet our future bills. In land tax, local government rates, stamp, and probate duties, the Commonwealth and States now collect about £20,000,000 from the total productive wealth of Australia, and it seems to me that, hand in hand with the imposition of new taxation for the big Budgets ahead, there must go* an absolute determination to get economy and efficiency in administration. Every pound saved is a pound gained. I say most deliberately I shall not, in this Senate, support the imposition of tax upon tax, unless, accompanying that policy, there is seen a determination to secure the utmost economy and efficiency of administration. <inline font-style="italic">Knibbs</inline> gives our private assets of Australia - that is, the net wealth of Australia, excluding public properties or properties invested in the Commonwealth and States -at about £1,600,000,000. This total, too, is probably more now, as the census was admittedly somewhat incomplete. </para>

                <para>Australia's State and Federal non-revenue producing debts will at the end of this year be in the region of £500,000,000.  I ask  honorable senators to realize what this means. Our national assets total about £1,600,000,000, but against them we have to put public non-revenue producing debts of £500,000,000. In fact, to-day we owe 6s. 3d. in the £1 on all we are worth. True, we owe some of the money to ourselves, but there is about £50,000,000 or £60,000,000 of local government debts in addition to these, and which are not included in my figures. It may safely be said, therefore, that for every £1 of our net assets we shall have, at the end of this year, a liability of 5s. 4d. in the £1 to financiers overseas, and we shall owe to ourselves ls. 8d. in the £1 in connexion with money borrowed from ourselves, so that our total liabilities in respect of our total assets will be 7s. in the £1.  </para>

The railways, which are our biggest asset in Australia, are owned privately in the United Kingdom, and must be excluded from the figures I have given for Australia, but are included in my figures for the United Kingdom. In France the private wealth is estimated at about £300 per head, and the net assets, or public wealth in private hands, at about £12,000,000,000. I quote these figures merely to remind persons who airily boast about the economic position 'of Australia, that their views must be revised after the war, because no longer shall we be able to say that Australia owns, on the average,  £327 per head of population, because we shall have to add to the statement that against their wealth we must place a debt of about £100 per head of population. </para>

The Treasurer's first determination to make subscriptions to clubs taxable was difficult to understand, and I am pleased to know that some amendment has been made in another place in regard to this clause of the Bill. I am not quite clear yet what will be the effect of the amendment, as the Bill as amended has just been placed in our hands, but I am hopeful that the anticipated injustice, at first feared, will be done away with altogether. </para>
                <para>I think the most objectionable feature of the Bill - and I believe it will be objectionable to honorable senators on both sides of the House - is its retrospective character. It is proposed, in spite of the High Court decision, to make the Act retrospective. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> states that it is proposed to give retrospective force to the principal amending provisions by dating their operation back to the commencement of the Act, to 1st July, 1914, and that the said amendments are to be deemed to have had force at and from that date. This means that all assessments and adjustments that have been made over the last three years will probably have to be opened up again. </para>

                <para>I most emphatically protest against the inadequate amount allowed by the Commissioner as depreciation in respect of machinery used in most of our secondary industries. It is true this is not particularized in the amending Bill before us, but it is one of the things that, in the course of administration by the Commissioner, is very strongly objected to by the manufacturing community. I believe that a standard schedule has been adopted, but in my own experience I know that the amount allowed by the Commissioner is altogether inadequate, and is most unfair. Although it can be pointed out that in some industries the machinery will not last ten years, the Commissioner objects to an allowance of more than 5 per cent, per annum on the diminishing value. I point out that it is a very bad national policy to discourage ample depreciation for machinery and plant. The allowance generally is from 5 per cent, to 7½ per cent, per year. </para>

                        <para>- No; but I think in some few cases the allowance goes up to 10 per cent, on the decreasing value of machinery and plant. The net effect of this policy, if the procedure of the Income Tax Commissioner is followed, is that the plant and machinery are never written off. Upon buildings irrespective of whether they have been specially built or not to carry on any particular trade, no depreciation whatever is allowed. We know that progressive manufacturers have found that it is necessary in some cases to put aside a sum up to 100 per cent, in excess of the allowance permitted by the Commissioner for depreciation of plant and machinery. I .was struck the other day in reading the proceedings of a conference of British engineers. The account which I read was from the London <inline font-style="italic">Times,</inline> and the question of the depreciation of plant and machinery was recognised by that conference to bc most important. The delegates recommended, for national reasons, that in ordinary peace times no less than 15 per cent, per annum  be  allowed for depreciation on the decreasing -value of plant and machinery. They pointed out that the British Income Tax Commissioner - and the Australian Commissioner is not alone in this matter - rarely allowed more than 5 per cent., and, in consequence, firms tended to retain old-fashioned machinery, which imposes a very heavy industrial handicap in these days of rapid progress. . If we are going to have science bureaux and progressive bodies of that character to give us a lead, we shall have to turn over a new leaf in Australia. But let the Commissioner of Taxation also turn over a new leaf, and not place a handicap upon progressive manufacturers by reason of what I may fairly term his harsh and unfair administration of this section of the Act. </para>

If we are going to pay off our war debt in the future, it can only be easily done by stimulating production. And if we, by the administration of the Income Tax Department, are going to prevent manufacturers from scrapping old machinery, the country will certainly be none the better for it. </para>

As to the operations of the British and the Australian law, these are administered on practically identical lines, but my objection is that they are pre-war lines.

He said it would probably save the taxpayer a million and a half sterling per annum in fees, and in trouble, and in time. I have had no opportunity of checking that estimate, but I feel sure that a very large sum will be saved the taxpayers in expenditure of time and trouble if this desideratum can be brought about. </para>

                <para>On the question of deductions for charitable and war donations there appears to be some confusion. I understand that the Bill has left the other House in a rather unsatisfactory position - that deductions on account of war donations are allowable over a certain amount, but not deductions for charitable purposes. I hope this phase of the amending Bill will receive some attention from honorable senators. So far as I can see, the Federal Income Tax Commissioner has committed a breach of faith with the Senate in connexion with his decisions upon assessments sent in under the Wartime Profits Act. Before this Bill was introduced, I understood that deductions were allowed to the taxpayer for contributions for war purposes and for charitable purposes. I remember distinctly receiving the assurance of the Leader of the Senate when he was in charge of the War-time Profits Bill that assessments under that Bill would be allowed in exactly the same way as income tax assessments are made up. I am informed, however, that the Commissioner is taking up a very high-handed and harsh action in disallowing taxpayers, when making up their wartime profits assessments, any deductions for war and charitable purposes. </para>

                <para>Another matter mentioned in the Senate to-night relates to clause 32, which will give the Commissioner power to call upon any employer of a taxpayer who is in arrears in payment of his tax to deduct the amount due from the salary or wages due to the taxpayer by the employer. I think this clause should have the most careful consideration. I hesitate, in dealing with it, to give the Commissioner the power which the Bill as it stands would provide. This clause is full of pitfalls. It may have the effect of disturbing the harmonious relationships which should exist between employer and employee. On the other hand, I admit that the Commissioner is in a difficulty in collecting the amounts from comparatively small incomes. I would like to see some <inline font-style="italic">modus vivendi</inline> whereby revenue stamps could be used by the employer, much on the lines that stamps are employed in England to-day in connexion with the insurance and other schemes. Thus friction might be prevented, and at the same time the Treasury could be protected. </para>
                <para>The great difficulty in regard to income taxation in Australia is its application, and since the incursion' of the Commonwealth Government into this matter confusion has become worse confounded. Different methods have been adopted by the Commonwealth. Different principles have governed the collection of the Commonwealth taxation, and protest after protest has been made by the commercial, primary and secondary industries in the community with regard to these difficulties, concerning both Federal and State income taxation. Taxpayers really have much to complain about. I complain that an arrangement has not yet been arrived at between the Commonwealth and the States to simplify and reduce the work imposed on taxpayers in connexion with their schedules. This applies also to land, income, and probate duties, which are collected by both Federal and State authorities. All taxation schedules should be alike. We should certainly have one uniform schedule for the preparation of income tax returns throughout Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and if possible we should have one central collecting authority. I question whether the Commonwealth can collect more cheaply than the States. It is obvious that one taxing authority could collect more cheaply than seven, but no reasonable comparison can be made between the. collections of the States and the Commonwealth until we get some idea of the actual cost per assessment of the Commonwealth. The cost of collecting direct taxation by the Commonwealth was given by the Treasurer a little while ago as 2½ per cent., or 6d. in the pound of the total yield. The Treasurer was particularly definite in saying that he was speaking from memory, to the effect that the States taxation officers averaged in the region of 5 per cent. The States may have averaged in the region of 5 per cent, of the collection of their income tax years ago, but to-day throughout the States the collection of income tax is in every case lower than the cost , of the collection of the Federal tax. Consequently the Treasurer's illustration was quite illusory, as the Commonwealth taxation also graduates up to 6s. 3d. in the pound, while in no case does any State tax more than 2s. in the pound. </para>

                <para>Another matter is that, although the Federal Taxation Department is one as a whole, people are apt to overlook the fact that in each State there is a Federal Taxation Department, as a subDepartment, presided over by a  Deputy  Commissioner. I doubt very much whether the States taxation officers desire to have their status reduced by absorption by the Commonwealth, or limitation of the duties they perform . The objection is only natural, and it is natural, too, that the Federal taxation authorities should not desire their status reduced by being absorbed within the ambit of State Taxation Departments. So far as the officers of these Departments and their opinion is concerned, the Ministry and Parliament should deal with these matters on their merits, irrespective of what is advised or desired by the officers of either State or Commonwealth Taxation Departments. </para>
                <para>It seems to me that, with regard to the uniformity of taxation returns, the difference between the States and Commonwealth Taxation Commissioners is vital. The State Commissioners desire to tax income at its source, the Federal Commissioner desires to follow the money, or to tax the individual taxpayer. There is a slight difference, too, I believe, on the question of the taxation of sales and assets ; but the vital matter connected with the difficulty of uniformity of income taxation returns throughout the Commonwealth is that the State authorities want to tax the money at its source and the Federal authorities desire to tax individual taxpayers. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the Minister for Repatriation misunderstands the position. I am speaking now with regard to uniformity, not only of schedules, but of collection, and practically the only point of difference and the obstacle to uniformity, efficiency, and economy and the establishment of one collecting authority is that point of difference between the methods of the State authorities and of the Federal Administration. </para>

                <para>I think that the whole question of income taxation, so far as the Commonwealth is concerned, and our whole Act, requires reviewing. I believe that in the Commonwealth we are drifting into complications, if not chaos, that is not creditable to the Commonwealth Administration. Largely owing to the complications of the Commonwealth method of collection of income taxation, I say most deliberately and dispassionately that the Federal Taxation Department cannot properly collect its taxes. At any rate, it has not succeeded in doing so up to now, and this is the third year in which the Act has been in operation. It was stated last Sunday week in a newspaper published in Sydney, that the Federal authorities started income tax collection in 1915. Three years' returns have been furnished, and we are on the eve of the fourth, and it is well within the mark to say that 80 per cent, of the total assessments issued to date are tentative, and if the Department were to be closed tomorrow, and asked to clean up the work to date, it could not do so in less than two years, which would very materially increase the cost of collection. </para>

                        <para>- I think I mentioned 1,800,000, and approximately 2,200,000 altogether. This figure of 381,000, added to the 1,800,000, will approximately make my figure of 2,200,000 adult persons throughout Australia re-' ceiving incomes of any sort or any size. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> in his wealth census, states that in 1915 there were 381,000 persons in Australia receiving incomes of £156 a year or over. Seeing that the people were asked to send in statements of what their income was, and it was generally recognised that this wealth census was intended for future taxation requirements, I think it is reasonable to assume that there were 381,000 persons at least in Australia receiving an income of £156 a year and over. </para>

                        <para>- I have said that the great desideratum is uniformity of returns and collection.

                <para>I have said that the only obstacle to uniformity seems to me to be the difference between the Commonwealth and State methods of taxation ; that is to say, whether the company earnings should be taxed at their source or the individual shareholders in those companies should be taxed individually. The argument for the taxation of incomes individually is stubbornly adhered to by the academic mathematicians who run our Federal Income Tax Department. The argument is that if you tax the income of a company at its source you will tax a number of poor people, and amongst them, perhaps, poor widows, who ought not to be called upon to pay Federal income tax at all. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. There seems to be nothing at all in their argument. It does not appear to me to be reasonable to suppose that people who invest in the shares of companies are in receipt of an income of less than £156, or £100, a year, as the case my be. If people have money to spare to invest in the shares of companies it may reasonably be assumed that they come within the Commonwealth taxable area. Persons in receipt of less than the Commonwealth taxable income with its small exemption are not likely to be able to invest in the shares of companies. Even if they did. that could easily be provided for here, just as it is provided for in England, by giving a rebate at the end of the year to those people who were unfairly taxed. On the other hand, it is claimed that the taxation of income at its source would not enable the Commonwealth to properly graduate incomes, and the rich man would get off with a lighter tax than he is called upon to pay under the present system. I ask whether every man is not called upon now to make an individual schedule. There is practically no difficulty, therefore, with regard to graduation. Consequently, all the arguments for the Commonwealth methods of taxation fall to the ground. </para>

                        <para>- Under the Commonwealth system we must follow the money in respect of the 16,000 different sources. It does seem to me that it is clear and irrefutable that the muddle and chaos that the Federal Income Tax Department is in is largely and almost solely due to this academic method of income taxation. </para>

                        <para>- I am going to show how the States do it. I can quote a case that occurred in Sydney not so long ago to show the chaos into which the Income Tax Department of the Commonwealth has got. It is a case where refund vouchers to the extent of £80 were given where no income tax had been' paid. In other words, vouchers to collect £80 at the Treasury were given to a firm that had paid no income tax. I am not going to say that these things are the fault of the staff. I know that we have a very estimable staff in the Commonwealth Taxation Department. These things are the fault of the system, and we shall never get satisfaction in the matter of Commonwealth income tax administration until the system is radically altered.. The system, as. honorable senators are aware, includes curves of the second and third degree. The academic scientists who say they are right, but whose fellow scientists sometimes say they are wrong, who impose curves to the second and third degree, and impose upon' us the collection of taxation following the money, instead of at its source, are the persons who are responsible for the very unsatisfactory position that the Commonwealth Income Department is in at the present time. Even the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> is reported to have said in connexion with these curves that he " did not know how in the devil it  wa3  done." </para>

                <para>On the great point of the difference between the Commonwealth and State systems, I would remind honorable senators that the system of collecting income tax at its source is carried out in England, in New Zealand, and in every State of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth taxation authorities are the pariahs in this matter, because they represent the odd man out in regard to the system. This is the only' obstacle to uniformity, and I do not believe uniformity will ever be achieved unless the Commonwealth is prepared to adopt what, to my mind, is the common -sense method of collection. Other matters, such as synchronizing the date upon which the year shall close, can easily be adjusted if this great stumbling block is removed. I believe that, if we remove this lion in the path, an hour's discussion between the Commonwealth and State authorities would be sufficient to give Australia, not only uniformity in regard to income tax schedules, but uniformity in regard to the collection of the tax, which is so greatly to be desired. </para>

                    stated the other day that the cost of collecting the Commonwealth income tax was only 2^ per cent., or 6d. in the £1. May I point out that the New South Wales Income Tax Department spends less than £30,000 a year, and yet it collected during the last financial year no less a sum than £2,040,000. These figures, which should have been available to the Acting Prime Minister when he made his statement, show that the cost of collecting the New South Wales income tax is, approximately, only lj per cent., or one-half the cost of collecting the Commonwealth income tax, despite the higher rates imposed by the Commonwealth. The cost of collection in Tasmania, I am informed, is the highest that obtains in any State, but even there it does not exceed 2J per cent. That cost, too, includes the collection of the Tasmanian land tax.

                <para>It is obvious from a close study of the wealth census . figures, and of the official statements published from time to time by the Commonwealth Taxation Department, that there is something very wrong in connexion with the administration of that Department. </para>
                <para class="block">I would like to show the basis upon which I make this grave charge. In New South Wales, a general exemption is allowed of £250 a year, whereas the Federal authorities allow an exemption of only £156. For each child, the State from which I hail allows a deduction of £50, whereas the Federal authorities allow a deduction of £26 each, for two children only. New South Wales allows a deduction for the maintenance of a child up to eighteen years of age, but the Federal authorities allow a deduction up to the age of only sixteen years. The maximum tax imposed in New South Wales is ls. lid. in the £1 on income derived from property; whereas in the Commonwealth it is 6s. 3d. in the £1. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so. The minimum in both cases is approximately the same. New South Wales collects from companies a maximum of ls. 3d. in the £1; whereas the Commonwealth collects a maximum of ls. 10£d. in the £1. If the New South Wales rates were the same as the Commonwealth rates, that State would collect from companies alone £500,000 more than she does. In spite of all these great differences in. favour of the Commonwealth - differences of rates and charges - the Federal authorities during the last financial year failed to collect more than £5,500,000 throughout the whole of Australia; whereas the New South Wales Taxation Department, upon its low rates and with a maximum of ls. lid. in the £1, collected £2,040,000. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend, I am afraid, fails to understand my contention. I am contending that, under the flat rate, and under the method of taxing income at its source, a greater revenue would be secured than can be obtained by the adoption of the present Commonwealth method. I can give my authority for this statement if I am desired to do so. I am emphasizing the fact that, if the New South Wales State Taxation Department had collected Commonwealth rates under the New South Wales Act, which taxes income at its source, it would have collected last year approximately £4,000,000.. Now, I think it is generally conceded that, in order to get a factor for the whole Commonwealth, we may multiply the New South Wales figures approximately by two and a half. This factor appertains in regard to total wealth, net assets, total net incomes, Commonwealth taxation, population, and several other matters. Consequently, I think it is reasonable to assume that, on the basis of this factor, the Commonwealth income tax returns, if they had been collected during the last financial year under the laws operating in the State of New South Wales, would have approximated £10,000,000 instead of £5,500,000. </para>

                <para>I have, already indicated a suspicion that there are at least 100,000 persons in Australia who are escaping payment of the Federal income tax. Do not these facts and figures lead one to believe that the Federal Income Tax Department is not yet thoroughly organized <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> It cannot be regarded as being in a state, of efficiency, and no State Government is likely to rush in blindly and to hand over to the tender mercies' of a Department, which has only collected £5,500,000 where it ought to have collected £10,000,000, the collection of the whole of its taxation. I submit that the policy of the Government should be to rake in the defaulters before imposing additional taxation. </para>
                <para>I should have liked very much to have gone into the question of the rates which obtain in England as compared with the rates which obtain in the Commonwealth and in the States which compose it. But, briefly speaking, the comparison with England, from the stand-point of taxation, may be roughly divided into four headings. Under the heading of personal exertion the tax in England is practically double our own on lower incomes, and it graduates higher until, when an income of £20,000 a year is reached, it is practically much the same as that which obtains here. In England, however, additional income taxation has been imposed in the form of a super-tax. Now, there is no super-tax on incomes in the Commonwealth, although there is a comparatively small super-tax operating in New South Wales. This super-tax graduates from £3 15s. on an income of £300 a year to £250 on an income of £20,000 a year. But in England the  super-tax  graduates from £12 10s. on an income of £300 a year to £4,500 on an income of £20,000 a year. In Britain the tax upon income from personal exertion, plus the super-tax, compares with our taxation here in this way : In the Commonwealth  the total taxation - Federal and State- is £33 on an income of £500 a year, and it graduates to £4,505 on an income of £20,000 a year, whereas in England the graduation is from £46 on an income of £500 a year to £10,500 on an income of £20,000 a year. The combined taxes in respect of income from property in the Federal and State arenas of Australia are very much the same as the taxes in England. So that there seems to be only room in the Commonwealth for a war super-tax on moderate incomes from personal exertion when compared with the taxation that obtains in England. There does not appear to be very much room for taxation in respect of the higher incomes. </para>
                <para>I would remind the Minister in charge of the Bill that conditions in Australia differ very much from conditions in England - that, comparatively speaking, a very small proportion of the total income of the people of the Commonwealth is derived from investments. By far the largest proportion of that income is derived from personal exertion. For the next "financial year, the Treasurer has forecast some increase in taxation. I admit that the Commissioner of  Taxes  has a most difficult task to perform - the task of collecting taxation over a whole continent. But I am sure he will be the last to assert that the Commonwealth Taxation Office is not full of imperfections, and that he would not like to rake in the thousands and tens of thousands of taxpayers who at the present time are evading the payment of the Federal income tax. There aTe, I believe, some thousands of 'State civil servants who are evading its payment; but these do not make up the big discrepancy which is apparent in the figures which I have previously quoted. I have given reasonable proof that we may be yet £3,000,000 short of the proper collection of our present income taxation. It is also likely, on the figures, that 100,000 people are still evading their in-' come tax dues. It seems to me that the common-sense method is to collect this amount first before imposing new taxation. </para>
                <para>It would be as well, in view of the controversy between the States and Commonwealth on uniformity, which seems to have got no further in spite of all the pressure that has been brought to bear, for the Government to obtain some unbiased inquiry into the actual position. I accept any .challenge so far as the figures I have quoted are concerned. My authority is irrefutable, and I believe the only solution of the present chaotic condition for the benefit of the Commonwealth is to have an unbiased inquiry, and, if necessary, to come down from the pedestal, admit that the Commonwealth is not successful in- what it set out to achieve, and. that these academic mathematicians have gone wrong, and led us in a wrong direction. Then let the .States collect the income tax, and give us. certainly le3s trouble' and more revenue. My figures lave been carefully collated, particularly those applying to New South Wales income tax collection. </para>

In the nearest financial year of the Commonwealth the Federal income tax authorities collected only £1,691,000 from that State. </para>

                        <para>- No, it first came into force in 1934-15. I am quoting the year 1915-16, in which -the Commonwealth collected only £38,000 more from New South Wales than the State authorities did, in spite of the much higher rates and charges. If that is not evidence that things' are not what we should like them to be, in heaven's name what sort of evidence does the Minister want) It is clear that the Commonwealth tax should be nearer twice what the State collects than just about the same. The present income tax schedules of the Commonwealth, if properly collected, and if the Department is efficient, .should bring in nearer £10,000,000 than the sum they now bring in. </para>

                <para>I apologize to the Senate for speaking so long on this matter at such a late hour, but the subject is very important, because, after all, it is here that we have to consider the finances of the Commonwealth, and if I can put the Ministry on the track of another £3,000,000 of .revenue without increasing taxation, I consider I am doing something for the public weal. There seem to be only three or four points in the Bill, and I have mentioned them in passing. The figures I have given have been supplied to me on unquestionable authority, and are well worthy of the investigation of the Ministry in relation to the' attempt to get extra revenue, and the great desirableness of simplifying income taxation throughout the Commonwealth. </para>
