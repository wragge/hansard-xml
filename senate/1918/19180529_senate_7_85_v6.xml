                            <para>- Arising out of the Minister&#39;s reply, I would ask him whether it is not customary, in a case of the kind, to acquaint the members of the Committee concerned with the fact that their services are no longer required ? Does the Minister not think that there was rather a lack of courtesy in not telling the members of the Committee that some new arrangement was to take the place of that under which they were appointed, and that the Committee was therefore disbanded ? As a member of the Committee, 1 knew nothing about the matter. </para>

                    <para>.- I find by investigations since Friday last, and after arriving at the true meaning of the word &#34;trading,&#34; that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten&#39;s</inline> amendment, if carried, will mean that every butter factory, cheese factory, and co-operative sugar mill in Queensland will not be exempted, while they should he. I therefore propose to vote against the amendment. When the War-time Profits Bill was under discussion exemptions were granted to every firm or institution that liked to tack on to its name the word &#34; co-operative.&#34; There exists in Queensland, and I take it in other places, grocers&#39; shops which are called cooperative establishments, although they are very little different from an ordinary joint stock company, inasmuch as they trade with anybody, whether he is a member of the concern or not. If these firms are to be continually exempted from every form of taxation proposed by the Government, it will be quite impossible for small grocers or other small concerns in a similar line of business to compete with them. They have already been exempted from one class of taxation, but, apparently, it is not the intention to exempt them still further. In discussing the definition of &#34; Value &#34; on Friday, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> made certain suggestions to the Government, which I sincerely trust will not be accepted. He made comparisons between cattle and sugar, and between sheep and barometers. When an honorable senator makes comparisons of that sort I can come only to the one conclusion, that he knows very little about stock values and the way they fluctuate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior&#39;s</inline> suggestion cannot possibly be accepted, because in Queensland, at any rate, the value of the stock on one station may be entirely different from that on an adjoining station. If a good rainfall is experienced in one part of Queensland, and  a  few miles away they are having  a dry  time, it will be impossible to put the same value on all the stock according to  the  local sales, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> proposed. </para>

                        <para>- I thought some attempt would have been made to define the position of co-operative societies. The object of my amendment was to relieve truly co-operative societies from taxation under this Bill. It has been pointed out in the course of the debate that there is very little true co-operation in Australia; that co-operative societies have gradually developed into largely trading concerns, and have come into active competition throughout the length of Australia with businesses controlled by private enterprise. It is not the intention of my amendment, neither would it be fair and reasonable, to exempt such societies. True co-operation as it emanated from Rochdale, is the banding together of a body of consumers in order to cut out the profits of the middleman and cheapen the price of commodities to themselves. My amendment, as is generally acknowledged, will not have very far-reaching effect just now. Even if it is carried, it will not affect the revenue, because in the case of truly co-operative institutions which distribute their profit by way of bonus to their members, any  savings effected by the members will be included in their individual assessments. </para>

                        <para>- It is not. I do not like the ill-informed interjections of my honorable friend. I have laid down the principle that true co-operation is the banding together of a body of people in order to eliminate the middleman&#39;s profits, and if honorable senators have been following me closely, they will remember that I pointed out that any savings made by members of co-operative societies would ultimately be a benefit to the revenue, because such savings would be added to the individual assessments of income taxpayers. The amendment has many advantages; and looking forward, as I do, to the development of this principle in Australia, I hope it will be agreed to. </para>

                    <para>. - I am sorry that I cannot agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> although I am as much in favour of co-operation as anybody. My conception of true cooperation is a society which makes no profits at all, but which carries on business at such low prices to its members as will merely cover the cost of distribution. When co-operative societies start to make profits they immediately clash with the ordinary traders. If we want to hold the scales evenly between man and man - and this is what we ought to do - we should treat co-operative companies in exactly the same manner as we treat a man who conducts any business. Are we to lay down the principle that a small grocer is to be taxed because he makes a profit, while a big co-operative society shall escape scot-free? I cannot understand any advocacy of that practice. Directly we get away from the basic principle of co-operation, co-operative societies are in just the same position as the ordinary traders. There are plenty of such societies throughout Australia. Aa a rule they fall into the hands of a few rich shareholders, and they are cutting out the small traders all over the country. I am entirely in favour of co-operation on proper lines, but I cannot see that we will be doing any good by exempting cooperative societies from taxation under this measure. </para>

                        <para>- No. It is clear that in the case&#62; of  co-operative  societies any sums received for the sale of animals or land shall be included as income, although the society may have made .nr profit out of the. transaction. If a profit has arisen from that agency, I can quite understand, that it should be a legitimate subject for taxation. The ideal cooperative society is that society which trades without making any profit at all. That, however, is not practicable, because a society, like any man in business, cannot carry on safely without a margin for profit, which, in the case of a cooperative society, is distributed in some form or other to its members at the end of the year. I see this difficulty in regard to the clause under consideration. In the. case of co-operative societies, it taxes income at its source, and also taxes the same income after its distribution amongst those of its members who are liable for income tax payment, so that really they become subjects of double taxation. </para>

                        <para>- There should be some provision, as in the case which I mentioned previously in connexion with this very clause. It was, that where a company under necessity was compelled to transmute its business as from a cheese to a butter making concern, and from either, say, to a hog-raising business, and where a certain outlay was rendered necessary to carry on that changed form of business, it would be unfair to tax such capital. It could be taken for granted, in those circumstances, that the factory concerned had to make its changes, or cease from being a factory, and thus come to an end of its being regarded as a source of revenue. If that sum is to be subject to taxation, it lays a. penalty upon a company which it would not have to hear in other circumstances. To all intents and purposes it is equivalent to a manufacturer replacing obsolete machinery. </para>

Would the honorable senator exempt from taxation all income that is paid into the building up of assets ? Take the case of a wealthy pastoralist - one having a very substantial income, say, of &#163;10,000. He is told that, as long as he is building up other assets, he will escape income tax. So he says, &#34;I will live on &#163;2,000, and put the other &#163;8,000 into the expansion of my business.&#34; Surely, that is no justification for releasing him from payment. If we exempted that class of case for which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> pleads, it would be extremely difficult to deny the same concession to those who, instead of electing to spend their money, place it to the creation of further assets. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire, in speaking again, only to make this matter perfectly clear. I understand the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> to have said that when the balance remaining in the hands of a company has been taxed, it will not be taxed again. But I think he added that it would not be taxed again unless, in the distribution of that balance in any future year, an individual shareholder&#39;s portion were brought within the taxable ambit set out under this Bill. What happens in the case, . say, of a butter factory is this : A factory has a surplus to credit of profit and loss account. This is distributed (a) by dividend to shareholders, (b) by transfer to reserve, and (c) by balance paid to suppliers during the next succeeding monthly payments. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not intend to lose sight of the main point at issue in connexion with this provision. With me it is not a question of when these profits will be distributed, or what taxation they will pay either in one form or another. The principle of co-operation is so valuable that I do not wish to see the reserves of genuinely co-operative societies subjected to taxation at all. That being so, I hope that the mover of the amendment will allow it to go to a vote. It appears to me that even from the Ministerial standpoint men of straw are constantly being put up merely for the purpose of being knocked down. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> has said that if these mythically large reserves of genuinely co-operative societies are ultimately distributed amongst the shareholders, those shareholders will have to pay the tax upon them, if by this addition their ordinary incomes are brought within the taxable ambit. </para>

                <para class="block">Wales) &#91;3.50&#93;. - It is proposed by paragraph f of clause 2 to amend the definition of&#34; income from personal exertion &#39; &#39; by inserting after the word &#34;derived&#34; the words &#34;from sources&#34;. This raises the question of the definition of the term &#34; from sources in Australia.&#34; For the sake of clarity in connexion with the collection of our income taxation I suggest that there should be some distinct definition of the term &#34; from sources in Australia.&#34; The Commissioner for Taxation issued some time ago a handbook on the war profits tax. I think he is to be congratulated upon the clarity with which he deals with the multiplicity of complications in this legislation. In that handbook he defines the words &#34; from sources in Australia &#34; in these terms - </para>
                <para>In the case of sales made by Australians in businesses of persons outside of Australia, the question sometimes arises whether, in fact, the profit has arisen partly or wholly from sources in Australia? If the business has been actually transacted in Australia, the whole resulting profit is taxable. In determining that business has been actually transacted in Australia, in such cases it is necessary that any two of the following three places be in Australia: - (1) The place where the contract of sale is made; that is. where the orders are definitely accepted. (2) The place where the goods are delivered to the purchaser; that is, the place where they cease to be at the vendor&#39;s risk, and where they are taken over by the purchaser. (3) The place where payment is made. </para>
                <para class="block">There should be some definition of the words &#34;from sources in Australia,&#34; and I therefore move - </para>
                <para>That after the word &#34; sources &#34; in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">(f)</inline> the following words be inserted :  - &#34;Provided that the profits shall be deemed to have been derived from sources within Australia, when any two of the following three places are in Australia: - (1) The place where the contract of sale is made ; that is, where the orders are definitely accepted. (2) The place where the goods are delivered to the purchaser. (3) The place where payment is made.&#34; </para>
                <para class="block">I submit this amendment to make the position perfectly clear. The commercial and trading world regard this definition by the Commissioner of Taxation as a perfectly clear and equitable one. I feel quite sure that with the present Commissioner administering the Taxation Department there will be no trouble over this matter. But if it is already defined in print by the Commissioner of Taxation, and is already being acted upon by the income tax authorities, there can be no objection to the incorporation of this definition in the Act itself, in order that this equitable principle may be laid down for all time and that so long as the Act  is in operation there may be no possibility of dispute on this point. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like to point out that, apart from the merits or demerits of the amendment, it cannot possibly be made where the honorable senator proposes that it should be made. He overlooks the fact that if the amendment were carried it would involve the insertion of certain words in the middle of a section of the existing Act, and this, followed by a new series of clauses now submitted, would be absurd. The honorable senator must see that he must make provision for the insertion of this amendment in that part of the existing Act to which it refers. </para>

                    <para>. -  In paragraph <inline font-style="italic">j</inline> of clause 2, it is proposed that there should be a new definition of the word &#34; value &#34; in relation to live stock, and that in future the value of live stock shall be &#34; the value as prescribed.&#34; I am not quite sure what that means; but I am under the impression that the intention is that the Income Tax Commissioner is, of his own volition, to value the whole of the live stock in Australia, instead of permitting the owners to do so. In my view, it would be far better that paragraph <inline font-style="italic">j</inline> should be left out, and that the Act. in this respect should remain as it is. The owners of live stock should be allowed to value their own stock, and pay taxation accordingly. </para>

                <para class="block">Commonwealth to collect its income tax. It will be remembered that, on the second reading of the Bill, the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> specifically asked me, if I felt so inclined, to pursue further this question of uniformity of taxation. I quoted in my second-reading speech many figures. None of them has been replied to. I should like to accept the Minister&#39;s invitation to consider this matter further.. I &#39; regret that, in my view, it was not adequately dealt with by the Minister in his reply to the second-reading debate. In order to make the position clear, I shall direct the attention of honorable senators to the figures I quoted before, at the risk of having to repeat some of them. </para>
                <para>It is generally recognised by all who come into contact with the business community that there is a&#34; most profound feeling of dissatisfaction amongst income taxpayers throughout Australia in connexion with the complexity and complications of the methods adopted. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> has publicly stated that uniformity in income tax collection would save the taxpayers of Australia &#163;1 .500,000 a year in time, trouble, and expense. National efficiency is so very often urged upon us that why, in Heaven&#39;s name, the Government do not tackle this problem I cannot, for the life of me, understand. On the Treasurer&#39;s own showing, the taxpayers can save &#163;1,500,000 at once, and yet, for years past, and even this year, this question has been pecked at and altered with until we are in no better position than we were in five years ago. In March of last year, at a Conference of Commissioners of Taxation, Federal and State, a uniform Income Tax Bill was drafted. For this the Commonwealth Income Tax Assessment Act was taken as a basis. This meant that the States, under the pressure of circumstances, and with a desire to unify this matter throughout Australia, practically agreed to jettison the State Acts and build up a uniform measure on the basis of what the Commonwealth was doing. Since then nothing has been done. </para>

                        <para>- I shall come to that shortly. Nothing has been done, and we have had another Premiers&#39; Conference. . State rights and Commonwealth rights seem to be clashing with each other, just the same as if there were no war on and no reform were needed in this direction. Judging from the inconclusive results, and the want of <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> of all parties concerned, uniformity seems as far off as ever. It is futile for the State  Commissioners  or the Commonwealth Commissioner to think they live in glass houses. Both sides can throw stones at one another, and it is common knowledge that the administration of the Commonwealth Income Tax Department is inefficient and unsatisfactory. I have no hesitation, on comparing the administration of the Commonwealth Department with that of New South Wales, in saying that the latter is infinitely more efficient and thorough. To prove this, I put forward, on the second reading, figures that appeared to me reasonably correct. I think honorable senators agree with me that there are tens and scores of thousands of people throughout Australia who are not paying the Federal tax they should pay. My figures fully proved that that was so. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> reply, in effect, was that if it were so a year ago, it was not going to occur any longer, because the Commonwealth Taxation Department had received nearly 600,000 returns this year. </para>

                        <para>- I am coming to that. The returns in the New South Wales Income Tax Department number over 200,000, and the assessments are only 60,000, so that it by no means follows that because the Commonwealth has 600,000 returns this- year the big gap between the assessments last year and the number of people who ought to pay income tax will be bridged. I gave figures, on what I considered good authority, that proved, in effect, and approximately, that the efficient organization of the Income Tax Department of the State of New South Wales enabled it to collect a sum equivalent to the&#39; amount collected throughout New South Wales by the Federal Department. I showed that the income tax revenue from the whole Commonwealth last year was, approximately, &#163;5,500,000. If we take two-fifths of that amount, a proportion that holds good in most comparisons regarding the States, so far as I have studied them, we get, approximately, the proportion of that sum collected for the whole State of New South Wales. That would be just over &#163;2,000,000. The State Department collected last year &#163;2,040,000, or, approximately, the same amount as the Commonwealth. </para>

                <para>The maximum assessment in New South Wales is ls. lid. for property, and ls. 3d. for a company. The exemption in New South Wales of income before the tax starts is &#163;250. Compare these with the Commonwealth exemption of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;156,</inline> and the Commonwealth maximum rates of 6s. 3d. for property and ls.  10&#189;d.  for companies, and honorable senators will at once begin to see that there is something wrong with the Federal Income Tax Department. I have it further, on the best authority I can get, that if the State of New South Wales collected income tax with the machinery of its State Department on the Commonwealth graduation and with the Commonwealth exemption we could get nearer &#163;4,000,000 in New South Wales than the &#163;2,000,000 odd that the Federal Income Tax Department is getting there now. I stated on the second &#34; reading  that the New South Wales Department collected income tax for 1915-16 to the extent of &#163;1,653,000, and that the amount collected in the same period, in the same State, by the Commonwealth authorities was only &#163;1,691,000, or a difference in favour of the Commonwealth of &#163;38,000. </para>

                        <para>- The amounts collected at the Central Office consist principally of money from taxpayers who have assessable incomes in more than one State. I have taken the trouble since my honorable friend raised that point to see what <inline font-style="italic">Knibbs</inline> says about this period. He states that in New South Wales, for the period 1915-16, the Federal Income Tax authorities collected &#163;1,197,000, and that a sum of &#163;1,393,000 was collected at the&#39; Central Office. If we again take the proportion of two-fifths as representing the share of New South Wales, the amount collected for that State at the Central Office, added to the amount collected in New South Wales, gives a total figure which exceeds the amount collected by the State Department for the same period of less than &#163;100,000. Seeing that my figures show an excess in favour of the Commonwealth of &#163;38,000, and that the figures my honorable friend relies on show an excess in favour of the Commonwealth of less than &#163;100,000, I claim that my argument is sound and has not yet been refuted, and that the figures on which I base my arguments are true and unassailable. </para>

                <para>As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has asked me to carry the matter further, I point out that in the Income Tax Department of New South Wales a staff of 140 persons, consisting of sixty-eight permanent and seventy-two temporary officers, is employed. This staff collects an amount approximately the same as the Commonwealth. The Federal Income Tax Department in Sydney employs over 500 persons, and they work overtime from six to eight months in the year. There, again, the comparison is in favour of the State methods, because 140 officers collect approximately the same amount of income tax as 400 officers, after allowing for land tax administration. I have proved up to the hilt the necessity for more efficient methods in the collection of Commonwealth income taxation. I have shown that, instead of collecting &#163;6,000,000 in income tax this year, we ought to collect nearer &#163;9,000,000, and it cannot be gainsaid, in view of the differences in the exemptions and graduations, that if New South Wales is going to collect &#163;2,250,000 this year from its State income tax, the Department of that State, if intrusted with the collection of the Federal tax, would gather in nearer &#163;4,000,000 for New South Wales than the amount the Federal Department is getting now. </para>
                <para>Reverting to the much-vexed question of uniformity, which, according to the Treasurer, will save the taxpayers &#163;1,500,000 a year in time, trouble, and expense, and to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen&#39;s</inline> interjection that the Bill does something towards achieving uniformity, I have here the report of the resolutions and proceedings of the Conference of Commonwealth and State taxation officers held at Melbourne in March of last year. In the appendix to this report there is a suggested uniform Act for Commonwealth and State income tax assessment, which, I understand, was unanimously adopted by the Commonwealth and State Commissioners. I have here the suggested Act with the alterations proposed, and I think it has been suggested, though I do not know whether it has been definitely stated, that the amending Bill, with which we are now dealing, is an advance in the direction of uniformity. Does the Leader of the Senate claim that? He does not reply. I will tell him what I think about it. </para>

I have taken the trouble to go through this suggested uniform Act, which was unanimously agreed to by the. Commissioners in March of last year, and compare it with the amending Bill now before the Committee. Approximately, I suppose, there are in this amending Bill about 100 alterations of the principal Act, and I say most definitely that, approximately, about 25 per cent. of them are in the direction of uniformity, while about 75 per cent. are getting away from that principle of uniformity which was unanimously recommended last year. </para>

                        <para>- I say it was the unanimous opinion of the States Taxation Commissioners at that Conference that the income of companies should be taxed at its source. These gentlemen met in Melbourne over a period of several weeks, each of the States and the Commonwealth being represented, and the result of their deliberations, as I have already said, was the suggestion that a uniform Act, on the lines of the Commonwealth Act, should be adopted, and I regret that those responsible for the drafting of the measure now before the Chamber have not seen fit to keep reasonably within the ambit of the Conference&#39;s resolutions. </para>

I feel that this matter is very important. Probably the clause is the most important in the whole Bill, and I therefore made a few notes in regard to where we are on this question of uniformity. </para>

                <para>The chief reason assigned by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> for his refusal to tax company profits at their source is that that method of taxation is unjust;  that the rate of tax should be computed on the aggregate income ; and that, by taxing company profits directly, the principle of aggregation of income would be violated. I think the Minister in charge of the Bill, in his reply on the second-reading debate, also mentioned this, and gave some attention to the question of equitable taxation. I am not advocating any inequitable taxation. I have said time and time again that the burdens of the future will have to be placed upon the backs of those best able to bear them, and that the richer a man is the more he ought to pay. Consequently, I am heart and soul with the graduated system of taxation. </para>

                        <para>- No. The small shareholder, whose total income is below the exempted minimum, pays indirectly at the Commonwealth rate, although he is not liable for taxation. Under the present Income Tax Act undistributed profits are aggregated, so most complicated results follow. It is fair to claim that the present method of taxing company&#39;s profits is both inconsistent and illogical. That is the point I want to make to the Minister. I should like to say, also, that it is quite possible to tax the whole income of a company at its source, and yet retain and apply the principle of individual graduation. This matter has engaged the attention of practically all the trading organizations, all the accountants, and all the income tax assessors of Australia. For years they have been placing before the, Federal Treasurer various suggestions, but, owing possibly to the war coming upon us, necessitating the Minister&#39;s attention being given to other important subjects, this seemingly unimportant matter,, by which the people can save &#163;1,500,000 a year, has been overlooked. I say: Let a company pay taxation on the profits earned during the taxable year, irrespective of  the amount distributed or retained, as, I understand, is the practice in Victoria. Then let the shareholder show in his personal schedule the dividends received by him, and include such dividends in his income tax return for the purpose of aggregating the total income; and allow the shareholder a rebate on the dividend at the rate paid by him in the company return. This could be automatically done in the Income Tax Office, and not by the taxpayer himself. If the shareholder is exempt from taxation, the tax paid on his behalf by the company can be claimed by him and refunded. This refund could be obtained by a simple form of declaration supported by the necessary evidence. </para>

                <para>If the Minister in charge of the Treasury says uniformity has to come, then uniformity will be very near. If, however, the question is met in the spirit of seeing only its very many difficulties we shall never get nearer than we are now. There are difficulties to be overcome, but if one does not want to overcome them, then 150 different reasons can be found, for instance, by the Treasurer, or the Commissioner of Taxation, why they cannot be circumvented. The. case for uniformity is universally accepted. </para>
                <para>Summing up the position, I cannot do better than quote from a joint letter sent to the Melbourne newspapers a little while ago by representatives especially appointed for the purpose by the Incorporated Institute of Accountants, the Society of Accountants and Auditors of England, the Employers Federation, the Federal Institute of Accountants,&#34; and the Chamber of Manufactures. Those representatives included such men as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cuming, president</inline> of the Chamber of Manufactures, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Keep,</inline> of the Chamber of Commerce. They said they were perfectly in accord with the conclusion that if half-a-dozen business men sat down together for half-a-day they could devise a satisfactory arrangement to prevent the duplication of income tax returns. Those representatives, in their letter, continued - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>Disappointment must be expressed that nothing definite resulted from the Premiers&#39; Con,ference in Sydney regarding the uniformity of taxation returns. As far back as 26th March last, in a letter to the Federal Treasurer, we suggested that the matter be referred to a commission including skilled accountants and representative business men. It appears to us that  this is the only way to obtain any result which will be satisfactory to the community  as&#62;  a whole. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>I do not wish to delay the Committee further. This is proba&#39;bly the most important clause in the Bill. If we can obtain uniformity, and go back in the direction of simplicity in taxation, many pages of complicated print, such as the Committee has before it, would disappear. I see no necessity for much of - it.~ We have set out on a deliberate, scientific, academic system, and assuming that the Secretary to the Treasury, the Government Statistician, and the then&#39; Commissioner of Taxation are responsible for taxation Bills, they have imposed on the taxpayers one of the most complicated and intricate Bills possible to produce, as a result of which taxpayers are put to the expenditure of time and trouble, and the Government of the country are not able to collect all the taxes which are their due. </para>

I am glad it is included, because I look upon it as a step in the direction in which we so intensely desire to proceed, namely, that there should be some simplification of the system of taxation. To have a State Taxing Department in every State and a Federal Taxing Department in every State also, is becoming unendurable. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and the difficulty is to get out of the error. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has brought forward some startling figures regarding the cost and number of officials in the two Departments in New South Wales. I hope the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> will be in a position to reply in some detail upon the figures quoted. I agree with. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> that one explanation as to the excessive number of officials required in the Federal Department is in respect to the taxation of companies. I strongly agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> that if we taxed the profits of companies - that is, taxed them at their source - we would be going a long way in the direction of simplification. At present we tax a company only on the undistributed amount of its assets, and shareholders, when they get their dividends, have to pay on the remaining, amount. </para>

                        <para>- I know that they are two distinct amounts. It means  a  huge expenditure of time and trouble to the Federal Department to have to go closely over the returns of great numbers of taxpayers to ascertain whether shareholders are evading taxation. I fear that, despite all the efforts on the part of the officials, many people manage to dodge their responsibilities. If  a  company were taxed on the whole of its income, and then distributed it to  its  shareholders, as the shareholders received their portion they could claim upon the Treasury, which would have to refund the amount which had been overpaid by them. </para>

I carefully studied that measure and thought it very clear and concise. I&#34; could understand its every clause, but I have not had the same experience with respect to the Bill presented by the Commonwealth Government. I hope something really tangible in the direction I have indicated may be brought about before Parliament meets again. I do not advocate reduction of taxation. In fact, it is going to be all the other way. We know that wealth must bear its share. All that I  am  afraid of is that its share  is  going to be the whole lot. In  my  opinion we shall all be having to start off from scratch together again. However, so long as we win the war that is the only thing that matters. T know well, and have said so before, that when it comes to a matter of sacrifice it is impossible to compare life with wealth. I hope the Government will take the matter seriously in hand. </para>

                    <para>. -  Very much of the alleged excessive cost incurred in the collection of Federal income tax is due to the extraordinary and almost incomprehensible formula which has been supplied by some astute mathematician for the calculation of a person&#39;s income. The formula is quite beyond the capacity of any member of this Committee to comprehend, and it may be said to be mainly responsible for what appears to be the extraordinary number of officials required by the Commonwealth in its New South Wales Department, as compared with the total employed by the State Income Department. But it is possible that there is another and very lucid explanation of the difference in the amounts collected by each of those collecting bodies. State income tax in New South Wales accelerates, on small incomes, much more rapidly - even after the  &#163;250  exemption is allowed - than the tax under the formula supplied by the Commonwealth taxing authorities. </para>

                        <para>- One of the factors overlooked by the honorable senator is that, notwithstanding the complicated formula adopted by Hie Federal Income Tax Commissioner, the amount which has to be paid on small salaries accelerates much more rapidly under the State taxing machinery, with an exemption of  &#163;250,  than it does under the Federal tax-, ing machinery, with an exemption of  &#163;156.  But that is not the only reason why the cost of collection may be greater  in the case of the Commonwealth. It must be remembered that the Commonwealth Income Tax Commissioner has also to collect the Federal land tax. </para>

                        <para>- How simple a land tax would be at, say, 3d. in the &#163;1, is known to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> as well as to myself. Any person would then be able to calculate his liability without the slightest difficulty. Yet a trifling tax of 3d. in the&#163;1 would produce a revenue of &#163;5,000,000 annually. It must be remembered, too, that in New South Wales the Taxation Commissioner has to employ a very considerable staff in order to calculate the land tax which has to be collected in that State. There, a very complicated formula is adopted. It starts at &#163;5,001, with a tax of11-18750d. in the &#163;1, and it goes, either in a sweep or a curve - I am not sure which - up to &#163;75,000. At that point, and subsequently, a flat rate of 9d. in the &#163;1 is operative. If, however, the landowner is an absentee, he is entitled to no exemption whatever. Notwithstanding the plank in the Labour party&#39;s platform that there shall be a rigid exemption of &#163;5,000, the Labour Government imposed upon absentee land -owners a flat rate of1d. in the &#163;1 until &#163;5,000 is reached. Then, at &#163;5,001, they have to pay 21-18750d. in the &#163;1 until &#163;80,000 is reached. At that point a flat rate of10d. in the &#163;1 becomes operative. What the rate of the tax is between these various amounts only a very limited numiber of honorable senators would be able to calculate, and we ought not to expect the army of gentlemen employed in the Federal Income Tax Department to be able to make such calculations any more rapidly, or any more correctly, than can the average member of this Parliament. </para>

                <para>A very substantial allowance ought to be made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> on account of the cost of collecting the Federal land tax. In New South Wales, the State land tax, which is a flat rate of1d. in the &#163;1, does not apply to any of the lands in the Eastern or Central Divisions, and only to a comparatively small area in the Western Division. As a matter of fact the total revenue collected under this heading last year was only &#163;3,190. It should not impose a very great strain upon the time of the New South Wales Income Tax Commissioner to send out the notices involved in the collection of such a small amount. In condemning the Federal Income Tax Commissioner, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> should remember these facts. I would also remind him that the wartime profits tax has to be collected by that officer. Obviously, he requires very substantial assistance to enable him to accomplish his task. Then there are a number of other taxes which have been imposed, but which have not yet been collected. I think I have said sufficient to show that it is unfair to institute a comparison between the Federal Income Tax Commissioner and the New South Wales Income Tax Commissioner to the detriment of the former. In New South Wales there is a general exemption of &#163;250, and the tax increases, not by fractions of a penny, but by pence, and this fact makes it quite a simple matter to calculate the impost involved. </para>
                <para>There are other reasons why I think it is advisable to pass this clause. It really represents an effort, however small, on the part of the Government to terminate what is unquestionably a source of tremendous annoyance to those persons who have large incomes, especially in the different States. The army of clerks which must be employed by this class to protect their incomes must be a source of very great expense and very great annoyance to them. I know perfectly well that, owing to the energy that is displayed by the Australian workman, he is now able, with the aid of machinery, to produce so much every year that he can afford to, and does, keep whole armies of men battening  upon him. without rendering him any service whatever. Yet it was even gravely suggested here to-day that another Committee should be appointed to unravel what is as plain as noonday. </para>

                        <para>- I am quite aware of that. But when the Commonwealth took over the Customs and Excise duties, the machinery in the various States relating to those matters was either abolished or taken charge of and operated from one centre, with a fair degree of satisfaction and considerable economy. This clause represents an effort on the part of the Government to secure authority - whenever the States will agree to this course being adopted - to collect income tax for them. I, for one, am not prepared to hand over to the States the business of collecting the Commonwealth income tax. </para>

There are only three ways in which we can secure uniformity. One is by the Commonwealth bludgeoning the States regardless of their constitutional rights; the second is by the Commonwealth surrendering to them and saying, -&#34;Do just as you like&#34; - a course which is plainly impossible; and the third is the alternative which is here offered, namely, an agreement with the States. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has spoken as if the Commonwealth were a defaulter in this matter. But it can truthfully be said that this is the first practical step in the direction of securing uniformity. By means of this clause the Government will say to the States, &#34; We are now ready to arrive at an agreement with you to attain this desirable objective.&#34; The Government are doing this, though not a single State has, so far, moved in that direction. I do not blame the States for their inaction. Any individual State may well say, &#34;It is useless for us to move until we know that the central authority is ready to meet us.&#34; But this Bill, when passed, will be a plain intimation from the National Legislature that we are now open to negotiate with the States with a view to arriving at an agreement with them which will be to our mutual advantage. </para>

                <para>There was no need for the denunciation of this clause in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> indulged. Surely the honorable senator does not intend to oppose it. Yet those who listened to him, if they were not aware of the circumstances, could only conclude that he was in some way criticising the Government for failing to do something. This clause embodies the only practical thing we can do at the present moment. It is an offer to the States, and it is for them to say whether they will accept it or not. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> said that it is useless for the taxing authorities of the Commonwealth, and of the States, to throw bricks at one another. That might be so, but it does not apparently prevent some people from throwing bricks at both of them, which, by the way, is always a popular thing to do. </para>

                <para>Let me say, with regard to the honorable senator&#39;s general criticism that the Bill does not move in the direction of uniformity, that I entirely differ from him on that point. First of all, the Bill was not unanimously adopted by the Conference of Taxation Commissioners. They were not at all unanimous in dealing with the matter, but this measure includes every provision put before the Conference which was adopted either unanimously or by a majority. In the circumstances it may fairly be claimed that it does go a long way to secure uniformity. Whilst that is done by this Bill, may I ask what the several State Governments have done to bring about uniformity in their present diverse laws? They have done nothing at all. I repeat, therefore, that this proposal represents a direct practical and immediate advance towards that uniformity which every one believes to be desirable. </para>

Many reasons point to that. One is that the Commonwealth, being the collecting agency, would establish uniformity, and there is no other guarantee for it. </para>
                <para>I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> will not mind my expressing a considerable amount of surprise and regret that when he makes statements here he is not more careful to set out those factors which ought not in fairness to be ignored.

                        <para>- The honorable senator made the state&#39;ment that there were 500 officials employed in the Income Tax Department. As a matter of fact, the Department is not an Income Tax Department alone, but has many  other  activities, and if the honorable senator desired to deal with the matter judicially he should have set out clearly the work which the Department had to undertake. If he wishes to establish a reputation for putting matters fairly and in a judicial spirit before the Senate he must be careful not to ignore such important factors, as otherwise the officials directly concerned might complain that they were not fairly treated when the honorable senator&#39;s statement would lead to the conclusion that they were a lot of incompetents or idlers. The honorable senator should recognise, when referring to the number of officials employed, that it is important to consider the duties they are called upon to discharge. </para>

                <para>One of the points of difference between the Commonwealth and States taxation authorities at present is whether it is or is not right to tax incomes at their source. I am not going to argue as to the convenience to the staffs of the Taxation Department of the method adopted. I am not greatly concerned about that, but I am concerned about the equity of the taxation as it affects the taxpayer. Under the system prevailing in New South Wales there are possibly thousands of men with small incomes paying a greater tax than they ought to pay, and, correspondingly, a number of rich men escaping taxation which they ought, to Pay: </para>

                        <para>- Yes, in New South Wales to-day. That arises in this way: New South Wales, like the Commonwealth, has a graduated tax, and has decreed that a man with a small income* shall pay at a lower rate than a man with a higher income. The New South Wales Government fixed a flat rate upon the profits of companies. A small shareholder might otherwise be exempt from income tax altogether, but if he draws &#163;50, &#163;100, or in New South Wales up to &#163;250 a year as income from a company, he has to pay taxation upon it. If he obtained that amount of income from any other source he would be free of the State income taxation, but deriving it from the profits of a company he is called upon to pay a flat rate of ls. 5jd. in the &#163;1. At the same time, while he is paying that flat rate upon an income which the Parliament of the State said ought not to be taxable, there is alongside of him a big shareholder who ought to be paying 3s. or 4s. in the &#163;1, who is only paying the same rate of ls. 5Jd. </para>

                        <para>- It is largely a matter of speculation, unless one has a very intimate knowledge of the working of the land tax system in the Commonwealth and the States, to decide which involves the most work, or would relieve people to the greater extent of inconvenience. It seems to me that the Commonwealth system, under which the Government say to a taxpayer, irrespective of whether his income is obtained from the profits of a company or in the ordinary way of trade as an individual, &#34; Send in your return, and we shall directly and simply assess you at the rate appropriate to the income you have earned,&#34; is simplicity itself compared with the alternative now offered. It is now proposed that, first of all, a company should be charged a flat rate, and then the shareholder, whose proper rate would be less than that, should come to the Taxation Department for a refund, whilst a taxpayer whose rate was higher would have issued to him a supplementary notice charging him with the difference. It seems to me that as between the two the system operating in the Commonwealth can claim the laurels on the ground of simplicity. I cannot help thinking that a number of the prominent gentlemen, as they are, and honorable men who put forward the other view, are influenced in their judgment by the circumstances of those with whose affairs they are familiar, namely, the recipients of the higher incomes. For every  recipient  of a higher income there must be ten, twenty, or fifty recipients of smaller incomes. I cannot help thinking that the people who talk in the way to which I have referred, and write to the newspapers about it, are not greatly concerned about taxpayers of small amounts, but on behalf of the taxpayers of small amounts I put in a protest against the proposal to alter the present system requiring each taxpayer to send in his return of his income, and pay tax on .the measure of the income he receives. </para>

                    <para>. - I rise to commend the Government for having at last proposed something in the direction of uniformity in connexion with our Taxation Departments. I think this clause is a step in the direction of the goal, which I hope yet to see attained, of one taxing master and one tax gatherer. I cannot understand the position taken up by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> or his calculations. I do not claim to be an authority on such calculations, but I believe that the Federal method of taxation is more equitable to the small taxpayer than is the method adopted by the State of New South Wales. T have made up the taxation return for a friend, who, under the New South Wales law, has an exemption of &#163;250, and under the Commonwealth law an exemption of &#163;156. He has to pay income tax to the State Government to the amount of &#163;19 7s. lid., and to the Commonwealth Government to the extent of &#163;10 ls. 7d. I can let <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> see the papers in this case, and perhaps * he will be able to account for the difference. The matter is one which does not greatly concern those who, like myself, have to pay income taxation which is very light compared with that which has to be paid by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> and his friends. It is a privilege and honour for them to assist their country to the extent of the amount they are paying, and I only wish I was in the same box, and had to do the same. Income taxation, as imposed by the Commonwealth, is more favorable, equitable, and just, so far as the small taxpayer is concerned. The contention that the Commonwealth should consent to allow the States to collect its taxation for it is absolutely untenable. We have not the sovereign rights in regard to certain matters of self-government that the States have, and it is our duty, wherever we think we should have uniformity, to seek to give the Commonwealth Parliament, by means of an alteration of the Constitution, constitutional power and sovereign rights. That applies particularly to taxation. </para>

                    comparison of the number of employees in two different Taxation Departments - State as against Federal - is unfair and unjust. He gave only one side of the question. It was just as if he said that a certain business was carried on with a certain number of employees, and another business with considerably less, without mentioning the important fact that the larger number of employees had to do ten times more work than the others. I guarantee that the Federal Income Tax Commissioner and his Department have ten times the work that the New South Wales Commissioner and his Department have to do. I hope the Government will not allow the clause to be altered. It is a step in the right direction, and I shall vote with the Government to keep it as it stands.

It does not matter to the taxpayer to a very great degree whether the system is State or Federal. We want, of course, a simple system, and I have been assured that the taxation of companies at the source is the most economical method. I do not know whether that is so or not, and do not pretend to express an opinion. </para>

                    <para>. - The complexity of modern commercial transactions is necessarily reflected to a very large extent in income tax legislation. Whether it would be more economical for the States to collect taxation on behalf of the Commonwealth, or for the Commonwealth to collect it on behalf of the States, is a moot point. As the Commonwealth possesses very few exclusive powers of taxation, there must from time to time arise, from the very necessities of the case, considerable difference between Acts of. taxation which operate in the same field. There is a great deal of talk about uniformity, but I, for one, am not greatly struck with the principle. Australia is a very big country - a continent as big as Europe, with the exception of European Russia. Instead of adding to the functions of the Commonwealth Government, it is desirable, if possible, to reduce them and to confine the sphere of Commonwealth legislation to a few of the larger continental principles of government. In the Constitution we have dozens of powers which we have not yet exercised. As a general principle it would be wise for the Commonwealth Legislature, so long as the principle of Federation continues to be observed, to refrain from creating new Departments in connexion with Commonwealth activities where State Departments of a similar kind have long been in existence. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>We talk about an approach to uniformity. This, of course, is an invitation to the States to subordinate their income taxation Departments to the newly created </para>
                <para class="block">Commonwealth Department. To my mind the efficiency of the officers of the Commonwealth Department, as of those of the State Departments, is not called in question, but it is extremely undesirable for the Commonwealth to create new Departments of taxation where similar State Departments already exist. I was one of those who, filled with enthusiasm, helped, in my humble way, to establish the new Commonwealth. We were told at the time that the cost of Federation would be a mere trifle, and, although perhaps too much was anticipated in the direction of economy, there is no doubt that the cost of Commonwealth activities has almost appalled those who were most enthusiastically in favour of Federation at the outset, and who are still hopeful of the prospects of our Commonwealth. The Commonwealth, which only lately instituted income tax legislation, had before it evidence that in almost every State income taxation was being levied, but it created a new Department, or added to the officers of the existing Taxation Department. If it follows that principle through the- whole field of taxation, where very few of our powers are exclusive, we shall have a tremendous multiplication of the Commonwealth Public Service. Against this I am going to set my face. </para>
                <para>There is nothing mandatory in the clause, nor could it constitutionally contain anything mandatory, and I do not think it desirable that it should. It is only permissive, and innocuous enough. It is an invitation to the States to set aside their, in some cases, long-established Departments of Taxation, in favour of the newly created Commonwealth Department. That is a wrong principle, which I shall not support by any vote of mine. For the future, if a Department exists, common to all the States, which can be utilized to collect Commonwealth taxation or carry out Commonwealth duties, that Department, in the interests of national economy, will have to be used until the principle of Federation is superseded by something else. <inline font-style="italic">No</inline> doubt the clause, if availed of by the States, will tend to something in the way of uniformity, but I do not think any great or practical degree of uniformity is as possible as some of those who are intimately acquainted with the work of the Departments make out. I recollect an Income Tax Act which I helped to enact in Tasmania. Owing to the exigencies of the economic and industrial conditions of that State, we had to do things there in connexion, with income taxation which we did very reluctantly, and which probably no Legislature in any of the other States would have cared to do. That being so, it must be recognised that over this continent there will always be a great disparity and difference of conditions in connexion with the particular activities which are selected as suitable subjects for taxation. </para>
                <para>The only thing I believe will ensue from the wide discussion of this principle is that the people of the Commonwealth, who are still very much more in favour of the Federal principle than some individuals seem to think, will set their faces against any duplication of services and instrumentalities which already exist in the States, and which can be utilized by the Commonwealth for the purposes of Commonwealth services entailed by legislation passed by this Parliament. There is no occasion to oppose the clause, but I expect no very great result from it, because it says to the States, in effect: &#34;Our Taxation Department must stand. If you like to recognise that, we will collect your taxes for you, but, although your Departments were in existence before ours, we decline to set aside our agency in favour of yours.&#39;&#39; That is to say, we will permit the States to subordinate their agencies to ours in the field of taxation, which is as open to them as to us; but we declare, by means of this clause, that we certainly shall not do away with our Taxation Department in favour of theirs, notwithstanding that theirs were in existence long before ours. </para>

I have already pointed out that in at least half the alterations made by this Bill in the existing Act, the Government depart from the uniformity arrived at by the Conference of Taxation Commissioners last year. This clause, in effect, provides that it shall be lawful for the Commonwealth to collect the State taxes. It does not make provision for the States to collect the tax for the Commonwealth. It says in so many words, &#34;We, the supreme Commonwealth, are willing to swallow you up whenever you are ready to be swallowed; our methods must be your methods ; our taxation must be your taxation ; our officials must be your officials.&#34; It does not pay the due and proper regard that should be paid by the Commonwealth to the efficient State officers. </para>

                        <para>- I repeat that the Minister did not challenge figures which I have twice given in comparing the collections by the New South Wales Taxation offices, though he read me a .little homily on the accuracy of my statements relating to the comparison of results achieved by employees in the two Sydney offices. I did mention the number of employees in the Sydney Income Taxation Office, and regret that I made the slip, because it could be clearly understood from my further references to the matter that I meant the Federal Taxation Department in New South Wales. I repeat that in the New South Wales Taxation Department there is a staff of 140, consisting of sixty-eight permanent and seventy-two temporary officers, and the New South Wales Taxation Department employs over 500 persons, who, from six to eight months of the year, work overtime. Now, we have this comparison : The 140 State officers collect, approximately, the same amount of income tax as 400 persons, allowing for land tax and other administrative duties, collect in New South Wales for the Commonwealth. It may be that the 400 persons I allocated to the Federal income tax side of the Taxation Office in Sydney is too large a number; but if we allow for only 300, or even 250, we shall still have the fact that they are employees working all the time, and for six or eight months of the year working overtime, as compared with sixty-eight permanent and seventy-two temporary State officers, who work no overtime in the Taxation Department of New South Wales. </para>

                <para>It seems futile for Parliament to expect uniformity, in view of the position taken up by the Federal Taxation authorities and the Commonwealth Government. I repeat that the clause now under consideration practically says to the States, &#34; We now have legislative authority to collect your taxes, but have no necessary authority to do anything else, or avail ourselves of your offices. We have all the knowledge in connexion with income taxation, and what we do not agree to, you must. We will agree to nothing that you suggest.&#34; That is altogether a wrong attitude, and I again ask any honorable senator, if he were a Treasurer of one of the States, what would he say to the Commonwealth under these circumstances? I am sure he would say, &#34; You can go hang. You are not efficient enough to collect our taxes.&#34; </para>
                <para>Although this clause may be a little step in the direction of uniformity, I am afraid it will be inoperative, and that it will only be a step, and that after &#39;we have passed the Bill, the exasperation of the public will be greater than ever, with the result that this highly desirable reform will be put off. I appeal to the Government to appoint some business-like honorary committee, the members of which would gladly deal with the matter at no expense to the Commonwealth, because it is urgent. I have already pointed out that it costs the State of New South Wales only lj per cent, to collect its taxation, as compared with <inline font-style="italic">2\</inline> per cent. cost to the Commonwealth, and I again urge that the course suggested would lead to greater simplicity in the matter of collections than is possible under the present system, and that the Federal taxation would be greatly increased. </para>
                <para>Just a word now on the question of graduation. Nobody wants to see the rich man escape, but we do want to see all income first taxed at its source and then graduations made on individual taxpayers&#39; returns. I appeal to the Minister that these matters should be considered outside the officers concerned, in order to bring about that national efficiency which is so highly desirable. </para>

                    <para class="block">The amendment sounds complicated, no doubt, but if read into the original section it will become quite simple. It has been found necessary, because there is reason to believe that some officers have made records of the information received with respect to a taxpayer&#39;s income. These records have sometimes been used to the detriment of the Department and annoyance to the taxpayer, whose business affairs have thus been divulged. The amendment, therefore, is merely a precautionary provision. </para>

We would then be able to compare the receipts under State and Federal taxes and discover any discrepancy. This practice would also remove from the minds of some taxpayers a suspicion that others were escaping their fair share of taxation. </para>

I am in some doubt as to whether the provision is comprehensive enough to take in associations other than those specifically mentioned. As honorable senators know, there is a number of associations outside of this narrow ambit existing in Australia, helping on the development of this country. For instance, there is the Chamber of Manufactures; also the Chamber of Commerce, trade unions, and other organizations. They are all much on the same basis, and I think the provision should be comprehensive enough to include them. I have one or two suggestions to make with regard to this matter. I think the subparagraph should read as follows :  - </para>

Apparently, there would be some injustice inflicted. If it is proper to give relief from income tax payments in respect of a man who departs to fight for his country, then it seems quite proper that he should have exemption from the date of his enlistment. </para>

                        <para>- I see the objection there; but the point is that he is under military discipline, and has no time or opportunity to look after his own business affairs. The same commercial circumstances prevail, although he may not have left Australia, as would exist after he has gone abroad. Seeing that, on the whole, when a man enlists in the Military Forces he loses control of his civil freedom and becomes part of the great military machine, if it is fair to grant exemption when he has departed as a military unit, then it is fair to expand that exemption to the whole period of his being a. military unit - that is, from the time of his enlistment to the date of his discharge. I have a suggestion for a substitution in the language of the clause after the manner I have indicated. I trust the Minister will agree that it is equitable that when a soldier loses his civilian identity his exemption should begin. </para>

During that period, they have been withdrawn from their civil occupations. </para>

He has asked what would happen under this provision in the case of an Australian who, having left Australia, ultimately enlists in some Imperial unit, or some one of the Allied armies. He inquires at what date his exemption would commence. I think - speaking as a layman - that, according to this clause, such a man could claim exemption from the date of his leaving Australia, although he has not then put on the King&#39;s uniform. I ask that the clause be passed, so that I may submit it to the draftsman for the preparation of a proper amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - This is probably the most objectionable clause in the Bill. Originally, the Labour Government decided - by a nominal majority only - to foist upon the country this form of legislation as it appears in the section of the Act. It is a direct tax upon industry. The present Government, following the vicious and mischievous example set by the Labour Government, proposes to proceed along the same evil pathway. I would like to see those now in power depart from that path and get on to a proper procedure of raising national revenue. This is a proposal to take into consideration the house in which an employee may live - to calculate its value, and, presumably, the value of the land upon which it is erected - and to charge him 5 per cent. upon the total amount thus involved. Apart altogether from the basic wrong contained in the provision, this tax will fall very heavily upon some employees who receive less than &#163;156 a year. For instance, it provides for taking into consideration the accommodation occupied by a caretaker in connexion with stores, offices, and other buildings. Many of these offices and buildings are erected on land which is worth many hundreds of pounds per foot, and when the. value the accommodation provided for, say a caretaker, is taken into account, it is obvious that the tax will constitute a very serious impost upon a class of persons who are usually paid very small salaries. We  know perfectly well that the wages of watchmen and caretakers do not equal those that are received by artisans and others. But why should we seek to discourage the erection of houses if only for week-ends and pleasure purposes? Does not everybody know that to-day rentals are exceedingly high, and that anything in the form of a handicap upon those who are prepared to invest their money in buildings should not be countenanced by this Parliament ? Do we not all desire to see the building trade active, and better accommodation provided for every person ? Then why should we seek to levy a tax upon people who desire to invest in dwellings ? In New South Wales we are told that the Pair Rents Court is a serious handicap upon, and acts as a deterrent to, the erection of new houses. We know that the abnormally high cost of building materials is another serious factor, as is also the high price of land. Yet, on the top of all these things, the Government propose to still further inconvenience persons who invest their money in this form of enterprise by taxing them according to the value of their residences. I trust that the Minister will see his way to abandon this proposal. </para>

                        <para>- I think not. In the early portion of it the clause says that they shall be exempt if they are accumulated profits; but it then goes on to say that practically no account shall represent accumulated profits. It is a most extraordinary provision, and I know of several cases in which it is inflicting very great injury upon people. At the same time, I recognise that, as it is designed to protect the revenue, it will have to be passed. But I would like to tell honorable senators how it will work out. Section 14 provides that the &#34;carry forward &#34; in profit and loss account shall not be deemed to be accumulated income. Let me give an instance of the effect of that provision. Let us suppose that A and B are two companies, which, on 1st July, 1914, have each &#163;100,000 undistributed on account of contingencies. In A&#39;s books let us assume that the amount has been transferred to a reserve account, . but that in B&#39;s books it is still shown in profit and loss account. When the contingencies disappear and both companies distribute in dividends, A&#39;s shareholders will pay no tax on these dividends, whilst B&#39;s shareholders will pay tax. In other words, a book entry will make income either taxable or non-taxable. Do honorable senators fully appreciate the absurdity and unfairness of such a position, and do they realize that the proposed amendment of the clause will extend and perpetuate the injustice by so defining profit and loss account as to include &#34; appropriation account, revenue and expenses account, or any other similar account &#34; ? The clause is the most extraordinary example of proposed retrospective legislation that I have ever seen. I know of one case in which a small number of men were trading as a company. It waa practically a private company. They had an amount of &#163;22,000 to their profit and loss account, and they invested that amount in a lemon orchard on the Murray River, which will not come into bearing for five or six years. They divided the profit which was made by them prior to a Federal income tax coming into operation. Later on, when legislation was enacted authorizing the collection of this tax, the Department came down on them  with a demand for &#163;7,000. This action did seem very harsh, and I know that, as a result, these persons were put to very serious inconvenience, although the Department met them as far as it could by deferring the payment of the tax. But so long as we are legislating in this way with our eyes open, I have nothing more to say. The astounding feature of the whole business is that, under the first Income Tax Act, these profits were specially exempted from taxation. Then Mr. Tudor brought forward an amendment under which they were made taxable. I will undertake to say that there was not a single representative in another place, nor was there a single honorable senator, who understood the change which was then effected. The explanation made by the Minister was an exceedingly weak one. </para>

Under <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor&#39;s</inline> proposal, however, amounts carried forward to profit and loss account were made taxable. I am perfectly certain that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor</inline> did not understand what he was saying at the time, nor did any of the representatives in another place. Several law suits have resulted from that change in our legislation.However, I understand that there is no intention to again interfere with the people who were chiefly concerned in that litigation and who have paid up the amounts that were alleged to be due by them. Iknowthat this clause is brought forward for the purpose of protecting the revenue. At the same time, I should like the Minister to explain what accounts will now be exempt from taxation. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable senator has put to me a question which, I frankly admit, is a puzzler. I wish that I had a better cause to argue. But I cannot for the moment think of any account which will be exempted from taxation under this clause, unless it be a reserve for the equalization of dividends. Perhaps a fund so called might meet the ease. Bub the clause will impose no obligation on anybody to which he is not already liable. It says that where a company. has appropriated to a certain fund certain of its : profits, and, later on, it distributes those profits, the income so distributed shall not pay tax. But it goes on to say that if, in the meantime, those &#34;profits have been paid into funds carrying certain labels, they shall be subject to taxation. It will thus put upon companies the obligation of finding some fund which is not labelled as enumerated here. I cannot for the moment think of any other fund which -will enable the recipient taxpayer to obtain the benefit of this clause. </para>

It seems to me that the new proviso will give the Commissioner of Taxation power to go back to July, 1914, and compel all taxpayers to overhaul their multitudinous accounts, and put them to no end of expense and trouble for probably a very small amount of additional revenue. It would be well if the Minister for Repatriation could give the Committee an assurance that the effect of agreeing to the proposed new proviso will not lead to retrospective action in the direction I have indicated. </para>

                    <para>. - I have already stated that the proposed new proviso will not impose any additional liability upon any taxpayer. I do not know that I can add very much to what I have already said about it. It might have been worded somewhat differently. It sets out by saying that . any profits made before a certain date, when distributed, shall not be taxed. Having apparently opened a door wide by which accumulated profits might escape taxation, the proviso continues to carefully block, brick by brick, the space represented by the open door. I believe that the object of the proviso is to meet technical requirements rather than anything else, and I am assured that it will not impose upon anybody any taxation that is not now payable. </para>

                    raised a point in connexion with a later portion of the clause, under which a person occupying a house in connexion with his employment is called upon to add to his income its estimated annual rental value. I think that is a fair proposition provided it is stipulated that the man occupying the house shall be charged upon an addition to his income not necessarily equivalent to the rental value of the house as computed in the ordinary way, but equivalent to its rental value to him. It is quite within our knowledge that men filling certain positions are frequently given houses to live in which are more spacious than they would need. I think it is right that in such cases the taxpayer&#39;s income should &#39;include the annual rental value of the premises to him. That would insure that the occupant of such premises would not be called upon to pay taxation in respect of a higher rental than he would ordinarily have to pay for a residence that he would select for himself. I think that it is right that these persons should have to include in their income something in respect of the rental value of the premises they occupy in connexion with their employment. An ordinary taxpayer is compelled to do that.

                    <para>. -  I have heard of a State Government expending &#163;2,000 or &#163;3,000 upon the erection of a superintendent&#39;s residence, and I believe that the Commonwealth Government have spent substantial sums of money for official residences in connexion with public works in the course of construction. The amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> would enable the occupiers of these residences to escape the payment of income tax on the rental value of the property at 5 per cent. by including in their incomes only the rental value of the premises to them. I believe that under the amendment persons occupying such premises would be placed in a position of advantage as compared with persons occupying rooms or dwellings attached to many public buildings in all of the large cities. I am opposed to the whole paragraph, but I entirely object to the suggestion now made that persons occupying the buildings provided in connexion with their employment should be allowed practically to occupy them at a smaller rental than they would otherwise be required to pay. If it is a fair thing; that a man living in his own house should include in his income an amount equal to 5 per cent. of the capital value of his house and land in lieu of rent, it is not right that persons occupying residences in connexion with their occupation should have their incomes estimated on a different basis. By the way, I should like to mention that this introduces in a certain sense a land value tax without any exemption at all, providing the land is built upon, notwithstanding the fact that the Federal Labour party have agreed to a &#163;5,000 exemption in connexion with the land tax. </para>

Sometimes they may prefer to live elsewhere, and the paragraph may inflict an injustice on an employee occupying an employer&#39;s premises. I understand that

                    intends to move to substitute a new provision specifying that the employee shall pay no rent. Of course in certain circumstances the occupying of premises has to be taken into consideration when wages are being fixed. I retain an open mind on the subject until I arn perfectly clear as to what

                    (New South Wales business firm employs some one, and as part of his remuneration offers him premises to live in, it may deduct as an expense an amount represented by the value of the accommodation for that employee. If that amount is entitled to be taken off the income of the employer as a deduction for expenses, clearly it is entitled to be put on to the beneficiary as part of his income. For that reason it is thought fair that where any one, as part of his income, has the use of premises to live in, it shall be regarded as part of his emoluments, and he should be called on, if within the taxation limit, to pay tax upon it.

Apparently that is the position now placed before us by the Minister. It is highly unsatisfactory from every point of view. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> seems to have only two points of view - that from which he sees in this clause some relief to highly-paid officials, and the other when he looks through the wrong end of the telescope, and sees some injustice to a poor, struggling individual. The principle of this provision is not only fair in itself, but just to any individual, no matter what his position.  Colonel Miller,  whose name has been mentioned, or the humble school teacher, is not to pay according to the value of the bricks and mortar put into the premises by some one without consulting him, but according to the value of the premises to himself. An employer running  a  factory may put up rather  a  spacious manager&#39;s house, assuming that he is going to have a married man there, or he may have built it in the first instance to reside in himself. Later on he offers the position to a single man, or a married man with a small family, who requires but a modest cottage. It would not be fair to make the occupant, who requires only a small dwelling, pay tax on 5 per cent, of the capital value of that big place. </para>

What does he propose in the many cases that exist in the country ? </para>

                    <para>, - The clause is  not  difficult of comprehension, and it is entirely equitable. It should also commend itself to honorable senators, because it is obviously a clause which will stop those &#34;ways that are dark, and tricks that are vain,&#34; which are not unknown in the commercial world of this or any other community. Obviously, income may represent something other than actual cash received. It may represent the profits of a transaction in the shape of goods or bills. It would still be income. Suppose a person had money on mortgage, and allowed the interest to accumulate, should he be allowed to escape a payment on his income ? The clause assumes that a man has been paid the money he is entitled to receive.It would be very easy, but for this provision, for a man, by foregoing demands for &#39;payment, to build up assets, and thus avoid his income tax payment. Under  these  circumstances there is no hardship in requiring that a man shall do the fair thing. </para>

                        <para>- It is very easy to make general observations, but an act such as this will affect somebody throughout the Commonwealth in almost every line. I am not going to say whether the provisions here are more complicated than they should be. It is a distinct departure from the draft Bill of the Commissioners. I do not understand very much about what is in clause 10. Admittedly, the clause is of an extremely  complicated character, and is likely to give rise to a great deal of litigation. We have heard that some of the retrospective clauses are most unfair, and that if they are left entirely to the adjudication of the Commissioner they may be carried out in too harsh a manner. I suggest that a clause be included to provide for a Board or Boards of Reference in connexion with the administration of the whole Statute. We have already adopted the principle with respect to a very complicated law - the War-time Profits Act- namely, that it rightly admits of the establishment of Boards of Reference. It is fair to the taxpayer that there should be some Board or Boards to whom be may appeal in any case of possible injustice inflicted upon him. </para>

                        <para>- Continuing my line of argument, it is clear that, under such a complicated Act as this will be- - and it will practically give autocratic power to the Commissioner - taxpayers may eventually be placed on the horns of a dilemma. If the Commissioner attempts, in the opinion of the taxpayer, to inflict an injustice upon him, his only recourse will be to a Court of law; and the hearing of the case will follow in legal fashion, which may, or may not, give justice to the Commissioner or the taxpayer. I repeat that we have acceded to the principle in connexion with the Wartime Profits Act. </para>

I cannot think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> who has been sleeping with the Bill for the past fortnight, is not familiar with all its crevices. I invite the honorable senator to look at sub-section1a. Under that provision, it is proposed to impose a tax of 6d. in the &#163;1, plus the flat rate, in the case of absentees who draw their dividends from companies here. That means that, in addition to a flat rate, in these cases there shall be a charge of 6d. in the &#163;1. Is that complicated? Coming to the next paragraph, it provides - </para>

                    <para>The interest paid or credited by the company to any person, who is an absentee, on money raised by debentures of the company and used in Australia or on money lodged at interest in Australia with the company, shall be liable to pay the tax. The same rate is proposed to be levied there. It is, of course, a debatable question whether or not we should impose an extra tax upon an absentee. But that question has not been raised, and consequently there is no  complexity about the paragraph in question. Then, paragraph c deals with the holders of bearer debentures - those documents which cannot be traced. Here, again, the company is called upon to pay the tax as if the whole of the amount distributed by it were the income of one individual. That is done to protect the revenue, because it is impossible to trace the holder of bearer debentures. But, whilst calling on the company to pay taxation on the amount which it thus disburses, as if it were the income of one individual, it is provided in later clauses that the individual adversely affected may reveal himself if he chooses to do so to the Income Tax Commissioner, and may say to that officer, &#34; I have been charged through the company at the maximum rate. I have included the amount in my income, and, therefore, I claim that I should be charged only at the rate which that income is entitled to carry.&#34; </para>

                    <para>. - This clause may be necessary, but I believe that the charge of complexity which is so frequently made in connexion with long clauses of this description is largely occasioned by the draftsmanship. This clause covers two pages. There are four provisos in it before we reach the second sub-clause. Then there is a proviso in that sub-clause. Now, if these clauses were made very much shorter and simpler, the charge of complexity which we so frequently hear would not be made. I suppose that members of Parliament speak one kind of language; there is another kind of English which is called &#34;journalese,&#34; and it seems to me that there is still another which might very well be called &#34; draughtsmanese,&#34; which applies to the drafting of parliamentary Bills.

                        <para>- The provision might very well be epitomized in about five lines. I do not say that it is unnecessary, but the language of these clauses should be simpler, and the&#39; clauses themselves should be shorter. In the clause now under consideration, the taxation of absentees, the taxation of the debentures of a company, and the deduction by a company of a proportionate amount of the tax which should be paid by every debenture-holder, are all lumped together. I venture to say that these matters should be dealt with in separate clauses. We are embodying in this clause in an uncouth manner the salutary provisions, which should be made the subject of separate clauses, and I say this, with all due deference to the Parliamentary Draftsmen, to whom I am willing to concede the possession of any amount of ability. This proviso, which covers almost ten lines, could be met by saying that a company shall be entitled to deduct from its disbursements to share and stockholders a proportionate amount of the taxation payable by it on such disbursement. Anybody dispassionately looking at the clause must see that something savouring of more clarity should be introduced into the drafting of this financial legislation. </para>

                    <para>Provided that a company shall be entitled to deduct and retain for the use of the company from the amount payable to any of the persons, referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this sub-section such amount as is necessary to pay the tax which becomes due in respect of that amount. </para>

                <para>That sounds quite simple. But, if the Minister were a company and had made a contract for these bearer debentures in England, he would find that he could not possibly make the deduction for which this clause provides. Thus the. effect, of the clause will be to impose the highest rate of tax upon companies. I agree entirely with the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap,</inline> and I ask, the Minister if he really. thinks proposed new sub-section 2 is.necesr sary?

                    <para>. - The point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn,</inline> which forms part of this extremely simple clause, arises in this way: There are in Australia a number of really proprietary concerns, which, in order to obtain the benefit of company law, register themselves as companies.. Not infrequently they represent, in a company of 20,00,0 shares, one gentleman, who holds, say, 19,090 shares, and his wife and daughter, together with two or three clerks, who hold a share or two apiece. If a. company abstains from distributing its profits, the taxpayer who would be liable to pay a high rate of, perhaps, 4s. or 5s. in the &#163;1 escapes by the payment of a very low rate. That is not desirable. As a matter of fact, complaints have been made by ordinary traders, who say, &#34; We have not formed ourselves into a company, and. we are, bound to pay upon the higher rate, but because our competitor has formed himself into a. company, and has. not. distributed his profits, he has avoided the payment of the tax which we Lave had to pay.&#34; I think, therefore, that there is justification for this clause. </para>

I think it would help to a proper understanding of it if it were dealt with in three parts. It deals with three entirely different subjects. The first portion of it deals with the collection of the tax from absentees, the second with cases in which companies do not distribute to their members a reasonable proportion of their taxable income, and the third with butter companies. I do submit that the clause ought to be split up. </para>

                        <para>- It is. It is so complicated that a draftsman may almost be pardoned - in view of the frequency with which he finds apparently plain words capable of a double meaning - if he seeks to make quite clear the intention of the Legislature even by the employment of redundant language. I am not discussing the merits of the draftsmanship of the Bill now. I point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> that if he or any other member of the Committee believes that it is necessary to discuss or amend any one of the paragraphs of this clause it&#39; is quite open to him to do so. For that reason I say there is no disability upon the Committee in submitting the clause as a whole, seeing that every line of it is open to review. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> has rightly pointed out that under the proposed new sub-section 2 the Commissioner of Taxation is given power in certain circumstances to override a board of directors of a company. I do hot like to give this very drastic power to the Commissioner of Taxation. That is an additional reason why I hope the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> will provide some safeguard against a harsh decision by the Commissioner of Taxation.  I  quite agree that in certain circumstances the payment of legitimate taxation might be dodged if there were no provision of this kind included in the Bill. But, oh the other hand, I say that honorable senators should hesitate before they give such an autocratic and arbitrary power to the Commissioner of Taxation. This legislation may be found to be full of pitfalls, and I echo <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford&#39;s</inline> request that the clause should be dealt with in sections. We shall want to know what will be its effect upon a butter company. </para>

                        <para>- I am taking one thing at a time. I am referring to the arbitrary power given by the proposed new sub-section 2 to the Commissioner of Taxation, to say what part of the profits of a limited liability company shall be distributed so far as income tax is concerned. There may be a keen conflict of opinion between the directors of a company and the Commissioner. They may say that they must have a certain sum placed to reserves, in order to insure the stability of the company. The Commissioner will have the power under this law to say, &#34; I shall not agree to that, but will tax you upon the whole of the profits you have made.&#34; The discussion has justified my opinion as to the complexities and pitfalls of the clause. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like some information upon this clause, which must be a matter of concern to every honorable senator interested in mining. From the mining point of view this is one of the most vital clauses of the Bill. It prescribes that deductions are to be allowed for development expenditure, and that the whole of the expenditure incurred for development in any financial year shall be allowed as a deduction for that year. I am guided in the remarks I am making by a statement which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of 11th May, in an article by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Maughan,</inline> of Western Australia. In that very able article <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Maughan</inline> points&#39; out that no true profit can be said to have been earned by a mine until that development expenditure is taken into account. He mentions the fact that the Conference of Federal  and  State taxation officers unanimously recommended that development expenditure should be treated in the manner suggested, that is. to say, that any money expended upon development of a mine should be  deducted  from the income for the year in which that expenditure takes place. It is very important that our mining ventures should not be unnecessarily hampered. </para>

The amendment I propose to offer is to insert before the word &#34;appropriated&#34; in the first part of the paragraph <inline font-style="italic">bb</inline> the words &#34; expended in that year for development or.&#34; I think that that will meet the objection taken by a number of honorable senators interested in mining constituencies.

If it had not been cleared up some injustice would very possibly have been inflicted on small mineowners. The amendment should meet the views of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham,</inline> and should assist the stimulation of mining so necessary in Australia just now. </para>

                    <para>. - Although it involves but the addition of a very few words, the concession made by the Minister for Repatriation in this amendment is a practical and substantial one, and of great value to the mining industry. I had marked on the margin of my copy of the Bill the substitution of the word &#34; expended &#34; for the word &#34; appropriated,&#34; but the amendment submitted by the Minister in charge of the Bill will be more comprehensive than that. It represents the most material concession we have received from the Minister so far, and I accept it with pleasure. </para>

                    <para>. - I earnestly advise the Minister not to press the amendment. The very fact that new plant is included in the deduction clause in the first place is evidence that mining plant differs considerably from any other. As  a  miner, I say  that  mining plant, as a rule, has very little residual value. We might possibly get  a  little for a portable engine which has  not  been in use too long, but the bulk of mining plant has practically no residual value. I am acquainted with one of the largest mines on the North-East coast of Tasmania, where two batteries of. fifty head each were erected, and operated  for  about thirty years. The shareholders never received a penny in dividends, although the mine was of inestimable value in developing the district. The Tasmanian Government advanced the company &#163;5,000 after it had been operating for about thirty years. The war broke out when the company was in process of reconstructing for the sixth or seventh time, and in consequence of the war  it  had to default. The Tasmanian Government having lent &#163;5,000, became practically the owner of the mine, and for two or three years it was worked as a State mine. The other day the company, with all the plant, including the batteries, dressing machinery, water  races,  some of them 30 miles in length, and leases amounting in area to about 400 acres, was sold. The whole box of tricks brought &#163;2,000. Most of the shareholders were Englishmen, and showed the tenacity of their race by frequently reconstructing the company, but they got no return. It would have been nothing less than a crime to charge the company on the money which it put into new plant from time to time in the endeavour to cope with new mining problems as they arose. </para>

At times very considerable amounts gained by the operations were put into plant to deal with the problems that arose, principally from the fact that the company had to treat low-grade material. </para>

                    <para>. -  I trust the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> will reconsider the &#39; amendment. We depend to a great extent to-day on the opening up and development of our primary resources, and I hope the Commonwealth Government are going to do all they possibly can to assist and foster those industries, and more particularly to assist the men who are prepared to go into the back country and live on the smell of an oil-rag year after year, in developing what is, after all, one of the main industries of Australia. It is the industry on which Victoria was built up, and on which Western Australia is being built up to-day. On the Westonia field, one of the newest and most promising in our State, I know a number of prospectors who for many years have been making considerably less than a living wage. They have now reached the water-level, and must expend money on a winding engine and pumping plant. If the amendment is carried no allowance will be made to them for that expenditure, although it is necessary to open up and develop the mine. The amendment will be a big handicap to new mining fields, as it will not give a fair deal to the men who, after all, are responsible for. the building up of the chief cities of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>.- The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> would be well advised to let the clause stand as it is. Provision is made in the original Act for the whole cost of plant to be written off in the course of a number of years. I do not see that in the long run it makes any difference to the Government whether the whole of it is written off in one year or in a period of years, but it will make a material difference to a struggling mining company. In this matter my sympathies are with the struggling company. </para>

                    <para>. -  The Minister&#39;s proposal is almost unfair. I look on the clause as the poor man&#39;s clause in mining. The rich man&#39;s clause is in another part of the Bill. It allows the rich man to deduct from his income tax schedule all the calls he pays to mining companies or syndicates, but the prospecting party, or party of working miners, would be prevented by this amendment from making any deduction for new plant. </para>

                        <para>- I do not see how this clause will affect the other class of mining companies, in view of the other clauses of the Bill relating to companies. Very liberal provisions have been made throughout the Bill to stimulate the production of metal in Australia. Calls on mining companies, limited or unlimited, or syndicates, are deductible from individual income tax schedules. That practically will allow a company to start with any amount of capital thought to be desirable, and by virtue of this provision to be able to buy its plant and machinery free of income tax; but if the Minister insists upon the amendment he has submitted, I fear it will, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buzacott</inline> has pointed out, inflict great hardship upon the poorer men and prospectors, of whom there are so many, and of whom there will be so many in Australia after the war. I ask him to leave the matter where it is at present. It is not a now principle. </para>

                    <para>. -  I admit that the arguments presented create some little difficulty in my mind. First of all I should like to remind the Committee that the amendment I submitted cannot be regarded as doing an injustice to the mining industry, because, even if it is agreed to, concessions which are not extended to any other industry are granted to the mining industry,&#39; and, therefore, all that. can be said is that the concessions do not go quite so far as some honorable senators think they should. The amendment cannot be termed unfair. I realize that money expended in plant necessary for developmental purposes should be exempted for the same reason that wages paid for developmental purposes should be exempted; but there is another kind of plant which is used for the permanent working of the mine - so far as a mine can be worked permanently. I am afraid, however, it will not be possible to discriminate between the two. Some classes of plant, the winding and pumping machinery, for instance, used in the developmental stages, may be just as necessary when a mine has passed beyond that stage. Consideration of this aspect of the question has created some difficulty in my mind. I have been endeavouring to see if it were possible to differentiate between the two kinds of plant used; but I am afraid it will not be possible to draw the line of demarcation. There is another difficulty, and I want the Senate to appreciate it, or, at all events, to consider it. As the Bill stands at present, the owners of mining properties are enabled to deduct from their income tax schedules the amount of money spent on their plant. But they should not be able, under another portion of the Bill, to deduct the amount again, under the heading of depreciation. </para>

                    <para>. - I am rather surprised at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> providing in his amendment for the deductions of such a low sum as &#163;1 . On the broad principle it is quite right that if an exemption is made in favour of wealth, a similar exemption should also be made to include the gifts of persons of humbler mean&#39;s. But honorable senators should consider the amount of work which would be thrown upon the taxation officials if they were required to verify every contribution throughout Australia amounting to &#163;1 and over. And while the task would be tremendous the exemption to taxpayers would be insignificant. If the Committee is disposed to re-enact the principle, I appeal to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> to fix a more substantial sum. </para>

                            put the matter very properly in stating that if the principle is to be retained and an exemption is to be granted to a large contributor, the gifts of humbler people should also be proportionately exempted. Very often we know that it is those who make the relatively smaller gifts who make the greater sacrifice. As to the work thrown upon the Department, it would be for the taxpayer claiming the exemption to place verification before the officials.

The Act provided that only contributions over &#163;20 to patriotic funds should be exempted; but that provision has been deliberately struck out. If the principle is to be restored I cannot see why it should not refer to gifts for charitable institutions as well as to patriotic funds. </para>

Department, and that there is an immense staff in Victoria, in addition, to large staffs in all the other States, it is surely not too much to expect that one of these officers should be told off. to make the necessary calculation. Apparently the . Minister has not the information which I seek, and consequently I ask him to postpone the consideration of this clause until to-morrow. By that time the Commissioner of Taxes will perhaps be able to furnish us with the information for which I have asked. </para>

                    <para>.- I should like to have some further explanation of the clause under the references to bad debts. Under the existing Act, permission is given to deduct bad debts proved to be such to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, and to have been incurred in and actually written off by the taxpayer in the year in which the income was derived. It is in this Bill proposed that the Commissioner may allow a deduction for bad debts claimed in respect of any year if he is satisfied that the taxpayer has in that or any previous year included those debts as income in his return. There is a good deal of controversy in regard to the position  of  bad debts. It is claimed by the commercial community that what is really a bad debt should be written off, and if the taxpayer has the luck to have it paid in future years, it could be added to his profit, and accordingly to his taxable assessment. Perhaps the Minister can give the Committee some explanation of the amendment proposed by this clause in connexion with bad debts. </para>

                    <para>. - This is a concession to the taxpayer. The existing law provides that he shall be allowed a deduction in respect of bad debts actually written off in the year in which the income is derived, provided those debts have been incurred within a limited period before. Now, in a spirit of generosity it is proposed that if the amount of a bad debt is included by the taxpayer in his income for one year, he can in a subsequent year have the amount deducted if it can then be shown to have been a bad debt. That is distinctly in the interest of the taxpayer, and I therefore assume that the Committee will support the proposal. </para>

It is thought, in view of the higher prices now prevailing, that that is not an unfair thing to do.It is not possible to directly assess the profits made in these cases, but it is obvious to every one that they have increased very much of late years in consequence of the war. In the circumstances it is not unreasonable to charge 10 per cent. instead of 5 per cent. in the case of incomes that cannot otherwise be determined. </para>

                    <para>- He was prosecuted under the Unlawful Associations Act. I shall give the Minister the particulars of the case. Two or three weeks ago, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> brought under notice the case of a man named Wilson, who was convicted and sentenced under the Unlawful Associations Act. He made an appeal to the Leader of the Senate in that case. The matter was placed before the proper authority, I suppose the Attorney-General, and, as a result, the man Wilson was released. That was no doubt a very proper course to follow. But Moyle&#39;s case is deserving of even a greater measure of consideration at the hands of the Government than was the case of Wilson. I have the records of Moyle&#39;s trial before me. He was brought up on 20th November, 1917, at Adelaide, and the case was adjourned to 26th November. He was then charged that he was still a member of an unlawful association under the Unlawful Associations Act. Evidence was given that there were found in  hi3  possession certain documents. He had been secretary to the Industrial Workers of the World Association, but my colleagues from South Australia will bear me out when I say that that association never had any particular grip on the people of South Australia. Although some two or three years ago meetings were held under its auspices, it never had any particular influence in that State. In Moyle&#39;s possession there were found some balance-sheets and other documents pertaining to the association. He stated in his evidence that he was no longer connected with it. The Crown Prosecutor, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Powers,</inline> stated that since the police found these documents in his home, the accused had, in company with others, taken part in a meeting in the Botanic Park, where the Industrial Workers of the World songs were sung. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith,</inline> the Counsel for the accused, said he was entitled to go there and he could choose anyone&#39;s company.

If the Government are going to prosecute every one who advocates &#34; one big union,&#34; or the abolition of wage slavery as being connected with an unlawful association, they are taking on a very big contract. </para>

            <quote>
                <para>The accused in evidence denied that he was a member of the Industrial Workers of the World. For about two and a half years he had been secretary of the Adelaide section. Although he had accepted moneys from members passing through Adelaide, there was no sectional meeting place in this State. He had not spoken publicly in support of the Industrial Workers of the World, nor had he distributed any literature. </para>
            </quote>
            <para>The usual sentence in most cases of this kind is six months&#39; imprisonment. So lightly did the magistrate regard this case that he gave Moyle only four months&#39; imprisonment. After serving that four months in Adelaide, and before being removed to another State, Moyle was still detained in prison, and in prison garb. I have that from relatives and friends of his who visited him in prison. They found him detained as an actual prisoner, although the full term of his sentence had been served. I wrote to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Groom,</inline> the Acting Attorney-General, as follows: - ite Moyle&#39;s Case. - I have seen a letter sent to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Moyle,</inline> Parkside, South Australia his sister-in-law, in which it is stated that if he enters into a bond of &#163;200 himself, and obtains two securities of &#163;100 each, he will be released&#34;. </para>
            <para>Thishas not been asked in other cases where Industrial Workers of the World suspects have been released - Wilson, of Sydney, and. Riley, of Broken Hill, among others. From what I can learn, Moyle is a quiet, inoffensive type of man, and has not done anything of an inflammatory or criminal nature. Undue influence has, I think, been given to the finding of Industrial Worker&#39;s of the World papers, &#38;c., in his possession. There has not, to my knowledge, been any Industrial Workers&#39; of the World organization in Adelaide for some years. </para>
            <para> Under these circumstances, seeing that Moyle has served his sentence, and in view of the conciliatory policy emanating from the Governor-General&#39;s Conference, I would urge that Moyle , be released as most of the other Industrial Workers of the World detainees have been. The executive of the South Australian branch of the Australian Labour party strongly support this view. I trust that you will reconsider the matter. </para>
            <para class="block">I have since seen <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Groom,</inline> and also had a letter from him, in which he says that he regrets that he cannot release Moyle except on the conditions specified. </para>

                    <para>- But this man is still detained. Why is the difference made between his case and others? From inquiries I have made, Moyle is not a firebrand, or of the extreme criminal type, and he comes from Adelaide, where the Industrial Worker&#39;s of the World have had very little hold at any time. Yet he is detained, while men in Sydney and Broken Hill, where the Industrial Workers of the World influence is much stronger, and who were sentenced to longer terms, showing the estimate which the Court that tried them formed of their offence, have been released without being asked for sureties. </para>

                        <para>- That was not the full term of his sentence. The honorable senator knows that the punishment under the Unlawful Associations Act is not merely the term of- imprisonment to which the Court sentences the accused} but also carries- with it the. possibility- of deportation. It is not fair to assume ; that men are being held in. excess of the punishment allotted to them by the law of- the. country. I do not know that.the honorable senator is quite right in representing Moyle as -a . mere thoughtless inno cent in this, matter. He was, and con tinued, secretary of the Industrial Workers of the World as- long as it had. an existence in Adelaide. He was the general secretary there for the whole of Australia, as long as there was a- branch of that body, in Adelaide. It was only when, owing to the good- sense of the Adelaide people, not enough support was forthcoming for a branch there, that Moyle could, pretend that he had ceased to be the secretary. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator  knows  the reason why. When a number of men are found guilty  of  an offence of the kind, and the Administration review their cases, extenuating circumstances may be found in some instances which are not present in others. Moyle&#39;s case has been reviewed, as is shown by the correspondence read by the honorable senator, and the decision has been given. Instead  of  complaining that Moyle was asked to find sureties for his good behaviour, and that that was a hardship, I might as well ask why that option has been extended to him and not to others. </para>

                        <para>- There are other cases where the option has not been given. It cuts both ways. If the honorable senator says that because one man has been released without a bond all men ought to be, my answer is that some men are still there and have never been given the option of a bond, and  Borne  men have been deported. If the treatment meted out to one is to he the treatment meted out to all, I might contend that Moyle ought to be deported, and never given the chance of getting out of gaol. </para>
