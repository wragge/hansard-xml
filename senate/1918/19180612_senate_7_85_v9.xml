                    <para class="block">I wish to say not only that I did not alter that question, but I never do alter the report of questions or remarks of mine. I apprehended at the time the Minister gave his answer that he had misunderstood my question, but I did not wish to further interfere with the business, and did not proceed further with the matter. I desire now to remove from the Minister's mind any idea that my question was misreported. Had it been answered it would have enabled the Minister for Defence to have made a more complete statement of the intentions of the Government instead of leaving the matter, as his reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn's</inline> question left it, in such a way as possibly to convey to the minds of the public, as it did to my mind, a wrong impression. I wish to add that not only was my question properly reported and the report unaltered by me, but I believed at the time that the question was misunderstood, and turning to an honorable senator alongside of me, I remarked, " I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has made a mistake." </para>

                        <para>It is not the practice to ask men to produce their rejection badges before they can obtain employment. As casual work is offering on the Trans AustralianRail way, the practice is to give preference to returned soldiers and married men. Where insufficient returned soldiers or married men are offering, work is allotted to the single men: It there arc more single men offering than there are positions, them men who have offered, for enlistment and been! rejected would. Have preference over single men who. have not offered for active service. This is considered to be a. reasonable practice, and will be continued. Under this arrangement, George Davies would be given preference over William Davies. </para>

                        <para>- They have been distributed. No one knows more than myself how difficult it is to grasp the effect of an amendment, especially when it is an amendment upon an amendment. If at any stage the Committee desire a little further time to consider an amendment I shall willingly agree to a postponement, but most of the proposals of another place are so simple that that is hardly likely to become necessary. </para>

                        <para>- I am accepting some of them, but alterations have been inserted in another place, as in this case, for purposes which, I am sure, will appeal to the Senate. The clause, as passed by the Senate, widened the power of the Repatriation Department with regard to returning to Australia soldiers' wives who, for some reason, might be in the Old Country. It was found that the clause did not sufficiently include sailors, and the purpose of the amendment of another place is to make it clear that the sailor shall be entitled to those benefits which the Senate said should apply to the soldier. </para>

                        <para>- It is not covered by this amendment. The Senate will agree to include a woman who has a husband so incapacitated that he is not only no help, but, to some extent, a handicap to her in the battle of life. The amendment puts her in the same position as widowed mothers whose husbands are incapacitated. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap's</inline> suggestion is open to consideration, but it opens up the very wide question whether all the relatives of the soldier are entitled to be included in the scope of the scheme. I would ask the Committee to think very seriously before doing that. This is the very door through which crept all the abuses which have marked the American pension system. While individual cases appeal to our sympathies, I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> to let the measure remain with the present liberal amendments, until in the light of experience we see that further amendment is necessary. </para>

                    <para>. -  I recognise that in dealing with amendments between the Houses it is difficult to induce the Government or the Senate to accept alterations that mean an alteration of principle, but I appeal to the Minister to see if he cannot draft this clause so widely that every  5754 <inline font-style="italic">Australian Soldiers'</inline> [SENATE. ] <inline font-style="italic">Repatriation Bill(No.</inline> 2). case of real hardship to mother and father or dependant can be met. Take the case of two men doing their share in this war. One is a soldier who heard Che call to the colours, and immediately enlisted. Perhaps I can better explain what I mean by an illustration. I was in the town of Scone the other day, and a gentleman was pointed out to me who had put £100,000 in the war loan - quite a creditable thing to have done. I am making no complaint of that, but before I left that town I met two men driving out in a sulky to a shearing shed. The younger one opened his shirt, pulled down his collar, and showed me the marks of shrapnel wounds all round his neck. I could not help contrasting what Australia had done for those two different cases. The man who had. put £100,000 into the war loan would draw £4,500 a year in interest free from taxation for the whole currency of the loan in return for what he had done. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. I am not complaining of the man getting that return for his bit, but we ought to be very careful to see that those who have taken greater risks do not have cause to draw contrasts. The other man was so badly wounded' that though he was quite fit for work again and anxious to return to the Front, the doctors would not let him. He was going up to work as a shearer, to earn something. For every pair of boots he buys at £1 he pays 5s. duty, and for every suit of clothes he buys he pays25 per cent. duty, while when he wants a smoke he pays 4s. in the pound weight of tobacco, and that money will go to pay the interest to the man who put £100,000 into the loan to buy clothing food, and equipment for him while he was fighting. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. It is much easier to speak when one has something prepared, and it is much better reported here, and secures much wider publicity in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> because the newspapers do not report one fully. The point I want to mention is that no one raises a voice against the man who puts £100,000 into war loans and secures interest for it. If we deal so generously with wealth, we should be quite as generous towards men who have fought for us. I will give the Committee particulars of a case that is not provided for under this measure. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think the case I am about to mention is covered by the Bill. I refer to the father of two lads who went to the Front. One was killed, and the other, upon his return, got married. The father is now too old to work, and the young man who returned is not able to earn enough to meet all the needs of the family. Will the Bill meet a case like that ? If it does not, it should. I know that the Minister has as much sympathy with these matters as any other honorable senator, but I maintain that cases of real hardship like this are calculated to make men think there is something unfair in the measure. The Bill should be so drafted as to leave no case of real hardship in regard to dependants of our soldier unprovided for. It is the duty of the Ministry to see that this is done. It is not the duty of the Opposition to suggest, or oppose, or fight for any particular phase of the. Bill. In this matter I am following the excellent example set by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> himself in regard to war measures when he was in Opposition, and resting the responsibility upon the Government, criticising them, of course, when necessary, but not unduly interfering with them, or unduly taking up the time of the Senate.I therefore appeal to the Minister to see that the measure, when it finally leaves the Senate, provides for every legitimate case of hardship in regard to our soldiers' dependants, not classifying any particular section. I suggest that the Minister should, if necessary, adjourn the debate to allow of time to so frame a clause that it will represent perfectly the desires of the community toward our returned soldiers. </para>

                        <para>- There are other phases of the particular amendment now before the Committee to be considered, and I desire to give particulars  of  a case which I "have in mind, without mentioning names. The father of a soldier who went to the Front was really incapacitated before his son went. This young joan was the eldest in the family, which included several young children, and the mother was having a hard struggle, even with the assistance of the eldest son, to keep things together on a kind of bush farm. This young fellow, like a brave man, enlisted, went to the Front, and, unfortunately, lost his life in battle. I had considerable difficulty in connexion with some financial considerations which had to be shown to the mother after the soldier had embarked, and I point out that since the death of this soldier the mother has died, leaving the incapacitated father and several small children to struggle on as best they can on their bush holding. In a case like this, the incapacity of the father is the real reason for giving consideration to the mother while she is alive, and if she dies, the family is handicapped to a much greater extent; so there is additional reason for consideration being shown to the incapacitated father. I respectfully suggest, therefore that an amendment should be drafted to meet cases like this, and without opening the door too wide, to place an incapacitated father of a soldier in the same position as a mother with a«n incapacitated husband. </para>

                <para>The reason for my motion is that the clause will thus be brought into conformity with the terms of the original Act. The portion of the Bill in question deals only with the functions of the Local Committees; and while the Act makes some restrictions as to the classes of people entitled to the benefits conferred by Local Committees, it was deemed desirable that those Committees should be left free with respect to those to whom they might extend the benefits of their operations. The simple purpose of the amendment, as I have now moved to amend it, is to leave the Local Committee's untrammelled with respect to those whom they desire to assist out of their own funds. The insertion of the words, " Australian soldier " will cover both soldier and sailor, since the definition clause sets out that " soldier " includes " sailor." </para>

Is the amendment intended only to control those funds so that, under fair conditions, the patriotic people interested could always secure permission to carry on their activities as hitherto? My reason for putting the position in that way is that I have great fears that a specific organization, which has been doing good work, if it is not permitted to augment its funds in the manner  in  which it  has  been accustomed, may  have to  cease operations. I ask the Minister to give me an assurance that there is no intention to do anything of that character whatever. </para>

Authority rests with the State Boards, but it is not intended that there shall be any restriction upon legitimate effort. That which  I  assume was in the minds of members of Parliament when the original section' was passed was that it was necessary to have some authority which, for example, would prevent a clash of dates upon which various patriotic efforts might be undertaken. We all know of instances where it was clear that the exercise of some controlling authority was necessary, if only for the protection of the public, and to prevent that leakage which is almost bound to occur when efforts promoted for the best purposes are  not  properly organized. But the question of the continued operations of any. body rests with the State Boards, and  I  do not expect that those authorities would exercise their powers in an arbitrary manner. </para>

Until recently it was the practice to make a grant of £675 for the purchase of a home, but latterly the grant has been reduced by £75, and is now fixed at £600. The deduction of the £75 in many cases makes all the difference between procuring a home for the soldier and his relatives and not procuring one. We are all aware that at the present time nothing much in the way of a home can be procured for £600 in any part contiguous to the city where workmen have to live. I ask the Minister whether he will see that the allowance for those desiring to procure a home shall be restored to £675. </para>

I believe that the Minister for Repatriation is as anxious as any one can be that every facility shall be afforded to our soldiers to re-establish themselves on their return. These matters are of considerable importance to the returned soldiers. An allowance of £25 is a substantial allowance for commencing housekeeping in a small way. I hope that the deductions in allowances previously given, to which I have referred, will be restored. </para>
                <para>With regard to the amendment;, I am not aware whether in the case of a fund established under the authority of the Repatriation Department  it  is competent for the managers of the fund to raise money for the insurance of the lives of soldiers. I should like the Minister  to  look into the matter? </para>

I am not criticising the scheme, but asking the Minister for guidance, in order that those who have proposed it may know the position in which they will be placed. I might add, as one who has taken considerable interest in recruiting, that I am anxious to know whether, when I go upon a recruiting platform, I shall be justified in inducing recruits to join up by telling them that such a scheme as I have referred to is feasible, and has the approval of the Repatriation* authorities. I should like to have been in a position to put the matter privately to the Minister, because I could then say many things which the  Chairman  of Committees will not permit me to say here. </para>

                <para>With regard to some of the matters raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland,</inline> the honorable senator appeared himself to be conscious that they did not quite come within the scope of the amendment. I do not know anything of the constitution of the fund to which he referred, or the purposes for which it was raised, so I cannot express a definite opinion on that point, but I shall be glad to have a chat with the honorable senator on the .subject later on. He was not quite right in saying that the furniture grant has been abolished. It has not, but the conditions of the grant have been altered. Originally it was granted in such a way that every returned man seemed to think that he had a right to it, and' many to whom it was of no benefit as an aid to setting them up again in life, and some who did not want it, claimed it and got it. The principle governing its allotment now is that it shall be granted only in those cases where the purpose is to re-establish a man in civil life. I think that that is a principle which has much to commend it. </para>

Under the new principle, wherever a grant for furniture will help a returned man to establish a home, or, it may be, to accept a situation, it will be made, but it will not be granted merely because it i3 claimed. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. I hope before long to be able to put forward a complete scheme. When honorable senators realize that the majority of the returned men would possibly become applicants under any generous housing scheme, they will see at once the tremendous financial responsibility involved. I may feel justified in asking Parliament to make the necessary provision to meet a reasonable and sound scheme, and one that will be fairly generous to the returned soldiers. But it is not easy to link the two things together. </para>

His  application is treated as though it were 5760 <inline font-style="italic">Australian Soldiers'</inline> [SENATE.] <inline font-style="italic">Repatriation Bill (No.</inline> 2). matured before the new system was brought into vogue. The matter is one which interests us all, and perhaps on that account I have been tempted to speak longer than I intended. I assure honorable senators that I appreciate the various suggestions that have been made, but I will have the sympathy of the Committee when I say that unless we want the whole scheme to break down, we must avoid incurring expenditure that may do no real good to the returned soldier. </para>

I do not know how many persons are already employed on the staff of the Repatriation Department, nor do I know how many more it is contemplated employing. But evidently the Department is going to be a very big one. We already have a Minister whose attention is devoted almost exclusively to the Department, and as more of our soldiers return to Australia we may expect that the staff of the Department will increase very materially.

                        <para>- It is when an honorable senator is sitting on the other side of the chamber. But we have only to consider the experience of America in connexion with its pension bill to sec the evil that has to be guarded against. Today America has a bigger pension bill than she had when the Civil War terminated. My proposal represents a very fair effort to meet those cases which stand out as clearly entitled to consideration. I ask the Committee, therefore, to accept it. If, in the light of experience, it is 'found necessary to widen the Act, it will be easy to do so. It will be easier to widen it, as the result of experience, than it will be to close down upon applicants later on. </para>

                    <para>. -  The injustice which will be inflicted by the latter portion of the Minister's proposal is so obvious that I cannot understand his attitude. Take the case of a father who is in a really good position to-day, and whose son makes the supreme sacrifice. A few years hence that father may experience a reversal of fortune, as the result o'f which he may be left in his declining years without the son who would have been his support. Yet he will be prevented from getting any assistance under this Bill. Thus the door will be closed to perhaps the most deserving cases which could be dealt with. Such cases will not be few, but many. Take the case of a man who has made the education of his sons his chief object in life. He may have made no provision for himself.  His  sons may be killed on the battlefield, and, perhaps, ten years hence, when he is in declining health, he may be urgently in need of support, but will be unable to get it. </para>

                    <para>. -  The amendment is one which, in a general sense, will appeal to everybody's sympathies. But what does it amount to ? It seeks to throw on the Minister the responsibility of accepting or refusing every application made by anybody who can prove that he has suffered in the remotest degree, either now or twenty years hence.  If  Parliament wishes to do that, it ought not to throw the responsibility on the Minister. It ought to say, by means of a schedule, what it proposes to do. That would make the thing comparatively easy of  administration, but to throw ou the Minister or the Department the responsibility of determining the degree of* relationship, dependency, or hardship, and the <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> of the case, without some indication of what Parliament wants, is asking altogether too much. If the honorable senator represents any considerable body of opinion here, the way to give effect to it is, not by such a general, vague resolution as this, but by  specific  proposals in the direction of a new and wider Bill, which will set out with considerable particularity what is desired. I should shrink from administering a clause of that kind, and I ask the Committee to negative the proposition, not as an indication of want of sympathy with deserving cases, but because of its impracticability. </para>

                    <para>. -  I realize that it is difficult to devise a clause to meet all the conditions that may arise. I have been trusting to the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> and the Government to make ample provision for all the dependants of soldiers -who will be left in poverty because of the fact that men have died fighting for us. It reads very well for the Minister to tell me to introduce a new Bill, but honorable senators know that a private member has no hope of getting a Bill through, particularly when he is in a minority of two to one. In every Bill that has come before us we have provided for an ample return to the man who puts money into the war, but we shrink from the cost of making an adequate return to those who  have put their lives into the war. It is pleaded that we should not saddle the Minister with responsibility. If I were the Minister administering the Act ten years' hence, and a man who is now well off came to me in reduced circumstances, caused through losing his two sons at the war, I would not shrink from doing my best to help him. It is a big thing to repatriate our soldiers; but I have had experience of the hardships that occur under the Old-age Pensions Act. The most deserving cases are shut out from relief because of the wording of that Act. and are struggling along under conditions that are a disgrace to our civiliza- </para>

I should like to see something like it in all our pensions and charitable laws. An old boilermaker whom I served my time with came to see me the other day.  He had got the old-age pension, but it was not enough to keep him, so he went out rabbit-trapping and earned a few pounds. The result was that his pension was stopped, because he had earned more during the year than he was entitled to under the Act. The official administering the Act wants to help him, but cannot do so, because that is the law. The law has him tied down, and my contention is that the law should be open enough to avoid hardships of that kind. The man is now stranded in Sydney. These are the cases we have to look to, and, therefore, I shall support a wide proposal such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has put before us. </para>

                    <para>. - I am rather in favour of the amendment inserted by the House of Representatives, though I am sorry to see even £5 mentioned as the amount of exemption, because, so far as concerns donations to public charities or patriotic funds, I would prefer no exemption at all. People give to these funds from philanthropic or patriotic motives, and it seems strange that we should insert a provision granting exemption from income tax payments in respect of such donations. I think that when the Committee of the Senate fixed the amount at 21s. there was some slight misunderstanding as to the manner in which the amount should be calculated. </para>

I understand, now, that if a person gives £50 in gifts of £1 each to a charitable institution, he will be granted no exemption from income tax in respect of the total : whereas, if a person gives £5 in any single gift, he will be entitled to exemption. That is rather unfortunate, and I shall be glad to vote against the proposal. </para>

                    <para>. -  I think we should strike it out altogether. I realize, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> the difficulty of tracing gifts, and that the real benefit to the taxpayer by way of remission of taxation will not be very much. If the striking out of the provision results in a curtailment of donations to the institutions referred to, then we should still have power to make up any deficiency by way of direct taxation. The Minister will be well advised to strike out the provision altogether. I do not want to stress this question of unfairness in dealing with different classes of the community; but I point out that a gift of £11s. is a large amount for a man with a family to maintain on the wages of an ordinary tradesman, whereas a gift of £5 5s. would not be much to a man like, say- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten.</inline> I do not wish the honorable senator to think that I am making an unfair comparison. I am merely quoting his position as compared with mine. If we both were out of the Senate to-morrow, £5 would not be very much to him ;. whereas, £11s. might be a great deal to me. Income taxation is down amongst the poorer people in the community to-day; and if we are not going to grant exemption in respect of gifts of £11s., while we propose to grant exemption to a man who can afford to donate £5 to a charitable institution, that is a form of class distinction  which  I shall not support. </para>

                    <para>. -  In the original  Act there  was provision granting exemption  in  respect of gifts exceeding £20, and  when  that was struck out in another place, and the measure came before the Senate, it was thought that  it  would  tell  very hardly probably on some institutions,  if  some provision were not made in respect of gifts to those institutions. At times, large gifts come to our hospitals, and it was felt to be inequitable if a heavy amount of income taxation was also levied upon large donors. When this clause was under review, it was felt, too, I think, that if it was fair to make deductions in respect of contributions for repatriation and other similar patriotic purposes, it was also fair to make deductions in respect of contributions to hospitals and similar institutions. I think it would be distinctly unfair to these institutions to strike out the clause altogether ; because they are not included in the clause granting remission of income taxation in respect of donations to repatriation and other patriotic objects. While I appreciate the  Very  vivid illustration given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> I think it is hardly worth while, and, indeed it is almost ridiculous, to insert a clause exempting donations of one guinea because the taxation on those amounts would be only a few shillings. The real reason for the incorporation by the Senate of the provision in the Bill was to cover big donations to institutions that were not provided for in the other clause to which I have already referred. I think a reasonable compromise has been made in another place by inserting the words " Five pounds " instead of "twenty-one shillings " - a compromise as between £20, as originally provided, and one guinea, as passed  by  the Committee of the Senate. I hope my honorable friends opposite will consider carefully the effect of striking out this provision, because it will have a considerable influence on very large donations  to  deserving institutions throughout the Commonwealth. </para>

                <para>After the remarks made by the financial expert of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pratten),</inline> I feel more convinced than ever that I am right in asking the Committee to strike out the provision altogether. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> laid stress on the fact that, if exemption is not granted, donations to the institutions referred to may be affected, but I do not think this will trouble some of the wealthy people very much. A mistake seems to have been made with regard to this clause. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> first moved that the amount should be £20. Then he was induced to alter it to £1 ; and after that he wanted it back to £20 again. Then when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin</inline> moved that the sum should be 21s., that amendment was agreed to without any honorable senator really understanding the whole of the facts. I am pleased now that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has given reasons why I should move that the whole matter be struck out. The difficulty and trouble of having to supply proof to the Taxation Commissioner will be considerable, while the benefit to be gained by the individual will be relatively trifling. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope the Committee will not be led into a serious blunder. The near future will prove that very great efforts will be required on the part of the public to provide sufficient funds for dealing with repatriation. We should not place any possible obstacle in the way of donations. Take the case of a rich man who desires to leave a large share of his wealth to the Repatriation Fund,, and has provided to that effect in his will. After his death it would mean a very serious item to have to pay income tax out of the estate without any remission in respect of the generous donation. Does it strike honorable senators as quite fair that, while on the one hand the authorities may be accepting a very large gift for the repatriation scheme, the Commissioner of Taxation, on the other, may require a very heavy payment of income tax out of the estate, without any remission? Such a situation might well discourage the making of bequests of that nature. </para>

                    <para>. - The specific purpose of the Senate in its amendment under review was that contributions other than to the Repatriation Department or to various patriotic funds, should also be included in the exemptions- from payment of income tax. The Bill already provides for remission of income taxation in connexion with payments made during the continuance of the war to any patriotic fund for any purpose connected with the war, " if the payments are verified to the satisfaction of the Commissioner." It also provides for exemptions and remissions in the case of contributions to the Department of Repatriation, " provided that the value of the contribution shall be verified to the satisfaction of the Commissioner." The Committee is now dealing with an addition which, if incorporated in the Bill as proposed by the Minister, will permit of remission in connexion with contributions to hospitals and other benevolent institutions. </para>

I wish it to be clear, therefore, that in rejecting the subparagraph in question, we will not do away with remissions in connexion with contributions to the Repatriation Department and to patriotic funds. We shall only be cutting out exemptions upon contributions to philanthropic institutions. We shall be placing a handicap upon hospitals, and that will be an invidious distinction. </para>

The Senate inserted an amendment that exemptions should bc granted upon any gifts amounting to 21s. Another place has raised the amount to £5.

The money largely went to the purchase of material for making various things for the military hospitals. That good course was continued until the men went out on strike. Of course, the loyalists now will not do anything like that. "Week after week the old unionists paid their money in as regularly as though they were adding to their banking accounts. They got no remission upon their payments. If remission may be had upon gifts of 21s. that will affect a great number of people, while if the amount, is raised to £5 there will be comparatively few who will be able to take advantage of the exemption. Some honorable senators say that the withholding of any exemption will have its effect upon large contributions. There are many rich folk who, out of the goodness of their hearts, give large donations and do not consider whether they may receive remission of taxation. </para>

                        <para>- I do not want such a provision. I do not think it would be worth anything. I do not believe that there is any demand for exemption from income tax in respect of these donations. The man who gives £1,000 to any -of these funds does not care whether he will secure exemption from income tax because of it or not. He makes his donation because his heart is in the business, and the fact that he will be exempt from income tax in respect to the amount of his subscription is not an incentive to him to give it, and the abolition of such a provision would not prevent him from contributing to these funds. The provision exemplifies, in an objectionable manner, the difference between the way in which we treat the wealthy and the rest of the community. If we make an allowance by our legislation for the man who gives a large amount, we should make an equal allowance for the man who gives a small amount. One man may give a small amount frequently, while another, because it may be of some importance to him, may give a large sum very occasionally. This provision makes an invidious distinction between those who can afford to give largely, and those who cannot. </para>

I object to provisions in our legislation intended to appeal to certain persons, and to make it appear that we are specially considering them. Our legislation should do what it purports 'to do. Special provision to give relief to certain persons, and to meet special cases, will always fail. We can  only safely legislate in a general way, realizing that our legislation should apply equally to the whole of the people. </para>

                        <para>- Because we  have done one wrong, we should not therefore tlo another. As a matter of fact, two wrongs do sometiir.es make a right. If I gave the honorable senator a bad shilling, that would be a wrong, but if he gave it to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas,</inline> while it would" be a wrong, it would make him right. So that it may be argued that two wrongs sometimes make one right. The objectionable feature of this provision is that it marks in our legislation class distinctions. It holds out an exemption of income tax to those who can afford to give large sums, and honorable members in another place seem to have deliberately, by their proposal, shut out from the same consideration those who cannot afford to do so. Because of this distinction I shall vote against the motion. </para>

                    <para>. - In my view it is unfortunate that we should have proceeded so far as we have done with this invidious system of taxation. This is a part of the punishment which must be inflicted, not only upon the members of the Committee, but upon the public generally, because of the methods adopted for raising national revenue. We are now asked to exempt from income tax donations which goodhearted people are prepared to give to hospitals. I think it is a very good idea to exempt such donations, because I believe that from stem to stern the income tax law is upon a wrong basis, and should bo repealed as soon as possible. </para>

                        <para>- My remark was entirely due to the disorderly interjection of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, who seems to have forgotten the taxation principles which guided his early youth, and to have wandered away into this <inline font-style="italic">mil de sac</inline> for national taxation. The proposal made in another place did not, in my opinion, receive the attention there which it should have received. It has been proposed that gifts exceeding 21s. to public charities may be deducted from the amount upon which the taxpayer has to pay. It would have been better if it had been suggested that the deduction should apply to " gifts of or exceeding 21s." As the amendment; stands a person would require to give 21s. Id. to secure the proposed exemption. This illustrates the absurdity of the proposal. Merely on the ground that it will reduce the sources from which income taxation may be derived, I am prepared to support the proposal. </para>

                    <para>. - The arguments put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> are incontestable. There can be no doubt that if we accept the amendment of the House of Representatives we shall institute a class distinction under this Bill. It is well known that during the war the citizens of Australia have contributed generously in response to appeals for hospitals, Red Cross, and other patriotic and charitable purposes. I venture to say that many men in receipt of very small wages have contributed an average of between £10 and £12 a year to various charitable movements. They will continue to make further contributions in the future. Under this amendment a man who gives 2s. to a fund to-day and 3s. to-morrow, though his contributions in the course of a year may amount to £10 or £12, will receive no exemption from income tas </para>

                    5769 in respect of those payments, whilst the man who is in a position to give £5 in one sum is at once entitled to exemption. The Minister in charge of the Bill

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline>
                    to make the provision apply cumulatively to donations of 21s., so that if any person gave 21s. weekly to a public charitable institution, he might secure exemption in respect of the total amount he contributed during the year in that way. As to the position arising in connexion with a contribution of £5 as against a contribution of £11s.,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline>
                    Largie was apprehensive that the provision might interfere with contributions to the Repatriation Fund, but
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline>
                    has pointed out that that is provided for. If the Committee accepts the amendment moved by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall,</inline>
                    no charitable institution in Australia will suffer. No man in the habit of giving a donation to a hospital will cease to do so because the amount will not be deducted from the amount upon which he will have to pay income tax.

                        <para>- It is impossible to put a stigma on charity. The honorable senator, no doubt, unintentionally suggested that the Repatriation Department is a charitable institution, but it is the duty of the nation to look after repatriation. It should be provided for whether gifts are made to the Repatriation Fund or not. If any one desires to make a donation to the fund, it will naturally be accepted, but the work of repatriation should not depend on any donation, and the fund should be provided in the fulfilment of a national duty. The Committee will be acting wisely in agreeing to. the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall.</inline></para>

                    <para>. - This is one of a number of amendments in which, departing from the practice which has previously obtained in our legislative enactments, the other House has inserted a minimum as well as a maximum penalty. I am not at all certain that I was not one of those who suggested the advisableness of keeping this measure in conformity with all the other enactments of this Parliament. However, the Bill has come back from the House of Representatives with an amendment giving a reason why a minimum as well as a maximum penalty should be adhered to. That reason is that magistrates throughout Australia take such widely different views of the same offence. In some cases the magistrates inflict a fine of a few shillings for an offence for which other magistrates mulct an offender in a fine of some pounds. In these circumstances it has been thought better that Parliament should indicate for the guidance of magistrates the minimum penalty which should be inflicted for a given offence. I move - </para>

                    <para>. - This amendment seems to me to open up a very wide field because what will apply to this Bill will apply also to Acts which have been passed by this Parliament - Acts in which a maximum penalty has been prescribed. The reason advanced by the other branch of the Legislature for the proposed amendment is, to my mind, insufficient. It might just as well be argued that a magistrate should be compelled to inflict either the minimum or the maximum penalty. </para>

                        <para>- Hitherto in our legislation the maximum penalty, and not the minimum, has been inserted. To my mind, it is a wise plan to provide for a maximum penalty alone. But under this one man may be fined £2 and another man £10for the same offence. I do not think we are acting wisely in departing from the custom which has hitherto obtained. Hitherto our Federal Statutes have been remarkable for their clearness and uniformity. </para>

In the early days of the Federation this was especially the case. In the present instance we are asked to depart from a very wise precedent. This is scarcely the measure in which we should institute such a departure, even if it be necessary. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> appeals to me when he argues that this is exceptional legislation and that we are getting away from the fine old principle which has worked so well hitherto. We all know of cases where a person is technically guilty, and where the magistrate has expressed his sorrow that he has had to inflict a penalty, although there has been no real offence. Power should be left to a magistrate where only a technical breach of the taw has been committed to impose a nominal fine of, say,1s. We should refuse to break away from the old principle of fixing the maximum and allowing the magistrate to say what the minimum shall be. Many cases may arise in which a fine of <inline font-style="italic">£1</inline> is exorbitant. True justice demands that the penalty shall be commensurate with the offence, and if we insist upon a penalty that is out of proportion to the offence, people will become dissatisfied with our Courts of justice. I shall adhere to our previous decision to wipe out the minimum penalty. One pound is a considerable amount of money to a great many people, though it may seem nothing to those who are accustomed to handling thousands. To leave the minimum to the discretion of the magistrate is safe, satisfactory, and in accord with all our previous legislation. </para>

                <para>The Minister now assures us that under the Acts Interpretation Act £50 may mean only1s. To honorable senators who, on the advice of Ministers, are prepared to vote millions of pounds in a few hours, it may seem a very small matter whether the fine is£1 or £50, but, to the person who has to pay it, it may mean a great deal more than he can rake up. Surely we can rely on. the magistrates to exercise their judgment and impose a fine commensurate with the offence. </para>

                        <para>-Colonel O'LOGHLIN (South Australia) [5.41].  -  The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> has not made out a very good case for abolishing the minimum. He advanced the reason that there is a wide variation in the decisions of magistrates'. That is probably because there is a wide variation in the cases that come before them, but this proposal does not prevent that variation, because the fines may still vary from £1 up to <inline font-style="italic">£50.</inline> All it does is to prevent them going below £1. There may be many cases of nominal offences where no penalty is really deserved, and the magistrate should have power to inflict a nominal fine. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> has put forward the good old Conservative rule, which particularly appeals to us on this side that we should observe the wisdom- of our forefathers, who decided that there should be no minimum., but that vindictive penalties should be prevented by the inclusion of a maximum. </para>
