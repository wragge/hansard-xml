                    <para>The Government fully appreciates the pride of Australians of Scottish ancestry in the history and, traditions of the famous Highland regiments, and respects their desire for the perpetuation of those tradition's amongst their descendants in the Dominions. The proposal to, form a Scottish regiment in Australia to assist in reinforcing the Australian Imperial Force cannot, however, be given effect to. The five Australian divisions now in the field are organized in brigades and battalions which have won for themselves by their courage and dogged endurance traditions which it is desired to cherish and perpetuate in Australia. Owing to severe fighting many of these battalions are sorely depleted, in numbers, and the pressing need is for recruits to fill up the gaps in existing battalions. If new battalions were formed on the basis suggested they would have to take the place in the existing brigades and division's of the battalions referred to, and the Government feels that it cannot indorse such a proposal. </para>
                    <para>At the same time, appreciating the spirit of patriotism that has prompted the proposal, the Government will welcome the formation of units of reinforcements, and an assurance can be given to those of Scottish descent that if they enlist together, they will be trained together in Australia, sent oversea together, and, as far as military exigencies permit, will be kept together in the same unit. This course has already been followed with successful results in regard to the Riflemen's Thousand and the Sportsmen's Battalion. The Government is also prepared to extend this principle to other sections who are prepared to guarantee obtaining recruits on this basis, but it must be distinctly understood that the existing organization of the five Australian division's will be retained. </para>
                    <para>It is not proposed at this juncture to make any alteration in the service dress, which has been demonstrated as suitable for all requirements as a result of three years' experience in this war. </para>

                    <para>.- When this Bill was under consideration on Friday last, I expressed my regret that, owing to a misunderstanding, we had been denied the opportunity of a second-reading debate upon it. It was the intention of some honorable senators to make a few general observations on the measure, and as this clause covers practically the whole question of militarism, I propose to address myself to an amendment of which I have given notice, and also to the general principles underlying the Bill. Although the measure is apparently a very modest and unobtrusive one, it seeks to vest in the military authorities of Australia a power over our soldiers who will return after the war which I am not prepared to concede them. Under it, the permanent staff will be given control for an indefinite period over every officer and every man who returns to this country. Those officers who are now commanding here, and who know but little of the horrors of actual warfare, will thus be able by their advice to the Minister, and through his advice to the Governor-General, to keep these men mobilized regardless of their desire to get out of the Army,, and to return to their civilian occupations. In other words, the military organization here will be practically able to maintain a standing army. I quite recognise that grave weight must be attached to the reasons advanced by the </para>

I realize that owing to the exigencies of the war, and the developments of the past three years, it is impossible for us to keep to the . letter of the contract- which we made with our soldiers in the matter of allowing them, in all cases, to get out of the Military Forces within four months after the conclusion of the 'conflict. I think that on Friday last I described this measure as one to authorize the breaking of our contract with the soldiers. The contract, which was made during the early stages of the. war, was that any man who enlisted did so for the full period of the struggle and for four months afterwards. I quite recognise that owing to the shortage of shipping, and the fact that the troops of other Dominions have to be considered, the whole of our soldiers at present overseas cannot return to Australia within four months of the conclusion of the war. We all agree that it would be extremely undesirable to demobilize the men in England or outside of Australia, and that a Bill is necessary to prevent that. I am not complaining. </para>

                <para>Unless the Senate sees fit to reject the Bill altogether, with the view to making other provisions, amongst which is the suggestion made by my honorable friend, there is very little that we can do beyond establishing . the right of the soldier when he returns to Australia to be discharged if he so wishes. The pivot of the Bill is that on a proclamation being issued by the Governor-General on the advice of the Minister for Defence, who would presumably act on the advice . of his military advisers, no soldier shall be discharged in Australia while such proclamation is in existence unless by consent of the military. The contract we have made with the soldiers is being broken, in the spirit, because they ought to have the right once peace is declared, and they have returned to Australia, to go back to their farms or businesses or billets, and that right should not be taken from them by any Act that this Parliament passes. My amendment, if carried, will give, the soldier the right to be discharged, and will not give the military any right to keep him in khaki once the war is over and he has returned. </para>
                <para>It is most desirable, after the war, to take away from the Military Department any undue power. I, for one, will not stand one minute after the war is over for an extension of militarism in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I hope that is so. We are fighting to abolish militarism, and our hope is that militarism will be smashed for all time and put behind us as a result of this war. This Bill goes too far. It rightly provides to keep our soldiers intact and mobilized until they return to Australia, but the provision giving the military the right to keep them , in khaki once they have returned is quite wrong. I doubt whether, in certain circumstances, the soldiers  themselves would consider themselves bound by an Act of Parliament such as this, inasmuch as they contracted to serve their country for the period of the war and four months afterwards. I very much doubt whether men, who had been kept in England for six months, and took another two or three months to come to Australia, would be satisfied, in spite of any Governor-General's proclamation, to remain in khaki if they wanted to return to their business or avocations. The Bill takes us too far in that direction, and imposes a risk of militarism on a community which is not going to have any of it. It will be possible for a military clique or autocracy - and after all, militarism is much the same all the world over - it will be possible for a military organization remaining in Australia, controlling these men who have been abroad, to say they shall be kept in khaki, when it is clearly against the interests of the country to do so. </para>

                <para>The Minister, in explaining the Bill, said, in effect, that one of the reasons why the provision was required was that, on account of the present position of the world, and the danger of international complications, we may require what in effect would be a standing army. I think he added that it might be desirable to keep one division intact. That is not the way to provide for meeting the international position after the war is over. We already have power on the statute-book to conscript practically every fit eligible male in. Australia for the defence of Australia within Australia, and it is not right or proper or fair to suggest that a division of these men, who may have been fighting strenuously for four years shall, willy nilly, once they return to Australia, be kept in khaki because international relations may be dangerous. We can meet that sort of thing when it arises, and the nearest remedy to our hand is, as far as possible, to keep our contract with the soldiers in spirit and in letter. Our men are looking forward to coming home. We all know that, determined and willing as they may be to see the thing through, most of them, and most of us, and the whole world if it comes to that, are almost sick to death of war. If the Bill is passed, it will have a very bad effect on the men themselves. I want to make it clear that the military authorities should have no right whatever to keep men in the ranks, except by their own free will, after their return to Australia, and after peace is declared. If it is necessary that we keep a division intact, we should be able to get plenty of volunteers. I do <inline font-style="italic">not</inline> assume for <inline font-style="italic">one</inline> moment that all the men who return will be able to get back to their civilian occupations at once. I do not assume that all of them will be enthusiastic in their desire to get out of the Army; but I do say it should be laid down in an Act of Parliament that after a man has served his country, and after peace is declared, every man who wants to get out of the Army should have the right to do so. </para>

                <para>I am not assuming, in my argument, that there will not be a good many men requiring assistance from the Repatriation Department, but , on the broad principle of militarism <inline font-style="italic">versus</inline> Democracy, I say that after peace is declared, and when  our men tome back, if it is then considered necessary to have a standing Army, it should be composed of volunteers, and not the men who, after haying served their country, as our men are serving us, are practically conscripted by the authorities. I do not wish to burke the issue. I have always believed in universal military service, because I think that it is the only fair form of service. I am not speaking against militarism in Australia during the war. This is a necessity which we have to put up with; but I do declare that a Democracy such as we have in Australia will not stand, after the war, any form of military government, with its attendant repulsive features. I do not wish to pursue this topic very far, but the morning papers will give to those who are able, perhaps, to read between the lines, some idea of what is happening in England; In my opinion, many of the controversies that have been raised are practically the controversies of a military caste against democratic principles, and I hope, therefore, that the Minister will consider the advisability of giving returned soldiers, who want to get out of the Army, the right to do so. </para>

                <para>I do not wish to stress this matter too far, but personally I am not prepared to trust militarism when peace is declared, because we have had too many evidences of an indifference to popular feeling, and an indifference to the rights of representative government. Militarism all the world over is repugnant and nauseous to democratic Australians. It appears to me that the Bill has not been considered from every stand-point. The principle contained in clause 4 is dangerous and repugnant, because it takes away the right of the soldier to be discharged as soon as he returns to Australia. It practically enables the military authorities to keep a soldier in khaki; to conscript him for as long as they like. I am not going to say that the Minister for Defence for the time being may not be a reasonable and a strong man. I am not going to say that there will not be a pressure of public opinion with regard to this matter ; but I do say that if we allow this clause to go through as it stands, we shall be placed in a dangerous position. We may have a new Parliament, a new Minister, perhaps a more dominant military caste in Australia than we have at the present time, and Parliament may not be in session. I say, therefore, that we have no right to keep these men a week, or even a day, longer in khaki and under military discipline, provided there is reasonable excuse for their getting out. I have spoken to a good many, returned men on this subject. They are quite clear as to what their contract was with the Government and the people of Australia. They realize, too, that they cannot all get back to Australia within four months after the conclusion of the war, owing to the shortage of shipping, and that, therefore, their demobilisation in Australia will be delayed somewhat; but they are under no misapprehension as to the position, and they expect to bo demobilized as soon as they return to Australia and after peace is declared. There is another clause in the Bill which, while it does not bear directly upon this matter, will- probably be a subject for discussion at a later stage. My amendment will take away from the Minister the right by proclamation, issued by the Governor-General, to keep any man in the Army if he does not wish to remain there. </para>
                <para>The question has been raised as to what would happen should our soldiers be returned to Australia in numbers greater than can be handled by the Repatriation Department. I think that problem might be considered when it arises. At all events, I am not going to vote to keep in the Army against their will men who want no benefits from the Repatriation Department. Is it realized that probably one-half of our soldiers have been drawn from' the land, from small . businesses, and from various positions in the community at much sacrifice to older men, and that -as soon as peace is declared they will be welcomed back to their old positions with open arms! I do not think it is realized to the extent that it should be that repatriation will probably not affect one-half of the Australian Army, and that plenty of work will be available in various industries and primary production. </para>

                <para>If it were the desire of the Government, owing to the advice of certain military men, that there should be kept a standing army under this Bill, the Government would still have to face their responsibilities to the Parliament and the people. And it would be a standing army by compulsion, because we should be keeping these men against their will. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> says that we are living in a time of militarism in Australia. He has assumed that I am a sort of military monster. Let us consider what this- military monster is doing in this time of militarism. The Government are in power, and have in their hands the War Precautions Act, and are we doing those terrible things which the honorable senator prophesies that we should do after the war? To-day we want a Home Defence Force, and are inviting enlistment for the purpose. There are hundreds  of men coming back to Australia, many of whom axe no doubt invalids, but a great number of whom are quite as fit as are those whom we are inviting to join the Home Defence Force. We could keep these men for the Home Defence Force, but we do not do so. Fourteen days after their arrival they are discharged. That is what militarism is doing in Australia ' to-day. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, that is the complaint in many .instances'. We do this for the reason that any Government, controlled by a democratic Parliament, would do it after the war, and that is because it is advisable that as early as possible the men should return to their civil avocations. It is recognised that the men who have gone overseas to fight have done their duty, and it is not right that they should be called upon on their return to do a duty here which may very well be done by those who have not gone overseas to fight. We can fairly assume that after the war no Government in power would exercise this power in order to create and maintain a standing army in Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> said so many things of an extraordinary character that I hesitate to discuss them all, but there are some which I cannot allow to go without a reference. In one instance the honorable senator deliberately, misrepresented a statement of mine. He stated that I had said that it might be desirable, to have a standing army in Australia after the war. I never said anything of the kind. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> may think so, but I do not. We have the power under the Defence Act to provide for the efficient defence of the Commonwealth within Australia, and we should have that power after the war is brought to a close. What I did say was that it is impossible for US.,to say at what rate, or at what period, our men will return. It is quite feasible that a whole division of our troops might return to Australia within the same week. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> '« idea were given effect to, as soon as those men arrived they would have a right to their immediate discharge, and this would be after the war. </para>

                <para>Let honorable senators consider what the conditions in Australia are going to be after the war. At present somewhere about £70,000,000 per annum is being spent on defence in Australia. Thousands of people in this country are working on defence material of all kinds. As soon as the war ends a great part of that expenditure will come to a full stop. What is going to be the effect upon our economic conditions ? It is going to be disastrous to pur economic conditions, and will bring about such a state of affairs as Australia has never yet seen dr had to face. With such a 'condition of affairs confronting us <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> would immediately discharge the returning soldiers. I think that it was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> who asked what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> would do about it when we had to face such a condition of affairs, and the honorable senator replied that he would face that hurdle when he came to it. I say that when we are taking power to deal with this question we should take power to deal with that phase of it. </para>

                <para>There is no intention under this Bill to sneak in a proposal for a standing army, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> would have the Committee believe. I gave that assurance when moving the second reading of the Bill. To show that I am in earnest in the matter, I am quite willing to put into the Bill an undertaking that within a reasonable time these men shall have their discharge if they wish. When we come to think of the enormous debt we are piling up, and the increasing difficulty of finding the money necessary to finance the war, I ask honorable senators whether they believe that any Government would keep these men on the pay-roll if they could get rid of them with greater advantage to the men themselves and to the country? Of course, they would not. It is unthinkable. I did not dream that any one would suspect this or any subsequent Government of having any such intention. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> seems to suspect that this or some other Government might do what he has suggested, I am quite willing to put our intention into the Bill, but I cannot accept what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> proposes to include in it. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that it is very definitely expressed there. That sub-section provides that when a soldier becomes entitled to be discharged he shall be discharged with all convenient speed, but there is a proclamation to be issued, and during the period of that proclamation the Government would have the right to hold the soldier. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten's</inline> argument is that under that proclamation, notwithstanding that it might be possible to place the men in their former employment or on their farms, and that they desired to be so placed, the Government would be so imbued with militarism that they would retain the men for the purpose of maintaining a standing army. That is not the intention of this Government, and, to give effect to the intention I expressed on the second reading, I am prepared to move the insertion, after sub-section 2 of the proposed new sub-section 39, of the following proviso: - </para>

                        <para>- Certainly. Under the amendment I propose, if a man upon arrival makes application for his discharge, the longest period during which we could hold him would be two months ; but, obviously, no Government, the members of which possessed common sense, would hold for two months a man who had a farm waiting for him, and who sought his immediate discharge. What object would any Government have in saying to such a man, " You cannot be discharged now; you must wait for two months " ? No Government would be so stupid as to say any such thing. They could not stand up against the public clamour that would arise if they did. </para>

                        <para>- Unfortunately, he might, and that is why we require some time to deal with the matter. The defect is not confined to soldiers, but we know that there are numbers of men who do not look to the future. Some of the returned soldiers may have become tired of militarism ; they may want to get out of khaki ; they may have a few pounds in their pockets, and may say, "Let us get out straight away." Would it be in the best interests of the men that that should be allowed? I do not think that it would. The Government should have some little time within which they can make provision for the discharge of men. Two months <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> not too long a time, and is only half the time that it was intended to provide for in the attestation papers. There provision is made for engagement during the period of the war and for four months after. Though we did riot succeed in doing what we intended, honorable members must be aware that what was intended was that that period of four months should be after the men had returned to Australia. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> withdraws his amendment. I am prepared to move the amendment I have indicated. It will set out clearly the intention of the Government, and should remove any doubt or suspicion in the mind of any honorable senator that we propose under this Bill to sneak in a standing army. </para>

                <para class="block">It is necessary, in my opinion, to delete this sub-section, and I think that subsection 3 of the proposed new section 31 should also be omitted. Our men enlisted for the period of the war and for four months thereafter. It does not matter what promises are made. It is well to be on the safe side and give the soldier the security he is entitled to. Notwithstanding all that the Minister for Defence has said, it is quite clear to me that the Bill, as it stands, or amended as he has suggested, will alter , the conditions upon which the soldiers were enlisted, and if, on their return, the proclamation by the Governor-General be still in operation they may, against their will, be retained in the Forces. I have a strong objection to retrospective legislation of any kind, and unquestionably this Bill breaks faith with the soldiers who have gone abroad. It is . proposed under the proposed new subsection 3 of section 31 to give the Governor-General power by proclamation to retain the men in the Forces for an indefinite period after they return to Australia.

                        <para>- No. Some provision for them is made in the Repatriation Act. My contention is that under this Bill in its present form, the Governor-General may, by proclamation, retain returned soldiers in our military Forces for a longer period than that for which they enlisted. I admit that in ordinary circumstances the Government will be quite willing to discharge them  as&gt; soon as it is possible to do so. That being- the case, why should we incorporate in this measure a provision which will be strongly resented by the public, and which is calculated  to create the belief that Ministers are taking to themselves the power to retain men in the Army for a longer term than that for which they enlisted ? I strongly urge them to abandon paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of sub-section 2 of the proposed new section, and, if necessary, to recommit the Bill for the purpose of reconsidering proposed new sub-section 3 of section 31 of the principal Act. Of course, if the men are agreeable to remain in the Army for a longer period than that for which they enlisted, no serious objection will be raised to the adoption of that course. I am of opinion that, whilst many of our soldiers who return to Australia will be anxious to get back into civilian life as speedily as possible, probably a greater number than we anticipate will be only too eager to remain in the military service of the country. We cannot fail to recognise that, when once we set the military machine going, it is not the easiest thing in the world to restore the soldiers under* its control" to civilian life..

                    <para>.- The reason why this particular provision has been embodied in the Bill is that some of our Citizen Forces have been called up for home service . during the war. For instance, there is the Garrison Artillery. In that branch of the service there is a certain number who come under the compulsory provisions of our Defence Act. For example, there are the guards at various stations. It may be necessary to retain some of them for a short period after the war. At present we could not do that. But, even if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> were to confine his amendment to section 125 of the Defence Act, he would not bring in the t whole of the provisions of Part 12 of that Act. That section is one of the provisions of Part 12 of the Act; but the whole of that part deals with the liability of citizens to compulsory military training. The particular provision which we are now discussing is intended to deal only with those soldiers who have been called up for home service during the war. </para>

That is to say, that this clause practically applies Part 12 of the Defence Act to those soldiers who have been called up in Australia for home service during the war. </para>

                        <para>- il think that the Minister will recognise that we may" well hesitate to accept his assurance as to the meaning of this Bill, seeing that on a former occasion, when the War Precautions Act was under consideration, we were given to understand that it would be utilized only in extreme cases having relation to military matters, and that the censorship would be put into operation only in cases in which it was deemed that ' publication might prove detrimental to the Allied cause. I do not think any honorable senator will contend that that assurance was carried out. While the Minister may in good faith give us his assurance in regard to this amending Bill, it is pretty hard for us to accept the guarantee of any temporary Minister. I was not suspicious, but rather doubtful, when he gave us the repeated assurance that this Bill and this clause had reference only to the demobilization of the returned men, because if that be so, why should a subsequent clause bring under the proclamation the men in the Reserve Force? </para>

                        <para>- -Clause 6 does so. I was waiting for the Minister to give us some reason for undermining the whole fundamental principle of the Defence Act, because the power in proposed new sub-section 3 of section 31 as contained in clause 3 of the Bill has that effect. It is a most drastic change. I realize that to repatriate and place the returned men will be a big problem, and that in some instances it will take more than the four months stipulated in their contract, or even the two extra months offered by the Minister. We should be told in explicit language. what is behind  the proposal. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten's</inline> amendment hardly meets my view of the seriousness of the situation. The way things are going on in Australia, and the public expressions of responsible men, might lead one to the conclusion that these soldiers may be maintained, organized, and kept at the Commonwealth expense for a long time before they reach Australia. The Government or the Defence authorities, in their wisdom, may decide that it would be a very good thing to plant a division or two of the Australian Imperial Force in the Pacific Islands, and maintain them there indefinitely. That is not a long stretch of imagination when we remember that on the eve of his departure from Australia with the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Cook said he was going abroad with the firm conviction that Australia was determined to retain the Pacific Island to the last gasp. Under the provisions of this Bill it would be possible for the authorities in Australia to maintain a standing, army in the Pacific Islands, although I do i.ot think. that would meet the views of the majority of the people of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- No ; I would not force them. We no more want to conscript people into Australia than to conscript them out of it. My main objection to the Bill is that it will afford the Governor-General in Council another opportunity to do what is not in the best interests of Australia - that is, to mobilize men in our midst. All thinking persons, of whatever shade of politics, and whatever their views on conscription, admit that the calling-up on the one occasion when it was used in Australia had a very detrimental effect. Even ardent conscriptionists must admit that it most " adversely affected the cause it was supposed to help. </para>

But the critical times ahead of us' - and most people realize that critical times will be right on us with, the cessation of hostilities - will be <inline font-style="italic">tha</inline> occasion, not for withholding men from producing avenues, but for endeavouring to bring about increased production instead of depending on cheap coloured labour imports from other countries. A successful system of repatriation, launched on good lines, and with the whole-hearted sympathy of people of all shades of political thought, such as I believe the present endeavours command, should aim at putting men into producing or wealth creating avenues as quickly as possible. </para>

                <para>We have had too many experiences during the past three and three-quarter years of the danger of. giving too much power to any body of men, military or governmental. Our experiences under the War Precautions Act in that regard are ever recurring; so I think this is too much power to place in the hands of the Governor-General in Council. In discussing this important matter, we must leave the Governor-General out of it, realizing that, although he is mentioned, he is only a figurehead of the Government in power. I am constrained to confess, and regret, my belief that military dominance has had an effect on the Government in Australia since the outbreak of the war. Otherwise how is it that papers published in Great Britain, and sold in the streets of London six days a week, are prohibited from entering Australia? It is incidents of that sort that make me afraid to give unlimited power to the military authorities, or the Governor-General in Council. We have had far too many instances of men being put into gaol - men of enemy origin, or of enemy descent, and others- </para>

                <para>Military dominance in Australia has undergone a great slump since the defeat of the conscription campaign. If the military authorities had the power to maintain in Australia what would be, in effect, a standing army, that swagger of theirs would be buttressed up a bit, but it would not be a good thing for Australia. The powers proposed in the Bill are unlimited, and I would impress on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> and the Committee generally; that the dominance of the military authority over the civil is, to a great extent, unpopular arizing the existing Defence Act. A huge number of men in Australia, who have never had, and never will have, political leanings towards the Labour party, were absolutely disgusted on the one occasion that section 60 was put into operation. I refer to the time of the general call-up. It should be remembered, that the period of retention of the soldiers is unlimited under the Bill, except so far as the Minister's offer of two months is concerned, and the numbers to be retained are also unlimited. The men may not come back to Australia for some time after the cessation of hostilities. Are we to understand "that this Bill is preparatory to the cessation of hostilities ? Are we so near the long-hoped-for . time of peace that it is necessary now to prepare for such eventualities ? I cannot reconcile the Minister's attitude in making provisions of this nature for the sole purpose, as he assures us, of demobilizing the returned men of the Australian Imperial Force, with his assertion last week that any person who spoke of peace was either suffering from mid-summer madness or was a traitor of the deepest dye. If peace, in the Minister's opinion, is so far distant, why the necessity to lay down these precautions, . which he says are being taken in the interests only of the returned men who are coming back after peace has been proclaimed ? The Committee requires some enlightenment on that question. If. Ministers have that knowledge, we should be told whether . <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was drawing the long bow last week or not. When we realize all the evils that may occur through giving this Government this unlimited power to put into execution at its own sweet will, it is enough to make us hesitate, because we have had innumerable , experiences of the exercise of arbitrary power by them. As the Minister assures "us that the Bill is brought before us only for the purpose of making provision for the returned men of the Australian Imperial Force, I ask him again why clause 6 refers to men in the Reserve' Force ? </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> sees some connexion between paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> of sub-section 1 of proposed new, section 39, and clause 6. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> deals with those who have been called up for home defence and come under the operation of Part XII. of the Defence Act, dealing with the Reserve Forces. Every Australian Imperial Force officer who comes back, and who is not in the Commonwealth Military Forces, goes on what- is called the reserve of officers, and becomes part of the reserve. We call up some of those officers for various duties, such for instance, as the officering of guards at the concentration camps. It is obvious that these camps will have to be maintained until arrangements are made for the disposal of prisoners of war, and therefore we shall  have to retain the services of those officers. If -we do not make this provision every officer will be entitled, immediately peace is declared, to claim his discharge as a matter of right. The honorable senator will see, therefore, that there is no connexion between the amendment proposed in clause 6 and paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c.</inline> One deals entirely, with the Citizen Forces and the other is intended for the set of circumstances I have just referred to. </para>

                    <para>.- After the Minister's first explanation I realized there was no connexion between paragraph c and clause 6, but the provision with regard to the reserve officers looks as if the Ministry were taking a steam hammer to crack a nut, because it is obvious that all the returned men will not readily be- absorbed in wealth-producing operations, and therefore many will be available for guard duty at these concentration camps. Is it necessary to bring the whole of the Reserve Forces under this proclamation to be issued at the will of the Governor-General ? </para>

                        <para>- That may be so, but it is safe to assume there will be no lack of applicants for any officerships that may be vacant in Australia for home service duties. After our experience of what the military cult means we should be rather dubious about accepting the assurance of the Minister with regard to this matter. I remember a statement which appeared in that elaborate production, the <inline font-style="italic">Military Journal,</inline> issued some time ago from head-quarters in Melbourne, but which, the Minister for Defence tells us, has ceased publication on the ground of economy. It was stated in that journal that war time was the oasis in the desert of a soldier's life; that a soldier only had to look for his own welfare and advancement through the occurrence of war; that the soldier who went into the profession of arms - I think that is how it was put - had no chance of promotion during peace, and that therefore they must be reconciled to the thought that war was their only chance of advancement. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, unfortunately, it does. We have to fear, however, if military dominance is allowed to continue in Australia, as has been the case during the last three years, that .. sooner or later these gentry may be the means of embroiling Australia in a war of its own. And they would do it. I venture to assert that if a referendum of the Australian military officers were taken, 95 per cent, of them would say that Australia should go to war to fight for the retention of the Pacific Islands. </para>

                <para>SenatorFERRICKS. - I could never accept the Minister's assurance again in a matter like this, after what he said about the War Precautions Act, which, it was promised, would only be put into operation to meet the necessities arising out of the war situation.What would Parliament be doing in the event of any congestion arising as the result of the return to Australia of our soldiers in large numbers? Will Parliament be in perpetual recess, as has been the case practically since the outbreak of war? Will it continue its unenviable record of sitting for seven months, and being in recess for twenty-four months? Australia is pretty conveniently situated in regard to Inter-State communication, so that Parliament could be assembled within three days at the outside, now that Western Australia is connected with the eastern States by rail, and surely should any congestion be threatened it could be summoned to deal with the situation? </para>

I think, in the course of my argument, I said the Minister had stated in his second-reading speech that, in certain circumstances - if, for instance, the international atmosphere were hazy, complicated, or dangerous - it might be advisable to have a standing army in Australia. The Minister now has definitely repudiated having said anything about a standing army. </para>

                    O'LOGHLIN (South Australia) [4.49].- I think the explanation by the Minister of the. proposed amendments has cleared away any. difficulties.What

                    is anxious to do, and what we are all anxious to do, is to see that the contracts made with the soldiers who enlisted and went to the Front are respected) and that compulsory military service after the war is not imposed on them by any subterfuge. The impression has been created - and this feeling has been voiced by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline>
                    - that in this Bill the Ministry are seeking power to keep intact the Military Forces of Australia after the war is over ; that, in fact, they are going to apply post-war conscription on those who have already served their country while not applying conscription to new Forces. I now understand from the Minister - and I think he made it clear when moving the second reading of the Bill - that this power is only sought to enable the authorities to deal with the men while they are being absorbed into civil life.

                        <para>- That would be better, because I do not agree with the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> that it is necessary to protect the soldier against himself. No soldier would be likely to claim his discharge unless he 'had his old or some other occupation to return to. It is going to be the other way about, namely, that the troops will desire to retain their military status and pay for a longer period than the authorities may be prepared to keep them. Really, there should be no need to extend the period beyond one month. That should be ample for the Department to deal with the men upon theirreturn. </para>

                    <para>. - I have been chiefly concerned whether it was intended to keep the troops in camp against their will after their return. The amendment of the Minister meets my objection, but he would be well advised if he put it into the Bill, to the effect that any member of the Force may have his discharge on setting foot in Australia. We did not send our soldiers away with any impression that immediately on their return they would be in a position to re-occupy their former places. I voice no doubt or suspicion against the Minister. I was shocked, shamed, and surprised to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten's</inline> speech, wherein he spoke about the military in Australia. What absolute humbug it was to say that' we are suffering under the heel of a roughshod military power! </para>

                        <para>- For <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> to tell this Parliament and the people of Australia that we are under a military system which is objectionable to us - well, I venture to say that the military system of Australia has not interfered with the civil rights of the community. What did interfere with those rights was that the majority of the electors returned the Government to power when it appealed on the question of its administration. I complain, not of the military, hut of the civilians - the people - in giving a wrong decision. Of course, they gave it under a misapprehension. Will <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> tell us some of the occasions wherein the military have ridden roughshod over civil institutions? They are not interfering in any degree at all. </para>

                        <para>- Judging by his remarks, I should say, as a representative of New South Wales, that he is more likely to have been listening to the type of oratory along the Yarra-bank. In a world under arms, how can a Democracy live unless it be also under arms? I was reared a Christian and tried to live up to Christian doctrines. There was only one mistake, and that was that I was not brought up in such a manner that I could uphold those doctrines. I could not see myself turning the .other cheek. I am generally more ready with what is known as the " cross-counter." The doctrines of Christianity and of warfare cannot rank side by side A lot of people  seem to be able to amalgamate them, but I cannot. </para>

                <para>Where has the military rule of Australia ridden roughshod over us? If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> sends the censor along to cut out a portion of what a man says upon a civil matter, it is not a military officer who has done that, lt is the civil authority;  and yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> blames the military system for it. It is the civil system, constituted by the electors on the broadest based franchise the world has ever known. I am not going to complain of what that system is doing, nor will I saddle the military with the offences of civil government, and try to mislead the people into the belief that there is some monstrous military power among us. The power that is ruling this country, and which has made all the mistakes of the past twelve months or so, is the power acting under the authority of the people given at a general election. I, therefore, hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> will not try to make more difficult the task of organizing -our military departments by raising against them an outcry about mistakes for which they are not responsible. There may be serious ground for complaint in what is being done within the military organization itself. And, by the way, it has been my experience that after an investigation of these complaints - and I ha've" gone to the Minister with some of them myself - they are found in .nine cases out of ten to contain nothing whatever. There has been no need to go to the Minister at all. </para>

                    stated, " The whole world is tired of the war." ' That may be so, but I do not think that this is the place to voice sentiments of that kind. When a man's knees are knocking together and his nerves are all gone, that is not the time to let the other fellow know that he has merely to deliver a blow and his opponent will drop. I do not believe there is any war weakness in the world to-day.

If any one desires to draw satisfaction from the fact that the Americans are going into it as conscripts, I can only say that it would be well for those favouring conscription not to talk quite so glibly, in view of the comparison of the deeds of voluntary Australians with those of any conscript army. There is no getting away from the truth that conscripts cannot be made to fight like the Australian volunteers. </para>

                <para>When the honorable senator referred to our men coming back, he said they would return as did Cromwell's soldiers, better men and better citizens. I agree with him there. When I hear people talking about military autocracy, I can only say that I have great regard for that military autocracy of Cromwell, seeing that it gave to us the foundations of liberties which we still continue to enjoy. So far as British liberties are concerned, and we enjoy them here, the origin of many of them may be traced to the military power organized and controlled under Hampden, Pym, Cromwell, and other men to whom British liberty owes so much; </para>

                        <para>- Yes, to the military power. There are two sides to every question when changes are made. I say that so far as the military domination of this country is concerned, any force exercised here interfering with outside citizenship is the force of the civil power exercised by a civil Minister acquiring his authority from the whole of the people on a franchise broad-based on the people's will. We should remember that here we speak in a responsible place. On Sunday I spoke in a responsible place, the Sydney Domain, where one gets a much better hearing and less interruption. I am sorry to have spoken at such length upon this question, and I should riot have done so but for the seriousness of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten's</inline> utterances. The honorable senator was, perhaps, thoughtlessly voicing opinions that he had not seriously considered, and opinions which I think ought to be refuted in this Chamber. </para>

                <para>In the opinion of the Minister for Defence there may be something which makes the introduction of this Bill very necessary. I shall not propose any amendments upon it. It is not my place to' tell the Minister and the members of the Government who are responsible for the returned soldiers, what they ought to include in this measure; but I do say that what we should make perfectly clear in this Bill is that the moment a soldier sets foot in Australia after having been away to fight for us, it should rest with him how long he shall continue in the Military Forces. The Minister considers the Bill necessary in order to keep the returned men in the Forces until they are. employed. That is one of the reasons for the introduction of the measure. Our men have been sworn in for the duration of the war and four months thereafter, and we should require some legislation if they were still in the Forces five months after the close of the war. If the Bill has been introduced in order that the men may be kept going until they are replaced in civil life, I still think that honorable senators and the Minister would be well advised not to permit even a suspicion to get abroad that the. <inline font-style="italic">men,</inline> when they return here, may be retained in the Forces for even one day against their will. Take the case of a man who returns in April, which is the ploughing season on his farm, and may have been neglected in his absence. He wants to put a crop in, and if he is not able to do so until June, he will lose the year's crop. Take the case of a shearer landing here in August. If he were discharged at once he might be able to get a place in a shed which would secure to him the shearing of 3,000 or 4,000 sheep ; but if he is not discharged until September the board may be full, and he will have no chance of re-employment. I am not doubting that the Minister will give attention to cases of this kind, but what I want the Committee to do is to make it so clear that he who runs may read, that as soon as a returned soldier lands in Australia he may claim his freedom. </para>

                        <para>- I recognise that that has been the practice up to the present time, but honorable senators must realize that we are altering the conditions under which our men have enlisted. There is no question about that. I have read the Bill, and I want to say that I am in doubt now as to whether it is sufficiently clear upon the right of a returned soldier to claim demobilization as soon as he returns. I say that he should have that right. I believe that the Minister for Defence and every member of the Committee desire that that right should be conceded to our soldiers. If so, why should we not provide for it in this Bill ? </para>

                        <para>- I recognise that no living man could deal with 20,000 applications for discharge in a day if they were to be dealt, with on their merits. I recognise that the caution and safety for which the Minister for Defence is renowned make these difficulties appear perhaps bigger to him than they do to people who have not given the same attention to the business, and are not so well posted. Still, the fact remains that by this Bill we are actually altering the conditions under which our men have enlisted. It may be that the proposal is to alter them to the advantage of the men. I am prepared to take the Minister's word for that. At the same time, if it is possible under this measure for such a suspicion to arise as has been voiced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> that there is some desire to retain the men for some military purpose, it is wise to avoid that suspicion. </para>

He must realize that one of his own supporters has voiced a suspicion that the proposed alteration of the conditions under which our men have enlisted is a dangerous alteration. I do not intend to vote for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten's</inline> amendment. But if this Bill is so expressed that a highly intelligent member of the Minister's own party takes exception to it, and finds room for suspicion as to its intention, the Minister will be well' advised to make it so clear that none of ns can misread it or read a suspicion into it if we wished to do so. The Minister desires to extend the time in order that the men may be kept on the military paysheet until they can be absorbed in civil employment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator .</inline> Pratten thinks that there is danger in the proposed extension, and if the measure is doubtful, now is- the time for us to deal with it so that even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> will not be able to say that it will be possible, under this measure, for the iron heel of a military autocracy to be imposed upon us.

                        <para>-There is ali the more reason that we should take care that no soldier will say in England, and no soldier in France will have it whispered into his ear, that during his absence an alteration was made in the conditions under which he enlisted. That is very important. People whisper and create misgivings where there should be no misgivings, and they thus do a great deal of harm. I have heard people say, and I believe it is true, that our enemies keep a keen watch upon anything that might be calculated to create dissension in this country or a feeling against this country. If a supporter of the Government can read into this clause a suspicion that our soldiers may be kept in military employment against their will even a day after they land in- Australia, it is the duty of the Minister to alter the measure in such a way as to make it so clear that, even the most plausible whisperer, speaking to men thousands of miles away from here, will not be able to put a wrong construction upon the legislation we are passing. I hope the Minister will propose such an amendment as will make it sufficiently clear that each individual soldier returning to Australia may, when he sets foot on these shores, immediately demand his dismissal from the Forces. </para>

We may have as many as 20,000 men returning in one week, and we should have a period of at least two months within which to enable the Repatriation Department to make arrangements for the employment of men who have no farms or shearing employment awaiting them. </para>

                    <para>. - If this Bill constituted in a primary, or even secondary, sense an attempt on the part of the Administration to continue in Australia after the cessation of war a Military Force for military purposes by subterfuge, it would be indefensible. But, having received from the Minister an express undertaking that the measure is really a corollary of the repatriation scheme, and is intended to facilitate the absorption of our returned soldiers into the ranks of the civilian population, I do not think any great exception can be taken to it. One honorable senator appears to think that the Bill will afford an opportunity for the creation of a standing army. I have no hesitation in saying that I do not see anything criminal, from the standpoint of the interests of Australia, in the creation of a standing army. Indeed, I am prepared to argue that the welfare of the people of this continent will in future demand the creation of such an army, and I believe that the nucleus of that army can be constituted from the ranks of our returned warriors. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; and I believe that we can get a fair percentage of them to enlist. There is just one phase of this matter that has not yet been touched' upon. It does seem to me that, if satisfactory repatriation which will avoid the dislocation of the labour market is in view, it will be desirable to allow all returned soldiers who have homes here to at once return to them, with a view to reentering civilian life as soon as possible. No mention has been made of the fact that- 15 or 16 per cent, of the men comprising our Expeditionary .Forces are married, and it will be generally recognised that, after three or four years of war, it is desirable in the interests of the family life that these men shall be allowed to go to their homes as speedily as possible. </para>

                        <para>- It cannot .be too widely circulated that the intention of this measure is to repatriate returned soldiers in such a way that they will not suffer industrially, it is to be regretted that a measure of this description could not have been incorporated in the1 Repatriation Bill, but I suppose that certain legal formalities necessitated its being brought forward as an amendment to. our Defence Act. Despite what . <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> has said to the contrary, I  think that the Minister's assurance merits our trust. He has informed . us that under this Bill it is not intended after the war to maintain a Military Force for military purposes, and I think we might judiciously let it be known everywhere that the intention of the measure is to facilitate the repatriation of our soldiers, and to enable them to find a satisfactory means of livelihood before they are thrown into the hurly-burly of Australian industrial life. In view of the explanation of the Minister, and notwithstanding that the proposal in the Bill may be represented as a form of conscription, I desire to express my complete satisfaction with the amendment which he has outlined. I do not think we need to be hypersensitive in regard to this matter. The intention, of the Administration is not to constitute a permanent military force under this Bill, and as the whole measure is a corollary to the Repatriation Bill, let us accept it as such, and pass it without further delay. </para>

What I wished to secure was practically what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> crystallized in his concluding remarks, namely, the right of every man who has served his country abroad to get out of the Military Forces, if he so desires, immediately upon his return to Australia. It has been recognised by the Minister himself that in the provision embodied in this clause there is something suggestive of an injustice to our returned soldiers, inasmuch as he has outlined an amendment which fixes a maximum period within which the returned soldier shall receive his discharge. I would urge upon him the desirableness of shortening that period to one month. </para>

                        <para>- I quite realize that the difficulties attendant upon dumping thousands of men in Australia will be very acute, but I venture to say that there will be thousands amongst them who will desire to re-enter civilian life as soon as possible, and it would be very injudicious for the Government to keep them in khaki a moment longer than is necessary. We know that a soldier seeking his discharge has to apply to his , Commanding Officer, who, in turn, has to- send his application to somebody else, by whom it is probably forwarded to Melbourne, where it may lay on' the table of another official for a few days before' it receives consideration. I want to avoid that sort of thing. If a man desires to get to work immediately upon his return to Australia, he should have the right to do so. I have no apologies to make for anything I have said during the course of this debate, because I think we are all agreed that some limitation should be placed on the period during, which returned soldiers may be kept in khaki. That fact has been evidenced by the proposal of the Minister to limit that period to two months. I hope that he will consent to still further whittling it down to one month, I would remind him that there will probably be many men who, having cut adrift from all their previous environment, will elect to remain in the Army until something can be done for them. These men will not become the wards of the Minister for Repatriation until he is able to attend to them. But I do wish to appeal to the Government on behalf of those men who will be anxious to re-enter civilian life as soon as possible. If the period mentioned by the Minister be curtailed to one ' month it will probably constitute a fair compromise, and will represent the best that can be done both in. the interests of the soldier and of the country. </para>

                    <para>.- Let me give an instance of the unwisdom of still further limiting the period which I have indicated as that within which a returned soldier must be discharged to one month. I may say that my military advisers requested me to make that period four months. However, I have taken upon myself the responsibility of cutting it down to two months. There is one class of case in regard to which that period will be found to be extremely short. Unfortunately we. shall have returning to Australia, after the war, a large number of men who are afflicted with tubercular complaints. Now the peculiar feature about men afflicted with such complaints is that they always believe they are going to recover. We want to be able to keep them under our control until the Repatriation Department is able to provide proper establishments for their reception, and is ready to take them under its care. I need scarcely point out that it is quite possible they may return in such numbers that the Defence authorities will not be able to provide them with sufficient accommodation. Consequently, it is in the interests of the men themselves that we should have at least two months in which to make the requisite provision. In the case of the ordinary soldier, however, it will be to the interests of the Government to get rid of him at once. We shall naturally be anxious to get him off the pay-roll as early as possible. In all the circumstances, I think that the limitation which I have suggested is a very reasonable one. </para>

Now, if we increase the period for which a soldier enlisted, obviously we are breaking faith with him.

                        <para>- Instead of adopting that method, the Government have met the difficulty by creating a Repatriation Department. When a man is discharged, that Department will either give him a sustenance allowance or find him means to support himself. That brings about a radical difference in the situation. Before the new scheme came into operation, a man was under some inducement to delay applying for his discharge, because so long as he was an undischarged soldier he received military pay, and naturally was not as ready to apply for his discharge when he knew that to do so would leave him without payment, as he never will be when the repatriation scheme is in operation. He knows now that by getting his discharge from the military he can come on the repatriation pay-roll. This is an additional incentive to him to get his discharge at the earliest moment. </para>

                    <para>. - I cannot' see the necessity for retaining under the operation of the proclamation the members of the Reserve Forces. Irrespective of those that may be referred to in the proclamation, the following military branches are organized and maintained by the Department: - Administrative and Instructional Staffs, Aviation, Survey, Army Service, Medical, Veterinary, Ordnance, Artillery, Engineers, and Submarine Mining Engineers. All returned men who will not be absorbed by the repatriation scheme will be available, and presumably willing, to take up guard duty at the Concentration Camps. If there is nothing more behind this Bill, it seems strange that it should be deemed necessary to bring the Reserve Forces within the scope of the proclamation, so as to prevent them from obtaining their discharge until the Governor-General so orders. I do not see the necessity for clause 6 at all, and the Minister has not given us reasons for this provision. When the proposal to form the Reserve was first mentioned, I asked the Minister for Defence if members of the Reserve would be used in any industrial or domestic trouble, but up to the present he has not " furnished an answer to my query. . The question whether returned soldiers, who are included in the stand-by corps, would be called upon to take any part in an industrial dispute to the detriment of organized labour has never been cleared up. </para>

                <para>Quite recently, in Queensland, wo had an application of conscription through the instrumentality of the Military Forces. It appears that after the floods and cyclone in Mackay, men who were asked to do some clearing up and urgent removal of stores asked for what was considered an exorbitant rate of pay, and the two gentlemen who were sent up from Melbourne as Commissioners representing the Federal Government, in their report to the Prime Minister, boasted of the fact that they were able to get the work done by Cadets, who were undergoing military training, at the rate of 3s. per day. Thus, by means of compulsory military service, trainees were actually employed in an industrial trouble. I suppose that there is no more disagreeable work than the clearing up of <inline font-style="italic">debris</inline> after a flood, and if, in view of the nature of the work the men asked for a high rate of pay, that was their concern. If the work had "to be done for nothing, probably it would have been carried out by those very men. I do not think it was right to employ trainees at 3s. a day on that work. Without any explanatory statement from the Minister regarding the necessity for the all-embracing nature of the clause, I think there is some ground for our fears as to the manner in which this power may be employed in the future. The reasons given by the Minister for Defence were very brief. He said that officers would be required to control the guards at the Concentration Camps, and that they would be drawn from the Officers' Reserve, but I think we will find many men imbued with a desire to continue a military career for some time, and probably they would only be too willing to take up the duties referred to. I shall vote against the clause, because I can see no necessity for it. </para>

                    <para>. - This, the last clause of the Bill, brings under review the practice of appointing officers in the Australian Permanent Forces. In section 148 of the principal Act it is laid down that no person who is not a graduate of the Military College shall be appointed an officer of the Permanent Forces, and the clause now before the Committee states that in time of war this provision shall not apply to officers of any Expeditionary Force raised for service outside the Commonwealth, and that it shall be retrospective. I think the section of the Act making it incumbent on an officer to be a graduate of the Military College should be altered, because, in my judgment, the best officers for our Permanent Forces will be those who have had actual experience in warfare. </para>

                    <para>. - I point out that the permanent officers are really only the instructors of our Army. Ours is a Citizen Force, and it is commanded and led by citizen officers. The permanent officers are really the schoolmasters. They do not lead our Army. This scheme has been adopted as the result of careful investigation into our military system by Lord Kitchener, who advised that we should establish a Military College for the training of instructors. That College has been established, and each year it turns out a certain number of trained  officers who are appointed to the. Instructional Staff and distributed throughout the country as instructors for our Citizen Force officers. These Citizen Force officers are the men who command  our  battalions and lead our armies in war. This question was debated when we were considering the last amending Defence Bill, because then it was proposed that officers who had served in this war should be eligible for appointment to our Permanent Forces, but I pointed out then that if this course were followed, we might as well wipe out the Military College for the time being, because if appointments were made from the Australian Imperial Force it would be impossible to know each year how many graduates would be required from the Military College. One Government might appoint Australian Imperial Force officers to every vacancy, and so the need for graduates would disappear, and as there would be no vacancies, we would virtually be breaking a contract entered into with the parents of students, that graduates would be appointed to' the Instructional Staff. This special instruction in military science has been found to be necessary in all the armies of the world, and it was adopted in Australia on the advice of Lord Kitchener, our greatest soldier. The system is now in full working order, and it is quite satisfactory in its operation. I am glad to know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> does not intend to submit an amendment. As regards our citizen officers, who in this war have proved themselves to be leaders of men, they will be retained in the Reserves, and will continue to train and lead our battalions, so that if another war takes place- in five or ten years their services will be readily available. </para>

                    <para>.- With respect to the motion in the name of <inline font-weight="bold">'Senator Thomas,</inline> dealing with the investigations of the Senate Committee on Intoxicants, I do not desire to anticipate the report, but when the Committee was appointed I drew attention to the waste of money likely to be incurred, in that the investigations were to be prosecuted in Hobart during the hot weather, and at Cairns in the cold season. I find now, however, that the Committee has not yet visited the chief city of Australia. Parties on both sides of the liquor question in Sydney have been led to believe that the Committee would make a visit, and they have put themselves to trouble and expense in  preparing evidence. Now, it seems, they are not to have an opportunity on either side of stating their case. </para>

The temperance people will not support me because I am a representative of Labour, and the followers of the licensed victuallers will not support me because I am against drink. At any rate, I am in an independent position. ' I am able to put the case impartially, and it seems wrong that when parties are prepared to represent their case in the chief centre of the Commonwealth the Committee should fail to secure such valuable information. I hope that before the report is finalized honorable senators upon the Committee will visit Sydney. </para>

                    <para>.- I should like the Vice President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> to evince a little more notice of certain questions put to him last week and this. I ask him to look carefully into the matter of the jute contract and the supply  of cornsacks for Australian requirements. It is a vitally important question, upon which the Minister should place himself in the position of being able to make a statement when the Senate meets next week. There have been grave inaccuracies placed before the public in a portion of the press during the past week, which should be corrected at the earliest possible moment. I can only add that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> cannot place the facts before the people I shall deem it my duty to bring them forward in some other form. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable senator seems to think that I am trying to suppress something. The fullest information has been given to the people through both Houses of the Federal Legislature, as far as I have been able to do so. A cablegram was sent to the Indian Government five days ago, asking for the final conclusion in connexion with the jute contract. The moment the reply is received I shall be able to tell what is the position in regard to jute for the whole of the season throughout Australia. Until then, I cannot say more than what I have done already. The moment that cablegram arrives, which will finalize the matter, Australia shall know the whole position within twenty-four hours. In regard to the criticism in the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> I may say that after having carefully looked through the report this morning, <inline font-weight="bold">Major Purcell's</inline> complaint is that we did not get into direct contact with the millers of India. </para>

The man who is the controller of jute in , India, who purchases all the sand-bags for the Allies in connexion with the war, and all the requirements for the Indian Government, is the identical person who is purchasing the cornsacks for Australia this year. </para>

I am not able, however, to control the jute dealers in Calcutta. A year ago the Government of India declined to interfere with the normal conditions of trade. To-day they have agreed, because of the development of war necessities, but the agreement is limited to war conditions. </para>

We might carry 10,000 Bills here, but it would not enable us to purchase a sack in Calcutta without the consent of the Calcutta merchants. The Indian Government have made it clear to us that such items as cement bags, for example, are not necessities of war; neither are bran bags. The Allies do not purchase them. </para>
