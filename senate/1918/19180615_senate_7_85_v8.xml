                            <para>- It has been laid down by the first <inline font-weight="bold">President, Senator Sir Richard</inline> Chaffey Baker, that the  President  of the Senate should not be called upon to decide constitutional questions. With that ruling I entirely agree. The Senate and I, as presiding officer, can take no cognizance of whether a matter is in accordance with the Constitution except in so far as the Constitution is a guide to procedure and action in the Senate. The question whether measures brought forward, or proposals made are constitutional or otherwise, is a matter that comes within the jurisdiction of the High Court, which is the proper interpreter and guardian of the Constitution. </para>

It has frequently been laid down that honorable senators in asking questions may not offer any arguments, or make statements, or do any more than ask for information. It is obvious that if an honorable senator is not allowed to make a statement or offer an argument, a newspaper or magazine writer should not have ' that privilege extended to him. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> will be in order in directing attention to the nature of the paragraph to which he refers, but he will not be in order in quoting any statements from it. </para>

                        <para>Since September, 1917, the Government has been in constant communication with the High Commissioner regarding the securing of an allocation of woollen, worsted, and cashmere yarns for Australia. An estimate of the yarn required to fill Australia's requirements for twelve months was made, and forwarded to the Minister of Munitions, through the High Commissioner, with a request that permission be given to British spinners with established Australian connexions to export <inline font-style="italic">pro rati</inline> to any allocation made by the Minister of Munitions. In April last a cablegram was received from the High Commissioner stating that he had arranged for an interview with the Wool Production Department of the War Office, with a view to safeguarding Australian supplies, and asking whether the Commonwealth Government had any further facts to place before the British authorities. A cablegram was forwarded, stating that the shortage of woollen and worsted yarns in Australia was very serious, and that it would be appreciated if, in addition to any yarn which might be allocated for ordinary commercial use, a certain quantity could be made available for distribution to Bed Cross Societies and Comfort Funds. If this was arranged, the Commonwealth was prepared to undertake an equitable distribution at a fixed price. The only other solution- of the difficulty would be to allow the manufacture and exportation of two yarn spinning units for erection in Melbourne and Sydney respectively. If this could be done, the yarn could be spun in Australia, and shipping space saved on the wool to England and on the yarn back to Australia. </para>
                        <para>On the 20th April, the High Commissioner cabled that the War Office had made a special ration, renewable every two. months, to cover self-governing Dominions. He stated that the quantity allocated was said to be in excess of orders then on the books of spinning firms, and that Bed Cross requirements had also been met. This allocation was for the period from the 1st April to 31st July, and the War Office stated that in all probability similar allocation would be made during the period 1st August to 30th November. A later cablegram stated that the War Office has arranged to increase the quantity of yarn to be delivered during present rationing period by firms now holding Australian orders to ' 550,000 lbs. A cablegram has been despatched to the High Commissioner, asking how far this amount covers orders in hand, exclusive  of  Bed Cross and Patriotic League requisitions, and what the position is regarding the supply of worsted and cashmere yarn for hosiery factories. It was pointed out that the situation here was very serious, and that many small factories might have to close from lack of yarn if supplies were not forthcoming at an early date. A reply to this cablegram is now awaited. </para>

The House of Representatives has accepted the amendment which we inserted in this clause with an amendment omitting the word " incapacitated." Its effect will be to give to the local authorities power to render assistance, not only to soldiers who are incapacitated, but to all discharged soldiers.

                        <para>- Yes ; the growers of Australia, and not of only one State. Prior to the war, and during the early days of the war, from 1,000,000 to 1,250,000 cases of apples were exported from Australia yearly,, but owing to the shortage of freight in later years it has not been possible to keep up this rate of export, our own markets have been overstocked, and prices have dropped to such an extent as to make the industry quite unprofitable unless it was helped. As it had been the policy of the Government to endeavour to keep things normal during the war, we decided that it would be to the advantage of Australia to give the apple growers a helping hand. </para>

                            <para>- I have given the information at my disposal. Of course I do not pretend that it is more than a rough average. It is not as payable to evaporate apples as to place the fresh fruit on the market, but the process enables us, if not to get a payable price, at all events to reduce the loss which otherwise the growers would suffer, owing to the lack of freight. They are being paid by agreement1s. 6d. per case, which can hardly be termed a luxurious price, and the Government have decided to give a bounty for one year of 10 per cent. The Government are attempting also to help the apple-growers of Western Australia to overcome the difficulty of their isolation owing to the want of freight. In regard to labour conditions, the Bill provides that, on application by the Minister, the Federal Arbitration Court, or a State industrial authority, may declare what wages and conditions of employment are fair and reasonable. I have been asked if the Bill is for the benefit of Australia" generally, or of one State? There are many evaporating plants in Tasmania, and there are four at least, in Victoria. I have inspected some here, and find that they are quite up to date. There is every promise of a good industry being established. </para>

                            <para>- The Imperial order is through the Commonwealth Government, and will be equally distributed among the States in proportion to their production of apples. The order is for 300 tons per month for six months, or 1,800 tons in all, at 7d. per lb. The total amount of the bounty to be paid under the Bill is limited to £12,000. This is not much, but, if it succeeds in preventing the deterioration of the industry, or in preventing loss to the apple-growers of Australia, our object will be achieved. Whatever may happen during the dearth of shipping in Australia, we all want to preserve this industry and see it grow, develop, and prosper after the war is over. </para>

                            <para>- That is a subject that interests us much more than apples just now. The Minister said that an agreement had been entered into for the export of evaporated apples, and I understand that we have to enable that agreement to be carried out by paying this small sum of £12,000 in the shape of a bounty. I shall not object to that, but I want to know who is going to get the money? Clause 3 says the bounty shall be payable to the grower of the apples only, but clause 5 provides that the owner,' occupier, or lessee of any land in which the apples were grown, or factory in which they were "evaporated, or in which they have undergone any process, shall, unless the Minister in writing otherwise directs, be deemed to be employed in the growing or  evaporation of the apples. That is a contradiction of clause 3. </para>

                            <para>- To me, it means that other than apple-growers will be able to receive a share. I do not think any one but the grower ought to be paid the bounty. If we are to assist the apple industry, it is the growers that have to be tided over the difficulty, and not those who do the evaporating, or pack the apples, or carry out any other process in connexion with evaporation or exportation. It ought to be definitely laid down that the bounty shall be paid to the grower only. He is the only man who suffers because of the .slump in the price. It may be a good thing for the people of this country if they have to find other markets for their apples. I was surprised when in London to see the miserable quality of apples sent there from Australia. Personally, I would not look at them, and I could not understand it. The apples I saw there from Tasmania were of very poor class. Those who know more about it than I do, and whom I have consulted since I returned, cannot understand it either. They say that other apples are displayed as Tasmanian apples. </para>

                        <para>.- I support the Bill on general principles. I think it is specially designed to relieve the Tasmanian fruit-growers of disabilities that have arisen on account of shortage of freight owing to the war. I point out, however, that New South Wales will pay about £5,000 out of the £12,000, which will be appropriated under this measure, and also that the people of that State will have to pay a higher price for Hobart apples, as under this measure a large quantity of the fruit will be available for export, and naturally the Tasmanian growers will hope to get a better price for the remainder of the crop. I am glad the Bill applies to the whole of Australia, that the Imperial authorities have agreed to take 300 tons per month, and that the orders will be apportioned according to the capacity of the various evaporators throughout the Commonwealth. There can be no objection to the Bill, and I hope it will help to establish the industry on a firm and permanent basis. </para>

                        <para>.- The State I come from produces a large quantity of apples, and I notice there has been a considerable increase in fruit-growing right throughout Australia, especially in Victoria. Western Australia also  produces a fine sample of apple. As the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> has pointed out, the* Bill is designed to tide growers over a very bad time. I would like, if time were available, to speak at some length on the measure, in order to demonstrate the advantage of still further encouraging this industry, I know of no other occupation which provides more employment than that of producing fruit, but, unfortunately at present, orchard property is almost unsaleable in Tasmania, owing to the unfavorable outlook. I know that many persons engaged in the industry are losing money, and they will continue to do so unless some assistance is forthcoming, as proposed in this Bill. It will not, however, give very much assistance, as the price fixed will be only ls. 6d. per bushel, which will not nearly cover the cost of production. I support the measure, and regret that more time is not available in which to discuss it more fully. </para>

I object to government in that way, and I hope that the objectionable practice of submitting provisions of this kind will in future be discontinued.

I learn from the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">( Mr. Watt)</inline> that the preparation of that reply would involve a very long investigation, and the Acting Prime Minister would, therefore, be glad if the honorable senator would let him know the object of his question, as possibly the desired information might be obtained without so seriously trespassing upon the time of the staff attached to the Prime Minister's office. Should circumstances so shape themselves that honorable senators have an opportunity of taking a holiday, which I trust they will both enjoy and benefit by, I desire to express the earnest hope, which I am sure is shared by everybody present, that when we reassemble the tide of victory will be flowing strongly in the Allies' favour, and that peace will have been brought distinctly nearer. </para>

                    <para>.- In speaking upon the Supply Bill yesterday I stated that twelve months ago certain firms in Tasmania had offered to build wooden ships for the Government, but that their offer had been turned down. The Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> affirmed that my statement was not correct. I have since been informed by the Minister controlling shipbuilding that he can only find an offer to build vessels of 900 tons. I learn from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mcwilliams,</inline> however, that though there may not be any official documents relating to this matter, shipbuilders from Tasmania waited upon the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> and offered to build wooden vessels of 3,000 tons, and possessing certain accommodation, upon the Government undertaking to pay half their cost as the work progressed up to the time of completion. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mcwilliams</inline> assures me that that information is correct, and that is the reason why I made the statement which I did yesterday. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Another matter which I desire to have cleared up relates to an ' offer by somebody more than twelve months ago to build concrete ships. The statement that such an offer was ever made has also been denied. But I am informed that more than a year- ago the firm of Stone offered to build these vessels, and that their offer was declined. Now the Prime Minister has gone to America, and proposes to pay a bounty to the patentees' of this class of vessel, although similar ships can be constructed here equally as well. I object to bounties being paid to people outside of the Commonwealth when our own people are qualified to carry out this class of work just as efficiently. I learn from the newspapers that a staff of workmen is to be sent from America to undertake the construction of these vessels. That is another experiment which should' not be undertaken by the Government at this time. </para>
                <para>The Japanese are about to build thirty steel vessels of 10,000 tons each, and I suppose of 3,000 horse-power or more. They do not adopt the principle of paying bounties to the people of other countries to do work for them. But directly we wish to get anything done the practice is to rush away to some other country to secure men to do it. Whether we want to print a stamp or a £1 note, or to make a wooden leg we send to some other country to get men to do the work. I protest against the payment of bounties to people in other parts of the world when we have equally skilled workmen in Australia. When I visited the shipbuilding yards in the Old Country I saw men doing things there for which a man employed in the Commonwealth shipyards would have been dismissed. I have seen a better process of steel moulding carried out at Eveleigh workshops and at Cockatoo than I. saw there. When I can go from Australia and witness that sort of thing, I feel bound to enter my protest against sending to other parts of the world for men to perform work which can be better performed by our own Australian workmen. </para>

                    <para>. - As one of the representatives of New South Wales, I avail myself of this opportunity to enter my most emphatic protest against the proposal of the Government to subsidize Western Australian fruit-growers in the matter of shipping fresh apples to Sydney. The Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> has said that it is proposed to pay this subsidy under the authority conferred by regulations. But I would point out. that any differentiation as between State and State is a violation both of the spirit and the letter of our Constitution. There is a proposal to give Western Australian fruit-growers a bounty of 9d. a case on all fresh apples sold in the Sydney markets at less than 7s. 6d. per case. There is no proposal to give a bounty to Western Australian growers for shipping apples to Brisbane, Melbourne, Adelaide, or Hobart. It is, therefore, practically a differentiation in favour of the Western Australian apple-growers against the apple-growers of New South Wales. We have just passed a Bill in, I think, record time, the second reading of which I supported, because it applied to the whole of the fruit-growers of Australia. But this proposal for domestic legislation is causing much concern amongst the fruit-growers of New South </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Wales. There are just as good apple-growing areas, and as good apples grown, in New South Wales as anywhere else on the continent of Australia. If New South Wales members do not come here and ask for differentiation for their State it is not because- they do not want assistance for their industries, but because they are big Australians, and would be ashamed to ask for differential treatment. I say deliberately that if this proposal is carried out by the Government it will be contrary to section  51  of the Constitution, of which paragraph iii provides that the Commonwealth Parliament shall have power to grant - </para>

                <para>The bounty proposed to be given by the Government to the Western Australian apple-growers is not uniform. It is given only to growers in Western Australia, and only for the purpose of further dumping on the Sydney market.

                    <para class="block">Ave  also are labouring under disabilities from the same cause, in common with all the States. For instance, Tasmania and Victoria export heavily under normal conditions, but on account of war conditions are compelled to dump on our market the bulk of their fruit, which would otherwise have been exported. With the addition of 100,000 cases coming also from Western Australia, the supply will so far exceed the demand that very low prices will rule, thus preventing the local grower from obtaining even a reasonable price for his product. We consider that, in fairness to the local grower, who will have to contribute his portion of the subsidy in addition to meeting the increased competition, he also should receive a bonus. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">I am not here to advocate a bounty for the apple-growers of New South Wales, but I am here to protest most emphatically against this differentiation being made between the States, and against the insertion of the thin end of the wedge of what, I fear, will possibly be political patronage and political pull. I hope the Government will carefully reconsider their . decision before anything of this nature is done. As I view the matter, the New South Wales fruit-growers have only to go to the High Court to have this proposed action of the Government declared <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> I ask the Government, in fairness, to remember that there is such a place as New South Wales, and that there are such people as apple-growers in New South Wales. I beg them not to encourage further dumping on the Sydney market, and, whatever legislation they may pass by regulation, to make it uniform throughout the States. </para>

                        <para>- As suggested by the New South Wales growers, they also should be given, a bounty to export to the Western Australian market. I believe that this matter covers a sum of only about £3,000 or £4,000, but I look on it as a most dangerous precedent for the Government, to create. If this policy is pursued, and every State which is suffering owing to the war in regard to some particular industry comes to the Government for relief, we shall find ourselves involved in unknown complications. From the high stand-point of national necessity it is extremely inadvisable for the Government by regulation to do things of this sort, which mean, perhaps, increasing the political pull of a particular section of this Parliament.I protest against it, because it is unfair to the New South Wales fruit-growers, and contrary to the spirit of the Constitution. </para>

I respectfully asked him if he had any intention of doing so. He looked angry, although he was not angry, and declined to pursue the matter further. Since the adjournment this morning it is possible that the Minister has had some sleep and has had an opportunity of consulting his colleagues, so I would like to know if he can now say when it is likely that the Government will nut their policy into operation. </para>

                    <para>. - Yesterday I made a request to the Minister in charge of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> to which I received no reply, and as the Minister was then dealing with a matter of greater importance I am not offering any complaint that he overlooked my request. So I now ask, if the Minister can inform . me if the Committee, of which I am  Chairman,  will he provided with the money necessary to finish their work. I am not asking at this moment for the money itself. A letter has been sent to the  President,  who has forwarded it on to the Government, and I simply ask now when we may get a reply either one way or the other. We are going into recess, and, naturally, members of the Committee are anxious to utilize to the best advantage any opportunities that may be afforded them by the recess either to pursue their inquiries and finish their work, or else to attend to other duties. I recognise, of course,, that, as far as the nation is concerned, this request is not a matter of great fundamental importance, but &lt;I do ask that during the recess the Government should do something in connexion with the drink traffic so as to insure the greatest efficiency for the military effort we are putting forward. If, during the recess, they are not prepared to do anything, I feel sure they will be confronted with a good deal of indignant hostility from a" large section of people who are at present their very loyal supporters. It is necessary, in my opinion, that something should be done. Let me quote from the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> a newspaper which is not regarded as a church organ, or as representative of temperance organizations generally. In a sub-leader which appeared recently in that journal there appeared this statement - </para>

                        <para>- I think I can give the words used by one of the witnesses before the Committee without actually quoting them. Professor ' Mclntyre, who, a little while ago, was Director of Recruiting in New South Wales, said that, in his opinion, the drinking habits, and the fact that the Government were not taking greater action in regard to the matter, was affecting recruiting. I have no doubt that, in view of the position occupied by Professor Mclntyre, the Government would naturally pay a good deal of attention to what he had to say. As the Minister is aware, there are throughout Australia a number of influential churches, which have been most loyally behind the Government ever since the war started. They have supported the Government without qualification and without reservation. Their pulpits have been used as sounding boards, even on Sundays, for recruiting purposes. They have, in season and out of season, pleaded and argued the justice and righteousness of this war ; and I think the Minister will recognise that they have done a great deal for recruiting in Australia. As one who can speak with a certain amount of authority in regard to this matter, I say advisedly that there is a good deal of rumbling and thundering of° discontent amongst those churches because of the Government's inaction. One of the most prominent ministers expressed his views regarding the discontent to me. He said - </para>

Then they will earn the thanks and praise of those who have loyally supported them and are now looking to them for courageous action in rendering all possible help in this time of crisis. </para></speech>

I have given up one or two engagements to free myself for further investigations if the Committee is to make them. One does not care to be kept in suspense in such circumstances. I hope the Committee will continue its investigations. It will be a serious reflection on the Senate if, after unanimously carrying a resolution for the appointment of the Committee, it now turns round and says it has no sympathy with that body, and will not permit it to continue and complete its labours. I do nob think the Government - will take that attitude. </para>

                    reiterated his complaint that some offer from Tasmania to build wooden ships' had been turned down. The only knowledge that I have as to that kind of proposition is in respect of one to which
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline>
                    himself alluded - namely, as to ships which were considered quite too small to be of material value. And this offer was coupled with the further proposition that the Government should find the whole of the money and finance the enterprise, but that that was to be so set out that, while the Government bore the whole of the loss, any profits, if they accrued, were to go into the pockets of those who made the offer. I do not think the Government should be held under censure for having turned down such a proposal.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline>
                    referred also to an offer to build concrete ships in South Australia. My remarks at the. present moment apply to that offer also. Neither was a sound business proposition. When
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline>
                    remarked that he objected altogether to the payment of bounties to companies and firms, his attitude was contradicted by his own observations in denouncing the Government for objecting to pay bounties in respect to this particular subject.

                    referred to my reply to his inquiry concerning a matter dealing with apples. He misunderstands the purpose and reason underlying the decision of the Government to maintain a rather badly shaken industry. Perhaps the fault is my own, but I did not mention that the attitude of the Government was adopted under these circumstances: Western Australian apple-growers were left in a parlous position owing to the action of the Federal Government in withdrawing from the Western Australian trade those two boats which have previously carried the larger portion of their crop eastward. Those boats were withdrawn, too, just at the time when the whole of the sea traffic was being more and more restricted. It was put to the Government that unless something was done to neutralize the effect of this withdrawal of tonnage the outlook would be serious. The Government have done as they did in other directions. It was felt that it would be to the national advantage, if not a matter of necessity, that everything should be done, regardless, even, of uniformity and, perhaps, of the strict letter of the law; and that it was an obligation laid upon the Government to do what they could to keep the various industries of Australia going throughout this time of war.

Exactly the same procedure was carried out as regards wheat for Tasmania. The Government should not be held blameworthy if, under the special circumstances, rather than see . an industry go down, they took steps to preserve from absolute ruin a large section of the community. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> will look into the matter again, and forget that communications have been received from his and my constituents in New South Wales, he will take the larger view - of which he is certainly capable - and will come to the conclusion that if he were seated a few yards further along the bench this way he would adopt exactly the same attitude. </para>
