                            in the Senate yesterday afternoon regarding tin scrap.
                        </para>
                        <para>When I assumed the position of Metallurgical Adviser to the Commonwealth Government (practically my services were requisitioned under the War Precautions Act), I was instructed by the then Attorney-General -  Hon.  W. M. Hughes, P.C. - that the policy of the Commonwealth Government regarding metals was to have, if possible, all ores and metals treated and refined within the Commonwealth, and to submit proposals to give effect to this policy. I have endeavoured to the best of my ability to carry out my instructions. The results must speak for themselves. </para>
                        <para>As regards " scrap metals," and particularly all forms of iron and steel scrap, the method adopted has been to conserve for Australian use the maximum quantities. From time to time letters have been addressed to the  Hon.  the Prime Minister and the  Hon.  the Attorney-General from the Australian users of scrap iron and steel to prohibit, absolutely, the exportation of scrap iron and steel in all forms. With occasional exceptions that policy has been followed, with the result that practically all scrap iron and steel has been worked up in Australia by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, Newcastle, the Lion Boiling Mill's, Melbourne, the Victoria Rolling Mills, and others. The outcome of this policy has been, with the scarcity of shipments from overseas, to keep the local markets, during the war period, fairly well supplied with certain standard types of steel rods, bars, &amp;c. </para>
                        <para>The embargo which was placed upon steel and iron by Great Britain and France was adopted by the Commonwealth with some exceptions. The United States of America also followed the same course on joining the Allies, with the effect that the Fast Indies, China, and Japan, were faced with a great shortage of iron and steel, hence the phenomenally high prices ruling in the East for scrap steel of all kinds. </para>
                        <para>The result of the shortage of stocks in Australia, the effect of the embargo, and the inducements offered by the Commonwealth Government, have been important factors in the huge and rapid development of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company's steel works at Newcastle, and the impetus given to all other companies and firms using scrap iron or steel. </para>
                        <para>The formation of the Australian Electric Steel Company, using scrap metal as the raw material, is the direct outcome of the Commonwealth's policy. This company has already expended £40,000 in plant and appliances, has not distributed after three years' work one penny as dividends amongst shareholders; yet the directors and shareholders of this company are so satisfied with the Commonwealth Government's policy and the prohibition of export on scrap iron and steel that the company has arranged to expend a further £80,000 in the Commonwealth in the extension of the present plant and in the establishment of branch works. This company has also decided to install plant for the manufacture of ferro-alloys - a most important industry to Australia. </para>
                        <para>Another example of the Commonwealth Government's policy is the Austral Wire and Nail Company, which is now erecting plant in close proximity to the Broken Hill Proprietary Company's works at Newcastle, to draw wire, roll steel bands for wool dumping and packages, and to embark on the manufacture of wire ropes. Other illustrations of the soundness of the Government's policy could' be given. </para>
                        <para>Tin Scrap</para>
                        <para>In pre-war times portion of the Australian production of tin scrap was purchased and shipped to Germany, but a large portion was carted to the " rubbish dumps." Previous attempts had been made in Australia unsuccessfully to treat the tin scrap. </para>
                        <para>The Metals Recovery Company Proprietary Limited was formed to treat tin scrap in Australia, and after much experimental work, perfected a commercial process and started operations. The capacity . of the works, according to the company's statements, is now 5,000 tons per annum, which is to be increased sufficiently to work up accumulated stocks within a reasonable time, and to treat current production. </para>
                        <para>Assume the treatment by the company of 7,500 tons of tin scrap annually, the gross value of the tin recovered - 150 tons - should be at the low figure of £250 per ton, equal to £37,000, and the resultant scrap steel - 7,500 tons - at £3 per ton, is equal to for that metal £21,000, or a total of £58,000. In addition to the Melbourne works, there is another company carrying on similar operations in Sydney. </para>
                        <para>With the establishment of tin-plate manufacture in Australia, which is imperative to safeguard many primary industries, such as meat canning, jams, preserved fruit, condensed milk. &amp;c, the conservation of metallic tin and the development of all sources of supply, together with protection of Allied industries, must be a sound and prudent policy. The Japanese were not buyers of tin scrap prior to the war, nor, I believe, before the formation of this company. If the embargo were lifted upon tin scrap, which consists of 2 to 3 per cent. of tin and 96 to 97 per cent. of steel, then there would be justification in asking for the embargo to be raised on steel scrap, the product of the detinning process, or any other form of steel scrap. </para>
                        <para>Since the embargo was placed on scrap . metals, scores of applications have been refused for the exportation of same overseas. This course was imperative in the interests of the Imperial Government, and to conserve stocks in Australia and protect Commonwealth industries. For many months applicants were pressing for the freedom of exports of all descriptions of iron and steel - manufactured or scrap - to the East, whilst the local users were short of supplies. Very strong measures had to be taken by the Commonwealth Government, not only as regards scrap metals, but also pig iron, steel billets, rails, &amp;c. Application was made by a company of the highest standing - Dalgety and Co. - to be allowed to export tin scrap to Japan. I recommended the Minister to refuse the application. It was after this refusal that I first learned that Colonel Oldershaw was connected with the Metals Recovery Co. Pty. Ltd. </para>
                        <para>I was. advised later that a syndicate had purchased certain stocks of tin scrap, and received notification that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ambrose</inline> Pratt, of the <inline font-style="italic">Miming Standard</inline> newspaper, was considerably interested in it. An application was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ambrose</inline> Pratt to ship a definite tonnage of tin scrap to Japan. This was also refused. Dalgety and Co., the Ambrose Pratt syndicate, and the Metals Recovery Co. Pty. Ltd. were treated alike. None of the applicants were permitted to export the scrap metals - the latter the resultant steel scrap from the detinning process; the two former tin scrap. </para>
                        <para>As an adviser, my duty is to uphold the policy of the Commonwealth Government if practicable. I am not specially concerned as to the details, but I must pay strict attention to the principles involved. In any application for the shipment of iron, steel or tin scrap, the problem is almost the same, and may be summarized under the following headings: - </para>

                        <para>In the case in question - steel scrap - because tin scrap consists of 96. per cent. to 97 per cent. of steel, I arrived at the conclusion, and I think rightly, in favour of. local treatment. This decision was not arrived at hurriedly, but after most careful consideration. I maintain that the action decided upon, viz., to support and assist in Australia an industry (to utilize a waste product - tin scrap - and which there is every reason to believe can bo made permanent, is of far greater value to the Commonwealth than the mere Sale of a parcel or two of scrap metal during war time, when prices and markets are abnormal. </para>
                        <para>As to the price paid for the tin scrap, that is ruled, as far as the recoverable tin contents, by the price of metallic tin in the world's markets, but local conditions practically govern scrap steel, which at the date of the application was very much lower in Australia than in China or Japan, and the Metals Recovery Co. Pty. Ltd. was, and is, forced to accept the Australian price for its scrap steel after the removal of the tin coating. The low price for Australian steel scrap governs the position. This fact must be emphasized. </para>

I say deliberately and positively that the Metals Recovery Co. Pty. Ltd. did not receive, as far as I am aware or concerned, preferential treatment or concession of any kind from the Commonwealth Government beyond the influence resulting from the embargo on scrap metals which applied to all parties interested in the working and treatment of scrap metals, on identically like terms. It is readily admitted that the satisfactory disposal of a by-product such as tin scrap is a factor in certain industries; on the other hand, steel scrap is the raw material of primary importance in other industries. The course to be followed, then, is that which will be of the greatest good to the greatest number, and I contend that the evidence is decidedly in favour of the treatment of the scrap metals in the Commonwealth. </para>

I am perfectly satisfied that his actions have been beyond question, but I believed that his position in the Prime Minister's Department, and his connexion with the company as  chairman  of directors, were liable to be misunderstood by some persons, hence my expressions of disapproval in order to protect the Minister in charge, the officers of the Attorney-General's Department, and myself. I take exception to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten's</inline> frequent references to  Colonel Oldershaw's  company. The correct title is the Metals Recovery Co. Pty.

If the Senate desire an inquiry, no one will be better pleased than the writer. The only qualification I can add is that it be a thorough examination, with preferably a High Court or a Supreme Court Judge in charge of the investigation. </para>
                        <para>In conclusion, I wish to state that, as Honorary Metallurgical Adviser to the Commonwealth Government, I made the recommendation that permission to ship tin scrap to Japan be not granted ; in other words, that the embargo be not lifted; and, further, I desire to emphasize the fact that the responsibility of adopting the recommendation rests with the honorable Minister. </para>

It was proposed to treat this parcel of scrap at the rate of 40 tons per week, at the same time treating 40 tons per, week of the scrap supplied by the regular producers, and 20 tons per week of the old stock at the factory, making a total turnover of 100 tons per week.

If the company had accepted the 1,600 tons from the above-named gentleman, it would have, retarded the treatment of scrap supplied by others, and the company could hardly bc expected to put down a special plant to treat this particular parcel of 1,600 tons, as machinery and other appliances had to be purchased at war prices; therefore the company's plant has cost probably at least double the amount it would have cost before the war. </para>

This company immediately arranged with its scrap producers for them to have the scrap carted to the works by their regular carriers, and to submit their accounts at the end of each month for the amount of cartage, which the company has duly paid month by month, so that already the company's scrap producers have received over 5s. per ton towards the value of their scrap, and it is expected that very shortly the company will be in a position to make a further payment on account to scrap producers, as their interests are always paramount. </para>

                        <para>It is presumed that the object of the embargo against the export of tin scrap was really intended to prevent the export of the steel. The company is at present turning out at the rate of 3,000 tons of the very finest and best quality steel per annum, and will shortly be turning out upwards of 5,000 tons of this steel per annum. The company has sold its steel to the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, who ship it to their steel works at Newcastle, and if the Broken Hill Proprietary can afford to pay the company a higher rate than the present one for this steel, the result will be that the owners of the tin scrap, and not the company, will obtain the main benefit. Several proposals have been made to the Metal Company that they should establish a rolling mill at their works in South Melbourne, and thus utilize their own supplies of steel to better advantage, but the directors have not considered the time opportune, as the supplies of tin scrap may decrease, and some of the larger holders may wish to follow the example of Messrs. Pratt, palfreyman, and Neuendorf, and export the tin scrap to Japan. </para>

                    <para>Sir,</para>
                <para>With reference to the discussion relative to tin scrap that took place in the Senate on Thursday last, on the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> for the special adjournment of the Senate, and to your verbal instructions to me to obtain from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Higgins and  Colonel Oldershaw  reports in relation to the matters referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> I have the honour to inform you that I at once communicated with the gentlemen in question, and have now received from them the 'attached reports. </para>
                <para>As, however, there are several phases of the matter referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> which are not dealt with in those reports, I, as the acting permanent head of the Department which deals with metals, desire to make the following report for your information. </para>
                <para>The policy of the Government, as ' regards metals, has been to have all ores, mattes, impure metals, scrap metals, &amp;c, treated within the Commonwealth, in order that the resultant metals may be put on the world's markets in a refined state, and employment given to Australian labour. This policy was laid down by the Prime Minister early in the war, and has been steadily pursued ever since, with the result that at the present time the whole of the Australian output of ores, with the exception of zinc, and practically all scrap metals, residues, &amp;c, are treated within the Commonwealth. </para>
                <para> The policy finds legal expression in a proclamation under the Customs Act prohibiting the export of metals, alloys, and minerals from the Commonwealth without the consent of the Minister for Trade and Customs. (It may be mentioned, in passing, that this proclamation was issued nearly two years before the formation of the Metal Recovery Proprietary Limited.) In determining whether to grant or refuse applications for permission to export metals, &amp;c, the Department of Trade and Customs acts on the advice of this Department. </para>
                <para>As part of the policy of providing for the treatment of metals  within  the Commonwealth, the Government exercises a general supervision of local treatment companies, in order to insure that fair treatment is accorded by them to local producers. Several instances of alleged unfair treatment by local treatment companies have been investigated by the Department, with the result that in some cases the Department has secured improved terms for the producer, while in others it was satisfied that, under the present abnormal conditions, the charges made were fair and reasonable.  Dealing now generally with the treatment of tin scrap, it may be mentioned that, before the war, tin scrap produced in Australia was either dumped on a tip or exported to Germany, a large portion of what was sent to Germany going to the Goldschmidt Works. </para>
                <para>The impossibility of getting supplies to Germany led to the accumulation of tin scrap in Australia. Twelve months after the war started, and just before the imposition of the general embargo on the export of metals from Australia, several of the local producers, including the Australasian Jam Company, the managing director of which is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> W. Palfreyman, one of the owners of this particular parcel of tin scrap, inquired as to the possibility of supplying tin scrap to the Goldschmidt Detinning Company of New York. The jam company, in making the inquiry, added that - " So long as we make tins at all, there is a certain amount of ' scrap,'which, so far as we are aware, is quite unsaleable in Australia, there not being the necessary  plant to handle it." </para>
                <para class="block">The imposition of the embargo, coupled with the growing accumulation of tin scrap in Australia, led to the establishment of two detinning companies - Detinning Limited, at Alexandria, Sydney, and the Metal Recovery Pty. Ltd., at Melbourne. </para>
                <para>It is difficult to estimate with any accuracy the annual production of tin scrap. The Department places it in the neighbourhood of 6,000 tons, while <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ambrose</inline> Pratt, part owner of the parcel of tin scrap referred to by. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> places it at upwards of 4,500 tons. </para>
                <para>The present capacity of the works of the Sydney company is 50 tons a week, or 2,500 tons per annum, and that company is stated to be treating the whole of the available production in New South Wales. </para>
                <para>The capacity of the works of the Melbourne company has for some weeks been 60 tons a week; but this week extensive increases in plant will be completed, and the capacity will thereupon be increased to 100 tons, or 5,000 tons per annum. </para>
                <para>Thus, assuming that the departmental estimate of the annual production in Australia of 6,000 tons is a fair statement of the position, the works already established in Australia can handle the whole of it. </para>
                <para>It may be mentioned that both companies have intimated that they are prepared to extend their works if increased supplies of tin scrap become available. </para>
                <para>Dealing now with the particular parcel of tin scrap referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> the following is a summary of the correspondence which has taken place with the Department in regard to it: - </para>
                <para>In June last an application for permission to export 1,000 tons to Japan was made to the Department by a prominent company in Melbourne, whose traveller had just returned from Japan. The company stated it had purchased the scrap, but subsequent events disclosed that it was merely the agent of the owners of the scrap. In accordance with the practice of the </para>
                <para class="block">Department, applicants were referred to the local detinning company, and were informed that if a reasonable agreement could not be made with the local company, the application for permission to ship might be renewed. </para>
                <para>The applicants thereupon approached the local detinning company, offering to supply the scrap at £2 15s. per ton. The company, however, having a largo stock of scrap on hand, and being largely of a co-operative nature, was not desirous of purchasing the parcel outright, but suggested treatment on a co-operative basis, and offered to place the applicants on the same terms and conditions as if they were producers of scrap tin, and treat their scrap on the same co-operative basis as the company treated scrap belonging to its shareholders. </para>
                <para>The applicants did not again communicate with the Department in writing, but, in the course of an interview, they hinted that the connexion of  Colonel Oldershaw  with the detinning company had something to do with the refusal of the desired permission to export - a suggestion which was, of course, wide of the mark, seeing that the refusal was in accordance with an embargo which was imposed nearly two years before the establishment of the company with which  Colonel Oldershaw  is connected. </para>
                <para>In September last <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ambrose</inline> Pratt, managing editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Industrial Australian and Mining Standard,</inline> applied for permission to export to Japan 1,600 tons of tin scrap held by him. The parcel of 1,000 tons, for which permission had previously been refused, formed part of this parcel. </para>
                <para>In reply, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pratt</inline> was requested to give further information as to the impossibility of treatment in Australia, and he gave some further information on 2nd October. </para>
                <para>On 17th October, after several communications had passed by telephone, he was informed that- " The policy of the Government is, if practicable, to have all ores, scrap metals, &amp;c, treated within the Commonwealth. Works have, since the commencement of the war, been established both in Melbourne and Sydney expressly for the purpose of treating tin scrap. These works are at present treating each week an amount greater than the weekly production of tin scrap in Australia, and both companies, if sufficient tin scrap is available, are prepared to extend their works. "I have accordingly to state that, before your application can be finally dealt with, it will be necessary for you to register the contract of sale of the scrap overseas with the Metal Exchange, and to produce evidence from the Australian detinning works that they are unable to treat the scrap, or that a reasonable arrangement cannot be arrived at with them for the local treatment of the tin scrap held by you." </para>
                <para class="block">In a letter in reply, on the same date, he referred to the correspondence that had taken place between the previous applicants for permission to export and the detinning company. </para>
                <para class="block">He did not combat the statement of the Department that the local companies were treating a greater quantity of scrap than the weekly production; in fact, he admitted that the companies might be treating an equivalent quantity, comprised partly of old and partly of new supplies, but maintained - as is, no doubt, the case - that the companies were not receiving the whole of the current output, inasmuch as several producers objected to the cooperative basis, which was the only basis upon which the local companies were prepared to treat. In conclusion, he threatened publicity if the export permit was not forthcoming promptly. </para>
                <para>Conformably to the custom, which had been followed in metals administration, of bringing the parties in controversial cases face to face at the offices of the Department, a conference was summoned by the Acting Attorney-General to take place on 28th October.

                </para>
                <para>The main question at issue was the question of the terms of treatment of the scrap by the company. It is understood that the terms originally quoted by the Metal Recovery Propty.

The conference discussed the matter generally, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Palfreyman,</inline> one of the owners, agreeing that "the work of detinning should bo done locally, if practicable." </para>
                <para>After the conclusion of the conference, the matter was further considered by the Department, in conjunction with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir J.</inline> M. Higgins, the Honorary Metallurgical Adviser to the Commonwealth Government, and it was decided to notify the Metal Recovery Pty. Ltd. as follows: - " With reference to the conference held on 28th instant, in connexion with the exportation of tin scrap from the Commonwealth, I have the honour to inform you that, as it was admitted by both parties that every effort should be made to treat tin scrap in Australia, it is proposed to refuse permission to export the tin scrap in question, on the distinct understanding that your company will be prepared to treat the parcel in question upon a basis considered by this Department to be satisfactory, and within a reasonable time. " To this end I shall be glad if, within a week, you will call a meeting of the directors of your company to consider the treatment of the particular parcel in question, and also current production, due allowance being made for working stocks. " I have also to state that satisfactory evidence must be forthcoming on or before the 30th proximo that your directors are prepared to increase the capacity of your plant, in order that the tin scrap may be treated within a reasonable time. "The division of profits at present fixed between your company and the producers is not considered satisfactory, and I shall be obliged if your directors will give special attention to the apportionment of profits, after deducting working costs, amortization, interest, &amp;c. "I have also to ask that a certified list of the true shareholders in your company be forwarded as soon as possible. " As you are aware, much attention has already been devoted to the treatment of tin scrap locally, and whilst the policy of the Commonwealth Government is to protect new industries, such as your company is conducting, it must be understood that it is the duty of the Government also to protect the producers of tin scrap. If your company should decide to undertake the treatment of this scrap metal, it will be necessary for the company to enter into a bond for the proper performance of the contract." </para>

It intimated that it had been the intention of the directors to increase the amount to be paid for the scrap, either in the shape of a bonus at end of year, or by paying a larger percentage of the profits. It thereupon intimated that it was prepared to treat all scrap on the following terms: - Division of profits to be increased to 66 per cent. to the producer and 33 per cent. to the company, after allowing for working costs, depreciation, and 7 per cent. interest on paid-up capital. It further pointed out that it had already 2,200 tons on hand at the factory, and was receiving weekly deliveries to the amount of 40 tons a week. It was, however, prepared to treat <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pratt's</inline> parcel at the rate of 40 tons a week. It did not consider a bond was necessary. </para>
                <para>As the Department considered that the bond was necessary, and that the division of the profits, namely, 66 per cent. and 33 per cent., was not entirely satisfactory, the company, on 22nd. November, made a further offer, altering the division to 75 per cent. to the producers, and 25 per cent. to the company. It also undertook to lodge with the Department a bond for £2,500 for the due performance of any contract entered into, and agreed to make  monthly payments to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pratt</inline> on account of his scrap as treated. </para>
                <para class="block">Before this offer was communicated to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pratt,</inline> a conference took place between the Acting Prime Minister, the Acting Attorney-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Higgins, and myself. The matter was carefully considered, and the Government, concluding that the offer was a reasonable one under the circumstances, approved of the refusal of the permit to export. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pratt</inline> was accordingly notified in the following terms: - " With reference to my letter to you of 30th ultimo, and your reply of 1st instant, in connexion with your application to export 1,600 tons tin scrap to Japan, I have to inform you that, as stated previously, the policy of the Government is to insist on the local treatment of all ores, scrap metals, &amp;c, wherever facilities exist within the Commonwealth for their treatment on a reasonable tariff. " Detinning works have been established at Melbourne and Sydney,, in accordance with the Government's policy, and this Department has been in communication with the Metal Recovery Pty. Ltd., of Melbourne, as to the terms upon which it is prepared to treat the parcel in question. " I understand that the company has increased its plant, so that early next month it will be capable of treating 100 tons per week, and the company is prepared to. still further increase its plant, if circumstances warrant such extension.. "I am informed that the company is prepared to take delivery of and treat 40 tons of your scrap per week, and is also prepared to divide with you the profits accruing from the treatment as follows: - " The holders of the scrap to receive 75 per cent and the company 25 per cent. of the profits, the holders paying for actual working costs, including depreciation and interest at 7 per cent. on amount of capital actually paid up, payments on account to be made monthly." "I may also add that the company is quite willing to enter into a bond to the Commonwealth Government to faithfully carry out the terms of the arrangement as above set out. " In view of the foregoing, permission to ship tin scrap from the Commonwealth  cannot be granted." </para>
                <para class="block">One matter in. this letter calls for attention - a matter arising out of the statement of terms in the fourth paragraph. That paragraph concludes with the words " payments on account to be made monthly." Those words are admittedly somewhat ambiguous, and have been construed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> as meaning thai the producers must make payments to the company monthly. What I intended to convey to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pratt</inline> was that the company was to pay to the producers monthly their share of the profits. I can, however, hardly under stand how <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pratt</inline> can have, without inquiry from the Department, placed such a construction upon the words as he has done, inasmuch as before the offer was communicated to him in writing he, in the course of conversation by telephone, asked whether the offer meant that he was to await the treatment of the whole parcel before receiving anything on account, to which I replied that the Department would see that payment was made by the company periodically as the scrap was treated. </para>
                <para>Before summarizing the position, I desire to draw attention to several inaccuracies in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten's</inline> speech. </para>

As a matter of fact, the Metal Recovery Proprietary Limited has for several months past treated 60 tons a week, and is now capable of doing 100 tons a week, and, as already pointed out, it and the Sydney company are at present treating an amount greater than the regular Australian production.

                            Higgins, £5,000 or £10,000 in actual cash was lost to Australia. He states, also, that the parcel which could have been sold abroad for £4 15s. a ton was offered to  Colonel Oldershaw  for £2 15s. Presumably he bases his estimate of loss on the figures £4 15s. a ton. He has not, however, allowed for the cost of bagging and dumping, which would be required in the case of shipment but would not be required in that of local treatment, as the offer to the Metal Recovery Proprietary Limited was " on the dumps." Thus the net return to the owners of the scrap would be in both cases £215s. a ton. And those figures would not produce a loss of £5,000, even if the owners obtained no return whatever from the local, treatment.

It was merely an intimation from the Department that, in response to pressure placed by the Department on the company in the interest of the local producers of tin Scrap, the company had made an offer which was considered reasonable.

                            refers to the fact that the company has, up to the present, made no profit. In reply, it may be pointed out that the industry has only just been established. It is getting over its initial troubles. It has had. high prices to pay for its plant and machinery. Its processes have now been perfected. Its product of tin is sold on the same basis as Mount Bischoff, while its steel is eagerly sought after by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company. In the first year it put through only 560 tons of scrap. At the present time it can deal with that, quantity in less than six weeks. With his' knowledge of business,
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline>
                            must be aware that it is an unusual thing' for a new industry to pay from the start. It is important, also, to note that the local company is not a purchasing company, but a treatment company engaged largely as a co-operative concern, and. therefore producers interested in the company share in the profits as shareholders, and also as clients. From this point of view, and having regard to the recent establishment of the company, and the progress it has made, the latest offer made by the company is considered by the Department reasonable.

                            Higgins had acted fairly in the matter. As a matter of fact, the application for export was for 1,600 tons only, which at £4 15s. a ton is £7,600. Of this £3,200 represents cartage, bagging, and dumping, which the producers would be required to pay, leaving the remainder £4,400 - not £10,000. In any case,

                            Higgins has merely acted in this matter, as he had always acted in connexion with the metal administration, in an advisory capacity. He has, since his services were first requisitioned by the Department, rendered simply invaluable services to the Department throughout - services without which it would have been impossible for the Department to deal satisfactorily with the many complex and varied questions arising 'in metals administration. And all of these services have been freely and cheerfully rendered in a purely honorary capacity.

                        <para>. - I have followed very closely the long statements which have been read by the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen).</inline> I regret exceedingly that the Government have come to the conclusion that those replies to my statements are quite satisfactory. I say most unhesitatingly that the replies are incomplete, that to me they are unconvincing, that some of the salient points in my statement have not been touched by them, and that in some respects they appear to be misleading, if not inaccurate. </para>

                    <para>We have heard a good deal about the very valuable character of this steel product from the de-tinning works. I will not repeat all that has been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Higgins,  Colonel Oldershaw,  and the representative of the Attorney-General's Department, as to the value of this raw material to the Commonwealth. But I will tell honorable senators that the price which the de-tinning works in Sydney received for this product in 1915 was 25s. per ton. A year or two later they obtained 35s. per ton for it, and today they are receiving only 40s. per ton for this very valuable material. </para>

There are now before the Senate two distinctly opposite statements, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has declared that the letters which have been read this afternoon contain inaccuracies. I must express astonishment at the method adopted by the Government in reading, not a report from their officers in regard to this matter, but an attack on a senator. </para>

                            <para>- The officers in question went beyond the submission of a departmental report. They attacked a senator and the Senate. Now that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has affirmed that there are inaccuracies in their statements, no other course is open to the Government than to sanction the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into the matter. Personally, I would prefer an inquiry by a Select Committee rather than by a High Court Judge. This Parliament, it must be remembered, is a higher tribunal than is the High Court. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> moves for the appointment of a Select Committee to investigate this question, I hope that his motion will be so framed as to make the inquiry embrace the whole of the minerals of Australia during the war-time period. At present, we are discussing only the question of tin scrap. In my opinion, the whole business should be inquired into. If the Government will not move for the appointment of a Committee, if they are satisfied with the statements which have been read to the Senate, I trust that this Chamber will have sufficient courage to vindicate its own character. If such an inquiry be held, inaccuracies will not then be able to stand, because the evidence tendered by witnesses will be given on oath. </para>

                        <para>. - I listened to the speech which was delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> last week with care and attention, and I listened with equal, if not greater, care and attention to the replies which have been read by the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> this afternoon. I must confess that I was absolutely surprised at the concluding remarks of the honorable gentleman. I was surprised at his statement that, in the opinion of the Government, nothing further should be done. As a matter of fact, the letter of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Higgins actually welcomes an inquiry into this matter, preferably by a Royal Commission, consisting either of a High Court Judge or a Supreme Court Judge. If my memory be correct,  Colonel Oldershaw  also makes reference to an inquiry, which he. courts. In the replies read by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> a great many allegations  are  made, not merely by way of criticism of the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> but by way of criticism of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ambrose</inline> Pratt, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Palfreyman,</inline> and others.

In a postscript to his letter, he says that he has given four years of voluntary service to the Commonwealth in time of war. All honour to him, all credit to him, for that. But let no man think that, because he gives honorary service to this country, because he is placed in a position of trust and" responsibility, and because he is endowed with powers such as have been vested in <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Higgins, he is not to be subjected to criticism. That gentleman says that the action taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> and the Senate in considering his conduct, is not calculated to attract from the business men of the community service such as he has rendered to the Commonwealth. We ought to resent that statement. I am prepared to give credit to all who have rendered voluntary service to the Commonwealth, either in respect of the war or in any other connexion. But a man so placed is not necessarily to escape reasonable criticism. </para>

                    <para class="block">The criticism offered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> last week was, I submit, offered in a spirit of duty. In reply, it has been asserted that he was inspired to indulge in that criticism. Perhaps he was. But I am not concerned with whether he' was or not.  His  criticism has been published, the replies to it have been read, and those replies involve a consideration of the conduct and statements of other persons, who, df the matter is now permitted to drop, will remain unheard. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">.Senator Pratten</inline> is quite right in his decision to move for the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into this question. I disagree, however, with the view that has been expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline> in that I would much prefer an inquiry of this character to be undertaken either by a Supreme Court or a High Court Judge, or by some person altogether outside of parliamentary life. </para>

                        <para>.- The Government cannot accept a proposal for the appointment of a Select Committee to investigate this matter. In the first place, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has based his claim for the constitution of such a body on the allegation that some of the statements which have been read this afternoon are inaccurate. But he has had an opportunity of pointing out those inaccuracies. Yet he has not pointed to  a  single .statement as inaccurate. Anybody who listened to the honorable senator the other day will agree with me - I heard his statement throughout - that he was definitely charging collusion between  Colonel Oldershaw  and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Higgins, and that he waa endeavouring to make it appear that the prohibition imposed on the export of this metal was imposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Higgins in order to benefit  Colonel Oldershaw.  The replies to his statements are here. Does anybody contradict them ? They -are not merely statements, because they are backed up by a representative of the Attorney-General's  Department,  who shows that there was an interval of two years between the time when the prohibition was imposed and the formation of the company in . which  Colonel Oldershaw  is interested. The Senate has heard both sides of this matter, and it is surely up to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> before we  are  asked to appoint a Select Committee,  to  say which of the statements read this afternoon  are  inaccurate. It may  be urged  that he has not had time to do so. But I can remember the leading statements made in those documents. I can put my finger upon them, and so can any other honorable senator. Instead of contradicting them, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has merely made a general charge that the replies read contain statements which are inaccurate. It may be that he has in mind the statements referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> in which other names - the names of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. 'Palfreyman</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pratt</inline> - are introduced. But the charges made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> were not against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Palfreyman</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pratt,</inline> but against <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Higgins and  Colonel Oldershaw.  Those charges have been refuted here today, not merely by the statements of these gentlemen, but by the letters read from the Attorney-General's Department, which entirely destroy them. </para>

                        <para>- I inquired some days ago if the Government could furnish information with regard to charges made in the New South Wales Parliament against the methods of quarantine and the regulations adopted in connexion with the quarantine of vessels during the present outbreak of influenza in Sydney. The answer which I received was that the Minister would try to find out what the charges were, but that he did not then know. Since then the charges have been published in the newspapers over the name of a gentleman who has been visiting Australia for the past three or four months, a Chicago business man, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Louis</inline> M.. C. Reed. That gentleman has taken a very prominent part, during his stay in Australia, in assisting  the Government in the recruiting and war loan campaigns. He is a man of standing; I have had the pleasure of meeting him on the public platform in the Town Hall, Sydney, in advocating the claims upon the public of the Voluntary Workers Association. And no question need be asked whether the man who made the charges has been game enough to sign his name. Those charges are of a drastic nature, and reveal such horrible things that it is scarcely possible that they could be perpetrated in any part of the world, even among the greatest bands of savages. The indignities placed upon passengers who have had to go into quarantine have been such that an inquiry should be demanded, and the conditions to which attention has been called should be remedied at once. There is a Conference of quarantine officials being held in Melbourne which should be in Sydney. If the scourge gets out among the inhabitants of Sydney there will be a repetition of what has occurred in New Zealand, where people have fallen in the streets, and there has been scarcely time to bury them. It has not been due to the precautions taken by the Quarantine Department that the disease has not spread. It is simply that nature has helped us in the matter of the good weather which has prevailed in Sydney. The good sunshine has, in my opinion, proved the main cause of the outbreak not spreading. </para>

                    <para>The passengers were not " questioned regarding their health and directed what to do to combat infection," but were absolutely unable to procure at any time, even at their own expense, any medicines or disinfectants, except the smallest quantity of Condy's fluid. </para>
                    <para>To have to stand by helpless and see decent, clean women like my wife, and elderly, refined mothers of useful men herded into stuffy, stinking inhalation chambers, and put through all manner of hardship and disappointments day after day for two long weeks until their nerves are so shattered with the indignity of it all that they are in condition to catch any disease, should be enough to make every decent, chivalrous, patriotic man blush for shame. </para>
                    <para>The absence of your chief health authorities in Melbourne during a crisis like this, obliging their subordinates here to have to wire back and forth for instructions, and to have three badly overworked doctors in charge of several hundred patients and a half-dozen ships, so that through the very physical inability of these men to properly attend to each ship the healthy passengers must be held for -two- weeks and regarded as contacts until the doctors can get around to them, is scandalous. </para>
                    <para>It is not against quarantine' measures that I ann protesting. It is against the shocking lack of them. Your Health Department did not quarantine the <inline font-style="italic">Manuka</inline> passengers. They simply imprisoned them. That any of us remained well' during the nineteen days' menace since we sailed from Wellington is little short of remarkable. </para>
                    <para>I have been quarantined in Turkey and Greece during, cholera epidemic. I have been through small-pox epidemics in South Africa, New Zealand,, and China, and plague in India, Egypt, and elsewhere. I have passed through hundreds of medical examinations aboard all kinds of ships touching all' kinds of civilized and.  half-civilized  ports,, but never during my whole experience in ocean, travel have I met with suck shocking indifference to health and dignity and decency until I came to the door of this white man's country on the 13th of November. </para>
                    <para>Those are; the charges that have been publicly made against our quarantine authorities. Like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reed,</inline> I do not blame the Government, or the officials, or the doctors, but I am blaming the system of quarantine that will allow such scandalous treatment of passengers to take place, and such utter disregard for the welfare of the community to be exhibited. I hope the Government will take immediate action to remedy this disgraceful state of affairs. If the scourge escaped from the quarantine station, which is only a few hundred yards from one of the healthiest suburbs of Sydney, the Government would be to blame on account of their- unavoidable quarantine regulations and arrangements. They have been asked- by the New South Wales' Government to provide temporary accommodation elsewhere in New South Wales, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> pointed out here last week an arrangement that could be made whereby all these difficulties could be overcome..  But nothing has been done, and nothing will be done unless we, in our places in this chamber, protest with all our power against the scandalous treatment of the unfortunate people who happened to- be on these ships. Here is a well-to-do Chicago business man, who has assisted' us in every possible way in recruiting and in war loans,, by going on the platform, and in other 'ways. He goes away, and when he comes back, is treated in a white man's country in the. way he has described. Better precautions for the health of the people would be taken in the- most savage country in the world than we are taking to-day. Their medicine-men and hospitals may be crude, but, at any rate, they do something, whereas we are running right in the face of. Providence, doing everything we possibly can, not to keep the disease outside the gates of. Australia, but to bring it in. If it does get in, there will be thousands more deaths than there were in New Zealand, because we have a different climate,, and the Government will be to blame for every one of them if they do not remedy the existing condition of affairs at once. </para>

                        <para>. - This is the first time that these charges have been brought directly under my notice in this Chamber. I have recently felt thankful, as an Australian, that Australia, lying between South Africa and New Zealand, and being practically the last link in the circle of the world, had' been kept free from this disease, which had spread rapidly throughout the habitable globe. It struck me that Australia must be a very clean country,, and that somebody was to be thanked for those conditions in Australia which enabled us alone to be free from the disease. I was inclined to think that our Quarantine Department must have been controlled by men who were not only careful, but highly skilled. I have had an opportunity of meeting <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reed,</inline> the American, the report of whose complaints, has been read by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall.. Dr. Lambert,</inline> an American health expert ; was a passenger on one of the quarantined boats, and furnishes a complete refutation of every statement made by that gentleman. A little personal and direct knowledge is often at least equal to information obtained from -a. newspaper, and evidently magnified considerably. Among the passengers on one of the boats was a brother of my own. I have spoken to him in Melbourne on this very subject. He was quarantined, not only in New Zealand, but also in Sydney, and speaks highly of the treatment he received at the Sydney station. Not a single complaint did he make, privately or publicly, about his treatment there. I have met several other prominent . citizens since their arrival in Melbourne, and know, from their conversations, that they had not the slightest complaint to make. Either Australia has been exceedingly well protected by our quarantine authorities, or it has been much more lucky than any other country, seeing that, except among the passengers who came from overseas, we have not had a single case of the disease in Australia. . If there have been little difficulties arising out of the sudden call upon the authorities, it is quite evident that the preparatory work of those authorities has been such as to prevent the disease from developing here. </para>

Every person, from whatever country, should be prepared to undergo such treatment as is necessary, not only to protect himself individually, but to protect also a good many other innocent people.

The statements quoted were made by a most reputable man. Because he is an American, his statements are none the less admissible. He was a passenger on the <inline font-style="italic">Manuka,</inline> and complained about the treatment which the passengers received at the hands of the quarantine officials in Sydney. I have had placed in my hands to-day by a passenger on that unfortunate steamer a record of a meeting held on that vessel, and I must say that, so far as I have been able to judge, the two statements made - the chargesby <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reed</inline> and the record of the meeting of passengers - entirely agree that a considerable amount of carelessness was evinced in the early stages of the quarantining of that vessel, and that the passengers were carelessly, if not inhumanly, treated.

                            <para>- Some honorable senators living here in Melbourne forget sometimes what is going on in that Queen City of the South, Sydney. This is one of the things concerning which dissatisfaction is felt. I heartily indorse what has been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall.</inline> So far as can be ascertained, the consensus of medical opinion appears to be that pneumonic influenza is traceable to the presence of vermin. I have been informed by three or four passengers on the <inline font-style="italic">Manuka</inline> that that vessel was full of rats, and that she had not been fumigated until she went up to the wharf in Sydney, further than that, the disease seems to be concurrent with the war, and probably is brought about by great empty, or half-empty, troopships in which vermin have been allowed to increase at a very rapid rate. It seems to me, therefore, that the Federal quarantine authorities should treat this epidemic very much on the same lines as outbreaks of what are regarded as more serious diseases, and that the first thing to be done should be the destruction of vermin. In the early stages of quarantining, so far as the <inline font-style="italic">Manuka</inline> is concerned, this was not done, and in the opinion of many passengers on that vessel it should have been undertaken immediately. I consider that the resolutions passed by the meeting of passengers indorsed all that has been said to-day, and dispose very largely of the reply made by the Minister. </para>

                        <para>. -  I am rather glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> has spoken on the motion, because, if he had known what the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> intended to say in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall's</inline> charges, he could not have made a more effective answer. Every statement made by the Minister in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> has been absolutely contradicted by the record of the meeting of passengers on board the <inline font-style="italic">Manuka,</inline> as read by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten.</inline> It is about time that the Government woke up. I pointed out to the Government last week in a friendly way, because it is not my method to raise difficulties when grave danger confronts us, that definite action ought to be taken in regard to this matter. To my mind, this plague - I hope I am not giving it a wrong name - is the gravest danger that has threatened Australia for many years, and I am satisfied that Government quarantine officials living in Melbourne have not yet realized the enormity of the danger. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Last week I put before the Government a proposal for the removal of the whole of the passengers to Trial Bay, so as to provide a separate establishment for those who were not contacts. Trial Bay has this advantage: there is a good beach, good fishing, and the military hutments recently vacated by the German prisoners are available for their accommodation. Moreover, the passengers could be conveyed to that place without coming in contact with the rest of the community. It is practically impossible to prevent overcrowding of passengers on a quarantined vessel, and there is always grave danger that some may escape from quarantine and get amongst the people. If they do, it will then be of no use for the Government to try and camouflage the danger. If once this plague gets a hold in Australia, the Government and those responsible for quarantine administration will be subjected to the severest condemnation. </para>
                    <para>As far as Sydney is concerned - and I speak as one who endeavours to get the very best information - I can say that from one end of the city to the other there is, among well-informed people, entire dissatisfaction with the administration of our quarantine laws in relation to this plague. </para>

That has frequently occurred in the past, and the same thing might happen to-day. </para>

In view of the grave situation with which we are faced, this is a time for the closest inquiry into all statements made in connexion with this disease. We are not yet free of this plague. We should make no mistake about that.. We may be congratulating ourselves upon the fact that our preparations' have prevented the invasion of the disease. We may assume that the sanitary arrangements carried out by Commonwealth officials have been so good that we shall be able to prevent its invasion. I hope that they are so good. </para>

                    <para>The agitation going on now in Sydney for the removal of the Quarantine Grounds from their present position should appeal to every common-sense person. I do not agree that the Quarantine Station should be removed to the Naval College at Jervis1 Bay. The buildings at Jervis ' Bay were constructed for Navy purposes, and should be used for those purposes, and kept altogether free from disease ; but I do say that the little neck of land between Manly and the Heads is no place in which to quarantine thousands of people, as may be necessary, should many more vessels arrive in Sydney with passengers affected by this disease. </para>
                    <para>The Government should take steps to give the public confidence, and they should let the public know that they are doing something effective in connexion with quarantine against this disease. Personally, I have not much time for medical reports that are intended to reassure the people, unless it can be shown that they are well grounded. As a casual reader, I noticed in yesterday's newspapers, in the references to what was happening at the Quarantine Station at Sydney, that amongst those affected with the disease there were, I think I am correct in saying, six nursing sisters, if not more. I believe that the attention of the Quarantine authorities should at once be called to the fact, if it is a fact, that certain of the hospital staff called in to nurse the patients at the Quarantine Station have themselves, after being inoculated, become infected  with the disease. If inoculation is a failure as a means of prevention from infection by this disease, we should know it. We should not be led to believe that an absolute preventative is at hand if, after making use of it, those who might be expected to be most careful, and they are the attendants upon the patients, are being infected with the disease. </para>
                    <para>I do not care whether this disease be called pneumonic influenza or by any other name. We have only to read the newspaper reports of its ravages in other countries to know how serious it is. I glanced at a letter published in yesterday's <inline font-style="italic">Sun,</inline> dealing with the disease. I do not pretend to quote its exact words, but to state the impression which the perusal of it left on my mind. It was the letter of a lady to her brother from New Zealand, and it stated that in New Zealand they could not celebrate the armistice as we did in Australia, owing to the ravages of this disease, and to people dropping down in the streets faster than they could be buried. That statement was not written with a view to spreading panic, but appeared in a letter from a sister to a brother. The Government should not take any action in connexion with this matter which might have the effect of giving the public a false sense of security. Australia is threatened to-day with an invasion of the most dreadful disease that has ever threatened this community. I make that statement on information from people who are qualified to judge of its effects. The Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> will be well advised not only to listen to all criticisms on this subject, but to make his officers realize that the danger is' great, that the utmost energy is ' required on their part and that Australia will never be safe from the invasion of this disease until the whole of the quarantine authorities realize how serious the danger is. Criticisms of the work of the Quarantine Department must not be turned aside as the criticism of some smooth-tongued American, but must be fully investigated, and all necessary steps taken to preserve Australia from the invasion of this plague. </para>

If we can keep this disease out of Australia that will be of immense benefit to&gt; this community. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has said, the ravages of the disease in other parts of the world have been something extra ordinary. In New Zealand the whole community was thrown into a state of chaos, and only now the people there are beginning to resume their ordinary business. </para>

                    <para>However, I do not believe all the complaints that are made in connexion with quarantine, and I will tell honorable senators why. My son, with his wife and family of two young children, came out from Home in the <inline font-style="italic">Niagara.</inline> They were .quarantined for a week in New Zealand, were fumigated there, came on to Sydney, and were landed at the Quarantine Station, and stayed there a week. Thinking that they might be short of food, I arranged with a friend in Sydney to send along hampers to my son, as he might require them. But he telephoned to my friend to say that the food was splendid ; that he was in every way comfortable and as well treated as a man could be. He said that the inhalations were very trying, but he supposed that that could not be helped. He gave as satisfactory an account of the treatment of passengers by the authorities as could be wished for. I think that many of the complaints made on such occasions may not be true, but the Minister should have them all looked into and sifted to the bottom, because Australia will be faced with a great calamity if this disease gets a footing here. </para>
                    <para>I can quite understand our Sydney friends desiring the Quarantine Station there to be removed to some other place. I am not sufficiently acquainted with possible sites for a quarantine station for Sydney to be able to say to what locality the present station should be removed, but it is clearly unwise to have such plague spots established in large centres of population. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has said that Manly is being avoided at the present time, and I can quite imagine, that it is.  When we had the meningitis plague to contend against here many cases were treated at the Alfred Hospital, and on that account people were afraid to go along- Commercial-road There was a panic created by the effects of the disease, and people became very nervous on that account. I agree that it would be advisable to. remove the Sydney Quarantine Station from the present site. </para>
                    <para>The fact that they have been successful so far in preventing this disease from coming amongst us is, in my opinion, a great feather in the cap of the quarantine authorities, not only in Sydney, but in other parts of Australia. I think that they have done good work. Some of my medical friends say that the disease is of a most infectious character, and that it will be found impossible to keep it out of Australia. So far, happily we have been able to keep it out, and I hope that we shall be able to continue to do so. Every nerve should be strained by the Minister and his officials in the effort to keep it out, as if it gets a footing in Australia it will mean the loss of thousands of lives. </para>
                    <para>There seems to be some conflict in the statements which have been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Lambert,</inline> but I have always found that a man while in quarantine is in a most fractious state. I know that I was myself in such a state while in quarantine. It does not therefore surprise me that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Lambert</inline> while in quarantine should say one thing, and when out of quarantine and calm should say another. I do not think that it will be found, on inquiry, that such atrocities as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> has brought before us have occurred. I hope not; but I do say that if there is a scintilla of truth in the charges that have been made the persons responsible should be severely dealt with. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable senators seem to have overlooked the fact that Sydney has been built almost right down to the Quarantine Grounds. When the Quarantine Station was originally established at North Head there were very few houses in Mosman's Bay, or in the area around there, and comparatively few at Manly. I suppose that Manly to-day has a population of some 20,000 people. Mosman is a large suburb. There are a great number of houses around that area, and the same may be said of Watson's Bay. If the Parliament of the Commonwealth met in Sydney instead of in Melbourne, I venture to say that the Sydney Quarantine Station would not be allowed to remain where it is for very many days. The urgency of its removal does not appear to me to receive the attention from this Parliament that it ought to receive. The sooner the Quarantine Station is removed from North Head, Sydney, the better it will be, not only for the inhabitants of. that city, but for the entire population of the Commonwealth. At the present time, Sydney possesses a population of 600,000 or 700,000, and, should the plague make its appearance there, it will be very difficult to eradicate it. I am confident that the people of that city are almost unanimously behind the movement to secure the removal of the Quarantine Station from its present position at North Head. It must be recollected that that station is within a very few miles of the city itself. I thoroughly appreciate the work which has been done by the medical staff there in preventing the spread of the plague, and I hope that their efforts will continue to be successful. But I enter my protest against the continuance of the Quarantine Station in its present position. It should be removed without delay. </para>

                            <para>- When my remarks were interrupted, I was making a few observations in condemnation of the attack made by the Vice-President of the Executive Council upon the author of these complaints. The statements which I have previously read appear in the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Times</inline> of 1st December under very big headings. That journal has a larger circulation than has any other newspaper published in Australia. One may find it in New Guinea, in the islands of the Pacific, and even in London. The record which I have cited constitutes one of the most damnable indictments against the Government that can possibly be conceived. If this plague - and undoubtedly it is a plague, because the bodies of its victims become black within a few hours after death - spreads, it will be on account of the neglect of the Government to combat it with the most scientific methods. Were it once to obtain a footing in Sydney, it would speedily spread to Melbourne, and all over Australia. Only the beautiful expanse of water at Sydney and the splendid sunshine which obtains there, have hitherto prevented its spread. Had the scourge broken out in the north, it would, ere this, have been all over Australia. Great indignation prevails amongst the inhabitants of Sydney because of the persistent way in which the Commonwealth Government have ignored the request of the New South Wales Government to remove the Quarantine Station from its present position. If action be not taken in this direction shortly, I believe that people will burn the entire station - lock, stock, and barrel. </para>

We know that in normal times there" might, in case of an outbreak of disease like that of Spanish influenza, be forty or fifty ships ' in quarantine simultaneously.

                    <para>I enter my protest against the ineptitude of the Commonwealth Government to cope with this great scourge. I resent their want of courtesy in replying to the Government of New South Wales. I do not blame the doctors for their action in connexion with the outbreak. Personally, I would be prepared to submit to any precautionary measures to which they desired to subject me. When I went to Egypt they inoculated me for various diseases no less than twelve times. So long as they submitted to the same treatment, I offered no objection. I saw men around me attacked with all sorts of diseases, which did not attack me. I received some very excellent advice from one doctor, who told me never to drink water there unless I had something strong in it. I followed his advice to the letter, and probably that is what saved me. </para>
                    <para>I say that the Quarantine Station in Sydney is undermanned, and that the minutes of the meeting read by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>
                    <para class="block">Pratten amply prove my contention. Some complaint has been made of the method of inspection followed in Sydney. But, in most cases, this inspection is a farce, because of the lack of doctors to efficiently discharge the duty. I am sorry that the Vice-President of the Executive Council attempted to refute the charges which have been made in regard to the treatment of people in Sydney on the scanty information which he had. In reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reed's</inline> indictment regarding the bathing of women, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Lambert</inline> says he " has no personal knowledge." </para>

                    <para>To-day has been -proclaimed a public holiday by the State Government. A special issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Government Gazette</inline> yesterday announced the fact "in celebration of the signing of the armistice, terminating the international hostilities of the past four years." </para>
                    <para>The shops will be closed to-day, in consequence of the declaration of a public holiday. </para>
                    <para>No one worked yesterday, and few will work to-day. There has been a clash in the holiday arrangements made by the Federal and State authorities respectively. The Federal Government late on Monday night declared Tuesday a holiday, whereas the State Ministers favoured Wednesday, and did not learn the Federal intentions in time to alter the decision and give legal effect to a closing up on Tuesday. So the upshot is that the people of New South Wales will have two holidays. The mass of employees will not object - and the great occasion, if it comes to that, justifies a week's holiday - but it is a somewhat serious matter for business men, particularly those who deal in perishable goods. </para>

When I "was on the other side, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Keefe</inline> and others have suggested that I should assist in carrying on a " stone-wall," but they were able to see that I was the most abject failure that any Opposition has had to call upon for assistance in the matter of "stone-walling," and I have never been able, indeed, to acquit myself creditably in that direction. There is, in many quarters, an impression going round that parliamentary government is breaking down, and is a failure; and one thing which has led to that impression has been the tedious and tortuous manner in which Parliament has dealt with public business. </para>

                                <para>- I apply that to practically every Parliament in Australia. We have got into the way of making, and expecting, and listening to, long speeches on every conceivable topic, and that means that only one mind, namely, that of the inordinately long speaker, has an opportunity of expounding the matter at issue. We should take heed of the motto which appears upon the floor of the entrance hall to this Parliament - "In the multitude of counsellors there is wisdom." But where only one counsellor is heard upon a subject, it is quite clear that others, perforce, can say nothing. Our aim should be to encourage members of Parliament to express their views; and, if that is to be effectively carried out, wo must curtail the opportunities of those who take an excessive length of time in stating their opinions. </para>

                        <para>This is not an attempt to curtail debate. The new standing order will do more than anything else to encourage debate among a greater number of honorable senators. Towards the end of a session, practically every Bill becomes urgent; and, if one or two honorable senators make up their minds to try to block a certain measure, and to occupy hours in its debate, there certainly can be no wide discussion. </para>

                                <para>- That is what the standing order is intended to accomplish. The cruellest method of getting our business through is to compel honorable senators to sit up all night, and, by sheer physical exhaustion, to pass the measures under discussion.. It would be far better to adopt this form of limiting speeches. There is ample time, given under the proposed new standing order for an honorable senator to address himself to every matter under the sun, and to do so comprehensively. The proposal is no new thing. In the House of Representatives in the United States of America there is already a similar rule by which a member is entitled to speak for an hour, and may not speak more than once upon the same question. In Queensland, speeches are limited to forty minutes upon any debate, except on the Address-in-Reply, or upon a motion of want of confidence, where one hour is allowed. An exception to that is made in the case of a member moving the second reading, when he and the Leader of the Government, and the Leader of the Opposition, are allowed one and a-half hours each. In New Zealand, no member may speak for more than half-an-hour in any debate, except upon the Address-in-Reply, or upon a motion of want of confidence, or in the case of the mover of the second reading of a Bill, when one hour is allowed. In Committee, speeches are limited to ten minutes. I appeal to honorable senators generally to support the motion, which is not aimed at any particular side, but applies to both alike. It is in the interests of public business. </para>

                        <para>.-The explanation was given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> in moving the second reading. Briefly, it is as follows: As the law stands, when an Act is reprinted with amendments, it is not permissible to state in the citation clause how the Act, as amended, may be cited. For instance, in the reprint of the Defence Act 1903-1917, in the volume of Commonwealth Acts for 1917 (page 127), section 1 reads, " 1. This Act may be cited as the Defence Act 1903." It is explained in a note that the Defence Act 1903, as amended by the various subsequent Acts, may be cited as the Defence Act 1903-1917. The Bill will remove the necessity for putting in that footnote, and will make it possible to state in the Act itself how the principal Act, as amended, may be cited. It has been the practice for many years to reprint, with amendments, Acts which have been amended several times. In the case of the Defence Act already referred to, there were in 1917, in addition to the principal Act, nine amending Acts. Consequently, since this Act has been reprinted, one can ascertain the law by referring to the reprint, whereas previously it was necessary to refer to several Acts. In addition to being published in the volumes of Commonwealth Acts, these reprints are published separately, and can be bought at the Government Printing Office. This system saves much inconvenience to the public, and particularly to members of the legal profession. </para>

                        <para>. - The Act which we are now amending already provides for what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> is. contemplating.. It sets out that when a principal Act is amended, reprints of the Act after that date may be reprints of the Act as amended, so that it will be possible to refer to the measure in its complete, and amended form. This Bill merely provides- that the citation clause of -an original principal Act may be referred to in all subsequent Acts in the way explained by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> The moment- one sees the new citation, one's attention is drawn to the fact that there is more than one Act dealing with the subject, and when one looks at the completed amended form of the Act, the provisions of any intermediate Act are at once noticed in it by the different print in the marginal notes. </para>

                        <para>. -  I associate myself with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> in. asking for an explanation of this clause. I have no doubt it is quite clear to the gentleman who drafted it, but I have read it twice-, and the second time left me a little more confused than the first. The two explanations by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> only added to my confusion. The wording of the clause is not of the kind that we should have 'in our legisla*tion. Each sentence seems to repeat and complicate the previous sentence. We ought to aim at definite, clear draftsmanship. Although this is only a small Bill, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> deserves the thanks of. the Committee  for eliciting, explanations from Senators Pearce and Keating, which we shall probably understand much better when, we can. study them at leisure. </para>

                        <para>. - I think the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen),</inline> when moving the second reading of this Bill; said that it had been rendered necessary owing to some prosecutions which had been initiated against a manufacturer of " soft ''" drinks in consequence of an 'undue proportion of alcohol being discovered. I must confess that I am not familiar with the circumstances of the trade, but I believe that, although " soft" drinks may at the time of manufacture- not contain more than 2 per- cent, of- alcohol, they may become strongly alcoholic before the process of fermentation has been completed, and the intention of the Bill is to throw on the manufacturer the onus of proving that the article does not contain an undue proportion of alcohol. Another provision relates to the duty of manufacturers to see that Excise duty stamps are placed on the casks of beer, and to properly cancel them so as to prevent their use a second time. I know that in the past some hardship has been inflicted owing to a neglect of this precaution, but the Minister for Customs has usually met the case by a small fine. The Bill also seeks to increase the amount _ of the annual licence-fee for brewers, and provides that the large breweries must pay more in licence-fees than the proprietors of small concrns. The breweries in New South Wales could almost be counted on one's fingers, as the large companies have absorbed most of the smaller ventures. It is only in the country that one or two companies are able to stand up to the big concerns, and it is only right that larger breweries should pay more in licence-fees. There is also provision in the Bill to allow of the transfer, prior to the payment of duty, of beer from one, brewery to another. This, I understand, has been inserted to meet a difficulty experienced under the existing law, as at present it is not permissible for one brewery to get beer from another brewery. I have no doubt that the Bill will remedy a number of minor defects that have been disclosed in the working of the Act, and the object, I presume, is to obtain as much revenue as possible from all businesses, but I do not believe in getting this revenue from the "soft" drink manufacturers. I really think the Government ought to put a tax on teetotallers straight out. </para>

                    <para>I want honorable senators to understand clearly what it is that the Government propose to do. They intend to interfere, and they have been interfering all along, with the people in a way that I never believed the Federal Government would get down to. Honorable senators know, also, that if the Government will make an endeavour to deal with the beer and spirit question in a comprehensive manner, they will have my support. We should clearly understand just what it is proposed to do ; and by way of illustration I may,  perhaps, he permitted to refer to the amusement tax. I do not believe a single honorable senator on the other side believed that that tax would so operate that if a man went in to have a game of billiards in a saloon, or if a boy went down to any of our beaches and entered an enclosure for the purpose of enjoying a swim, he would be taxed. With our recent experiences of the looseness with which Government measures are drafted, I venture to say that the Senate should give more serious attention to measures brought before it. I have just given an illustration of what is likely to happen in regard to this Bill. The clause I refer to states that no beer shall be taken from a brewery in any vessel or case unless such vessel or case is marked in the manner prescribed. </para>

This has been done, hitherto, in very many centres where breweries are established, and there has been no injury to the revenue.

                    <para>I have a vivid recollection of what happened to a man engaged in another line of business some years ago. Ignorant of the law - although I know ignorance of the law cannot be pleaded as any excuse - he started the cultivation of the tobacco plant. Finally, he commenced the manufacture of cigars, and exhibited them at the district show. A man who could make cigars and tobacco in that way soon established a business, but an Excise officer came down upon him, and he was heavily fined. The Excise officer was, no douibt, carrying out the law, but the law should not have made such a thing possible. This occurred under a law for which a State Government was responsible. The Government was more intelligent than is the present Federal Government, but it was still not sufficiently intelligent to amend provisions of the law which discouraged the local manufacture of tobacco and cigars. Of course, there was sufficient public spirit in the community to raise enough money to meet the fine. </para>
                    <para>What will happen under this Bill to men who make a practice of carrying home a quart of beer in their billy-cans for their evening meal, when they find out that under the Russell Act this practice will have to be stopped? The first time some of them are caught they will probably shake their heads and say, " And we helped to put him where he is." They may say that they thought that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> was a man who would not go out of his way to deliberately interfere with people in this way. The constituents of Senators Shannon, Keating, de Largie, and Earle - though I have some doubt about <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Earle's</inline> case - may express themselves in similar terms. The returned soldiers in Queensland may change their opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> when they find that in his first session in Parliament he has assisted the Government in the passing of such a Bill as this. They may feel disappointed with the honorable senator. They probably believed, when he was returned, that he would ultimately develop into a good old Tory, but they might be excused for considering that he would be able to stand his environment for one session of Parliament. No doubt our constituents would expect support of such a measure from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and from myself: </para>
                    <para>I seriously ask honorable senators not to hurry through these provisions imposing £50 penalties. They may be recorded against some innocent and unoffending person, who may have no desire to break the law of the country, because of the action of some officious and over-zealous Excise officer. I have personally no great respect for the police force, who have permitted me to enjoy so much liberty when they might have adopted another course, but we must not shut our eyes to the fact that there may be one in a hundred Excise officers who will read this measure in the narrowest possible way. When that occurs, trouble will arise under it. I ask honorable senators to insist that the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> shall give some reason why this measure should be passed. It contains about half-a-dozen different principles, one of which the Minister has explained. I suppose that, feeling buttressed with the support of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> who is prepared to carry on the war upon beer as vigorously as he has carried out the work of the Defence Department, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> considers that honorable senators will accept this measure with very few words from him. He should give a little consideration to the difficulties which may arise in the case of employees of  a  brewery. I do not suppose that, with  a  view to increasing the revenue, the Government will send an officer into every brewery, and prevent an employee obtaining a glass of beer until Excise duty is paid upon it. Will the Government expect the manager of a billiard saloon to certify as to the number of games played in his saloon, and the exact amount of tax he is, therefore, called upon to pay? I warn honorable senators that they should be careful in passing legislation of this kind. </para>

The Collector of Customs is practically the administrator of the Customs Department in each State. Under the existing Act, the Comptroller, who is really in charge of the central administration, is not included in the definition of " Collector " for the purposes of this measure.

                            <para>- When the sitting was suspended I was pointing out that under our Constitution full power is reserved to the several States to deal with intoxicating liquors within their own boundaries. Each State has full power to regulate the brewing of these' liquors within its own borders, and if this Parliament attempted to deprive it of 'that power the attempt would prove to he abortive. ' Were it otherwise, no State would have the power, if it wished to 'do so, to establish prohibition. But it is ©pen to any State to enforce prohibition, and it may seek to attain that result .by imposing a prohibitive tax on the brewing of beer, or by levying -a prohibitive licence-fee. I have already pointed out that section 8 of the principal Act provides that no person: shall make beer unless he is licensed - to do so under that Act, " or under a licence already granted under some 'State .Act." I understand that the reason the Government wish to strike out from that provision in the -principal Act the -words " or under a licence already granted under some State Act " is that the- State licences have expired. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. They cease to have effect at the end of the year unless they are renewed. I take it that the proposal now before us is not an attempt to deprive any State of its rights to subject the brewing of beer to any imposition that it may think fit. Should any State hereafter superimpose upon the licence-fee provided in this Bill a fee of its own, there will, I presume, be no&gt; attempt on the part of the Commonwealth Government to assert that it has exclusive jurisdiction in  this matter. In other words, though we are now about to affirm that nobody shall hereafter brew beer unless he is licensed to do so under this measure, we realize that any State,, if it chooses to do so, may impose an additional obligation upon the brewer to take out a licence within the State itself. </para>

                            <para>- But it has occurred to me that the draftsman of the Bill may be under the impression that the State cannot "butt in" upon this question. As a matter of fact, it can do so. If we levy a licence-fee of £100 upon the brewer of beer, any State may, if it so desires, levy a licence-fee of £5,000. So long as it is clearly understood that we are not attempting to assert an exclusive jurisdiction in this matter, but have in 'mind- section 113 of the Constitution, I have nothing more to say. </para>

                    <para class="block">I have many, reasons for submitting this proposal. In my judgment, the persons who run these breweries are not prepared to pay their fair share of our war expenditure, but desire to put it on to the shoulders of the working class. Consequently, when we have an opportunity of " handing it out " to them, we ought not. to neglect it. At the present time, in two constituencies in New South Wales, there is a strike in progress against the price of beer. The brewers are always ready to put an extra penny upon the poor man's glass of beer. What will be the effect of my amendment if carried ? It will stop brewing in Australia. That is my object in submitting it. </para>

Now, if any honorable senator wishes to throw out a direct challenge to the liquor traffic by means of a motion in favour of straight-out prohibition, I shall have no objection to urge against it. But this is merely a machinery measure, which is designed to raise revenue from that traffic. The larger question which has been raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> can better be discussed on a specific motion. May I also suggest that it would be preferable to raise that question just prior to a general election so that the people might be afforded an opportunity of expressing their views upon it. To tack his proposal on to an innocent-looking measure of this character is certainly not the way in which we ought1 to deal with a big public question. </para>

                    <para class="block">This measure is somewhat similar to one or two others having to do with the Customs Department, and which have been already dealt with. When Acts such as these were passed originally, some seventeen years ago, there were still such things as Interstate border duties; and there were various State enactments. This Bill and similar measures are intended merely to clear up the position, and to simplify administration on the part of Excise and Customs officers, in order to adequately protect revenue. In this Bill there are no <inline font-style="italic">new</inline> principles involved, except in regard to industries which, as they grow, require greater expenditure in affording Government supervision. It has been laid down that, wherever services are rendered in connexion with supervision for revenue purposes, the cost of such inspection should be fully borne by the industry itself. That is to say, the industry should carry its own expenses. </para>
                    <para>In this Bill there are also provisions relating to several minor matters. For instance, it is proposed to exempt from the provisions relating to licensing stills of a capacity not exceeding 1 gallon. There are private stills of this kind which are used purely for scientific or experimental purposes. At present, it is necessary for the owners to secure permission to use those stills; and, if they desire to do so for purposes other than the distillation of spirits, they must lodge security that the stills will not be used for distilling spirits. There is a section in the Act which apparently had its origin in an old fear that the brewer might be getting his spirits by some subterranean channel. It relates to pipes and tubes in a distillery, and imposes a restriction. At present, every pipe and tube, when placed below the surface of the ground, must be enclosed in a wooden case capable of being readily opened, so that the pipe or tube may be exposed to view. It is proposed in the present measure to give power in special cases, where there can be no possible danger to the revenue, to waive this requirement. </para>

                <para>This is another measure having exactly the same objects as that with which the Senate 'has just been dealing; but it is also intended to clear up a certain matter arising from a Court decision. The principal amendment relates to the improper use of methylated spirits. Apart from its use for human consumption in alcoholic beverages, alcohol is employed a great deal for industrial 'purposes; and, while it is a proper subject for taxation when used for human consumption, it is not advisable that it should be taxed when employed industrially, because alcohol for such purposes should be obtainable as . cheaply as possible. At the same time, of course, revenue must be safeguarded, and the difficulty is to exempt from duty alcohol when used for industrial purposes, without leaving a loop-hole through which the revenue may be defrauded. The method1 by which that difficulty is met in the principal Act is that spirit for industrial and scientific purposes is exempt from duty when denatured with certain nauseous and poisonous substances which render it unfit for drinking. When the spirit is so denatured it is called methylated spirit, and it is free from duty; but the untreated spirit is subject to a duty of 16s. per proof gallon. No one should take exception to the raising of revenue in that regard. E'ut to place an Excise duty of 16s. a gallon on industrial alcohol would be an undue tax upon industry. The denaturing substance most  commonly used is wood naphtha, the principal ingredient of which is  methyl  alcohol. In a recent prosecution in connexion with the use of methylated spirits in the preparation of a medicine for human use, the evidence showed the presence of methyl- alcohol; tout the Court ruled that although methyl alcohol was . a constituent part of wood naphtha, the latter was the  methylating  substance prescribed by the regulations, audi, as the Court would not accept the fact of the presence of methyl alcohol as proof of the use of wood naphtha, the prosecution failed. The result of that decision was to render practically useless the provision made to safeguard the revenue against the improper use of methylated spirits; and, in order to make this provision efficient for the purpose for which it was intended, the Bill proposes to alter the definition of " methylating substance" so that it shall include not only the principal substance specified as a methylating substance, but also any ingredients of any such substance. </para>

                <para class="block">Wales)  [8.23]. - I am heartily in favour of the Bill. We should protect the industries of the country, and this is an industry which has had very little protection in the past. There have been various efforts to make steel and galvanized sheets in New South Wales, but the objection which has been farcically taken, in my view, is that that product could not be used for fear that it would not last, and that it could not be equal to the imported article. An industry such as this should be given a fair chance. A bounty is not like a duty. It is spread over the whole community. </para>
                <para>One objection which I have to the Bill is contained in the clause which deals with the reduction of the bounty where the profits exceed 15 per cent. I would like to see the limit set down at 10 per cent. Objection may be taken that a manufacturer has laid! out much capital on machinery, but he would be able to advance the same argument in regard to a limit of 15 per cent, as to one of 10 per cent. </para>

                        <para>. - The proposal contained in the Bill to give a bounty on sheet iron manufactured from imported sheet bar steel, requires further consideration. I can quite understand the desirability of giving a bounty to those who manufacture galvanized iron or sheet iron from locally produced ores; but when it comes to granting a bounty for merely transforming imported bars, it appears to be a subject requiring very careful consideration. It is proposed to devote, altogether, a sum of £200,000 to the industry, and while this may be the best way, in the opinion of the Government, to secure the firm establishment of this very necessary work, it would be much better if the Government themselves took in hand the importation of the requisite machinery and manufactured the products themselves. After the £'200,000 has been expended the only advantage that I can see will be the somewhat reasonable certainty of the continued production of these commodities in Australia. During the currency of the war the selling price of galvanized iron has so greatly advanced that it is now problematical what one would require to pay for it. Some time ago the Government published a regulation under the War Precautions Act, fixing the price of galvanized iron at £56 per ton. I do not know whether that regulation is still in force, but, presumably, it is. Whether or not, however, I have noticed advertisements in the daily press in Sydney announcing that galvanized iron is for sale at prices very much in excess of the amount prescribed. In effect, the regulation appears to be a dead letter. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>It may not be widely known that for many years galvanized iron was manufactured at Lithgow. Not only was the iron rolled into thin sheets, but it was corrugated and galvanized, and, in every way it was proved as suitable and as good as any imported article. Why that industry was discontinued I do not know. </para>
                    <para class="block">I suggest to the Government that the Bill should be withdrawn, and that they should consider the question of establishing works which will be their own property. If the Bill is passed, I trust the clause which makes the bounty conditional on fair and reasonable rates of wages being paid will be rigidly enforced. In the event of the £40,000 allocated yearly not being mopped up in any one year, it is provided that the unclaimed balance may be paid in any other year, so that we may be faced with a payment of £150,000 during the last year of the life of the Bill. It also appears that altogether a bounty of £3 10s. per ton may be payable on the finished article. The other provisions may be necessary to give effect to the principle of the measure, but I would much rather see the Government construct works themselves, and directly control the industry. </para>

                    <para>Unless that amendment is made, manufacturers may claim the bounty for goods manufactured, not from Australian ore, but from imported sheet bar steel. That is entirely foreign to the wishes of those who are anxious to assist in the expansion of Australian industries. If the Government agree to the amendment, it will lead to a much greater manufacture of Australian productions. I shall be glad to hear the Minister explain the object of the provision. </para>

                        has raised this question. I agree with what he said, and personally would not be prepared in ordinary circumstances to give a bounty on goods manufactured from imported iron, but unless some provision of this sort is made it will hardly be possible to induce any one to go into the industry which we desire to encourage. Without mentioning names, at the present time any one who wanted to make these goods from Australian iron would be practically dependent on one company. If that company attempted to put up the price of the raw material to the secondary manufacturer - I do not say it would do so - it might be as well to open the door to the imported article for a month or two, in order to bring the company to its senses. This is one of the effective ways that we shall have of checking abuses. I hope there will be two companies starting right away to manufacture under this Bill; but if we tell them that they must buy all their stuff from the one company that now exists in Australia, irrespective of what that company likes to charge, neither they nor anybody else are likely to be induced to make a start.

This provision is really a protection against any local monopoly forcing the price up so as to obtain the bounty or profit that should go to the manufacturer of these articles.

We learn that a considerable sum has been paid for the option to the people who have been allowed to hold those leases for about twenty years, much to the surprise of most of the people of Tasmania.The parties concerned have  succeeded in inducing successive Governments in. that State to allow them a suspension of the labour covenants, for reasons which. I suppose, those Governments deemed good enough... Those deposits were said by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Montgomery,</inline> once Government. Geologist of Tasmania, and now in the. employ of the Western Australian Government, who is esteemed one of the best men in his line in the world, to be equal to almost anything known anywhere for quantity and quality. </para>

                            <para>- I - I suppose they have a better supply nearer at hand. It is supposed that some fairly heavy shareholders in the Broken Hill Proprietary have been the main shareholders in the Blythe River iron leases for a good many years. The Minister may be able to tell us whether the Government, having acquired the option, have any intention of establishing iron works as a Federal proposition. Constitutional difficulties may arise, but if they do, the Government can always propose an amendment of the Constitution to give them the necessary power. If they do not intend to enter into the business, what are they going to do with those leases, and why have they paid a fairly large sum to acquire an option over them? </para>

                            <para>- Let us be thanks ful for small beginnings. Any Government that thinks well of Australia must recognise that the iron and steel industries are the basis of all other industries. I have no complaint to make about the one company now operating in Australia, but no country should have all its eggs in the one basket. Under ordinary conditions I would refuse to vote for a bounty for an industry which merely imported iron and converted it, but I am prepared to give the Minister power to check any attempt that may be made to cripple subsidiary industries-, which depend on the basic industry of iron and steel, by forcing up prices against them. I do not infer that the existing company is likely to do anything of the kind, but where national interests are involved we should make assurance doubly sure by protecting them. </para>

We should lay down the principle that bounty should be paid only on products manufactured from Australian ores. The reason given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> for the provision is the very reason why it should not be included, because it means giving protection to the secondary industry and not to the primary industry, which is the production of steel from ore. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister's argument is absolutely against the basic principle of supporting the primary industry first. If we want to establish these secondary industries in Australia, we must support the primary industry of producing iron and steel from our own ores. If there is only one company engaged in that work, it can easily be regulated by providing that it must sell its product at a fair price. I believe it will do so, because it will produce so much that it will have to export. </para>

                        <para>. - I shall support the amendment because it should be the function of this Parliament to render all the assistance possible to the development of our primary industries, chief among which is that of iron production. If the bounty is extended to goods produced from imported iron and steel, it is certain that the Australian iron industry will suffer in consequence. T cannot understand why the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> does not accept the proposal, which appears to me to be a sound one. Reference has been made to the probable output of a certain mine in Tasmania, which is to be subjected to an exhaustive test, and I sincerely hope that the results will be equal to the expectations of the most sanguine person interested in it. It is very satisfactory to know that the Commonwealth Government have taken an interest in this industry, and it is equally satisfactory to know that the various State Governments are also active in this matter. ' The Tasmanian Government have already withdrawn a number of iron ore deposits from application under the mining laws of that State. The Government, we have been told, contemplate bringing an expert from the Old Country, or some other part of the world, to report upon the Blythe River iron deposits. No doubt they will get a very good man. There is no doubt, also, that in Australia they could get fifty men equally as good and capable of making as accurate a geological survey, and as exhaustive a test, as any expert from the other side of the world can furnish to the Government. If it were a question of developing and opening up these deposits on well-established lines, followed with regard to big iron ore deposits in other parts of the world, we could understand the policy of the Government; but in every Geological Department of Australia there are at least one or two men just as skilled as any imported man can be, but, unfortunately, they are not to he given a chance to display their ability. "We shall all be glad to do what we can to assist the industry, but the efforts of the Government should not be concentrated upon any particular mine. We should not regard this industry as belonging to one State, but as an industry affecting the welfare of the whole Commonwealth. There are other deposits to which attention might be directed. Today I addressed a letter to the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> asking that when the examination of the Blythe River iron deposits have been completed the necessary steps may be taken to have a test examination made of another deposit that I have named, and which, I have no hesitation in saying, in richness of ferro-oxide and in the absence of phosphoric acid, equals any deposit in any other part of the world. Honorable senators will see, therefore, how important it is that the application of the principle involved in this Bill should he as wide as possible, so that where a deposit of iron is known to exist, every assistance may be rendered to those who have been engaged in its development for some considerable time past. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will see his way clear to accept the amendment, which will limit the application of this bounty to steel produced from Australian iron. That ought to be the first consideration of this Parliament. We ought to see that every effort is made to place our own industries on as- permanent a footing as possible. If the bounty is to be extended to steel produced from imported  iron, we shall have very keen competition from overseas. </para>

                        <para>. -  I cannot support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant's</inline> proposal. The explanation given by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> is simple, and covers all the ground. The primary object of the Bill is to give a bounty upon black steel sheets manufactured from Australian iron ore and steel manufactured in Australia. That is its main purpose; but as the Minister has pointed out, the manufacture of iron and steel ore has not yet attained any very great dimensions in Australia. As a matter of fact, there are only two manufacturers, I believe, and to all intents and purposes, when we speak of them comparatively, there is only one. The Minister foresees the possibility that a company manufacturing iron and steel ore in Australia, realizing that the bounty is to be given upon, say, galvanized iron sheets made from their ore, might impose onerous conditions upon persons desirous of obtaining the bounty. He does not say they will do so, but conceives that it is quite possible that, having an existing monopoly which secures to them the purchase of their iron and steel ore by any other person who desires to secure the bounty, they may put up their prices or make their terms of supply so difficult that the object of the Bill ' might be defeated. In circumstances such as those - and such circumstances may assume varying forms not yet probably in contemplation - it is impossible to lay down a hard and fast rule for the guidance of the Minister in the exercise of the discretion proposed to be reposed in him. It is provided, therefore, that the bounty shall be given in respect of black steel sheets made from Australian iron ore and steel manufactured in Australia, or from such imported sheet bar steel as is authorized in section 3, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> has just read. In the event of such circumstances arising; in the event of the raw material produced in Australia being withheld from a manufacturer who desires to secure this bounty, the Minister, after full inquiry into all the circumstances, will have authority to let a little imported raw material in, to be used, until the manufacturer having a monopoly of black steel sheets from Australian iron ore, comes to his senses. If the Minister exercises his power unfairly or discriminatingly, and to the disadvantage of a primary industry of the Commonwealth, this Parliament can deal with him. The main purpose of the Bill is to secure the bounty for a new industry, to be founded on an existing primary industry in the Commonwealth. So long as a primary industry acted loyally by a subsidiary industry, there would be no need for the Minister- to exercise the power which it is proposed iri this clause to invest him with ; but if, for some unforeseen reason, the primary industry did not turn out the necessary raw material for the subsidiary industry, if there were a block in supplies, the Minister could be trusted to allow the importation of the necessary raw material for the subsidiary industries which it is proposed by this Bill to establish and secure. The Minister is responsible to this Parliament, and I think can be intrusted with the administration of the measure.___  i </para>

                            amendment raises another question. The iron ore having been smelted becomes the base upon which the secondary industry of the production of steel sheets depends, and the production of the steel sheets -becomes in turn the base for the production of galvanized iron sheets. It is possible that all. the operations may not be confined to one firm.
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline>
                            suggests that where the steel sheets are produced from imported bar steel, the bounty should not be granted, and it has occurred to me that by clause 13 the Minister would be restricted in such a way that he would be unable to differentiate as to the bounties paid upon galvanized iron made from sheets produced in Australia from Australian ore and that made from imported sheet bar steel. I think it would be wise if provision were made for a lower bounty on galvanized iron produced from imported sheet bar steel than for galvanized iron produced from steel sheets made in Australia.

                    <para class="block">Trade, who have studied the matter with the advantage of evidence taken by. the Inter-State Commission. After careful inquiry, it was. decided that the bounty should be £4 or £4 10s.,according to freight on black steel sheets' and galvanized. sheets. The alternative would appear to be to give a bounty that would not be required. It is proposed, under this Bill, to give the full amount of bounty required to establish the industry in Australia. We are operating in war times now, and can do a number of things which could not be done in normal times. To establish this industry by one or two firms may cost anything up to £250,000. The only object of clause 2, as has been explained is to prevent a monopoly in. the production of the raw material, squeezing the manufacturer engaged' in this industry. I have heard it said that it is possible to regulate a monopoly. I hope that we shall soon have power to do so; but until the Constitution is amended we shall not have that power. The industry has to be established in such a way that it may be carried on under the limitations of the Constitution, and under the normal conditions which, we trust, will exist 'before long. Clauses 2 and 3 provide the best policeman which could be devised by those who have considered this problem to effectively protect the secondary industry proposed to be established, and prevent it becoming dependent entirely upon any monopoly. I ask honorable senators to allow the Bill to pass as it stands. It may not be perfect; but it is a genuine: effort on the part of the Government to establish in this country a very important industry. </para>

                        <para>. - I intend to support the amendment. We are considering a Bill to provide for the payment of bounties on the manufacture of black steel sheets and galvanized sheets in the Commonwealth. The object of the measure is to encourage and foster an Australian industry, and I have always been prepared to vote for a bounty for that purpose. I support the amendment after hearing the argument adduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> who has put up the bogy of a monopoly being created if the amendment be carried. I agree with the Minister that, under our Constitution, we cannot control monopolies; but I point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> and to the Minister that the final clause of this Bill provides a protection against the suggested monopoly that can be made use of even without an amendment of the Constitution. Clause 13 provides that- </para>

I cannot understand why the Government should propose the payment of a bounty on imported material of this kind. This is an island continent blessed by nature with all the resources necessary for the manufacture of everything essential to its development. The Government propose under this Bill a means of encouraging the production and manufacture of Australian iron ore. But at the same time they leave the door open for the imported material. </para>

                            <para>- That is so; but it would give the Government all the power they would require under this Bill. I hope that the Committee will agree to the amendment, because I desire that the bounty shall be paid only to Australian people for the production of Australian material. If material is imported from abroad we have another remedy to meet the difficulty. We can amend our Tariff by increasing the duties upon it, but we should not open the door wider than it is now under the Tariff to importations of this material. </para>

                            <para>-Colonel  O'LOGHLIN  (South Australia) [9.15].  -  It is evident that we are all agreed in our desire to support this Bill, the object of which is to establish an entirely Australian industry - an industry which will be Australian . from the ore itself, to the completed article. But it seems to me that, under the amendment which we are now considering, one or two companies, which practically enjoy a monopoly of the iron industry to-day, would be able to defeat its very purpose. If, for example, the companies already in existence- decide to undertake the manufacture of galvanized sheets, and other companies, which may be formed especially to embark upon this particular enterprise, apply to them for the requisite raw material, they may be met with a refusal, to supply it or charged a prohibitive price. The result would be that the existing companies would be able to maintain not only a monopoly of the raw material, but also a monopoly of the manufactured article. At the same time, I think it would be wise to provide that the Minister, before permitting the importation of sheet bar steel, should be required to state his reasons to both Houses of Parliament. I cannot supportSenator Grant's amendment, because, conceivably, it might defeat the object of the Bill. </para>

                    <para class="block">State of the Commonwealth. Many years will probably elapse before more iron works are established in our midst for the purpose of manufacturing iron out of our iron ores. But the object of this Bill is not to sanction the payment of a bounty upon the production of iron ore, but to encourage the manufacture of galvanized iron. Now, if we are going to have that article produced in any places other than Newcastle or Lithgow, it is absolutely necessary that this clause should be carried in its present form. The manufacture of iron from Australian ore is now practically a monopoly. If a company were established in Western Australia for the purpose of manufacturing galvanized iron- and the plant required for this particular work is not large or costly - it would be obliged to obtain its raw material either from Newcastle or Lithgow. In such circumstances, the freight added to the price of the iron would be practically prohibitive. That is the reason why I imagine a pseudo Free Trader like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> wishes to see this amendment carried - to create a monopoly in New South Wales. </para>

                            <para>- In Committee, I moved to omit from clause 2 the words " or such imported sheet bar steel as is authorized in pursuance of section 3 of this Act." In doing so, I was actuated solely by a desire to prevent the payment of bounty upon galvanized iron and black steel sheets made from imported material. My object was not to secure the creation of a monopoly in New South Wales. As a matter of fact, I have very little respect for State boundaries. In these circumstances, I felt . that my opinions were being misrepresented, and my motives wrongly twisted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, who had evidently determined to place upon my views a construction which was absolutely incorrect. I appealed to the  Chairman  of Committees to protect me from those insinuations and gross misrepresentations on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie,but the  Chairman  held that the honorable senator was entitled to impute motives to me, namely, that really I was advancing this amendment in order that New South Wales might have a monopoly. As nothing of that kind was in my mind, and as the statements were untrue, I dissented from the Chairman's ruling; and I ask, in the circumstances, that you, sir, will not support the  Chairman,  but will declare that he was utterly wrong in the decision which he arrived at. </para>

But I have nothing to do with any offensive statement that may have been made, because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> has not called it into question in his written dissent from the ruling of the Chair. The honorable senator's complaint is that the  Chairman  did not compel <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie to withdraw the imputation of a motive. The whole question arises whether there was the imputation of an improper motive or not. I am walling to leave it to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> himself to decide whether it was improper to impute that by his actions he was standing up for the State of New South Wales. </para>

I would like to leave  it  to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> himself. My opinion is that it is not improper for any honorable senator to stand up for the benefits and advantages and the welfare of the State which he represents. I say so candidly. While recognising the duty that an honorable senator owes to the whole of Australia, I; personally, hold that it is only right that he should have his eye open to the best advantages which can be afforded the State which he particularly represents, and an insinuation that he was doing so, I would not regard as being an imputation of an improper motive. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> thinks that the imputation of the motive that he was supporting a benefit for his own State is an improper one, then I shall rule that the  Chairman  was not  in  order in refusing to compel <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie to withdraw the expression which he employed. </para>

                    <para>If a private firm, engaged in the manufacture of pig iron from Australian ore, were to attempt to carry on business in any other State than New South Wales, it would be impossible, owing to the fact of a monopoly being held by one big firm. I have tried to show the fallacy of the matter, but Iamsorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> was notable to grasp the meaning of my arguments. Knowing SenatorGrant as I do, I am not surprised at that. What I am pleading for is a fair deal for all the States, and not for a monopoly for New South Wales.

                            <para>- I have pointed out that the plant required would not necessarily be very expensive, and that, if the industry were confined to the use of iron made from Australian ore, that would preclude any rolling mills from being established in any other State than New South Wales. And to secure such an extension of the industry this Bill has been framed. If we preclude the possibility of the use of imported bar iron for this purpose, we shall defeat the object in view, and create a monopoly in New South Wales. That would be quite wrong. Consumers in the other States would have to pay for the monopoly established in one State only. I, for one, shall not agree to such a proposition. I shall endeavour' to see that a fair deal is given to the industries of Western Australia. They would suffer if the iron could only be secured from New South Wales. </para>

                        <para>. - I listened with great attention to the arguments of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> and to the explanations of the Minister in support of the clause as it stands. But those arguments have not made the slightest impression upon me. I do not propose to withdraw my amendment. Most honorable senators will remember that not many years ago, when the Commonwealth required a supply of steel rails for the transcontinental line, the iron manufacturers around the world combined forces, and agreed to supply those rails only at a certain fixed price. I do not imagine that the mental acuteness of the iron manufacturers of the world has been dulled by the war. I have in mind that, while there may be a large company established in New South Wales at present, there is just a possibility that it may work in harmony with the importers of iron. And, if we concede to that company the right to claim a bounty from the Commonwealth on imported manufactured iron, what is to stop the company from importing iron ? It may be easier for it to import iron than for the manufacturers to do so. To some honorable senators that may be a most desirable objective, but I venture to think it is not the objective behind this Bill. The idea of the Bill is to see that iron and iron ores procurable in Australiaare manufactured into the finished article. If we give a bounty on the article manufactured from imported iron or steel bars, we shall open the door wide to the two industries', at present established in New South Wales, to imports. If I were a big shareholder in one of those companies, and saw the door opened in that manner, and could make more money by the importation of partly manufactured material, I should avail myself of it as much as possible. That is not the intention of the Bill. It is not to be supposed that those who have put their money into the primary industry will be so unreasonable as to charge extortionate prices to the secondary producer. I do not agree that expensive machinery is not required for the manufacture of sheet iron, for I am informed on very good authority that the cost is fairly substantial, that the manufacture of the necessary machinery and plant is a matter of considerable expense, and that we need not expect to see many of these concerns established in the Commonwealth for some time to come. For these reasons, and with the desire to see Australian ores made into the finished article, I submit that it would be far better to make some arrangement with the companies, which have already shown their willingness to manufacture iron and steel from local ores, to supply their finished article to the Commonwealth Government or other companies at a fixed price. Australia has suffered in innumerable directions ever since the war began on account of the exceptionally high cost of galvanized iron. Probably nothing has caused such a deadlock in business as the scarcity and high price of that article. If my amendment is carried, I am satisfied that the companies' now extracting iron from Australian ore, and manufacturing it up to a certain point, will not charge excessive prices for their products to other companies which desire to manufacture subsidiary articles. </para>

                    <para class="block">He seemed to think that the amendment was framed purely in the interests of New South Wales, and that the fact that iron works were already established there would give that State a monopoly if the bounty were paid only on sheet iron wholly produced "in the Commonwealth. Iron works in countries where cheap labour is available can undoubtedly land here a much cheaper sheet iron than can be produced in the high-wage State of New South Wales. If imported iron from Japan and other cheap labour centres is put on the same footing as the locally produced iron, it will push it off the market. If that happens, we shall simply be paying a huge bounty to certain firms to galvanized imported sheets. I am not a Protectionist, and this war has made me more a Free Trader than ever. I have seen the iron monopolists of Australia hand their iron manufacturing concerns, brought into existence by means of" bounties paid from hard-earned taxes of the people, over to a combine of merchants to charge the users pounds and pounds above the normal value of their products. Iron which was selling at £9 per ton was up to £28 a few months after the war had started, the people being plundered by the very businesses that were brought into existence with their own money. </para>

If the bounty ' is given on sheets imported from abroad, and galvanized in Australia, the galvanizing process will give ana mount of work that is hardly worth considering. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie admits that the galvanizing plant is not very costly. He says those plants may be set up in Western Australia or Tasmania for that reason, but that if the promoters are compelled to obtain their raw material from New South Wales alone, they will be prevented from going into the business, because the monopolists in New South Wales can put the prices up. </para>

                    <para>Before any bounties are granted, a Bill of this kind should provide that no arrangement shall be entered into by the primary producers of iron with any firms or merchants to increase the price of their product; but that it must be sold at a reasonable profit upon the cost of production. The Lithgow company, who have been subsidized for years by the Commonwealth, were actually selling their scrap, which is the cut-off ends, to the manufacturers and users of iron. The combine of merchants, with which the company were acting in co-operation, objected, because this practice interfered with the profits of their business, the scrap being purchaseable at about half the merchants' prices. You could not get any of these businesses, which the people have paid to create, to sell directly to the man who wanted to use their products for manufacturing purposes. You could not get Hoskins to sell to a large engineering or blacksmithing concern. He sells to the combine which he has agreed to sell to, and the combine put on exorbitant prices. Thus everything has gone up, and during the war the combine has exploited Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> is coming right down to bedrock in saying that we must not give huge bounties to iron made in America, Japan, or elsewhere, and merely galvanized in Australia. That would simply mean establishing businesses for the importation of iron to come into competition with our primary iron producers, and with the great iron deposits of Tasmania and New South Wales. There may be equally good iron deposits in Western Australia. </para>

                            <para>- That is true. I said I was more of a Free Trader than ever; but we are getting somewhat mixed in this Chamber. Here we have old Protectionists, such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, proposing to open the door for the importation of iron, and accusingSenator Grant, as an old Free Trader, of trying to introduce a system of Protection. I shall vote with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant,</inline> whether his proposal is Free Trade or Protection, because his amendment goes far in the direction of giving the bounty to the wholly Australian product, and not to a product which is nine-tenths foreign and one-tenth Australian. </para>

                        <para>.- Will the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> explain the exact  meaning  of the term "sheetbar steel''?  I  have not seen it used before. There  is  a reference in the Bill to steel sheets made from sheet bar steel, and not exceeding one-sixteenth of an inch in thickness. It seems to me that all we are doing in opening the door, so far as the Minister's approval is concerned, is to allow the importation of steel bars into Australia, to be rolled in Australia into black sheets, and subsequently galvanized. It has been suggested in the debate that there is likely to be a big importation of steel sheets ready for galvanizing. I do not read that meaning into the Bill at all. It simply gives the Minister authority at his discretion,  should  circumstances  warrant it, to allow  the importation of bar steel.  It  is not right to assume that clause 3, which has a vital bearing on the  clause now before  us, will open  the door to the importation  of steel sheets of 24, 26, and 28-gauge, ready for galvanizing and corrugating into the article which is so largely used by primary producers all over Australia. </para>

I trust the Minister will accept the reasonable proposition I have now submitted. If he should desire to make such a departure by authorizing the importation of sheet bar steel, he will, under this proviso, lay the reasons before Parliament, and if they are sound and sensible there will be no objection to them by the Senate. Should they not be satisfactory, however, both Houses of Parliament will have an opportunity of expressing an opinion. </para>

                        <para>- No. The amendment as at present before the Committee merely provides that the reasons shall be laid upon the table. We know what that means. We have provided that our statutory rules shall be laid upon the table of the. House within fifteen sitting days if Parliament is sitting, but I point out that eight days have gone by since a statutory rule was promulgated, and it has the effect of law to-day. If I called a public meeting against the wish of any military officer who wrote an order under that rule, I and anybody attending that meeting would be arrested. Although the spirit of the Act provides that, if Parliament is sitting, statutory rules shall be laid before Parliament for approval or disapproval, I cannot disapprove of this rule, because it has not been laid on the table of the Senate. I rose to complain that the amendment gives us nothing, because, as I have already shown, the Minister could furnish the Senate with any reason he liked, and as the amendment is drafted, the Senate would have no power to deal with it. 1 would prefer to have the Bill without it than delude myself with the belief that the amendment was a safeguard against the possibility of any Minister permitting imported articles to put articles of local manufacture out of the market, because Parliament will not have an effective opportunity of discussing the reasons. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator says so; but I have been here for eight years, and I dissent from his opinion. This amendment merely says that the Minister shall place his reasons upon the table of the Senate, but as honorable senators know, papers so laid on the table are not often discussed. Year in and year out thousands of papers are laid on the table, and the Senate has no time to discuss them. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad of the' Minister's explanation. I should now like the Minister to accept a slight amendment of the clause by inserting the word" British " before the words " black steel sheets." This, I think, cannot be objected to. Obviously, there are many reasons why, if we are going to import raw material, we should obtain it from the 'Motherland. I know there are some objections to giving bounties upon anything imported, but if this course be necessary, and the Minister will accept the suggestion I have made, it will,I think, meet with the unanimous approval of the Committee, because it will remove from the minds of honorable senators any fear they may have that in the future the Australian taxpayers' money will be used in a direction not. at present contemplated. </para>

                    <para>.- I have no particular objection to the insertion  of  the word "British," but I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> that sheet bar steel is manufactured in the United States of America as well as in Great Britain. Ihaveevery respect for anything British, because I am a Britisher myself, but I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> that there is cheap labour in Great Britain. I supported <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant's</inline> amendmentin order to conserve the manufacture of Australian materials for theAustralian people . If I decided to oppose <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten's</inline> amendment, I should be consistent with the attitude I have always adopted as a member of the Senate when we have been considering amendments of the Tariff. I have consistently opposed the 5per cent. preference given to British goods under the Tariff, because there is so much cheap labour in Great Britain. People outside have considered my opposition to that preference best described by the word "disloyalty," which is in every one's mouth nowadays. I am still alive, despite that construction being put upon my action. If we are going to allow imported sheet bar steel to be used in this  industry, I remind honorable senators that it is manufactured in the United States and in Canada. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> intend that the preference shall be given to sheet bar steel manufactured only in Great Britain? </para>

                    <para>. - I wish , to say a word or two to correct a misapprehension which, I fear, exists in the mind of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham.</inline> If the clause were amended in the way suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Loghlin,</inline> and the supply of Australian sheet bar steel was not, in the opinion of the Minister, sufficient to supply the works to be established under this Bill, he would be able to authorize the importation of a sufficient quantity of sheet bar steel to keep those works going upon giving sufficient reasons to Parliament for that authorization. But when such a necessity arose, if my amendment were carried, no sheet bar steel could be imported on the authorization of the Minister unless that of British origin. A bounty Bill is very different from a Tariff. Under a Tariff the goods of all nations imported pay duty according to certain schedule rates, but under a Bounty Bill moneys drawn direct from the taxpayers' pockets are paid to manufacturers under the terms specified by the Bill. There are only a few countries abroad that would be in a position to export sheet bar steel, and the chief of these on the Continent is Germany. We cannot forecast what the economic position will eventually be, bub here we have a proposal to pay a bounty out of the pockets of the taxpayers, and surely it is reasonable to safeguard the Australian taxpayers' money, and see that it shall be paid only in respect of sheet bar steel of British manufacture, where it is necessary that sheet bar steel should be imported. </para>

                    <para>. - The amendment which I submitted some time ago has evidently been having its influence upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten's</inline> mind. The honorable senator is now prepared to exclude sheet bar steel manufactured in any of the oversea Dominions of the British Empire, in the United States, or anywhere else outside of Australia, except Great Britain That would not impose the limitation I desire to see imposed upon the payment of this bounty, but it would very substantially limit the importation of sheet bar steel. I should be disposed to support the honorable senator's amendment if he substituted the words " United King- dom " for the word "British." Probably that is what the honorable senator intended, by his amendment. </para>

But there should be some institution in which he can be cared for after his work for the day is finished.  His  name is Burlington.

                        <para>. - I take no exception to the action of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> in bringing this case before the Senate. But, before I say any more, I am entitled to complain of the persistency with which organizations, and the newspapers, publish statements of the kind which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> has just read when they ought to know, and if possible to point out to such men that they are suffering from their own ignorance of what we provide for them. There is no need for any blind soldier to subsist on his pension of 30s. per week. If those who profess to be looking after the soldiers' interests would only devote a little time to our repatriation regulations they would know that the position of this man to-day, if it has been correctly stated, arises purely from want of knowledge on his part. First of all it is stated that he gets a pension of 30s. a week, and that there is nobody to look after him. As a matter of fact, our War Pensions Act  makes' special provision for an attendant in such cases. I thought; too, that everybody knew that we supplemented the pensions: of ail incapacitated soldiers, and even of those who are not incapacitated while they are awaiting work, beyond 30s. a week. The least a single man can get in circumstances such as I have outlined is £2 2s. a week. That ought to have been pointed out to this soldier by some of his numerous friends who are acting as critics of the Department today. Our repatriation regulations, set out that the Department will provide a home for any blind soldier,, will teach him any trade that he - desires to learn, and will equip him with .the tools of that' trade in his own home. It would be very much better if those who ought to know the facts, would place our returned soldiers In. possession of those facts, instead of allowing, them to rush into print with all sorts of ill-founded complaints. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> has supplied me. with the name of this particular soldier, and tomorrow I shall wire to Sydney in. an endeavour to get into touch with him, so that we may inform him of -what his position really is. </para>
