                            <para>- The statement is not generally correct, though it is true to some extent. To illustrate the difficulty with which we are faced, I may say that we ordered a quantity of galvanized iron for the protection of our wheat, but when a boat called at San Francisco to receive the iron it, unfortunately, had to take another cargo, because of the difficulty of transporting the iron over the United States railways to the port of shipment. </para>

                            <para>- The answer is-  1 and 2. Members of the Pay Corps have been required to work overtime in connexion with the preparation of cards for a check between the records of the Chief Pay Office, London, and the District Pay Offices in Australia. Under the conditions of their employment overtime or tea money is not payable to members of the Pay Corps, who are paid for seven days a week, but ordinarily are required to work the usual office hours on six days. A large section of the staff, which came from London for the check, has been diverted to the 2nd Military District, and a considerable number of additional temporary clerks have been employed by the District Paymaster. The overtime on this work will only continue for a short time, and the special effort sought from the staff is not considered unreasonable under the circumstances. </para>

                    <para>The Premier of Western Australia, in common with the Premiers of the other States, was communicated with in July last in regard to the Commonwealth Government's scheme for the building of standardized cargo vessels, and was asked how many slips were, or could be made, available in his State for the construction of vessels of the character and dimensions set out in the letter. The Premier, in reply, gave an assurance of the desire of his Government to co-operate in every way in the scheme, and- stated that, while there were not at that time any slipways suitable for the building of such vessels as the Prime Minister suggested, the provision of these would not present any difficulties. He made mention of a suitable site at Rockingham. He specially emphasized the facilities offered in Western Australia for the construction of wooden ships, owing to the magnificent timber resources of the State. The Premier subsequently indicated that his State was not in a position to undertake the construction of vessels of the type decided upon by the Commonwealth Government, and strongly urged that the construction of wooden vessels should be included in the shipbuilding programme. Negotiations are now in progress foi- the construction of wooden vessels in Western Australia, but no definite proposition has yet been submitted to the Commonwealth. </para>

                    LARGIE (Western Australia[3.17] . - I was a supporter of the Government which passed this Act at a time when the necessity for such legislation, which undoubtedly is of a very extraordinary character, was much less apparent than is the case to-day, after four years' experience of war. I supported the Government in putting this piece of legislation through. Certain prophecies were made thereafter as to what was to become of this law if and when put into effect. We were told that all the civil rights were to be taken from the people, that our freedom under such constitutional Acts and documents as, for example, Magna Charta, were to be put aside, and that citizens were to be haled before a court martial and their rights taken away from them at the drum head, so to speak. If we look upon the outcome of this legislation it must be admitted that there have been no harsh ness or unjust decisions, and that, in fact, nothing extraordinary has happened. We could not have legislation of this character in times such as these without running the risk of some little inconvenience, but our war-time experience has been remarkably good so far as the War Precautions Act administration is concerned. Seeing that I was behind the Government which passed the Act I cannot now be a party to repealing the legislation - for that is practically what we are asked to do by this motion.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline>
                    a member of the Government which brought in this legislation, simply because he has changed from the Government to the Opposition side of the House, is prepared to undo the very thing which he did some four years ago. At any rate, I shall not be so inconsistent.

                            <para>- I did not take the opportunity of " jumping Jim Crow" in the manner that the honorable senator flow proposes to do. He supported the measure as a member of the Government which brought it in and now, because he is a member of the Opposition, he is opposing it. I shall not be a party to that kind of conduct in this Chamber. I think every honorable senator will agree with me that a much greater need exists to-day for the Act than existed at the time of its introduction, and that all the doleful predictions in which some persons then indulged have not been realized - in other words, that civil rights have not been impaired in the slightest degree by this form of legislation. Consequently, I intend to support the Government. </para>

                        <para>.- I desire to say a few words in support of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline> proposal to repeal the statutory rule under consideration. One was rather touched by the speech of the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> yesterday, in which he acknowledged how repugnant it is, and must be, for a Government which is based upon democratic principles, to be obliged to carry put its administrative duties by means of regulations. He pointed out how objectionable it is to take from Par.liamant this supreme power, and to vest it in one or two individuals. I was glad to hear his expression of regret that the Government were compelled to adopt this method in carrying on the affairs of this country. I observed, too, with some interest, the look of disgust which was apparent on the faces of honorable senators opposite who formerly belonged to our party, and who evidently realized that some of the most cruel, vindictive, and discreditable prosecutions of their onetime colleagues have been instituted under these regulations.. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie may smile, but I can imagine the criticism in which he would indulge if he were present iii another capacity. Had he not temporarily hired himself to another political party- </para>

Any excuse was regarded by the Government as sufficient to warrant them in retaining, at the expense of the Commonwealth, leading counsel in order that convictions might be secured. In connexion with these prosecutions, the Ministry have  been most unfortunate, because, if my memory serves me accurately, they have so far succeeded in obtaining only one conviction. Their action was rendered the more absurd because of the ridicule which more than one magistrate heaped upon the prosecutions that had been initiated under these regulations. In one particular instance, a member of another place rendered a great public service to Australia by calling attention, in the mildest manner possible, to the position of another nation in regard to the Allies and the Allied cause. Of course, I refer to Japan. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Catts,</inline> the gentleman in question, made his statement clear and definite. That statement was immediately repudiated by the Leader of the Government in another, place <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> thus showing clearly that it expressed the opinion of , <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Catts</inline> only, and did not reflect the views of the Ministry of the day. If the honorable member <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Catts)</inline> could show that the Japanese nation, was not as whole-heartedly supporting the cause of the Allies as we could' expect, or not giving the support that they ought to render, he was surely doing his duty in pointing that out to the Australian Parliament. The Japanese Government have played some little part in the happenings of the last three years. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- They have played a part, and whether they should have done more or not is a matter of opinion, a matter, too, entirely for the Japanese nation. "What I rose particularly for was not to find fault with the Japanese people for not having done more for the Allied cause, in which they should be interested, but to point out to honorable senators the view that the Japanese nation takes with regard to Germany. I raise this question of national importance for the simple purpose of letting this Parliament know what the attitude of a section of the Japanese is, as expressed by a professor of the Japanese University. I listened with a good deal of attention to the statement of the Minister for Defence about the skilful propaganda of the German agents in all the countries of the world where they thought they could turn public opinion to their advantage. They have, unfortunately, succeeded to a most extraordinary degree, because human nature in the countries in which they operated was such as to lend itself to treachery to its own country. I wish to say here and now that, notwithstanding the skill of the Germans, notwithstanding the generosity with which they have poured out their money in this connexion, they were operating in Japan upon a people that, I think, are the most incorruptible in the world where' the interests of their own nation are concerned. To me it was a lesson, and a pleasure to observe it, and a matter for regret that I could not find the same loyalty to Australia among the people of Australia as there was to Japan among the Japanese. They have only one thought and one object, and that is, the interests of their country. I am, therefore, not looking to the opinion of that section of the Japanese people that might be get-at-able by the German secret service agents, but am placing before the Senate the carefully-considered and matured opinions of one of the leading professors of Japan, as to why they are in1 sympathy with Germany, and the reasons he gives for that sentiment. </para>

It is headed " Japanese sympathy with Germany;" "A Candid Statement, by Professor M. Anesaka, of the Imperial University;" " German influence in the Imperial University, and why it grew;" "How the war has impressed some Japanese;" "ProGermanism, a disease in the political and social life of Japan."- I am not glorying, by any means, in the fact that some of the Japanese are pro -German. My only object in quoting the article is to let the members of this branch of the National Parliament know the sentiments of the people of Japan, as expressed by one of their leading scholars. When I have done that I shall feel that I have discharged a duty, and leave the matter there. </para><interjection><talk.start>

                        <para>There have been two periods in the growth of German influence in Japan. The first was consequent upon the defeat of France by Germany in 1870. This induced Japanese military authorities to adopt the German model in place of the French, which had been followed previously. The second dated from the middle 80's, when Prince Ito found the German Constitution and jurisprudence the most congenial to Japanese needs. After German jurisprudence came German philosophy and science. The introduction of German medical science had, been an earlier thing. These influences modified the Imperial University, then the only institution of the kind in the Empire, into a German institution; - </para>

I think that the honorable senator's speech has so far been strictly relevant to the question.

Where are the privileges of the members of the National Parliament if they are to be prevented from taking the course which they believe they ought to take in the interests of national safety ? The prosecution to which I have referred failed, of course, and failed' miserably, as it should have done. But, npt content with that, under this regulation, and under the authority of the Solicitor-General, acting under instructions, no doubt, from the Prime Minister, a further charge was levelled against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Catts</inline> for having procured the Government Printer to reprint his speech in pamphlet form. This action was taken, notwithstanding the fact that the Government must have known that <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> in the ordinary course, was circulated by tens of thousands of copies throughout Australia. The Solicitor-General, who is to visit, the Old Country in the capacity of adviser to the delegation that is going there, must have known that. In spite of that, a further prosecution was launched against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Catts,</inline> obviously on the ground that any old thing will do for the purpose of causing expense and inconvenience to a political opponent. No one. who is. aware of the facts can take any other view than that in a number of instances these prosecutions were levelled at men who have been, and are to-day, active opponents of the present Government and their policy in connexion with government by regulation. </para><interjection>

                            <para>- That is true. Unfortunately, I must accept some responsibility for it myself, because I voted for the War Precautions Act. But no one in this or in another place ever dreamt that, in carrying that measure, he was conferring upon the Government the extended powers which the present Government eventually assumed. It was never expected that the Government would use their powers under the Act so harshly or so unfairly as the present Government have done. I sincerely hope that honorable senators will see that these regulations, and the one now under consideration in particular, confer upon the Government a power which they ought not to possess. I hope, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> and other honorable senators who have spoken from this side, that they will agree that the time has arrived when the Government of the day should be deprived of such powers. The most effective way in which to bring that about is to vote for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner's</inline> motion, that this regulation be disallowed. </para>

                        <para>. - There is not a great deal in connexion with the debate for me to reply to. I do complain, however, of the manner in which the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> treated my motion. He stated that I deliberately tried to mislead the Senate. When I commenced my speech yesterday I read the whole of that section of the regulation because I wished the Senate to repeal it, or to disagree with it. The Minister spoke at length about the matter of German influence; and the insinuation behind the whole of that was, to my mind, that we who criticised the actions of the Government were, either the dupes or the tools of an enemy Power. </para>

                            <para>- I accept that statement, and I am glad to hear it. The Minister also questioned my sincerity in the whole matter. I will give the Senate an indication of my sincerity. There is quite a number of these regulations which I consider to interfere unduly with the liberty of the public. If the Minister is prepared to place before Cabinet the question of the cancellation of all these matters which interfere with the liberties of the individual, I shall withdraw from the business-paper every motion that I have connected with the subject. That is a. guarantee of my <inline font-style="italic">bona fides.</inline> But if the Minister is not prepared to do so, I would be in this position: If I did not register my protest against the regulations - and I am given the right within a certain time to do so - then I should be equally responsible with the Government for every one of these regulations under the War Precautions Act. Here is a simple proposition. There is not one honorable senator .who would stand by every one of these regulations. </para>

                            <para>- I venture to say that not one honorable senator will vote for this regulation because he be.Iieves in it. I do not think there is one man in this country who approves of the methods that were adopted by the Government during the recent referendum campaign to prevent the voices of their opponents .being heard upon a question of vital importance to the community. These regulations have been issued day by day in piecemeal fashion. The one with which we are now dealing vests in the Executive the power to say to its own followers, upon a question of vital interest to the nation, " You may be heard, and you may speak as you wish, but we will prevent our political opponents from exercising a similar privilege." Yesterday I instanced in this connexion the prosecutions which were instituted against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall,</inline> ex-Senator Rae, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan</inline> (the Premier of Queensland), <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline> Mathews--- </para>

Yesterday the Minister for Defence stated that the magistrate who decided this particular case had affirmed that he could see no such danger because of the character of their author. He said nothing of the kind. The Minister has repeated words that were uttered by the opposing counsel. </para>

                            <para>- I  did;  and. the whole Senate shares with me in that responsibility. But I believed that the War Precautions Act was an emergency measure which was intended to be applied only to our enemies. Surely I am not to blame because the Government have misused that legislation in order to prosecute friends of the Empire who are doing their share of the Empire's work! I say unhesitatingly that the War Precautions Act has been used to divide "the people of Australia into sectional 'camps.- If there is any section which can be put into a fighting attitude by reason of an attack upon it, the Government is always ready to use this particular Statute  as a  means whereby to attack that section. In eight  out  of every ten cases in which the Act has been used it has been abused. </para>

                            <para>- That was a shot in the. dark, but I think it was justified  .by  the  careful  way in which the honorable senator side-stepped the question. I know that he opposed the Government of which I was a  member  more frequently than he supported it. When the War Precautions Act was introduced there were men who predicted the loss of British rights -as they are laid down in the Bill of Rights. Whoever was wise enough to adopt that attitude can point to the record of the past few months for the purpose -of showing that his predictions, have been  fulfilled  to the very letter. All the liberties that we formerly enjoyed have -been taken from us under the War Precautions Act, which was never intended' to apply to public meetings, at which not a word has been uttered which, by any stretch of the imagination, could be held to be of advantage to the enemy/ I ask honorable senators to recognise that  if they vote against my motion they will be accepting their share of responsibility for the passing of this regulation. I have submitted the motion because Parliament has endowed me with the right to disapprove of it. I intend to follow the same course in respect of every regulation which I regard as unnecessary and absurd. These regulations were, of course, framed for the purpose of terrorizing honorable senators upon this side of the Chamber and others who share their views. As a matter of fact, they had precisely the opposite effect, in that they enabled us to pose as heroes on the public platforms of this country. Speaking of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan,</inline> the Queensland Premier, the Prime Minister said, " Let him make those statements outside of Parliament, and I will get him." Was it ever intended that under the War Precautions Act Ministers should be enabled to roam the country inviting people to break the law in order that they might be put in gaol? . </para>

They have given the wives, children, and dependants of returned soldiers cheap meat. The Federal Government have not done that. I ask the Senate to disallow a regulation that has allowed the Government to interfere with the liberties of individuals. Those individuals to-day happen to be the opponents of the Government. It may happen later on that the present opponents of the Government will have the governing power, and what would be the position of honorable senators opposite, if this power were used against them in such a tyrannical and despotic manner as has been the case in the last few months? </para>

All they could say would be "We suppose we must accept this; we are responsible for it, we approved of it when, months after the measure had passed, on the first opportunity the Senate had to disagree with it, we upheld the hands of the Government who introduced this pernicious system of government by regulation to interfere with the liberties of public speakers." If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is prepared to put before the Government a proposition to cancel this pernicious regulation dealing with public speakers, I am prepared to withdraw my opposition to all the other regulations that have yet to be opposed. I am putting that forward as a step towards meeting my opponents. </para>

                    <para>The honorable senator deplored the existence of party spirit at the present time, but a pious expression of sorrow and regret at the existence of party strife is quite unbecoming to a man who is unwilling to take one step towards meeting those whom' he accuses of bearing malice and using party spirit in a way in which it should not be used, although, they are prepared to go more than half-way to meet him. The matter is very simple. The poll is over and the regulation cannot be used again unless the Government intend to have another election next week, but that may be possible, seeing that the Minister for Defence, I understand, has called the representatives of the press- of Australia to Melbourne, where they will fare sumptuously, their expenses being paid by the people of this country. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad to hear it, because for months past our men have been suffering under the disability that the one claim for preference appeared to be that the person who got preference had the record of having scabbed on the Labour movement. . If there is to be another appeal to the country, of course the press have first to be gathered in, at the meeting next week, and these regulations may be of a great deal of use in suppressing opposition. The Government will be able to say to the press gathering, " Being sure, gentlemen, of your support, the Government will be able to go to the extent of dragging public men before magistrates." I appeal to honorable senators again to try to picture a high-minded public man, the leader of a great State, as Queensland is, being dragged before a magistrate and cross-examined day after day with all the vindictiveness and venom of a counsel opposed not to the man but to the principles he stands for. .-If honorable senators can imagine anything more degrading to the public life of this country, I cannot. That particular degradation of the public life of Australia was the most pitiful example we have had in this country of what petty tyrants will do if you give them unlimited power. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable senator can find anything of that in the original Act which I helped to pass I will resume my seat. I am speaking of the regulation by which public men were brought before a magistrate, and had to prove themselves innocent if any one averred that they were guilty, while another part of it so curtails the time during which witnesses may De called that if the most important witness, who can prove a man's innocence, can get out of the way for twenty-four hours, he can avoid being called on to give evidence. Are honorable senators going to support that kind of thing ? If they are, I am not. I have tried to make the seriousness of the position clear to them. </para>

                            <para>- Does the honorable senator think it licence for a man to complain of a regulation that will drag him before a magistrate because he dares to stand on a public platform and speak as he has always spoken ? . As far as licence is concerned, I have this peculiar testimonial from the Government, that during the whole of the campaign I was so truthful that they never brought me before a magistrate. But they sent their people to take notes of what I was saying, and I did not curb my tongue, either, be cause if the people of this country were to be robbed of their liberties I would rather be in gaol for raising my voice against that robbery than sitting on the Senate benches with honorable senators who approved of the application of German methods in a British Dominion. Honorable senators opposite are the representatives of force. They are the representatives of a military power . that is showing its head as a tyrannical influence with no regard for, or sympathy with, the rest of the population. </para>

I am not trying to dictate terms to him, but am making a sincere offer, to him. We shall have a busy session and these attacks on our liberties will lead to a certain amount of recrimination, as this debate has done. I do not want that, but the Minister is much mistaken if he thinks I am going to allow things of this kind to pass without asserting my right to protest against them. If the Minister is not prepared to accept my offer I shall not only press this motion to a division,' but shall call for a vote on each similar motion as it is reached, in order that we may see which honorable senators support the Government in this method of tyrannizing over the people of Australia. The Minister cannot expect those of us who  disagree with the regulation to subscribe to it, and as time will be valuable in the next week or two he will be well advised to accept my offer in the spirit in which it is made. If not, it will be my duty to give notice . of at least ten similar motions, and as each one is reached it will be necessary to 'debate it. I appeal to the Minister not to regard my offer as being made sarcastically, but as one made 'Sincerely in the interests of the business of the Senate. </para>

                        <para>. - This Statutory Rule refers to the appointment of certain police under the War Precautions Act. It has been argued that this action on the part of the Government had not been contemplated until the force known . as the Commonwealth police was . appointed as the outcome of a certain incident in Queensland. That, however, is quite a mistake. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Successive Federal Ministries had this matter under notice for discussion for several years, and different Ministers have minuted decisions upon the proposal. Failing to get former Governments to take any action in the matter, a number of Commonwealth Departments long ago took action themselves, and since the early days of Federation, in at least three Commonwealth Departments, there have been, and are today, officials called by various names, but whose duties are essentially police duties. These officials may be found in the Post Office, Navy Department, and Customs Department, and they have rendered very good service to the Commonwealth. They have, in fact,' become essential in many branches of the Commonwealth Service. In . the Navy Department, the men were appointed before the outbreak of war, and they are being employed at Cockatoo and Garden Islands. </para>

I do not think, however, that they referred to what may be termed the departmental police, but dealt with the men appointed in Queensland. In the latter case, then, the duties are general, whereas those appointed by the different Departments were called upon for special, but essentially police duties, and in the Navy Department they are called Navy police. </para>

With regard to the appointment of the police in Queensland, I desire to point out that  Under  the Constitution the State Judiciaries and police are required to administer the laws of the Commonwealth, and ever since Federation ' the Commonwealth Government have endeavoured so to utilize the services of State police. Generally speaking, the State Governments have willingly allowed their police to administer the Commonwealth laws, and they have rendered valuable service, but it remained for the Government of Queensland to refuse to carry out a Commonwealth law known as the "Unlawful Associations Act of 1916-17. On 6th August, 1917, the Prime Minister asked  the  various State Premiers to authorize their officers of police to give effect to the provisions of the  Act,  and all the Premiers, with the exception of the Premier of Queensland, consented. Notwithstanding that numerous f further requests were made to his Government, the Premier of that State withheld his consent to the State Police Force administering <inline font-style="italic">this</inline> law. This Act, I remind the Senate, was enacted by the Commonwealth Parliament after the outbreak of the war. Speaking from memory, I think it passed  the  .Senate with very little opposition. There was, I believe, a division in the House of Representatives, but in the Senate there was no division on the second reading, so we may assume that this law is on  our  statute-book with the authority of the people of the Commonwealth. It is a serious matter, therefore, for the Government of any State to ignore a request to assist the Commonwealth in the enforcement of its legislation. </para>

                            <para>- This law has the <inline font-style="italic">imprimatur</inline> of this Parliament, appointed by the people of the Commonwealth, ana with full authority to legislate on their behalf. Whatever <inline font-weight="bold">Senator' Gardiner's</inline> views may be with regard to this Act, whilst it is on our statute-book, it should' be administered unless, indeed, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator' Gardiner</inline> is going to advocate lawlessness, and say, in effect, that there shall be no" law, and that this Parliament has no right to pass such a law. In this matter it is not a case of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> saying that he would not trust either the Prime Minister or the Minister for Defence, because the administration of the law is in the hands of the State Police Department, and it is their responsibility to take action whenever any breach of the law is reported to them. Is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> going to argue that a State Government is to have the right to say that if the Commonwealth Government wish to take certain action, for which they are responsible to the Commonwealth Parliament, a State Government will have the right to determine whether any particular law shall he administered or not? Is he going to take up the attitude that a State Government is to have the power to revise and pass judgment upon laws of the Commonwealth, or upon any . acts of administration by a Commonwealth Government responsible to the National Parliament? Unless he does, I venture to say that he can find no shadow of excuse or apology for the action of the Queensland Government in not agreeing to administer the Commonwealth law referred to. </para>

I take it that if the State -police had been doing this work, there would have been no occasion for the Commonwealth Commissioner of Taxes to have asked them to do it. The Commonwealth income tax has been in existence since the first year of the war. It was about this period, I should say, that these inquiries were sought to be made. 'I assume that the request was made about that time, at any rate. </para>

I then outlined the particulars as to when the Commonwealth police were first established. I do not intend. to go over that again. I want to give some indication now of where and in what capacities the Commonwealth police are needed, and where the State police are used to some extent; and where, with the exception of Queensland, it is proposed to continue to use them. There is the Pensions Branch. A large number of inquiries have to be made by the police with respect to pensions. . </para>

                            <para>- I know of none. There is also the question of the note issue which affords an example of where we should have the Commonwealth police. Specialists are needed in this kind of work, and 'as the Commonwealth has the sole right to issue notes, the Commonwealth authorities should have their own expert police, to. follow up cases of forgery and the like. Then there is the Taxation Department and the Post Office with detectives or inquiry officers of their own ; and the Navy, and the Customs Department also. I was asked just now if this necessity had arisen only since that affair at Warwick. I am bound to say that that incident disclosed an attitude . on the part of the Queensland State police - no doubt, based upon the attitude which the State Government had taken up - which demonstrated that no representative of the Commonwealth Government could expect to receive the protection that he had a right to look for from the civil police of Queensland. That is, if they were all to adopt the same stand as the police at Warwick. </para>

                            <para>- I know all about that exoneration. As to the incident at Warwick, the facts as reported by persons present, who were quite impartial - not the Prime Minister's statement, but those of pressmen from other States who saw all that took place - show that it constituted an insult to the Prime Minister, and reflected discredit on the police officials who were there, and should ha '/a been there to maintain law and order. It was a direct encouragement to lawlessness, and it would lead to the spread of that kind of thing to every other part of the Commonwealth if it were to be ignored. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable senators, in trying to minimize and pooh pooh the whole incident, are guilty of the suspicion that they are 'endeavouring to shelter acts of lawlessness which were a disgrace, not only to those who committed them,- but to any person who might countenance or excuse them. If we are about to endeavour to make heroics out of the behaviour of the larrikins who got upon that platform with the deliberate purpose*" of insulting the chief citizen of the Commonwealth, then, if that is the attitude of honorable senators, matters may well reach such a pitch as to make public life impossible. When the Prime Minister - insulted and mobbed as he wa£ - saw those police and appealed to them, and they took no action to protect him, he was perfectly justified in assuming what he did. The State Government not only took no action, but condoned the acts of those persons and adopted a whitewashing report in condonation of them. Further, when we knew that the Industrial Workers of the World had been collecting their forces in Queensland  - had actually been inviting their members to leave the other States and go to Queensland - and when we were made aware that the State Government would not allow the use of their police, then the Commonwealth Government were justified in appointing their police. They were justified in seeing that the laws of the Commonwealth were observed, and that public men whose duties took them to Queensland should be protected from larrikins, who are not typical of that State, but who are in every- State, and who, if they feel that they can safely indulge in actions of that kind, will do so anywhere. If that sort of thing was to be condoned and no official action taken, and the police were to be encouraged by the attitude of the State Government,  the Commonwealth Government could have taken no other action than to appoint a police force to see that their laws were observed. </para>

                            <para>- The police throughout the whole of the States were instructed to do their duty. If honorable senators are going to condone such deeds as when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was subjected to insult and contumely while the police stood by smiling at the crowd, then they make themselves responsible for those things in our public life, and we shall not have government by reason or intelligence; we shall have . government merely by those who can- yell the loudest and make themselves the most objectionable. It is not the kind of thing we want in a Democracy. These were the circumstances leading to the employment of the Commonwealth, police. The question is now under the consideration of the Government from this point of view. The Government have no desire to appoint a single individual for whom there is not a duty awaiting. At present a Committee of Departmental Officers is -considering a scheme by which all the various departmental police are proposed &gt;to be brought together as one body, so that they shall be able to carry out their duties as effectively as possible. This will give better opportunities for control and administration, and perhaps for transferring officers from one Department to another if that course should be necessary. That is what is proposed fo be done in regard to the Commonwealth police. But the Commonwealth have a perfect right to appoint police if it finds it necessary to do so, to effectively carry out the Commonwealth law. Of course, we shall endeavour to prevent duplication, but I repeat that the Commonwealth Government has a perfect right to see that its laws are obeyed, and wherever the State police are not available to enforce those laws, the Commonwealth will appoint police to do so. I therefore oppose the motion. </para>

It is true that the first inquiry was conducted by a sub-inspector of police, but that was followed up by an inquiry on the part of the Commissioner of Police, before which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carey,</inline> the  chairman  of the conscription meeting at Warwick, gave evidence.  His  evidence alone vindicated the action of the police of that town, as well as that of the Queensland Government. The police magistrate also gave evidence at that inquiry. In regard to the statement of the Minister for Defence that the law was broken with impunity, I would point out that the man who threw the egg was arrested, brought before the Police Court, and fined 10s. </para>

                            <para>- No ; I have a singularly retentive memory for things in which I am interested. What really happened at Warwick? Stripped of all the sensationalism of the press reporters, who merely put a huge joke upon the people, this is what occurred : The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> stepped out upon the platform at Warwick for the purpose of delivering an address. As he did so an egg was thrown. He immediately rushed into the crowd gesticulating wildly. Then his own friends grabbed him, and prevented him making a bigger fool of himself than he usually does when he becomes excited. A sergeant of police - Sergeant Kenny - was blamed for having laid hands on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> in order to prevent him running into the crowd. There was no interruption at the meeting which he addressed. As a matter of fact, the right honorable gentleman was only in Warwick for thirteen minutes, and he did not encounter as much interruption during the course of his address as I frequently experience in this Chamber. </para>

However, I invite the honorable senator to interview <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> himself and to ascertain from him directly whether he had not a fair opportunity of presenting his case at Warwick. I repeat that, upon the Prime Minister alighting there, an egg was thrown at him. . Thereupon a man was seized and arrested, whilst another man was knocked down by the conscriptionists. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was then grabbed by his own friends and escorted to the place where he intended to deliver his speech, and where, in fact, he did deliver it. Here is the statement of a returned soldier who was present at the time. </para>

I am positively sure that it has been made a great deal of use of unreasonably, because of its untruthfulness.' I refer to the so-called assault made upon the Prime Minister on the Warwick railway platform. I was on the platform at Toowoomba when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> arrived, and I travelled to Warwick on the same train. At Warwick three men shook hands with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> and he then walked up the platform to where he was to address the people, who were on the roadway. There were 40 or 50 persons on the platform, the majority of whom were railway travellers. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was treated in due respect from the time he left the carriage until' within 5 or 6 feet of the place where he was to give his address. As he approached it a tall man threw an egg, which hit the Prime Minister above the rim of the hat. The man who threw the egg was immediately assaulted and tackled by men on the platform and a fight occurred about 2 or 3 yards from the Prime Minister, alongside of whom were two men and behind were two policemen. As soon as the egg hit the Prime Minister's hat he turned around and rushed back to the crowd excitedly and gesticulating wildly. Seeing the excited state of the Prime Minister  I  took hold of his arms, pinning them to his side, and said, "Biily, Billy, for God's sake pull yourself together. Remember you are the Prime Minister." </para>

Being a little ' weak from illness, having not long left Dalby Sanatorium, I was thrown aside by the excited Prime Minister, who fought his way through the crowd, and, pointing to a man in a dramatic manner, he said: - "You are one of them." The man, who was pale but calm, replied: "No, no, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes;</inline> I am one of yours." The Prime Minister getting such a cool reply to his hysterical charge, was taken back and cooled down very much. He then proceeded to address "the people, and I can say from my own experience that the Prime Minister was not at any time in danger of personal violence. Whatever happened was due to his excited condition. I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that the only violence used, if it could be called that, was the egg that struck <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes'</inline> hat and my friendly clasp of him. </para>

                            <para>- Let us take the statement of this disinterested- witness and compare it with the press reports of the Warwick incident. The Minister for Defence has stated that the Queensland Government refused to permit the police to give effect to the Commonwealth law. It is strange that we had never heard- of it before the establishment of the Commonwealth police. But if the Minister will persist in uttering the maliciously exaggerated statements of newspaper reporters, he will lose his reputation for truthfulness. From the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Standard</inline> of 3rd December, 1917, I take the following : - </para>

                        <para>The Premier has received the following, additional wire from the Prime Minister: - " Thanks for your wire. I am glad to learn that you propose to enforce Commonwealth and State laws. But I want to emphasize that Senior Sergeant Kenny, who I again repeat, connived at and permitted this outrage, emphatically refused to enforce them when requested by me as </para>

When the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth is assaulted and howled down by an organized mob, who would have gone to any length, had they not been prevented by civilians, headed by a returned soldier, and the police of your State look on and do nothing, it appears to me nothing could be more serious.  'I  again request you to forthwith suspend Senior Sergeant Kenny for refusing to obey the Commonwealth laws." </para>

                        <para>The Commissioner for Police <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. C. Urquhart),</inline> who was also threatened with arrest by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> if he did not deal drastically with Kenny, has now submitted the following report to the Home Secretary, exonerating the officer in question. </para>
                        <para>Attached to the Chief Inspector's report are signed statements obtained from C. E. McDougall, Esquire, Vice-President of the Reinforcements Campaign Committee, of Queensland;  President  of the Queensland National Agricultural and Industrial Association of Queensland ( marked No. 1 ) : and a justice of the peace: from Senior Sergeant Kenny (marked No. 2); from Sergeant Huston (marked No. 3) ; from Acting-Sergeant O'Brien (marked No. 4); from Constable Tong (marked No. 5); from Constable Duffy (marked No. 6) ; and from Constable Coughlan (marked No. 7). "It will be observed," says the report, "that I make much use of the evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mc-</inline> Dougall, and I do this, not because I have any reason to doubt the police evidence, but because they are all, to some extent, in the position of defendants, which, in a certain class of mind, might heavily discount the value  of  their statements, and also because the probity and honour of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McDougall</inline> are known to all Queenslanders. and probably also to the Right Honorable W. M. Hughes. " On charge No. 3 that Senior Serjeant Kenny had broken the Commonwealth laws: The only- Commonwealth enactment I am acquainted with which may have direct bearing upon the situation at Warwick is section 28 of the (Commonwealth) Crimes Act of 1914, which runs as follows: - </para>
                        <para class="block">Any person, who, by violence or by threats, or intimidation of any kind, hinders or interferes with the free exercise or performance by any other person of any political right or duty, shall be guilty of an offence. Penalty: Imprisonment for three years.' "I am unable to see how, on the evidence, Senior Sergeant Kenny, or any of the police, can be said to have broken this law. It is, on the contrary, clear that the Senior Sergeant endeavoured to insure the unhindered exercise of the Prime Minister's political right, and, finally, amid considerable turmoil, succeeded in doing so.  " Charge No. <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> is that Senior Sergeant Kenny issued instructions to the police under him to break the Commonwealth laws: The only instructions issued by Senior Sergeant Kenny to the police arc detailed in the evidence." </para>
                        <para>Senior Sergeant Kenny states: "I did not instruct the police not to arrest Brosnan, neither did I issue them any instructions beyond those I gave them before going to the railway station, and my instructions to them then were to preserve law and order." </para>
                        <para>Sergeant Huston states: "The Senior Sergeant gave no instructions except that the meeting was to be carried out as orderly and quietly as possible. Certainly no instructions wore given by him during the Prime Minister's Stay on the platform." " On charge No. 5, that Senior Sergeant Kenny had connived at the disgraceful proceedings on the Warwick platform, T. am bound to say that, in the statements before me, I can find no evidence of connivance. The evidence Shows what the proceedings amounted to, and what Senior Sergeant Kenny's actions and attitude <inline font-style="italic">were</inline> throughout, and it seems to me impossible for an impartial mind to come to the conclusion that he did connive." </para>
                        <para>Summarized, the rest of the report in effect expresses the Commissioner's opinion that the publication in the press, that Kenny did connive, was libellous, actionable, and defamatory. </para>

                    <para class="block">With the knowledge of those facts, is it fair to single out Senior Sergeant Kenny as a man who refused to obey Commonwealth law ? The man who broke the law on that occasion paid the penalty for it, as I have shown, and in the circumstances is it fair or wise to make out that a great State like Queensland is lawless? I know no State in the Commonwealth where the law is more strongly upheld by the people than Queensland. The recent State election proved that they appreciate the administration of the law at the hands of the Ryan Government. There is a solid wealthy community in Queensland, owning what is undoubtedly the greatest State in the Commonwealth, and developing it in a way that is a credit to themselves. </para>

I am told that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poll</inline> knows of an instance where quite a number of eggs were not only thrown at. him, but struck him, but the country has never been roused to any extent over it. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lynch</inline> would say, " Are not all men equal before the law?" and should not credit be given to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> that when he was the tar-  get for many Queensland eggs he took his gruel like a good soldier, without com' plaining unduly about it? </para>

                    <para>The Minister for Defence has tried to justify the regulation by saying that the Queensland Government refused to administer a law passed by the Commonwealth. He has given no evidence in . support of his statement, and I warn him that in view of the careless way in which he handles the truth, it will be necessary for him in future to produce evidence in support of every statement he makes if we are to judge by the version he put to the Senate of the Warwick incident. Holding a responsible position in this country, he says, without any proof beyond his mere words, that the Queensland Government would not carry out a certain Commonwealth law. Let us examine what kind of law it is. In New South Wales the State Government did carry it out. A man named Wilson was brought before a Court. The evidence of the prosecuting police against him was that he took .the chair at an Industrial Workers of the World meeting, and said he believed in one big union. He was sentenced to six months' imprisonment for being a member of the Industrial Workers of the World - an unlawful association. His period of sentence expired, and the Commonwealth Government, who talk about upholding the law, have had him detained in prison since then, although he has served his term. His employers, a big building company in Sydney, for whom he had worked for two years, are willing to take him back, which is some proof of his <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> as a workman. But notwithstanding that he has children to maintain, who are suffering because of his detention, and has expiated his offence, 'he is still detained in prison by this Government. I interested myself sufficiently in the case to send a number of wires to the Grown Solicitor asking why, seeing that his term of imprisonment was up, the mau was still detained. I received the illuminating information that no answer could he given to my inquiries. If the Commonwealth law will not respect itself, it will not be long before no State will respect it, and the 'Government will want a big Commonwealth Police Force if they are going to do that kind of thing in Australia. I inquired specially if there was anything else against the man, and could get no information. He is detained by the order of the Commonwealth Government forwarded to the State Government, yet on the other side of the Senate we cannot find a man with sufficient . courage to resent that infringement of our liberties. </para>

If the man is a dangerous criminal, I suppose they have a right to detain him, but the principal charge against him was that he favoured one big union. Both the Minister for Defence and myself could be put in gaol for worse statements than that. </para>

                    <para>There is no doubt that the Commonwealth police were called into existence because of the ridiculously exaggerated report that the pressmen, meeting in the Commonwealth Offices, in Sydney, compiled and put up on the public as a huge electioneering bluff. It fell flat, very flat indeed, because if one thing is resented in Queensland more than another it is the fact that Queensland was included in the condemnation of the Prime Minister, who forced the Commonwealth police establishment on that State. I venture to say that this action by the Prime Minister had an important effect upon the recent elections in that State, because, in the main, Queensland is intensely fair. </para>

                            <para>- The people of the Commonwealth are being continually called upon to meet additional expenditure by new taxation, rendered necessary by the circumstances of this war, and, that being so, surely we cannot afford to continue with the Commonwealth Police Force in Queensland. Let us reason the matter out. If there was any complaint against the Queensland Government, surely the matter could have been arranged without inflicting a costly superintendent, or inspector-general, or whatever term he runs under, together with a new police force, on the people of that State. I have travelled very much about this Commonwealth,, but <inline font-style="italic">up</inline> to the present I have not seen a member of this Commonwealth Police Force, perhaps because they do not wear a uniform. It may be an advantage to have a police force in civilian clothing, but, with my knowledge of the mainland, I can honestly say that I know of no State in Australia where there was any necessity for an additional police force, and particularly such a costly and cumbersome system as has been put upon the people by this War Precautions regulation, framed probably at a meeting attended only by two or three Ministers. I believe the Minister for Defence was in Western Australia at the time, so I do not think that we can hold him personally responsible for this regulation. I am pleased that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> has given me an opportunity to record my vote against the regulation, which involved an extravagant duplication of our police forces at a time when every pound counts. Are honorable senators going to support the continuance of this new expensive and useless police system, which duplicates our already efficient State police forces? The </para>

                    <para class="block">Minister for Defence, in his speech, showed he had entirely failed to make himself acquainted with what happened in Queensland. I presume that he now believes what" he sees in the daily press, and so he was not acquainted with the report of the Queensland Commissioner of Police, or he would have known that the Prime Minister had very little to complain about, certainly no more than possibly any other public man has had to put up with when people are led away by excitement. But because of what happened in that State a Commonwealth Police Force has been inflicted upon Australia for all time, and at a period, too, in our history when every shilling counts. The Government may be permitted to continue on their course, and, as these matters are decided on a (party basis, the division on this motion will no doubt be the same as on the previous question. I shall vote against the regulation which called into existence an absolutely unnecessary police force. </para>

                            <para>- In my opinion, the honorable senator has raised this question, not so much for the purpose of cutting down expenditure as for the purpose of re-opening the old party feud, and raking up some of that political muck which was disturbed so much during the recent referendum campaign, as well as to take advantage of an opportunity to make statements against the Prime Minister. </para>

                            <para>- If I thought <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> had brought forward his motion  with a desire to effect economy, I would approach the consideration of this matter with a certain amount of sympathy, but I think I shall be able to demonstrate that he desires to do something which is not very creditable, and which certainly is prejudicial to the interests of the Commonwealth Police Force. I agree with the suggestion of the Minister for Defence regarding the utilization of the Commonwealth police in the performance of other than ordinary police duties, work which at present is being" carried out bv State police at the cost of the Commonwealth Government. In this way a considerable saving could be effected, and the retention of the police in Queensland would not be an additional burden upon the people of that State. I understand that, at present, State police officers are largely employed in connexion with the Commonwealth electoral rolls, and as they have plenty of other work to do, all Commonwealth electoral work could very well be intrusted to the Commonwealth force. </para>

                    <para>A few days ago, while in Brisbane, I had an opportunity of meeting some members of this force. They waited upon me in that city, and appeared to be in an anxious frame of mind, because they had just received three months' notice to quit the service. It is all very well for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline> to laugh at this matter, but I remind them that it is not the easiest thing in the world at the present moment for any men thrown out of employment to secure other remunerative Billets. What is more important is that these men are being victimized by supporters of honorable senators on the other side to such an extent that when they leave the Commonwealth . Service the chances are that employment will be denied to them throughout the length and breadth of Queensland. </para>

That is why they have asked me to approach the Minister to request that, instead of their being given three months' leave, they may receive three months' salary, so that they can get out of Queensland, knowing, as they do, that they will not have .a fair deal in thai State. </para>

                            <para>- There was another statement that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> made to the effect that on .account of the actions of the Prime Minister and of various supporters the state of mind of people in Queensland had become very unsettled. He said, further, that if the unsettlement of their minds was allowed to continue anything might happen. When a political contest is being fought the state of the people's minds is always to a certain extent unsettled. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> endeavoured to point out that it was on account of the attitude adopted by those who favoured conscription that the minds of the public had become unsettled. I cannot see how that could have come about owing to the conscriptionists any more man that it might well have been due to the actions of the anticonscriptionists. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think it was, any more than at an ordinary election. There have been a few cases in Queensland, from my own personal observation, where the State police have not carried out their duties to the extent that they might have done. But the reason that they failed to keep law and order was not that they were not desirous of protecting me, but owing to the example shown them by the Administration in Queensland. </para>

                            <para>- The remark is incorrect. It is a wicked statement. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maughan</inline> knows that a number of the men who went to the help of the Savings Bank during the run upon the institution were strong members of our side. I can cite one in particular who strongly advised the public not to take their money out of the bank, and who said he would lead the way in depositing more of his own - asking others about him to follow his lead, with a view to stemming the rush. I refer to the  Hon.  Tom Hall, a member of the Legislative Council of Queensland. He and other business men did their utmost to stop the run, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maughan,</inline> when he makes such a statement, knows that it is incorrect as well as unfair, and that that run was not instigated by any persons. </para>

                            <para>- If I had been taking an escort with me, I certainly would not have chosen an escort of the kind that was at Gordonvale. At that place <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> and myself addressed a meeting comprising perhaps 200 persons. There were eleven or twelve State police present, but -we were nevertheless bombarded with eggs, and were not permitted for more than two or three minutes at a time throughout the evening to express our opinions. I cannot say what was the age of the eggs, but I can say that they were not laid in the twentieth century. When the 'supply of eggs became exhausted we were pelted with over-ripe fruit, and at the end of the evening "one or two stones began to fly, consequently <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford,</inline> the  chairman,  and myself decided that discretion was the better part of valour, and retreated. At no time during the progress of that meeting did any of these constables attempt to protect us. That circumstance shows that there are in Queensland a number of police who are not giving effect to the Commonwealth law. </para>

                            <para>- I have not made the charge against the police force generally in Queensland. I have already stated  that I do not think the entire police force of that State would refuse to  give effect  to the Commonwealth law if they were instructed to do so. But many of them did not do so during the recent referendum campaign because of the example set by the Government of Queensland and because of the political control which appears to , be exercised over the Police Department. When I was in Rockhampton recently, I was assured by a gentleman who  occupies  a very high position in the Police Department of Queensland that he knew of a number of undesirable men against whom . action should be taken under the War Precautions Act, but on account of the political influence which is exercised over the Police Department he was unable to take it. </para>

                            <para>- lt is true that we have a Commissioner of Police in Queensland, but to a large extent his hands are tied by the political control that is exercised over his Department. Although, he has control of the actual working of the Department, I venture to . say that he has very much less power than had the late Commissioner Cahill. In view of the fact that there is work for the Commonwealth police to do there- is no reason why that body should be abolished. </para>

The Minister for Defence has clearly shown that there is work for these men to do- work the performance of which entitles them to the money that is being paid to them. In the light of his explanation, and because I believe that this motion was brought forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> merely for the purpose of reviving . the political feud which characterized the recent referendum campaign, I hope that it will be defeated. </para>

                        <para>. - I have listened carefully to the speeches of honorable senators opposite who have indicated their intention to vote against the motion, and paid particular attention to that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> I have a long acquaintance with him, and have always admired his ability to handle a question., but have never heard him at a greater disadvantage than he was at this evening, either inside or outside this building. I expected him to put forward some -argument why the Commonwealth Police Force should have been created, but throughout his address he adduced not a single argument of the necessity for such a ferce. It is true that at the conclusion . of his speech he indicated that some alteration was going to . take place, and that there was to be an amalgamation of . certain officials who have been acting : as policemen in other directions with a view to making their services effective, . but that was a most remarkable admission . on his part, ' that the force was created when there was . nothing for it to do. I will not reiterate the statements about the famous egg which, at Warwick, was the source from which this great Commonwealth Police Force sprang. </para>

                            <para>- It is their duty to spend the money of the Commonwealth in legitimate directions. I do not want them to spend their money individually in that direction, nor do I cavil at the expenditure of public money in proper directions, but it is ridiculous to tell me that there was justification for spending the public money on a Commonwealth Police Force. I am not one who believes in lawlessness. I have never supported it, and never will. I am not in sympathy with any citizen of the Commonwealth who tries to assault another, be he the Prime Minister or a private person. Every man or woman who commits a breach of the law, if found guilty, should be punished, so that I am not holding a brief for any set of larrikins such as the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> referred to, nor am I holding a brief for any section of the community in any State that would lend itself to lawlessness of any kind. I believe it is true that a demonstration took place on the Warwick station. I believe it is true that a certain egg was thrown at the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> but is that a justification for mulcting the taxpayers of the Commonwealth in the sum of £3,713 ? I do not think so. I have had some experience of public meetings, and during the military service referendum campaign of 1916 there was good and substantial cause for the creation of some force to protect my humble self. When in Albany on the 24th October of that year I essayed to address my constituents, "I was prevented from doing so, not by the people of Albany, but' by a number of New Zealand soldiers. It was not an egg, but it was eggs, and oranges, and similar missiles that were hurled at me. It may have been because of my diminutive stature, but none of them hit the mark; still the desire to hit me was there. The throwers were not good shots, although they were soldiers, but if the present Prime Minister had been the subject of the same attack, there is every possibility that a Commonwealth Police Force would have been established in Western Australia. </para>

The Minister for Defence, a responsible Minister of the Crown, brought forward as practically his only argument to buttress this wild action of his Government, the assumption that the Queensland Government refused to do something with their State police to assist a Commonwealth Department. He could not give the date, and has not done so yet. </para>

                    <para>Brushing to one side the fact that the offender at the Warwick station was arrested, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> showed by his quotation from the Queensland newspaper to-day, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> said he had evidence of independent witnesses of what happened to the Prime Minister at Warwick, in the shape of representatives of the press. Those were his independent witnesses. He tells those of us who have been associated with him for years that he regards the representatives of the press as independent witnesses of a scene that took place during the heat, controversy, and excitement of a .contest such as the last referendum campaign. I, for one, will not accept representatives of the press, or the press itself, as impartial witnesses under such conditions. I am not impugn, ing the honesty and integrity of individual reporters, but we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that they have to work und,er instructions. Their reports when sent in are sub-edited. Very often the report they send in from their own pens is not the report that emanates from the editor's office, and appears in the columns of the public press. It is the policy of the owners, and not the reports supplied by the reporters, that appears in the newspapers of this country. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> might have gone further, and, on the strength of his impartial witnesses - these members of the press - have told the dramatic story that appeared in the columns of the public press throughout Australia, to the effect that the Prime Minister, while on the platform at Warwick Station, saw a man there with a hammer and a spanner in his hand, and felt that the man was going to assault him. These " impartial witnesses " to whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> refers, drew a very lurid picture of what might have happened to this great Prime Minister of ours, confronted by this able-bodied man dressed in dungarees, and with a hammer and a spanner in his hand. Every paper in the land had about half a column of the incident, but after all, the man was merely an examiner of the train in which the Prime Minister travelled, and, having finished his task, was quite innocently standing on' the platform. This story, as I have said, was scattered broadcast throughout the Commonwealth, and probably, per medium of the cable, it was circulated also throughout the United Kingdom. </para>
                    <para>If there was any justification whatever for the establishment of the Commonwealth Police Force, I am surprised that Victoria has escaped a section of' that particular brigade, because shortly before the taking of the last referendum, the Prime Minister addressed a vast concourse of people on the Melbourne Cricket-ground, and I believe that there was some sort of disturbance, and, according to the press reports, officials the following morning discovered a sheath knife only 2 or 3 feet away from the platform on which the Prime Minister had been standing. Again the press got to work. Here was another attempt to assassinate the Prime Minister. Here, evidently, was a man with a sheath knife ready to drop it on the Prime Minister's head. What was the explanation of that? </para>

                            <para>- Subsequently, it was discovered that there was a telephone pole near the platform from which the Prime Minister spoke, and that a" telephone linesman who had been engaged upon work in that locality, had dropped his knife, which was found the following morning, though the deduction was that the knife was intended to fall upon the head of the Prime Minister. In view of this incident, why has not Victoria been favored with a branch of the Commonwealth Police Force ? We hear a lot about Inter-State jealousy, and I think Victoria might well be jealous of Queensland. And Western Australia, because of eggs thrown at me in Albany, might also be jealous. The" motion provides a splendid opportunity for honorable gentlemen on the other side to show whether or not, in their opinion, there is any necessity for the continuance of this force. I understand some honorable senators opposite are not in favour of it, especially as it was established in a time of panic; and I have seen statements in the press, also, that there was no necessity whatever for the appointments. I hope, therefore, that those honorable senators who have incidentally mentioned, their opposition to the action of the Government, will give practical: evidence of their views by voting in favour of the motion. </para>

                            <para>- I am not saying that the honorable senator made a direct charge against the Commissioner of Police but indirectly he did, when he said that official was under political control. Does the honorable senator mean to say that any official, occupying a position like that of the Commissioner of Police in Queensland, would be controlled by any Government when he had an Act of Parliament to protect him ? The Commissioner is not here to reply for himself, so I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll's</inline> statements will be published in the Queensland papers, and that the Commissioner pf Police in that State will furnish a reply. </para>

My question, to-day was comprehensive; but in questions 2 and 3, asking for the names and residences of the members of the Commonwealth Police Force the Minister for Defence furnished " No " as his reply. This means that although the Commonwealth is paying, according to. the answer given to-day, £3,713 for the maintenance of the Police Force, those who foot the Bill - the people of Australia - are not to know the names of members of that force. </para>

                            <para>- Now that is a sum in proportion which might well be worth working out. If one. egg thrown at the Prime Minister in December cost the country, four months later, £3,713, how much would twelve eggs so thrown cost? It is not so much the value of the egg, the odour, the age, or the breed of the hen that laid it that is . important. It is not even a question of who threw the egg. The important question is : " At whom was it thrown?" It might have been thrown at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll, Senator Pearce,. Senator Long,</inline> or even at- myself, without any risk of expenditure', but- having been thrown at the Prime- Minister, and whether it hit him or not, it cost us £3,713. </para>

                        who. interjects, apparently believes that' for every egg thrown there should be a Commonwealth Police Force established. The whole thing from beginning to end has been a farce, and continues to be so. The only serious factor is that the Commonwealth is spending this money upon a force which is doing nothing. In the various States there are police; any citizen may ascertain the name of any policeman, and can see his number.

He was not included in the last additions -to the 'Ministry, although probably he expected that he might have been,, and, possibly, had he been, the Government would have been considerably strengthened. But until he has attained Ministerial rank I do not accept his reply to such a question as I have asked. I would like the Minister for Defence to inform the public of the names, and why they are kept secret. </para>

My reason is that the taxpayers should know the names of the officials whose salaries they are paying. I am not asking the names for victimization. I do not know the names, nor do I desire to know them for any ulterior motive.  Every 'member of the Commonwealth Police Force is, I dare say, an honest and reputable citizen ; I am imputing nothing against their individual character. I desire the information for no reason other than public purposes.

                            <para>- If there are larrikins in Queensland - people who will not obey the law - there is another way of dealing with them rather than to saddle this country with an expenditure like this. The Commonwealth police were established at a time of panic, and for the reason that the Prime Minister happened to meet with the same 3ort of treatment that both members of this Parliament and private citizens have experienced in the course of hotly-conducted campaigns. I hold no brief for any lawless person, but there are times when public opinion is excited, and things are often done which would not occur under ordinary conditions To say that as the outcome of the few minutes in which a train was standing at the Warwick station, and the Hughes incident occurred, we should be saddled with the upkeep and general cost of a Commonwealth Police Force is beyond all reason. No honorable senator opposite has uttered a word in justification of the force. The statement of the Minister for Defence to-day was an apology rather than a justification. By supporting the motion to repeal this regulation honorable senators will be instructing the Government to wipe out the Commonwealth police. </para>

                        <para>. - When the National party was elected, with a triumphant majority, many diversified political opinions in Australia came together on one common platform, namely, that we all pledged ourselves to do what we could to_ help win the war. As a unit among the Nationalists, so far as I remember, that is what we pledged ourselves to do; and generally that pledge has been honoured. The Government have passed through most difficult times - times of stress and times of improvisation. They have in some instances done things that they ought not to have done, and in others have left undone things that they ought to have done. During the nine months in which the present National Government have had the guidance of the destinies of Australia they have endeavoured to do what they considered in the best interests of the public. They have fallen short in some cases, and the Opposition in this and in- another Chamber must share part of the responsibility for those shortcomings. </para>

On this present occasion we are faced with a matter of administration and not of policy. The question before the Senate is that of not allowing a certain regulation which, if disallowed, will make the creation of the Commonwealth Police Force <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.</inline> I do not intend to give a silent vote on this matter. . I shall support the motion. A good deal has been said about party. We on this side have a right from time to time to express our free and individual opinions; and, for certain . reasons which I shall give, I must say that I am not taken with this administrative act of the Government. I wish to approach the subject on the evidence before us. 'The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> in reply to the mover of the motion, gave the reasons why this regulation should be allowed.I was pleased to listen to the same honorable gentleman yesterday, when, in such forceful language, he stated that many of the regulations that he had to put into operation , were repugnant to him and to the Democracy of Australia or of any country. The War Precautions Act is vitally necessary because of the position in which Australia finds itself to-day; but I think that the Government should generally administer that Statute on the lines of the minimum interference with the public liberty. The reasons advanced by the Minister for Defence why this regulation should stand were three in number. In the first place he urged that the Queensland Government had not replied to a communication from the Commonwealth Government in regard to the administration by the Queensland authorities of the Unlawful Associations Act. Now if honorable senators will cast their minds back a little while, they will recall that that Act was finally passed by this Chamber about the middle of September last. Probably the regulations in connexion with it were not framed until a few weeks later, so that no communication was perhaps made to the Queensland Government on the matter until the middle of October. Now we all know that the wheels of government grind exceeding slowly at times, even if they grind exceeding small eventually, and it is hot an unusual thing for a communication from one Government to another to be delayed, say, for a month or two. We have had an illustration of that, in connexion with communications that have passed between the Government of  New  South Wales and the Commonwealth Government. But very little more than two months could have elapsed between the communication of the Federal Government with the Queensland authorities and the actual establishment of the Commonwealth Police Force. </para>

Of course, if the Act were passed six or eight weeks prior to the time I have suggested, my argument is correspondingly weakened. Then the Minister stated that some communication had been made by the Commissioner of Taxation to the Queensland Government in connexion with the administration of the income tax collection, and that, whereas the Premiers of every other State had agreed to the Commonwealth's proposal, the Queensland Premier had refused to agree to it. We have yet to learn whether this action was taken before or after the establishment of the Commonwealth Police Force. </para>

                            <para>- So that in this particular 'instance Queensland did not stand alone. The third argument used by the Minister in favour of the retention of this regulation was that an attempt would shortly be made to co-ordinate and collaborate other sections of watchmen in various Departments with the Commonwealth Police Force. Now I hold that the establishment of this force was, at all events, a hasty action. I do not wish to discuss the historic Warwick incident, or to base any arguments upon it. I prefer to take the broader view concerning the privileges of this Parliament. The Minister has told us that there are forty-seven members of the Commonwealth Police Force, and that up to the present time this body has cost about £3,500. Now, any tyro in arithmetical calculations must see that such a force will cost the Commonwealth at least £12,000 a year. But that is not the only circumstance we have to consider. The Government have created a new Department by an act of administration - a Department which has nothing whatever to do with the war, which has nothing whatever to do with the safety of Australia outside Australia, and which has nothing whatever to do with international questions. It is a Department which relates entirely to a matter of internal administration, and the Government would have been well advised if before creating this force they had submitted to Parliament a Bill to authorize their action, so that the measure might have been discussed and settled in the ordinary constitutional way. In my opinion, the establishment of the Commonwealth Police Force was a hasty act of administration, which was both unwarranted and unnecessary, and on these grounds I shall feel it my duty to vote against the continuance of this regulation, so that if the motion be carried it will render <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> the establishment of the Commonwealth Police Force. </para>

                        for the disallowance of this regulation, I wish to express my pleasure at finding at least one honorable senator opposite possessed of sufficient temerity to stand up in this branch of the National Parliament and defend the action of the Government in connexion with the creation of this - I was almost going to say - bogus police force.

                        defence of the Government was, from his point of view, no doubt a strong one.  His  attempt to justify" the establishment of the Commonwealth Police Force for the purpose of enforcing the law was one to which nobody could take exception, and I think it is a pity that he did not stop there.  It is to be regretted that he allowed himself to hurl an absolutely nu justifiable charge at an officer in Queensland whose responsibility it is to administer the law that is directly under his control - I refer to the Commissioner of "Police. The honorable senator must know that that officer is just as free from political control as is the Public Service Commissioner of the Commonwealth. But in his anxiety to have a dig at his political opponents
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline>
                        hurled indirectly a most cruel slander at a man who is not. in a position to defend himself. The honorable senator must know that the Commissioner of Police in Queensland, protected as he is by an Act of Parliament specially designed to free him from political control, would resent any interference on the part of the Government of that State with the duties which he is called upon to discharge. That was the one blemish upon the defence put up by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline>

                    <para class="block">Now, what laws of the Commonwealth call for special enforcement in Queensland but not in any other State ?

I am sure the honorable senator realized, as we do, and as I know other honorable senators opposite do in their hearts, that the sum of £12,000 odd to be expended for this purpose is badly needed for distribution amongst the women and children whom the soldiers at the- Front have left behind. These have to go to the various pay branches and approach the officers, cap in hand, with the object of getting a little more to enable them to pay the ever-increasing domestic bills. The appeals, even to members of Parliament, in that connexion must -often go unheard. Although these women and children have to be denied those tilings that are necessary for their existence, we actually find senators on the other side applauding the Government for that unjustifiable and absurd expenditure on the Commonwealth Police Force. I make this prophecy to-night - that the members on the other side who vote for the retention of the regulation will lave to answer for it the next time they face the political footlights. The names of the members of the Commonwealth Police Force are to be kept secret from the people who have to pay them. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps some of the gentlemen who were giving us free advice and information to-night in the absence of the Minister can tell us. Since the election in Queensland, which did not turn out at all in accordance with the . expectations of honorable senators on the opposite side, and, perhaps, of the Government, the Government have found it necessary to remove the head-quarters to New South Wales. I suppose the political situation being definitely settled in Queensland, they thought it advisable on account of the political unrest amongst the National party in Sydney to send some of the Commonwealth police there to keep their eyes on Holman and Hall. I am not prepared to say whether there is any connexion direct or indirect between the slow, but sure, disintegration that has set in in the National or Win-the-War party in New South Wales, and the removal of the head-quarters of the police to Sydney, but if it is so honorable senators will see the advantage of keeping the names of the Commonwealth police secret. They can act as political spies on behalf of the Government. Goodness knows how long they will stay in Sydney. Perhaps there will be some of them over here. No doubt there were a few in South Australia during the recent election. If we could ascertain the real sentiments in the hearts of honorable senators opposite,I am certain that we should find that they regard the new police force as just as big a farce as we do. I wish we could induce them to show the public spirit exhibited to-night by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> to criticise fairly and openly the action of the Government, and announce their intention to end the farce and relieve the taxpayer of the altogether useless and unnecessary burden of £12,000 a year for the maintenance of the. new force. </para>

I am not at all sure that without this regulation the Commonwealth Government could not have established a police force. As an Executive in a responsible Government they have all the powers possessed by any Executive in any of the States. It has the powers, .within the limits of Commonwealth jurisdiction, that the Executive of the United Kingdom has within the United Kingdom. I am not sure that the police power of any State does not extend to the responsibility of the Administration in time of trouble, by Executive action, to meet an emergency. </para>

There is, too, I believe, something in the nature of a police force in connexion with the Customs Department - intelligence officers and revenue detectives to protect the revenue. </para>

We may cavil at paragraph 2 as to its form or need for. the purpose to be achieved. I do not think it was needed at all, and I do not see that we shall be achieving any purpose whatever by annulling it, because the Government, I contend, have an inherent power to establish a police force. </para>

                            <para>- No. We often see regulations which, in my opinion, are absolutely unnecessary in connexion with various Acts passed." They are only so much extra printing, and are mere assertion, in regulation form, of the inherent  power of the Government. This is not the first regulation by any means which in my judgment is absolutely unnecessary. I am not speaking, of course, of regulations as a whole, but of a good substantial percentage of them. Unlike <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> I do not think that annulling the regulation will make the establishment of the police force <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires,</inline> because I still think that the Government have an inherent power to establish such a body. If the constitutionality of the police force depends on the regulation, it will be constitutional until we annul the regulation, and responsibility incurred by the Government financially in respect of members of the police force will still be a constitutional obligation, valid and enforceable against the Government. </para>

                    <para>As far as the practical and actual need of this police force is concerned, I very much doubt the wisdom of the Government in establishing it. </para>
                    <para>I am not going to deal with the complaint that the force was appointed in a moment of panic. That is, I think, generally recognised; but I do not know that we would contribute much of value to the debate by entering into details concerning the circumstances of the panic, as it may be called, leading to the appointment of police. I think the Government were ill-advised in establishing the police force, and they will be badly advised if they make the existing force the nucleus of a Commonwealth police establishment. There are many Commonwealth matters in connexion with which it is necessary that there should be police activity. The framers of the Constitution contemplated this, for it is provided in section 5 - a covering provision - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>This Act and all laws made by the Parliament of the Commonwealth under the Constitution, shall be binding on the Courts, Judges, and people of every State, and of every part of the Commonwealth, notwithstanding anything in the laws of any State; and the laws of the Commonwealth shall be in force on all British ships, .... I desire to draw particular attention to the first portion of this section, providing as it does that all the laws of the Commonwealth shall be binding on all the Courts, Judges, and all the people of the several States. If we pass laws imposing certain duties upon the police, and those laws operate, and we make provision in certain sections of some of our Statutes, directly with regard to police officers, justices, magistrates, and Judges, although they may be State officials, all such officials are bound by this covering provision of the Constitution to administer that Commonwealth law. On occasions, it has been customary to allow State police officers to be used to assist in Federal administration in various ways. I know that, in former years, they were employed to help in keeping the Federal rolls, and while I was a Minister, we passed a law enabling the Commonwealth and State Governments to co-operate in electoral matters. I succeeded, in conjunction with the State authorities in Tasmania, in securing co-operation, and as a result it is not now necessary to use the police in connexion with general electoral work in Tasmania, because the Commonwealth law obliges the elector himself to enroll, as well as to register his removal from one district to another, and all those operations in connexion with which the police were previously engaged to secure the purification of the rolls, are now being performed automatically, so to speak, by the elector. Seeing that, in Tasmania, we have one roll for Commonwealth and State purposes, and only one set of officials, the compulsory provisions of the Commonwealth roll obviate the necessity of State police being engaged on State electoral work. </para>

                            <para>- We may have designated police as officials to whom certain references were to be made, but we have not invariably said that the police shall take action in these matters. When I used the word "police" in that connexion, I referred also to the fact that certain magistrates, justices of the peace, and Judges have been specifically mentioned in our Act, so that they cannot turn round and say, '* We are officials of the State." The covering provision of the Constitution to which I have already referred lays it down that laws passed by the Commonwealth shall be binding on the Courts and Judges of the State. We can make provision imposing upon State police an obligation to carry out Commonwealth laws. That is what we have been doing so far, but by taking this recent action the Government have intimated practically that they could not rely upon the State police forces in all circumstances, and so had resolved to appoint their own officers'. These officials have been appointed at a higher rate of pay than for the corresponding positions under the State Governments, and naturally the States do not like that, believing that they would have the leavings among the eligibles, and the Commonwealth would have the pick. As soon as the appointments were announced, policemen in my own State came to me, and asked how best they could get into the Commonwealth Service, but I advised them to leave the matter alone as the permanence of the new force was uncertain. </para>

                    <para>There is a great  borderland of jurisdiction between Commonwealth and State, and the State authorities in the future, keeping in view the creation of the Commonwealth Police Force, might well say to the Commonwealth, " This is your responsibility," while the Commonwealth authorities might in their turn say, "No; this is a State responsibility." In such circumstances the people as a whole would suffer. That is why I think the Government should walk warily in "the matter of appointing a Commonwealth Police Force, and that is why I think the nucleus of a permanent force should not be built up on skeleton provisions contained in this regulation, even if such a force were necessary. Apart from any consideration of what happened at Warwick, the States might very well turn round, if they feel aggrieved at the establishment of the Commonwealth Police Force, and say, " Very well, why don't you appoint your own justices of the peace?" Why do you not appoint your own special and stipendiary magistrates, and pay them ? Our stipendiary magistrates, whom we pay, and for whose services you do not pay one penny, have been hearing all your cases. Appoint your own stipendiary magistrates. Appoint your own justices of the peace. Get your own Court-houses. Build your own prisons. Appoint your own coroners. Have your own 'inquests." If somebody is drowned on a sea voyage between one State and another, or is killed in an accident, in similar circumstances,, it may be said, " This is an Inter-State matter. Have your own inquest. It is a Commonwealth affair," Again, we have a great volume of work awaiting some police - and I do not care whether it is State or Common- wealth. I refer to- the constant,, chronic, petty and- grand pilfering- and pillaging going on between State and State on all ocean-borne and Inter-State traffic and commerce. Day and night* every day in the week, it. is going- on. We in Tasmania have, been' suffering tremendously from it. Who is going to attend to it - the- State police in Tasmania, ' Victoria, New South Wales, or any of the other States? Will they not say, "Here is your Commonwealth police;, get them on to the Inter-State traffic crimes and offences." Apparently, nobody is attending to it now. I agree that there is work for the Commonwealth police, if it is properly and systematically established. Then there is other work which is being done very efficiently in all- the States by the State police. That is with respect to inquiries concerning missing persons. I noticed in a. police report from New South Wales that among 1,400 inquiries by the police in that State for persons missing either from abroad dr from another of the States, something like 1,000 were traced. All these inquiries related to people not permanently in New South Wales. The authorities of that State might well say, therefore, "Go to the Commonwealth police. We have nothing to do with persons from outside our State. We will only look after our own citizens missing within our own borders, or inquiries from New South Wales residents. ' ' Then- there is the question of the supervision of weights and measures. The State police might say, " We will take no notice of weights and measures being used for InterState commerce or business abroad." There are still other matters that might crop up. Supposing the slightest element of friction were to occur between State and Commonwealth - as there might well be. We have the case of the Minister for Defence exercising his power under the War Precautions regulations and declaring that in a certain port on a certain day all licensed places shall be closed so far as the sale of intoxicants is concerned. Might not the State authorities be justified in saying, " We are not going to turn our police on to this duty. They have enough to do in-, looking after licensed ' houses in ordinarily closed hours. Put your Commonwealth police on the job- of seeing that your Commonwealth proclamation is enforced " ?- I note in a newspaper this evening that the Federal </para>
                    <para class="block">Treasurer has brought in a regulation wherein it is provided that, notwith-  standing any law in any State, lotteries having for their object subscriptions to the war loan shall be legal. In some of the States, exception might even be taken to that, and it may be that a certain amount of police supervision ' would be required in regard to the administration of conflicting laws. It might be said, " What is the Commonwealth force doing?" If, therefore, we are going to establish such a body, it should- be done carefully, systematically, and with due regard to the past activities of the States, and to their present and prospective activities in respect to tne inforcement of the laws of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>Altogether, there are too many details for us in considering whether the existing Commonwealth force is justified. I do not intend to vote for the motion to annul a regulation which, in my opinion, was absolutely unnecessary so far as the existing force is concerned. I do not think the annulment of this regulation will knock the Commonwealth police out of existence. There is another means of expressing an opinion upon the continuance or otherwise of the Commonwealth, police. But unless the Government were prepared to enter upon a policy of establishing the nucleus of a permanent force, and of justifying that action by giving Parliament an opportunity of considering the whole subject, then I would not be prepared to continually give my support when it came to the granting of Supply. The Government might well have some scheme to submit if it is proposed to establish the Common wealth police as a permanency; and they might give the Parliament an opportunity of dealing with the broad general outlines for regulating the existence of such a force. I am not going to call in question this regulation,, or even the exercise of the power in establishing this new force. I do not know what the nature of the force is, except from what I have heard to-day, and I do not like provision being made in this way for such an elusive body. Therefore I cannot support the motion, but that does not mean that when the Estimates are before us I shall, without further justification from the Government, indefinitely support the existence Of a body in respect of which Parliament knows so little. </para>

                    <para class="block">So that in regard to any of the powers conferred on the Commonwealth Parliament by the Constitution, I offer a layman's opinion that this Parliament has power to institute a Commonwealth Police Force. But if the present force has been instituted under a regulation promulgated by virtue of the War Precautions Act, then it is essentially a war force. If the regulations under that Act are necessary to the creation of the Commonwealth police, then the force would necessarily cease to have existence when the instruments by which it was created automatically ceased to have legislative force; and that is what the regulation must do when the War Precautions Act itself ' ceases to be. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has been pretty clear upon this matter, but while he has expressed an opinion to the effect that the Commonwealth police can be created without recourse to a regulation under the War Precautions Act, it seems that there may be some conflict of legal opinion, seeing that the legal advisers of the Government considered that a regulation under the War Precautions Act was necessary. If the police force depends on this regulation, clearly it must cease to be when the Act itself and the regulations under which it is promulgated cease to have effect. That will be six months after the war. In certain circumstances it may be very necessary for the Commonwealth to create a police force, and exercise police powers. I will not say that it ought to be a mere duplication of the State Police Forces. But it may be necessary, by reason of the circumstance that certain functions of government have been absolutely transferred to the Commonwealth, for the Federal authority to create a police force to see that the laws enacted by this Parliament are carried out. Now, I differentiate between the Executive act which created the Commonwealth Police Force and the machinery by which it was created. Honorable senators who resent some act of administration because of the existence of a particular regulation promulgated under the War Precautions Act, invariably take the course of attempting to destroy the machinery by which that administrative act was performed. I venture to say that that is a childish action. If the Commandant at the Heads at Queenscliff fired, by mistake, upon some vessel, and his action had to be repudiated, it would not follow that the forts there should be dismantled. Consequently, I claim that if the Commonwealth law authorities deem it necessary to frame a regulation under which a Commonwealth Police Force can be created, that machinery should be allowed to stand. There are means by which I can enter my legitimate objection to the continued existence of such a force, and, at the same time. I may be perfectly consistent in permitting the machinery, by virtue of which that force was created, to endure. To a certain extent, I believe that we have been beating the wind during the course of this debate, because, according to the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll,</inline> the Commonwealth Police Force is to have a speedy termination put to its existence. If that assertion be true, and if the members of the force have been notified that at the end of three months their services will not be required-- </para>

                            <para>- But common sense tells us that if the force is to be extinguished in three months, the expenditure that has already been incurred is not likely to be greatly increased. I pass no judgment whatever upon the particular administrative act which created the Commonwealth Police Force. My knowledge of the circumstances in which it had its genesis is general rather than particular, and, consequently, I am not competent to say off-hand whether or not the action of the Government was justified. The creation of this force may have been justified, but, on the other hand, the force may be a superfluous one. I suspend my judgment upon that matter, but when we are discussing the Estimates I reserve to myself the right to say that the force ought to be extinguished. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Seeing the perils which surround us, and believing that the intention of the framers of our Constitution was that in certain circumstances the Commonwealth might be justified in establishing its own police force, I do not deem myself warranted in voting to destroy the machinery by which it was created merely because I may not perhaps approve of a legislative act performed through its instrumentality. </para>

                        <para>. - I am not . too satisfied as to how I shall vote on this proposal until debate upon it has been exhausted. I have been endeavouring to weigh the arguments both for and against the motion, and whilst I am not prepared, in the absence of fuller information, to say whether it is necessary to continue the existence of the Commonwealth Police Force, taking everything into account, I do not feel justified in voting for the annulment of the regulation. I view the position from a different stand-point from that adopted by previous speakers. It has been said that this regulation is the result of a panic, which was created during the recent referendum campaign. It is alleged that the throwing of an egg was responsible for the creation of the Commonwealth. Police Force. But while visible signs are often the direct means of creating a great <inline font-style="italic">furore,</inline> it should be remembered that other attendant conditions are necessary before those signs can produce such extraordinary results. We have all heard the story of the cow which gave a kick that resulted in the destruction by fire of Chicago. Many a cow has kicked from the time that cow kicked, though not with such an awful result. Similarly, other eggs have been thrown in the past, but a Commonwealth Police Force has not been evolved from them. What I wish to impress upon honorable senators is that before the throwing of the egg at Warwick there was apparent amongst certain sections of the community a disposition to ignore, and sometimes to deliberately bring into contempt, the laws enacted by this Parliament. The sum of £12,000 has been mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> as the net loss to the Commonwealth in twelve months, as the result of the establishment of this Commonwealth Police Force. But I would remind him that that is a mighty small atom compared with the mischievous effect which might be produced by tolerating in our midst a growing sentiment against the observance of the law of the land constitutionally framed. </para>

                            <para>- In connexion with the services which they have been rendering to- the Commonwealth, there has been a growing feeling of discontent on the part of every State, Treasurer for some time past. I know of one very respectable account which was presented by the Treasurer of Western Australia to the Commonwealth for work performed by the police of that State. The same remark is applicable to other State Treasurers, who think that their police organizations re doing much, more work for the Commonwealth than they are being paid for doing. If the establishment of the Commonwealth Police Force achieves nothing else, it ought to relieve the State Treasurers of these complaints. I have heard some honorable senators who have supported this motion .criticise the Government for not observing the law. I have heard them complain of the edicts of the fruit commissioner, and of the action of the censors Ll enforcing the law. Yet when the very first step is taken to insure its observance they condemn the Government for having established a Commonwealth Police Force. Such critics get themselves into a nasty tangle when, on the one hand, they criticise the Government for not doing things, and, on the other, condemn it because they have done certain things. Coming to the Unlawful Associations Act, it is a rather serious position to find that at least two States have refused to co-operate with the Common wealth in saying that nothing should be left undone to put down the particular association at which the Statute was aimed. </para>

I would remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> that we cannot reduce to £ s. d. the loss that the Federal Treasury has sustained through the non-performance of their duties by the police in two of the States. But that amount should be set against the £12,000 mentioned by him as the cost of the Commonwealth Police Force over a period of twelve months. Evidently the Federal Treasury has suffered a loss of revenue. </para>

                    <para>I am not too comfortable about voting against the motion, but if I vote for it it will mean censuring the Government for what they have done, and destroying at one stroke the nucleus of a Commonwealth Police Force. I realize that a justification exists for the creation of a force of some kind, and, therefore, cannot vote for the annulment of the regulation. To do so would not only abolish the existing organization, but annul the whole power of the Government to create one. As the Minister said, a Departmental Committee is now sitting, and about to report as to the aims, scope, and functions of a Commonwealth Police Force, which, although not perhaps recognised as an ordinary police force, will do departmental duty on a more enlarged scale than those already employed. As to the affair that happened at Warwick, if the report I read in Western Australia is correct, it is high time that something was done to see that the law is enforced. </para>

Honorable senators know that Treasurers in the past have complained about the non-performance of work for Federal purposes. That grievance still exists, and if the -creation of this force helps to relieve the friction between the Treasurers of the States and the Federal Treasurer, by having duties of that kind done in a straightforward way under Federal authority, a good purpose will be served. I shall vote against the motion, but I shall not do so enthusiastically. </para>

                            <para>- I have no intention to do so. The creation of the Commonwealth Police Force, notwithstanding the statements to the contrary by the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> is solely due to the fact that some stale hen fruit was thrown at and struck the prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> at Warwick. I fail to see why honorable senators should not recognise that that is the main, and, in fact, the only, reason why the force has been created. The Government are afraid, for reasons best known to themselves, to disclose the names of the new police. Why? What are they used for? Are they doing anything, or have they done anything whatever ? So far as we know they have not, except that we are informed by the Minister for Defence that they have assisted in discovering some contraband goods at Brisbane, and it does not even follow that they were solely responsible for that work. There is something about this business that ought not to be tolerated. There is no justification for the Government keeping the names from the public. We know the names of every member of the State Police Force, and all' about them. Their names are tabulated., and they can be looked up, but the Minister will not disclose the names or any other particulars of the men the Government have recently appointed. i'he panic into which the Prime Minister allowed himself to be thrown on account of the trivial incident at Warwick has surely passed away, and having expended some thousands of pounds in consequence of that temporary condition, the Government should now see their way clear to discontinue any further expenditure in that direction. If the force is to be continued it will cost tile country approximately £12,000 a year. If it is discontinued even in three months it will have cost about £6r000. </para>

The Queensland Government are expending over £302,000 per year on their police, who, according to the last return, number 1737. On top of that, and. in opposition to the wishes of the Queensland Government, the Commonwealth Government purpose to foist another forty-seven on them, apparently for, an indefinite period. There are throughout the Commonwealth approxi,mately 7,000' police, costing annually, in round figures, £1,600,000, so that we have quite enough of them. They are well able to do their work, and- do it with a very fair degree of effectiveness. I shall vote to disallow the regulation. </para>

                        <para>, - I have listened with a considerable amount of care to the debate in the hope of hearing some justification for the establishment of the Commonwealth police, and I must say, in all sincerity, that I never saw in all my life a poorer case put- up than has been advanced on this occasion. I believe that from one end of Australia to the other the new force is a huge laughing-stock. If there was any good reason given for the establishment of such a force other than what it. is believed to be, the outcome of that little fracas at Warwick", it might be justified, but nobody has come within coo-ee of justifying the amount of expenditure involved for such a purpose. </para>

                            <para>- I admire the clever manner in which Senators Bakhap and Keating dealt with that phase of the question. They differentiated between the machinery and the establishment of the force. But the public are not much concerned about the machinery. What they are concerned about is the huge farce of establishing a force to do nothing. I have not the faintest, doubt that honorable senators opposite, almost to a man, disapprove of its establishment just as much as I do. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> mentioned that he was waited upon by some members of the force in Queensland, who intimated that they had been given three months' notice of the termination of their engagement.-I have no doubt that is true, and that it applies practically to the whole of the force. I believe, also, that the notice will be made effective, and that this discussion will, if anything, hasten it. </para>

                    <para>I wish to remove a slight misapprehension that, might be created by an incident that happened this afternoon. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> mentioned that these policemen had interviewed him, I could not help smiling, and he remarked that I might smile, but these men were in dread of being in want.- I was not smiling at the suggestion that men would lose their employment, because nobody is more sympathetic than I am when men are placed in that position; but it waa somewhat amusing that men, upon receiving notice of the termination of their appointment, should wait upon a member of Parliament to see if something could be done for them. When they took on the job they evidently knew that it would not last, but still they tried to fmd a member of Parliament, in order to secure a continuance of employment. In any case, they are not the only men who are called upon to face hardships. 'There are thousands of men in the community' in that position. </para>

If that is done, there will be an increased burden on the people of Australia, and at a time, too, when we should have economy for our watchword. There are thousands of avenues for the better expenditure of this money, and I hope that, notwithstanding how the vote may go this evening, the Government will realize that the people of Australia are determined that the force shall not be continued. </para>

                        <para>. - I shall have very little to say on this subject. I intend, of course, to vote for the motion for the very obvious reason that the establishment of the police force is absolutely unnecessary and a wilful waste of money. The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> in the course of his remarks, endeavoured to show that the appointment of the police was not a panic act on the part of the . Government : that it was not established simply because somebody threw a rather stale egg at the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> but because of other disturbances which the Prime Minister said had occurred during his career along the Queensland railways. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> scouted the idea that the Warwick incident was responsible for the appointment of the police. I do not wish to detain the Senate by quoting from files of newspapers, but if any senator cares to look up the press reports of that time he will find that according to the Prime Minister's own statement those disturbances, or alleged disturbances, at Warwick were responsible for. the creation of this police force. There is urgent need for economy, end every' senator, -therefore, should vote to repeal this regulation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> endeavoured to show that it would not matter whether the regulation were repealed or not, as, in his opinion, the police force could still be retained, and though his constitutional knowledge would not allow him to be positive on the point, apparently he believes that the Constitution vests the Government with inherent power to continue the police force, as well as to establish a similar force in the other States. It is rather difficult to follow <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating's</inline> line of reasoning, because, although fie was at some pains to show the absolute absurdity of the action of the Government, he closed by saying that he would not vote for the repeal of fee regulation. . Fully nine-tenths of the people are convinced that this force is unnecessary, but because, of the exigencies of party politics I have no doubt the majority in the Senate will be against the motion. We ought, however, to get away from party politics in a matter like this, involving the unnecessary expenditure of several thousands of pounds. </para>

                            <para>- That is an entirely different matter. This action by the Government in appointing the Commonwealth police stands by itself, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell's</inline> interjection has proved' my argument. He said that, in 1916, the State police, for some reason or other, were not carrying out certain important Federal work ; but it was not until the end of 1917 that the Federal Police Force was created, and, as was said by a  speaker  in another place, these appointments were the result of a rotten egg. It is difficult to understand how members can justify the appointments, but I presume that they will vote on party lines, and that, although they believe it is unnecessary to continue the police force, they will be found voting against the motion. </para>

                            <para>- The reports which I read certainly did. The man whom the Prime Minister requested the  police to arrest was an individual very well known to the police. In giving evidence against him one of the police witnesses said that if that person ever went to Toowoomba the police in that town gave him twenty-four hours to leave the place. Only a fortnight afterwards this same man was brought before a Court for assault and was sentenced to two months' imprisonment without the option of a fine. </para>

                            <para>- They took very little action to protect the Prime Minister and no action to .protect others who spoke in favour of conscription. I heartily indorse all that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> said in regard to his and my own experiences in the northern part of our State. There is a serious principle involved in what both <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> have told us concerning the attitude of the Queensland Government upon the enforcement of the Commonwealth laws, and in regard to laws which were enforced in other States having no effect in Queensland. Honorable senators passed the Unlawful Associations Act; yet nothing has been done to enforce that j law in Queensland, and, as a consequence, the members of the Industrial Workers of the World have been deliberately concentrating in the northern part of our State within the past six or eight months. Last season 300 members of the Industrial Workers of the World were employed in the Alligator Creek Meat Works. They had their own press, and published several issues of their own paper, <inline font-style="italic">Direct Action.</inline> No action was taken to prevent that by the State police. </para>

Nobody will dispute <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating's</inline> contention that the Commonwealth Government had the power to do this under the War. Precautions Act, or constitutionally.

I hold that the establishment of this force will set every State upon its mettle, and that each will say it must be paid by the Commonwealth for performing Commonwealth services, or else that the Commonwealth will have to do the work for itself. It is a direct invitation. The two strongest arguments in the denunciation of this system have been furnished by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell.</inline> I regret that the Minister for Defence should have descended to the depths he did in his speech. Honorable members generally adopted a much higher tone in debate than did the Minister. He cast on the police force of Queensland, and on the people of that State generally, aspersions which were totally unwarranted. He referred to Industrial Workers of the World, to larrikinism, to hostile demonstrations, and to all that sort of thing; but for once he got away from his pet delusion about German gold. He did not accuse anybody in Queensland in that respect. On behalf of the Queensland police, and of the people generally, 1 hurl back at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> the slanders which he applied to them so unwarrantably. It has rarely come under our notice that there have been deliberate attempts at misrepresentation or suppression in this chamber. I do not say that the Minister has deliberately done so now, but he has been guilty of the suppression of information amounting to that worst kind of a lie of all, namely, a half truth. He said that Queensland had refused to lend its police force in connexion with taxation purposes; and it was only when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> dragged it out of him that the Minister stated that there was another State also which had refused similarly. The Minister for Defence has not told us which State it was, but would only give the information that Queensland had refused. And that was the reason he advanced for the establishmen of the Commonwealth police there. If there be any foundation for his statement, the Commonwealth should have established a police force in the other </para>

                            <para>- If there be any virtue in the argument that a Commonwealth Police Force is necessary in Queensland, it is manifest that a similar body is equally necessary in each of the other States. In regard to the Warwick incident, I merely wish to say that I have photographs in my possession which show <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> in the act of delivering his address, protected by Sergeant Kenny. In the local conscriptionist newspaper the statement appears that the sergeant got up and appealed to the people to give the right honorable gentleman a hearing. All this took place within the brief space of thirteen minutes. But for the lateness of the hour I should put into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> column after column for the purpose of showing there is absolutely no foundation for the aspersions which have been cast upon the police of Queensland. The people of that State have no desire to read such matter, because they are familiar with all the facts of the case. Those of us who know <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> and who read the reports which appeared in the big daily newspapers, can trace the Hughes journalese throughout it. For instance, there was a description' of how the blood was pouring from his fingers, and how he had dealt it out to his ' opponent. All this descriptive matter was typed between Warwick and Wallangara, by two hired newspaper reporters. Knowing the temperament of the Prime Minister, I can understand this, but I cannot understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> attempting to justify the continuance of the Commonwealth Police Force. I trust that honorable senator will give a direction to the Government to discontinue its maintenance. Only this afternoon a Government supporter in another place referred to the continuance of that force as an absolute scandal and a waste of public money. These are the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boyd.</inline> To those who support the Government in the continuance of this extravagance we shall look in wonder when in this chamber they rise and preach economy. </para>

How, therefore, anybody can say that my action is prompted by vindictiveness passes my comprehension. It has further been said that the disbandment of the Commonwealth Police Force would amount to the victimization of its members. </para>

Yet honorable senators have the temerity to complain of the victimization of men whose services will not be dispensed with for three months. I say that such men are very lucky.
