          </quote>
          <para class="block">With the exception of one clause, this is largely a machinery measure. Honorable senators will recognise that, when the first Excise Bill was introduced in this Parliament in 1901, a somewhat complicated condition of things required to be dealt with, owing to the varying arrangements adopted in the different States, and the transfer of the State Customs Departments to the Commonwealth. There were, in addition, some special conditions in the Customs and Excise Acts applying to the State of Western Australia. It is intended by this Bill to repeal certain sections of the existing Excise Act, the operation of which has been exhausted by the process of time. One important clause of the Bill to which I direct attention proposes an increase of from 100 to 200 per cent, in the licence fees charged in connexion with the manufacture of tobacco. When the existing schedule was drawn up, the manufacture of tobacco in the Commonwealth was distributed amongst a good many factories. To-day, there is a concentration of its manufacture, and we have some very hig firms operating in a large way whose factories require the supervision of two, three, or even four Excise officers. The object of tho pro- . posed increase of fees is not to derive revenue, but to secure that the cost to the Government of the services of Excise officers appointed for the convenience of private firms engaged in the manufacture of tobacco shall be recouped by the licence fees imposed. There are no vital questions involved in the Bill, and there is no attempt to increase the fees charged to the smaller firms. The Bill is one which can be better dealt with in Committee. </para>

          <para>I wish to say that its purpose is to secure parliamentary authority to appropriate &#163;454,951 for new works, buildings, &#38;c. This amount is &#163;802,666 less than the provision which was made in 1917-18, when the total amount for these purposes estimated to be payable out of revenue was &#163;1,257,617. Provision has been made only for the completion of works already in progress, and the commencement of works of an urgent nature. Consequently, the Estimates now submitted are &#163;541,172 less than the amount which the Departments originally asked to be provided for the services of the year. The principal items included in the Bill are as follow: - -Quarantine buildings, &#163;25,183; erection of drill halls and ordnance stores, &#163;17,379 ; other Defence works and buildings, &#163;22,011; Sydney Telephone Exchange, &#163;16,980; parcels post building, Melbourne, &#163;21,170; other postal buildings, &#163;22,324; water boring, purchase of scow, and other works and buildings, Northern Territory, &#163;10,000; telegraph and telephone material for construction and extension of lines, &#163;175,000; war-like stores, including field and machine guns, equipment, &#38;c, &#163;51,100; Small Arms Factory - additions and installation of machinery and plant, &#163;25,000; Cordite Factory - additions and extensions, &#163;7,000; Woollen Cloth Eactory - machinery and plant, &#163;5,000; naval works, &#163;14,000; vessels for Customs, quarantine and lighthouse work, &#163;21,300; other works and buildings, &#163;3,314.

              <para>- I do not mind when I get the information. I regret that I cannot see any item in this Bill which covers, the matter to which I now desire to refer. I have noticed that from time to time a considerable number of reports have been made by various experts&#39; upon the question of unifying the railway gauges of Australia.. But beyond the talking stage, very little, if anything, has been accomplished. I desire to know whether it is proposed to vote any money to enable that important work to be proceeded with? </para>

            <para>. - The Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> has told us that this Bill provides for an appropriation of loan moneys for the current financial year which is considerably less than the amount voted by Parliament last year. So far as I can gather, the principal items in the measure relate to post-office buildings and extensions. It seems to me that there is not much in the Bill to which exception can be taken, but that it involves to some extent the question of how the finances of the Commonwealth shall be put before honorable senators. For instance, in the general summary of the Commonwealth finances, the Post Office shows a rather big surplus. That fact has been taken into consideration by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> in his Estimates of the receipts and expenditure for the forthcoming year, and he has credited the aggregate revenue of the Commonwealth with those receipts. But now we are asked to vote about a quarter of a million sterling on loan account for the Postal Department. </para>

              <para>- If it is to come out of revenue, I think the Senate may very well pass the items as they stand. This Parliament should hesitate to do anything which is calculated to hamstring or legrope the expenditure of the Post Office just now. We have to provide not  merely for the requirements of this year, but for those of future years, and if we unduly  cheesepare  the expenditure on public utilities, it is obvious that we shall have to find a good deal more money to put those utilities in order later on. The appropriation proposed in the Bill is small compared with the amount which has been expended- in previous years, and we have very good indications that the Government are keeping a much, tighter rein upon public expenditure than has been kept by previous Administrations. One of the items at which we cannot cavil is that relating to military stores. It is manifest that for some time we shall have to pay attention to the military sustenance of the Commonwealth. </para>

          <para class="block">In regard to the proposed expenditure of &#163;10,000 on works in the Northern Territory, I suggest that it will be well for the Minister in charge of that great spending portion of the Commonwealth to keep the tightest possible rein upon what is transpiring there. The Territory seems to be a veritable sink for money, and I am quite in accord with the observations which have been made in this Chamber from time to time by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> regarding our expenditure there. In contradistinction to our administration of that Territory, the administration of Papua is being characterized by extreme economy. I do not think that the demand upon the Commonwealth finances for the administra- &#34; tion of Papua is very much in excess of &#163;40,000 annually. Perhaps in the direction of Northern Territory expenditure greater restriction and economy can be exercised ; but I see no other items in the Bill needing much reflection or criticism. The chief items are on account of the Post Office/ and it would be mistaken economy to curtail necessary postal and telephonic work now, for which we should have to pay through the nose a little later on. </para>

              <para>- If it is felt that it is necessary for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth to- take any step that will lead to the improvement of its trade or commerce, that step comes within the four corners of the trade and commerce power. If the Commonwealth has no power to take such a step, then it can have no power over trade and commerce at all. If it can be shown that that step will increase the trade and commerce of the Commonwealth, this Parliament is perfectly justified in taking it. The real question is not whether we have the power to create this Institute, but whether we are  justified  in doing it. The honorable senator has not addressed himself to that point at all. If we are justified in doing it, the first paragraph of section 51 of the . Constitution gives us ample authority. No exception can be taken to the proposal on legal grounds. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> very properly suggests that a previous Commonwealth Government induced this Parliament to pass a Navigation Act. It could not point to any definite section in the Constitution authorizing that legislation; but, undoubtedly, in dealing with navigation, this Parliament dealt with trade and commerce. </para>

              <para>- If by the creation of an Institute of Science and Industry, the Commonwealth can increase its trade, or improve its commerce, this Parliament will be justified in doing so, just as it- was justified in legislating about navigation. There is no strength iti <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn&#39;s</inline> argument. It is simply a skilful attempt to side-track the proposal; and it would be much better if the honorable senator dealt with the subject on the Bill already before the Senate.

            <para>. - I take advantage of this opportunity to call the attention of Ministers to what I regard as a pernicious system that is creeping into, at- least, one of our Departments. I am taking this action because of the fact that I am a member of the Standing Committee- on Public Works. I want no one to think that I am doing this because I am anxious that the Committee should have further work to attend to. I am doing it because, under an Act of Parliament, that Committee was called into existence to docertain things. Under the law, any public work costing more than &#163;25,000 must be remitted to the Committee for investigation and report. I am perfectly indifferent as to whether I remain on that Committee or not. No one can say that I am taking this stand because I am anxious that the Committee shall have more work to do. As a result of my connexion with the Public Works Committee it has come under my notice, and that of other members, that one Department in particular is getting into the habit of dividing its works into two or three sections, thereby avoiding any inquiry by the Works Committee. That has been done already. I refer to the Post Office Department. There are two items of expenditure in connexion with the Post Office Department set out in the measure now before the Senate. Those together comprise a sum considerably in excess of the amount which, in the ordinary course, should be referred to the Public Works Committee. On page 9 of the Bill&#34;, item 4, under the heading &#34;Victoria,&#34; there is a line: &#34;Melbourne - extension and alterations, General  Post Office, &#163;18,190.&#34; There is also a small item: &#34;Melbourne - construction of parcels post and postal sorting and postal stores building, &#163;1,600.&#34; The two upon that page cover a sum of nearly &#163;20,000. Then, on page 10, there is an item, again under the heading of Victoria: &#34;Melbourne - erecting new building and remodelling old parcels post building for telegraph operating room, &#163;21,170.&#34; The three items aggregate more than &#163;40,000. If the Public Works Committee is expected to exercise general supervision over the expenditure of money, whether upon new works, alterations of old works, buildings, or anything df the kind, it is no part of the duty of any Minister to divide those works in this manner and so, apparently, avoid reference to the Public Works Committee.. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I ask honorable senators to turn to the record of the Public Works Committee since its formation, when it will be found that the carrying out of the recommendations of that body has caused large sums of money to be saved upon practically every work referred to it. That is why I call attention to the position to-day. I do not know whether it is too late to make any alteration, and I am not concerned as to whether it is or not ; but I trust that this practice will not be permitted to grow in regard to the public works of the country. If it is desired that public money shall be spent without check or review, let us straightway repeal the. Public Works Committee Act, and thus the Departments may go on spending as they please. We are expected to do certain work, having been called into existence for that purpose. I am of opinion that the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Webster)</inline> has acted as I have indicated, with the idea of keeping those works from the Committee, so that he and his officers shall not be hampered or annoyed by having to explain details and answer a lot of questions from this very inquisitorial Public Works Committee. </para>

            <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> has raised a constitutional point. I suggest for his consideration that this is not - though, perhaps, unfortunately for the country- -the body which determines constitutional points. Had we been so intrusted, it is possible that a Chamber constituted as this is might have avoided some of the pitfalls of that Serbonian bog in which other authorities appear to spend much of their existence. Even if the Senate passes this amount, it cannot possibly be expended until the Bill authorizing the Government to proceed with the creation of the Science Institute shall have been finally approved. But, the constitutional point having been raised, I shall make an effort to -set <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn&#39;s</inline> mind at rest. He says he can see no portion of the Constitution which confers the. power herein claimed. If he will turn to section 51 of the Act he will find among the thirtynine articles of our political faith : </para>

          <para class="block">It does not require any arguing to demonstrate that science may involve matters incidental to the execution of those powers which are clearly within the compass of the Federal Parliament. o one will dispute, for example, that quarantine is a matter in respect of which the Commonwealth has full power. It requires no argument to show that scientific investigation may be very important in its incidental relationship to quarantine questions. The same line may be taken with respect to defence. No one in these times will assert that War can be successfully carried on except -with the aid of science. And it can be shown that the establishment of a scientific bureau is incidental to many of the powers claimed and exercised by the Commonwealth Government. The honorable senator in voting for this item - if he cares to do so - will not necessarily commit himself to the expenditure of that amount, for, if the Senate  turn3  down the measure for the creation of the proposed Institute, the money will not be spent, there being no authority for its expenditure. </para>

Yesterday we voted a. sum towards the Department of the Postmaster-General - amounting to about &#163;1,250,000 sterling, and now we are to authorize a further expenditure of about &#163;250,000 or &#163;300,000. Is it included in the total expenditure of the Department of the Postmaster-General for the year, or is it shown separately as a credit item for new works? </para>

The practice ;is that works and buildings constructed by the Works Department, although for other Departments, figure  under the heading of Home and Territories in the first instance; but the honorable senator will be able to see by the sub-heading for which Department certain expenditure has been incurred. </para>

          <para>. - The extraordinary facilities available to men for the production of wealth have given this Government a chance of introducing a measure which , if given effect to, will no doubt swallow up a very large proportion of the productions of many men. It is surprising what devices the Government will resort to in order to achieve this end. We have not had, in my opinion - </para>

            <para>- The passing of the amendment would not kill the Bill&#34;. It has already been pointed out that, for certain reasons, a measure which passed both Houses of this Parliament is still allowed to remain inoperative, and there is no reason why this Bill, even if it be passed; should not be allowed to remain inoperative for a considerable time to come. We all know that the members of the present Government are studying morning, noon, and night to try to find positions for men who are not prepared to go out into &#34;the country and do some productive work. We have had sufficient talk of the destruction of prickly pear, the Bathurst burr, and the Scotch and other thistles, to secure their complete eradication from the whole of the Commonwealth. If these men, including the Vice-President of the Executive Council, were really anxious to do some useful work they might equip themselves with mattocks for the eradication of these pests, and if they did so, there would not be a weed left in the whole of the Commonwealth. &#39;These men, who are so anxious to establish palatial offices in Melbourne, and surround themselves with enormous staffs, have never yet been known to eradicate a single weed. If the Government have some money to spend, it would be far better that they should give it to some genuine workers, and equip them with implements to eradicate the weeds. If they are prepared to spend &#163;3,000 as an insignificant preliminary upon this proposal, I say the money would be far better spent in equipping genuine workers with the necessary tools to eradicate weeds. They would do more in twelve months than will ever be done by those whom it is desired to appoint to positions under this Bill. </para>

Notwithstanding all the talk that has taken place in Queensland, there are, at the present time, some 20,000,000 acres of land in that State in the posses^ sion of the prickly pear. There are approximately 3,000,000 acres in the possession of the prickly pear in New South Wales. </para>

            <para>- Yes, but we do not want any more talkers or boards of inquiry. We need some one to do what the honorable senator did some little time ago. He did not start talking about clearing his land, but secured the  neces-sary  implements, and went about the business, and the local council taxed him more heavily than ever he was taxed before, and good enough for him, too. One can go to almost any place in Australia, and he will find that the local councils refuse, for reasons best known to themselves, to effectively deal with various pests coming under the definition of &#34; noxious weeds.&#34; Some little time ago I travelled over the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway,  and on the journey I noticed what was to me a perfectly new weed. It was something in the nature of an octopus. It stretched for 6 or 7 feet in many directions. It may spread to other parts of the Commonwealth, and,  on the other hand, it may fail to acclimatize itself ; but we cannot be sure of that. The prickly pear, is a comparatively recent importation to Australia, and so are many of our other noxious weeds that are now causing so much annoyance and damage. Why do not these men who are so anxious to have themselves foisted on to the Commonwealth go out and do some useful work? I am quite tired of seeing gentlemen who profess to be doing something sitting all day long in an office. These men would not know one weed from another, and have no practical idea of the way in which weeds should be destroyed. I tell the Government that far too many Commissions and Boards are being appointed in order to tell other people how to do the work of the country. There are very few men working in this country to-day. Some people object when the ordinary worker suggests that his hours of labour should be reduced from eight to six per day; but there are vast armies of men and women in the country who never do any useful work at all. </para>

            <para>- Here is an effort being made, apparently with the full concurrence of the Government, to rent another extensive establishment in Melbourne, and probably one in each of the capital cities, in order to duplicate work&#39; that is now being carried out by the State Governments. The idea of doing any practical work never seems to occur to their minds. - If the Government wish to deal with the prickly pear, or any other weed of the kind, they should equip these gentlemen with a mattock&#39; each, and give them &#163;3 or &#163;4 per week to go out and do some useful work, and get off the backs of the workers of the country. We have to-day in Europe about 50,000,000 men under arms. </para>

            <para>- Not they. Apparently the great desire of the WintheWar Government is to appoint a number of gentlemen, not for a year or two, but probably for a life-time, and at continually increasing salaries, in order that they may assist to consume the surplus profits of the few men who are now working. As one who represents the workers of the country in this Chamber, I enter my* strongest protest against this kind of thing. If it is permitted to continue, we need not be surprised if something like what is taking place in Russia at the present time takes place in this country. Some men appear to be determined not to do any useful work. They prefer to foist themselves into positions where they can legally enjoy the fruits of the labours of other men. In my opinion, they ought to be ashamed of themselves. If the Government, instead of placing these men in those positions, equipped them with mattocks, and told them to go out and do some useful work, they would kill more weeds in one month than are likely to be killed in twelve years under the operation of this Bill. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator has had his opportunity to speak, and I hope he will permit me to say what I desire to say. Amongst the multifarious duties I have been called upon to perform as a Minister of the Crown, I have been especially interested in my work as  President  of the Wheat Board. I make no claim to be a scientist, but I do claim sufficient common sense to be able to recognise the danger we are Tunning in Australia in connexion with the preservation of our wheat. To-day we have 5,000,000 tons of wheat stacked in Australia, and it is probable that before February next we shall have 7,000,000 tons of wheat stacked, for which guarantees have been given by the Government. I have had to shoulder responsibility in connexion with the matter, and on the scientific side I have been unfitted by lack of scientific training to effectively carry out that duty. We all know the enormous loss that has been caused by the ravages of the plague pf mice. We had no previous knowledge of the effects of such a plague, and I say that if, at the outbreak of the plague, we possessed the knowledge which we now possess in regard to preventive measures, we might have saved the Commonwealth from &#163;200,000 to &#163;400,000. I hope, within a few minutes, to point out what is being done to combat some of the pests in Australia to-day. We do not object to the weevil itself, but we do object to the destruction of our wheat by this pest. We have endeavoured to avertthat destruction by every method known to us. In South Australia, where members of the State Wheat Board have been working with the full consent of the State Government, in close co-operation with the Commonwealth authorities, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Hargreaves;a</inline> member of that body, has for some months been conducting experiments designed to solve this perplexing problem, with the result that to-day we are more hopeful of saving the wheat which is stored in Australia than we have been at any previous period. The solution of this difficulty appears to lie in building airtight sheds round our wheat stacks, roofing them with rubberoid, and pumping carbon dioxide into them. This appears to effectually prevent the ravages by weevil without affecting injuriously the quality of the grain. Before we are very much older we shall be spending many thousands  of pounds in enclosing our wheat stacks in the way I have outlined, because we have to recognise that shipping was never so scarce as it is to-day, and it may yet be necessary for us to hold our wheat here for three or four years. </para>

The experiment to which I have referred has proved successful so far as we have tested it, and we have tested it with the worst samples of our wheat.

The scientists expressed con- siderable confidence of success, and the Premier agreed to give the matter careful consideration. Nothing more was heard of it till last night, when the Minister for Lands, in the course of a short speech on the Lands Estimates, announced that the Government had decided to vote the subsidy of &#163;2,000 for the purpose sought. The announcement was received with expressions of pleasure by some of the country members. </para>

He has told us that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Hargreave</inline> has found a remedy for the dreadful weevil pest. That gentleman, I understand, is connected with the University of Adelaide, and with the activities of the State Government in connexion with this very important matter. Is itnecessary, therefore, to create a new Federal Department involving an expenditure of &#163;20,000 annually, to do what is already being done? I believe that the Commonwealth, by interfering in the way that is proposed, will kill a lot of valuable work which is already being performed by State experts. I do not think honorable senators understand the work which the States are performing in this connexion. </para>

The States, I repeat, are already doing the work which will be done by the proposed Institute. Until I began to look into the matter closely, I really was not aware of what the States were doing in this direction. But I read the <inline font-style="italic">Victorian Journal of Agriculture</inline> regularly, and from it I learn that many of these problems are already being attacked. We have in this State the splendid Agricultural College at Dookie, where, for the sum of &#163;25 a year, a young man can acquire a splendid knowledge of agricultural work. Noted argiculturists have said that that institution offers the best practical agricultural training that is obtainable in any part of the world. We do not desire the projected Institute of Science and Industry to engage in that sort of work. We have also the Agricultural College at Longerenong. Similarly in New South Wales there is the Hawkesbury College, one of the finest institutions of its kind in the world. Then in Victoria, I learn that free pamphlets are issued by the Government relating to such questions as silo construction, hints for new settlers, cider making, citrus fruit culture, tobacco culture, silos and silage, the beet sugar industry and closer settlement, worms in sheep, cheese making, farm blacksmithing, broom fibre industry, lime in agriculture, numerical system of packing apples, wheat, and its cultivation, &#38;c. There are thirty-three of these pamphlets written by distinguished scientists which anybody can obtain absolutely free. </para>

              <para>-I doubt it. In Queensland <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan</inline> is very much opposed to this Bill, and in New South Wales the authorities fear that the establishment of the proposed Institute will interfere with the work of the State Bureau. Something has been said on the question of improving our breeds of wheat, but we have already improved our wheat enormously by reason of these State activities, and to-day it is possible to get from the Department of Agriculture special breeds of wheat which practically insure the production of a crop even in the very dry. areas. Such wheats as Special Federation, Dart&#39;s Imperial, Yandilla King, and College Eclipse, make it possible to produce crops in country where wheat could not previously be grown. </para>

              <para>- I will accept that statement with a grain of salt. But we are travelling rapidly in the direction indicated by the honorable senator. Our splendid Agricultural Department, aided by applied science, is enabling us to grow wheat in areas possessing a very limited rainfall. Measures for the eradication of the cattle tick constitute one of the. most important functions which will be exercised by the Institute which it is proposed to establish under this Bill. But I fear&#34; that there is bound to be a clash between the Institute and the State Bureau. </para>

            <para>The second recommendation of the Committee, namely, that the Federal Government should undertake a campaign for the eradication of the tick, could not be acted upon by the Advisory Council itself, as it had not the necessary administrative powers. It therefore forwarded the recommendation to the Commonwealth Government, with the suggestion that, if the Government agreed that it was desirable that the Commonwealth should intervene in the matter, it should ask the States specially concerned - New South Wales and Queensland - to affirm, the desirability of Federal co-operation, and, as a first step, to appoint . delegates to a conference, at which a detailed scheme for a co-operative campaign could be drawn up. This action was taken by the Commonwealth Government, and the two States appointed delegates to a conference with representatives of the Commonwealth, which was held in Brisbane in February, 1918. </para>

              <para>- The point I am nervous about is that we are going to interfere with the really good work that is being done now in all directions. All these pests are being scientifically treated already. I cannot see why the Commonwealth should come in at this late hour, after the States have borne the heat and burden of the day for so long. They have worked, up to a pitch of knowledge and experience which it will take the new Institute, however scientific, many months, and perhaps years, to arrive at. This is not the time for the Commonwealth to interfere. Ministers are overworked, and will not be able to give the necessary time and attention to the undertaking. </para>

              <para>- Our State Departments have been trying for years to start fresh enterprises, such as the growing of flax, hemp, and sugar-beet ; but the population has been so sparse that it has had more than it could do to carry on the great primary industries and the secondary industries connected with them. That is the direction in which our efforts should be continued, and the .States are doing it already. If we had any money to spare, I should advise spending it on water conservation. The impression of General Pau, the splendid Frenchman who is among us just now, is that Australia is a waterless land. </para>

              <para>- I am showing the necessity of knocking the Bill clean out in the interests of science, so that we shall not interfere with what the States are doing. Water conservation is most important. A drought is now hanging over a great part of the continent, and if it continues I do not like the financial outlook. I&#39; crossed the Edwards, a tributary of the Murray, the other day - 5 miles of running water. Could we not conserve some of that, if there is money to spare? That i3 a channel into which every farthing drawn from Australian pockets, even if it has to he drawn by compulsion, might worthily go ; but what we are asked to do now is simply to interfere with the good work being done by the States, and that is a thing we ought not to do. Tho financial outlook is very grave. </para>

              <para>- We are doing through the States&#39; activities everything we can, as reasonable human beings, to encourage science. I have shown that pamphlets are available to educate us on every point. Every industry has its journal dealing mouth by month with the problems affecting it. We in Australia are very prone to run ourselves down ; yet our wool industry is looked on as the finest of its kind in the world. Our methods of conducting that industry .are &#39;being copied everywhere; and it is the same with the butter industry. Those are industries  natural to the soil, and there are others that we are conducting well, such as the frozen-meat industry, of which I can recollect the start. My father was the first man, in conjunction with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hastings</inline> Cunningham and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fred.</inline> Armitage, to ship meat successfully from any part of the world. One or two shipments were made from the River Plate, but they were not absolutely successful. As soon as we get more population we shall very quickly be abreast of any scientific development that is extant. Our Departments of Agriculture, and Committees dealing with tick and other pests, are in almost daily communication with every department of science anywhere, and no discovery can be made which we would not know of in course of post, if not by cable. This proposal is, therefore, unwise, especially at a time like this, when we are right up against a big financial problem. We are inclined to pat ourselves on the back because, when the Government asked for &#163;40,000,000, they received &#163;37,000,000. I am not inclined to pat myself on the back over that transaction, because compulsion was practically applied. </para>

          <para class="block">The effect of the compulsory measure now before another place will be to tighten up the money market tremendously. It will have an immense effect on the amount of capital available for enterprises. It will make it absolutely impossible for many a man to wire-net his property to destroy rabbits, because his money will be required for the war. That is only natural, but he will look askance when he sees the money taken out of his pocket being applied, not to the war, but to a hare-brained experiment of this sort. Every way I look at it, the position is most serious. We ought to take months, if not years, to consider this proposition. </para>

Our industry has been magnificently conducted, and that has been greatly due to the policy of State encouragement and assistance. _ If the Minister desires to serve the best interests of the country with respect to scientific investigation, he will offer the State Departments a helping hand.

            <para>.- I cannot appreciate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn&#39;s</inline> attitude. I take the very opposite view. With what the honorable senator has said regarding the financial position, I quite agree; but his one point appears to be that he fears the Commonwealth Institute of Science will duplicate expenditure. Many of our State institutions have been more or less failures. In their beginnings, indeed, they have been complete failures, and thousands of pounds have been wasted. No doubt, the Federal Government, upon taking up similar matters, will also make mistakes. But, instead of finding fault in this particular case, honorable senators should realize that scientific research is amongst the most appropriate works which the Federal authorities could undertake. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I have been in the cattle country in the Gulf of Carpentaria when tick was extremely bad. Nobody in Queensland cared a snap of the fingers about the cattle men in the Gulf, so long as they were not affected. I have seen mobs of Gulf cattle leave some of the stations from Carpentaria Downs on the way to the Bowen Meat Works. There would be some 500 or 600 head of cattle. They were all clean when they set out, but they had to traverse the tick country. Only seven of one mob of between 500 and 600 reached Bowen, and those few survivors were skeletons. The fatter the beast and the better its health, the sooner did the tick get to work, and the animal quickly died. What I have just cited occurred in the early days. When tick began to decimate our Queensland cattle, redwater broke out, and the question was whether the redwater accompanied, or was the result of the tick. Nobody knew exactly whether it was the redwater or the tick that was killing the cattle. The tick spread down through Queensland and reached the dairy herds, and our losses were enormously heavy. Had there been a central bureau-, possessed of the best of scientific men and knowledge, the tick question would have been tackled years earlier, and the loss saved to Queensland alone would have more than paid all expenses. But investigations were carried on in a muddled fashion, and the best of the State&#39;s dairy herds, meanwhile, were being swept away. Finally it was concluded that the only thing to do was to introduce dips. Honorable senators are not aware of the enormous losses which Queensland stock-owners have suffered. Many dairy-herders have been ruined. Ten to thirty cows have been lost from one herd in a week. Had there been a central bureau, investigating the subject from the Commonwealth view-point, the tick could have been grappled with far earlier, and huge sums of money might have been saved. </para>
          <para>When the tick reached the New South Wales border, the Government of that State sought to shut it out; but kangaroos, and rabbits, and dos;s helped to scatter it. New South Wales to-day has the cattle tick within its borders. Queensland cattle were shut out from the other States during the process of endeavouring to deal with the problem. Had a central bureau been established, the subject would have been promptly handled, and in a scientific way, and authority could have been given to permit fat and tickfree cattle to cross the border to the other States, where the price of meat had risen because of the shortage of Queensland supplies. An honorable senator asks, &#34;Is not <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan</inline> allowing the cattle through now ? &#34; I answer - Yes ; when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ryan</inline> opens the border up, and does not steal other people&#39;s cattle on the border. </para>

              <para>- Yes, he is a cattleduffer, only he legally does it. That is the only difference. Queensland has borne the loss; but why should she do so? If cattle die of tick in Queensland, it is only indirectly making the price of meat dearer in other parts of Australia. Thus it becomes a Commonwealth matter; and from the Commonwealth view-point it would pay to establish a central bureau. </para>

          <para>The prickly pear has been one of the greatest curses from which Queensland has suffered. I know Queensland well. I have watched the spread of the prickly pear for years. Great tracts of country have been covered, and now the pear is creeping into New South Wales, and is becoming a menace to its back districts. The Queensland Government have been trying to tackle the prickly pear, but, so far, all efforts have been a failure. A laboratory was established at Dulacca, a station in the centre of the prickly pear country. Recently the cochineal insect has been introduced, not by a scientist, but by a practical cattle man, and he thinks it will succeed in destroying the prickly pear. If that should be so, then, if the central Institute were established, the work accomplished in Queensland could be applied in practical form to the prickly pear all over Australia. It is a menace to the whole of the Commonwealth, and, therefore, I say that experiments carried out by the Institute in connexion with the prickly pear would, if successful, be ample justification for its establishment.&#39; I may give honorable senators an example of how vigorous this pest is. Recently, in Queensland, I saw the leaf of a prickly pear which some one had thrown over a wire fence. There it was, hanging by itself, and, although it was not -touching the ground, it was growling vigorously, simply because there had been a wet season and it had stored up sufficient moisture for its own needs. Honorable senators&#39; have nt&#62; idea how rapidly this pest is spreading and how vigorously it is growing. In some of the shire council districts of Queensland steps have been taken for its destruction, and the local authorities thought they were keeping it in check; but, after a good rainfall, it conies up smiling again and as vigorous as ever. Up to the present the authorities in Queensland have not been able to discover a poison sufficiently strong, or an insect parasite virile enough, to combat the pest, which ii spreading so rapidly as to become a serious danger to the State of New South Wales. Hundreds of thousands of acres are now covered with it. </para>
          <para>There are other reasons why this proposed Institute will command my support, in spite of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> and other honorable senators who are opposing the measure have to say against it. In regard to the blowfly pest alone, the pastoralists of Australia have lost thousands, if not millions, of pounds. Why should each State .work independently in the fight against this menace to the flocks of Australia? </para>

              <para>- In my judgment, we have not yet developed the resources of Australia in this respect In Queensland and in South Australia we have millions of acres of land which, under scientific treatment, should some day be producing wheat. The practical experience gained in America shows that immense areas of dry country may, under proper scientific treatment, be brought into profitable occupation for the production of wheat. And this is one of the problems which the proposed Institute should handle. If we could only solve this difficulty, vast areas of country which at present afford a living for only a few human beings engaged in the cattle industry will be carrying large numbers of people employed in wheat production. At present a cattle station gives employment to about three white men and a dozen blacks. I know that is the position in the Gulf country, and I am not finding fault with station owners, because that is all the labour that is required. Sheep stations also .give employment to comparatively few people, perhaps a dozen or twenty men, whereas, if we could bring that land under wheat cultivation we. could look for a large increase in our population after this war is over. I am not going to lose faith in Australia and its people because, at the present time, we are getting only 3s. 9d. or 4s. per bushel for our wheat. If there was nothing else to induce me to vote for this Bill for the establishment of a central scientific Institute, I would give it my support for the one reason that if we could successfully solve the problem of growing wheat in our dry areas it would more than justify its existence. </para>

          <para>Important results will also follow the scientific conservation of our water supplies. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> made reference to the Murray River, but in Queensland we have many splendid rivers, and if only we could conserve their water supplies very important results would follow in connexion with our primary industries. How it is going to be done I do not know, but if our water supplies could be successfully conserved, it would mean the salvation of the interior of Australia. It is because I look at all these problems from a practical point of view that I am in favour of the Bill. It seems to me that its opponents regard it from a narrow view-point. I think the Government are acting wisely in taking steps for the development of .our primary industries. Let us consider, also, what will be the effect upon our secondary industries. At present we have scarcely any secondary industry worth speaking about, but with the Institute of Science and Industry properly established, we should be able to support an immense increase in our population. Science is coming into its own, and- </para>

I must admit that a good deal of further light has been thrown upon the problems with which we are beset by those who have opposed the Bill.

              <para>- I should have felt more easy as a representative of one of the States if the &#34;Vice-President of the Executive Council had been more frank with honorable senators as to the way in which this proposal is taken by the State Premiers, for instance, of Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, and even of Tasmania. I consider this is a matter which should be very deliberately and carefully discussed, because there is a growing irritation amongst the public at the duplication of the work of various Departments. We already have duplications in various directions in connexion with our electoral machinery, our taxation machinery, for the collection of both income and land taxes, and duplication in connexion with State Agricultural Departments and Customs examinations. There is duplication of Federal and State effort in connexion with some other matters also. Therefore, although I am in favour of the principle of the Bill,&#39; I listened with a good deal of satisfaction to the voices raised in opposition to it on the ground that it involves duplication of effort. </para>

There is work for a bureau of information, in the direction of metallic prospecting, which is not now undertaken by the States, and I believe there is a fair field for work by the proposed Institute without interfering in any way with scientific work now being carried on by State organizations. </para>
          <para>If I were asked definitely to-day whether I would vote for the Bill in its entirety, I should hesitate to reply, because if it be carefully perused honorable members will find that it proposes the establishment of a somewhat- peculiar organization. The directors and officials are not to be under the Public .Service Act, but under the full control of the Minister. I shall have something to say about these aspects of the measure later on. It will be seen that if the provisions of the Bill are given effect in their entirety, the proposed Institute will develop into &#34;what will practically be a machine of patronage by the Minister, </para>

            <para>. - I had the pleasure of listening to the speech of the VicePresident of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> in moving the second reading of this Bill. I moved the adjournment of the second-reading debate, but as I was obliged during the last fortnight to submit to scientific treatment to combat a certain prevailing malady I was unable to continue the debate. Had I been able to do so I should have been an ardent supporter of the Bill. I consider that such a measure is very necessary in Australia if we are not to continue to move along at the laggard pace we have adopted in the past. People may say what they like about our industrial life, but unless we adopt scientific methods we must inevitably lag behind in the economic struggle. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I had the privilege of visiting the Australian Imperial Force in Egypt a short time ago, and of personally seeing what science has done there in the direction of saving thousands of lives which otherwise would have been sacrificed by reason of the maladies which infest that country. When I arrived iu England, it happened that the very first gathering I addressed was that of the annual meeting of the Royal Society of Scientists, and on that occasion I spoke of what I had seen in Egypt in the way of combating these maladies. At the close of my remarks, I was really surprised to learn that some of the scientists present were so interested in what I had said that they pressed me to dine with them. </para>
          <para>One of the reasons why Australia has lagged behind in the race for industrial supremacy is that hitherto she has failed to adopt scientific methods. On the other hand, Germany has been enabled to accomplish what she has by reason of the application of the most up-to-date and scientific methods to all branches of her industries. It is this&#39; fact which has made it possible for her to hold out for as long as she has done during the present war. Here, in Australia, we now have to make a start in the adoption of scientific methods, if we are to be well up in the economic race. We have the ability to make great advances if we choose to do so. </para>
          <para>Only a few years ago one of our most eminent metallurgists attacked the problem of extracting bismuth from wolfram. Thousands of tons of the latter ore were then lying about our mine tops, absolutely valueless. But w.hen this scientist had practically solved the problem of extracting bismuth from it, German agents brought pressure to bear upon the Governments in Australia, with the result that not one of them had the backbone to stand by him, and to see that his scientific methods were put to the test. I believe that since the outbreak of the war this man has proved to the world that it is possible to make this otherwise useless wolfram marketable, with the result that to-day we are able to supply not only our own needs in this matter, but those of other countries. </para>
          <para>In view&#39; of what I had previously heard, I was surprised to read in the newspapers that the motion for the second reading of this Bill had been carried unanimously; and what I have heard here to-day has convinced me that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap&#39;s</inline> amendment is merely designed to destroy it. I shall not be a party to tactics of that kind. I intend to assist the Government to pass the measure. A good deal has been said about economy during the course of this discussion, and we know that in Victoria the newspapers are preaching economy today; but it would be false economy to reject this Bill. If we expend &#163;20,000 a year upon the proposed Institute of Science and Industry, and as a result of its establishment effect a saving of &#163;1,000,000, that will be true economy. </para>
          <para class="block">We ought not to forget that, only a few years ago, the very newspapers which are preaching economy to-day were loud in their condemnation of the Labour party, and of the Defence scheme which it introduced. The same journals persistently demanded that Parliament should cut down the Military and Naval Estimates, and do away with the then Government&#39;s mad policy of Defence. Had any notice been taken of them, we would never have been able to accomplish what we have done in this war. </para>
          <para>I am a confirmed Unificationist, and I am . an Australian. I believe that the Commonwealth should control every industry in this country. By that means alone can we solve the difficulties - which confront us. Then we shall not have three or four States fighting against each other in every direction. With Unification, we should not be the laughing-stock of the world, as we are to-day, because of the fighting which takes place in London between the several States. I am an Australian pure and simple, and I do not care in what part of this continent development takes place, so long as it does take place. I intend to help the Government in every way possible to establish the proposed Institute, in order that we may be well up in the struggle for industrial supremacy. </para>

              <para>wish now to address myself particularly to the perverted logic which has been used by the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell)</inline> and by some other speakers who have discussed my amendment. In order to illustrate my remarks, let me point to our ordinary system of education, which is certainly akin to the system of scientific education and investigation. We have in Australia to-day six Education Departments, one in each State, and I would be the last to ask that we should impose a uniform system of education throughout the Commonwealth. I believe that the one stereotyped form of education would be particularly detrimental to the future intellectual equipment of the Australian people. But because we have six Education Departments, will it be contended that we should establish a Federal Education Department in order that all these Departments may be &#34;co-ordinated&#34; - blessed word ? My attitude in connexion with this; matter is precisely what it would have been had there been a proposal before the Chamber to superimpose a Commonwealth Department of Education upon the Education Departments of the States. That explains my position; and I protest against it being represented that I am antagonistic to scientific investigation. </para>

          <para>The Vice-President of the Executive Council let fall from his ammunition cart plenty of cartridges which will fit my gun, and I propose to fire one or two of them. He spoke very enthusiastically of the work of a South Australian scientist in connexion with the investigation of the weevil pest, which is alleged to be destroying large quantities of our wheat. Now, if <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Hargreaves</inline> is able to discover a gas which will kill this &#34; bug,&#34; as &#39;the Americans call it, more power to him. But is not that circumstance a sufficient illustration in itself that the States have in their service scientists who are capable of successfully combating those pests which infest the products of Australian industries from time to time. </para>
          <para>Only the other day Professor Laby, a scientist of considerable attainments, many of whose publications I have read with pleasure and profit, rushed into the columns of the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> in order to bolster up the Institute which it is proposed to establish under this Bill. He published an article which was quite unnecessary, because it vaunted the advantages of scientific investigation, and of the application of science in a direct way to production, and to various branches of industry. Somewhat unfortunately for his argument, however, he instanced the researches of a gentleman named Farrar, a resident of New South Wales, who has made a very lengthy Mid satisfactory investigation in regard to the production of new drought-resisting, and rust-resisting, wheats. I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Farrar</inline> is a professor; but in New South Wales he carried out investigations which, were productive of certain definite results. Now, if the Commonwealth have money to spare, can it not subsidize men like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Farrar?</inline></para>

          <para>Upon the motion for the second reading of this Bill <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> spoke at some length in regard to the discovery of a method of smelting pyritic ores on the west coast of Tasmania. In order to show how necessary it is that all these scientificinvestigations should be prosecuted with a strict regard to the practical result let me recall to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> the fact that Australian scientists, metallurgists, mine managers, and investors knew very well the value of the Mount Lyell copper ore deposit. But they knew, also, that they were not esteemed highly enough tosecure the necessary capital for the treatment of the deposit. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Peters</inline> - the highest known authority on the smeltingof pyritic copper ores - was brought from the Lake Superior district, &#39;and givencarte <inline font-style="italic">blanche</inline> for six months to conduct investigations into the nature of the ore. He recommended that it should be put in heaps and calcined, the sulphur contained in it being used as a fuel. If <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Peters&#39;</inline> advice had been followed, the Mount Lyell Company would have ceased to operate two years after smelting started. </para>

              <para>- As a matter of fact, practical metallurgists grouped together on the spot ignored the advice of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Peters,</inline> and shot the ore right into the furnace raw, obviating the calcination charge of 15s. per ton. The Mount Lyell ore at the present time does not return a profit equal to what that calcination charge would have been. The hot-air blast is all done away with. The employment of thousands of men to chop fuel was also done away with as the result of the practical experiments of the men on the spot. If <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Peters,</inline> notwithstanding his great experience of copper smelting, had continued experimenting with Mount Lyell ores at Lake Superior, the practical result would not have been satisfactory. Tho point and pith of my argument is that the operations of scientists employed by  State Departments on the spot dealing with local conditions and with matters arising in the particular States which constitute their spheres of operation, are likely to be more satisfactory in their discoveries than if their activities are directed from one centre in the temporary Federal Capital at Melbourne. </para>

          <para>I predict that in questions of discovery and research the too great concentration which will ensue will be prejudicial to systematic scientific investigation. The very great scientists, those whose discoveries are severely practical, are not those educated in universities. Great scientists are often like great poets, of whom, it is said that they &#34; learn in suffering what they teach in song.&#34; The great scientist has often had a hard task to earn his living. It is the persistence of genius, not Government co-ordination, that results in big things in connexion with scientific research. Pasteur, and the great French centenarian,  Chevreul,  discovered what they did very largely along the lines of original research. Governments did not do much for them until very late in their careers. Chevreul lived to over 100 years of age. He made important discoveries in regard to the fixation of colours in the dyeing of cloth stuffs when eighty or ninety years of age. He was in Paris at the time of the German bombardment. After the manner of the philosophers of classic times in the- groves of  Academus,  he was lecturing to the students of his class in the open air, when a German shell fell. He went in, and, like a philosopher, merely recorded in his diary that a scientific institution over which he presided had been bombarded by William of Prussia on such and such a day, to his eternal shame and disgrace. </para>
          <para>I do not want any one to believe that I undervalue scientific research. I know of nothing more eloquent than the language of a great scientific publication in dealing with this magnificent old chemist on the one hundredth anniversary of his birth : &#34; There this magnificent old man sits in his laboratory, holding silent commune with nature, and earnestly, yet reverently, watching the sublime irradiations of immortal Truth.&#34; There could not be a more graphic description of the labours of a scientist. My opposition to the Bill results from the fact that I am a Federalist, just as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall&#39;s</inline> appreciation of it, results, as he told us, from the fact that he is a Unificationist. As a Federalist, I think it my duty at all times to protest against the unnecessary duplication of State activities. In the present condition of affairs in Australia, in the period of financial stress which I see almost upon us, it will be wise on the part of this Committee to defer the opera.tion of the Bill for five years. By that time many people in Australia will have had a good many financial and intellectual cold showers. They will have had time to reflect. </para>
          <para>I cannot help thinking that the arrangements in connexion with this scientific institution very largely savour of these relating to the establishment of the Commonwealth police. That body was established by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> in a moment of haste, and the Government do not care about doing away with it altogether for fear that it may constitute an implied slur on the activities of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister dashed in with this matter also, and established the present Advisory Council of Science and Industry. This is one of the things that may well be regarded as altogether unnecessary at this juncture. It is a luxury just now, seeing that we have able scientists active along the lines described by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> and others in the employ of the States at the present time. </para>
          <para>Scientific investigation promises great things, and from time to time realizes them. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hagelthorn</inline> some time ago sent me a pamphlet, issued, I think, at the instance of the adviser of the American Institute of Bankers - presumably a pretty practical association - and including a passage which made a great impression on me: &#34; Our present knowledge of science is as a cupful of water compared with the whole area of Lake Michigan.&#34; That was an allusion to scientific possibilities. But, for all that, we have Lo pay regard to the homely adage of cutting our coat according to our cloth, and I am afraid our financial cloth in the years immediately ahead of us will be somewhat limited in quantity. If we are extravagant now we may, in the near future, wear a very threadbare coat. I think this amendment is a counsel of prudence - I will not altogether say of wisdom, but prudence to a large extent is an element of wisdom - and I believe it will be exceedingly wise for the Committee to accept the amendment, and, while not destroying the Bill, and allowing it .to proceed to the statute-book, suspend its operations, so to speak, for five years. I have attempted to make it clear that <inline font-style="italic">my,</inline> attitude is not one of opposition to scientific investigation or research, but, being a Federalist, I object to the unnecessary duplication of State activities, or the superimposition on them of a Commonwealth Department that at the present juncture of our history &#39;.s wholly unnecessary. </para>

            <para>.- Senators McDougall and Reid said it &#34;/vas apparent that senators supporting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap&#39;s</inline> amendment were doing so because they were opposed to the progress of science and industry in Australia. Some of those who oppose the Bill have made themselves quite clear on that point, and I tried last week to show that I was in no way opposing the Bill with any idea of retarding the progress of science and industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> put it very well when he said that none but fools would oppose the advancement of science. We all recognise that if a country is to progress its scientific institutions must <inline font-style="italic">go</inline> ahead.- I am opposing the Bill simply because, while I agree with the principle underlying it, I disagree with the methods which are being adopted, and disapprove of the creation of this fresh Board of Directors and the duplication of machinery already being operated by the States. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> referred to the conference recently held in South Australia with such eminently satisfactory results.

        <para>A conference of representatives from Victoria, New South Wales, and South Australia was held yesterday at the offices of the InterState Commission, to discuss means of dealing with the weevil post, which has caused SUCh an enormous loss to wheat stacks in Australia. The Conference was called together by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell,</inline> as  chairman  of the Commonwealth Council of Science and Industry, and the Australian Wheat Board. Professor Masson,  deputy chairman  of the Advisory Council, presided. <inline font-weight="bold">&#39;Dr. Hargreaves</inline> and the other South Australian representatives outlined the results of investigations undertaken in that State, which indicated that a, reasonable solution of the problem was in sight. These had shown that it was possible to cover wheat stacks with malthoid,  which was impervious to weevil, and by a fumigation process the pest was destroyed. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oman,</inline> Victorian Minister of Agriculture, congratulated the South Australian representatives on this valuable discovery, which, he said, would be a great benefit to all the wheat-growing States of Australia. Subsequently the Conference discussed the question of future research work in this direction, and it was decided to recommend the appointment of a committee in each&#39; State, whose work would .be co-ordinated by the Commonwealth Advisory Council. It was also recommended that the South Australian committee should receive financial assistance from the Australian Wheat Board for the continuation of its research. </para>
        <para class="block">If the facts are as stated there, and I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> in his opening address confirmed them, the bottom is knocked clean out of the arguments of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> and others - that petty jealousies exist between the States, and that it is impossible to bring them together. At that very conference called by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell,</inline> three States were represented, and there was evidently complete unanimity. </para>

              <para>- I said, speaking upon the second reading, that it was quite possible for the Commonwealth to intervene in other directions and seek the active cooperation of the States without endeavouring to create this new Department. The States are willing to co-operate with the Federal authority, and with each other, on any subject likely to be of benefit either to the States or to Australia as a whole. To say that petty jealousies exist between the States, when the future welfare of the States is at stake, is absurd. </para>

I regard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid,</inline> generally, as a very good authority upon Queensland. He has probably travelled over more of the State than any other Federal representative. He has come into contact with life far from civilization; but he said that if the Science Institute is&#34; established they will be growing wheat in the Gulf of Carpentaria. </para>

              <para>- If, as the result of the inauguration of the Commonwealth Institute, wheat is to be grown in the Gulf of Carpentaria, the day of miracles has not passed. Generally, so far as Queensland is concerned, our wheat-growing has not been as successful as could be desired. Unfortunately, the rainy season comes at the wrong time of the year. It is only a few years since all the indications promised a record crop on the Darling Downs; but rust set in as the result of untimely rains, and the crops were spoilt. </para>

I have been fairly patient, but I draw attention to the fact that the honorable senator should not discuss the whole of the Bill on this clause. He will have ample opportunity, as each clause comes under discussion, of moving any amendment. </para>

              <para>- I am reading from the extract, and summarizing its contents. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bunning</inline> stated that he was in hearty accord with the establishment of this Bureau, but, like honorable senators in this chamber, he was not in agreement as to the methods that are being adopted by the Government for this purpose. </para>

          <para>In view of the fact that you, sir, have ruled that I will be out of order in quoting <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bunning&#39;s</inline> remarks, all I have to say, in conclusion, is that I will very much regret if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap&#39;s</inline> amendment is defeated. Not one fresh argument has been advanced by honorable senators on either side of the chamber, or by the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Russell),</inline> to make me change my views in the least with reference to the establishment of this Institute of Science and Industry. Only within the last few days  we have had  evidence of active cooperation between the Commonwealth and State Governments in combating the weevil pest. And this has been done, too, without the creation of a fresh Commonwealth Department. For some considerable time past there has been complete cooperation between the various States in an effort to eradicate the weevil. </para>
          <para>The Minister is unable to point to any instance in which the State Governments have neglected their duty in dealing with these various pests. For many years, the Queensland Government have been offering a reward, at first of &#163;5,000, and then of &#163;10,000, for the discovery of an effective remedy for the prickly pear. Inquiries have been made in all parts of the world, but, in spite of this handsome reward, up to the present no effective means of dealing with the pest have been discovered. If the creation of this Institute of Science and Industry would lead to any fresh development in scientific research, I would not oppose the passage of the Bill, but I cannot see that anything fresh can be done. In the service of every State there are experts in their particular line of business - men who have given their whole life to the study of the many problems that are to be tackled by this new Department - men who are working today in an honest endeavour to find suitable remedies, and, in my opinion, they are doing very good service for this country. The argument that the States will not co-operate has been settled for all time by the fact that, as was stated in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> yesterday, and confirmed by the Minister himself to-day, only a few days&#39; ago the representatives of three States and of the Commonwealth Government met in conference for the purpose of considering measures designed for the eradication of the weevil pest, for the common good of the whole of Australia. They co-operated without any sign of those petty State jealousies which some honorable senators would lead us to believe exist to-day. In the interests of economy, and because I do not believe in duplication of work that is being done already, I hope the amendment will be carried. </para>

              <para>- Opponents of the measure, it appears, have now shifted their ground. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> put the position very clearly with regard to the cattle tick pest in Queensland, but according to the arguments of opponents of the Bill there is no need for science to go any further in that direction. One honorable senator, who quoted from a document this afternoon in support of his own argument, omitted to notice the very first statement in the article referred to, namely, that the annual loss caused to Australia by the tick amounted to &#163;2,500,000. The point I want to bring out, therefore, is: would it not be true economy to establish this Institute of Science even if it took five years to discover an effective remedy for that pest? It has been argued that the operation of the measure should be postponed for five years, but if the thing is good, we should have it to-day. If it is not good, then it should be postponed indefinitely. But not one of our opponents affirm that it is not good. They say it is good, and it does seem strange that, while they are firm believers in the. efficacy of scientific research, they want to postpone the operation of the measure. </para>

              <para>- I am second to none in my desire for economy, but I must be satisfied that what is proposed is true economy. If we can discover a remedy for evils that are causing loss to the community, it is false economy to refuse to expend what is necessary to make the discovery. We should not hesitate to spend &#163;100,000 to save &#163;1,000,000. Some honorable senators would appear to believe that we should Wait until other people do something and then take the crutches they have provided instead of walking on our own feet. In Australia we have hitherto claimed to be amongst the foremost of the nations in many respects, and I see no reason why we should not take a foremost place in the application of science to industry. </para>

          <para>. - When the sitting was suspended I was endeavouring to show how the arguments of those who are in opposition to this measure are practically answered by their own statements. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> affirmed that he is opposed to the Bill because it will unnecessarily duplicate existing machinery. In reply to his statement, I would point out that when the proposed Institute is established it will not be necessary for all the States to co-operate with each other on questions in respect of which the interests of all are not affected. In connexion with the losses caused by blowflies amongst the flocks in the northern part of Australia, for example, it would not be necessary for representatives of Tasmania to meet in conference representatives from Queensland.. But it might be well for the Tasmanian scientists simultaneously to investigate methods for dealing with this pest. Then I need hardly remind honorable senators that the Advisory Council of the Bureau of Science have noted that the losses at the present time consequent upon the tick pest amount to about &#163;2,500,000. The same body also points out that &#34; further scientific investigations as to the life-history of the cattle tick in Australia, and as to the micro-organism conveyed by the tick which causes the tick fever, should be carried out.&#34; Under this Bill it seems to me that that would be one of the first questions which scientists would investigate. Here is a parasite which causes the cattle to lose flesh and, finally, to die. Naturally, our scientists will attack the problem from the standpoint of how long the pest lives, what is its life-history, and what micro-organisms attach to it. Investigation will probably lead to the discovery of some serum by means of which cattle can be successfully inoculated against the tick. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>When we recollect what has been achieved by science in other directions, I do not wonder that every one of the opponents of this Bill has prefaced his remarks by a declaration that he is not opposed to science. But, whilst professedly not opposed to science,  the supporters of the amendment are certainly opposed to its operations in Australia. I admire much more the rhetoric with which they have clothed their arguments than I do the quality of those arguments. </para>

They will be considered by Cabinet; and honorable senators may rest assured that the desire of the Government is to make the institution the greatest success possible. They will probably secure the man they believe to be the most competent business man for the purpose, and also, I trust, the two most competent scientists available with the greatest knowledge of Australian problems. </para>

          <para>. -  I am sorry the Minister accepts the amendment, because it opens one of the very doors that we want to keep closed. It would be an advantage to have three directors with scientific attainments, provided that one also  haH  the business qualifications which the Government desire to secure in each. Some gentleman out of employment, who deserves well at the hands of the Government for the time being, or who can pull the strings sufficiently to induce the Government to look favorably on  his  application, or who has sufficient outside influence to impress his merits upon the Government, altogether apart from any. qualification he may have for connexion  with  a scientific institute,  may  otherwise get the position. The Committee would be well advised to leave the clause as it stands. I regard the words &#34; at least &#34; as the greatest safeguard in the clause for the appointment of capable scientific men to run the concern from which we hope so much. I am not suggesting that the Government will do anything improper; but, occasionally, men secure important public positions, and everybody wonders how they get them. This would be just opening the door for some such appointment. The measure has been very carefully drafted, and, no doubt, those words were inserted for a very good reason. No  reason  has been shown, at any rate, why they should be struck out. </para>

          <para>. -  I have accepted the proposed amendment because I believe  in  the principle. This Bill is not for the establishment of universities, or colleges, or technical schools, but to secure the trained scientist after he has finished his education. One of the prejudices against the measure, apparently, is that we are trying to secure scientists who will do nothing more than sit down in a room and dream. The object is to secure three men, one of whom, if possible, shall be a capable organizer. I hope that every scientific man in Australia who may have art idea to bring before the directors will become fully acquainted with the fact that there is an institution where he can get a hearing. Some of their proposals, of course, will be rejected on sight, while others will receive careful consideration and investigation. Correspondence, in the case of close technical work, is most unsatisfactory; but a capable organizer, of personality and strength of character, could go to the various State Governments and lay a project fully before them, thus bringing about desired harmony. It is earnestly desired to link up science with industry, and the production of the country. if the proposed directorate is merely to secure reports and place them on the shelf of a library, its work will not have been accomplished. </para>

        <para>It is not intended to put this measure through to-night. It is very .simple, and contains practically only one principle. I propose now to. move the first reading, and, thereafter, the second reading, leaving it to honorable senators to adjourn the debate, so that it may be carried on to-morrow if desired. </para>

          <para class="block">I desire briefly to point out that this is a war measure. It is intended as one of the means .adopted by the Government for raising necessary revenue to meet the annual expenditure in which the country is involved.. It imposes an additional tax, by way of postage, on existing rates. That tax will be an additional halfpenny on newspapers, letters, letter-cards, postcards  and  packets. That is the simple proposition contained in  thi3  measure. I think that honorable senators will agree that at a time like the present this is an equitable form of taxation to adoptThere is not the slightest doubt that our increasing expenditure necessitates additional taxation, and this is one means of raising additional revenue by taxation which was &#39; announced in the Budget of the Treasurer. The facts concerning the Bill are clear, the method of taxation proposed is one upon which honorable senators are able to form their&#39; own opinion, and I could not explain the measure more fully by discussing it at further length. </para>
