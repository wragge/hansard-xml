                        <para>Our experience with several vessels that have arrived with a large number of cases of pneumonic influenza on board goes to show that the  methods  adopted have proved effective in clearing up the disease in the shortest possible time, and with a minimum number  of  cases. The method  of  keeping the troops on board insures efficient control and regular medical inspections twice daily, and the rapid segregation of infected cases, which would not be possible if the troops were landed on an unequipped station on one of the islands close to the mainland. The <inline font-style="italic">Boonah</inline> arrived with nearly  400  cases on board. They were removed, and only eight oases appeared next day, six the following day, and two to-day. The probabilities are that there will not be any more, and that the ship will be able to leave in a day or two, and the remainder of the quarantine period spent on the run east, enabling the troops to reach their homes in the shortest possible time. If the troops were landed there would not be the same chance of inspection, and getting the cases under treatment in the very early stages which is most essential. In any case, long before it would be possible to clear Rottnest Island, and make the necessary preparation for the troops, the ship should be. cleaned up, and the soldiers on the way to their homes. It has to be borne in mind that the ship itself is not infected. The doctors are agreed that this disease is not transmitted by inanimate objects, and must be transmitted from individual to individual, and therefore, provided that those contracting the disease are removed as rapidly as they are discovered, the risk of others catching the complaint is reduced to an absolute  minimum.  This  is  borne out entirely by our experience, and I feel sure that the best has been done for the troops and the public in the steps that have been taken. Finally, Albany station will he used as much as practicable in dealing with other boats coming forward. </para>

                            <para>- I made inquiries this morning as to how this matter stands, and I find that there are two contractors working on the badges, of which 36,000 have already been delivered to the Department. The Department has been holding these until a sufficient number were in hand to warrant their distribution. This morning I gave instructions that the Department should immediately commence to distribute the badges which are in hand, and other badges as supplies are delivered. We are endeavouring to get the contractors to increase their supplies, but so far we have not met with much success in that direction. </para>

If so, will he afford them a further opportunity of placing their objections to the chosen site before him? </para>

                        <para>- The Minister for Defence informed me yesterday that there were thirty-eight Australian-born persona in internment camps in Australia, and eight individuals who were British born. Now that the war is practically over, will the Government release those men? Or, if there are offences against them which are not sufficiently serious to warrant the continuance of their internment, will the Government have them indicted and tried immediately? Also, is the Minister for Defence aware that there is a possibility of a fine crop of law cases arising over the illegal detention -of Australian subjects? </para>

No such regulations have been issued by the Department of Repatriation;but, from the nature of the question, I assume that &#39;the honorable senator is dealing with the ease of a man who is not a member of the Australian Imperial Force. In the circumstances, his case would not come within the ken of the Repatriation Department.

Owing to the pressure on that Department, however, due to the closing hours of the session, it has been impossible to give consideration to the matter. At the earliest possible moment the request will be dealt with, and the honorable senator will be communicated with direct. </para>

            <para>Clause 5 (Incorporation of Commissioner). </para>
            <para>SenatorNEWLAND (South Australia) &#91;11.22&#93;. - During the second-reading stage of the Bill I was not able to avail myself of the opportunity to address the Senate. However, under this clause, which deals with the incorporation of the Commissioner, I hope I shall be in  order  in making the few remarks which I had intended. I am glad to have noted that every section in the Senate has welcomed the introduction of the Bill. Certain shortcomings have been pointed out, and some of the operations proposed have not met with the complete approval of all honorable senators. A good deal, of course, will depend upon the appointment of the Commissioner and his staff, and upon the amount of liberty which will be granted to the Commissioner. The operations under the Bill will be of such a nature that it will be wise for the Commissioner to be given very wide powers; that is, if the measure is to be as successful as all honorable senators desire. I do not find fault with the Bill, but I trust the Minister will welcome any suggestions intended to improve it. </para>
            <para>In a discussion on a previous clause I pointed out that the Bill did not provide for all the ramifications with regard to soldiers and their dependants. There is no provision whereby the Commissioner may restrict, within certain limits, the nature of the applicants for homes. For instance, a returned soldier who is a wealthy man may make application. He may have thousands of pounds invested in Government bonds or other such securities, but he may not own a house or any property. He may ask to be provided with a home. In such circumstances, the Commissioner should have the power to say whether or not that person would be eligible to receive the benefits of this measure. </para>

                    <para>- A man with thousands of pounds may do so. I know that returned soldiers worth thousands of pounds have already applied for homes under one of the State provisions. There is no crime or offence in that, of course; but the trouble is that such applications may hinder or prevent more needy cases from receiving attention. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I hope the Commissioner and his staff will be as free as possible from political influence. The position of Commissioner is one wherein the occupant should not be hampered by interference on the part of Parliament. Of course, this official should be responsible to the Minister controlling the Department, and a tight rein should be kept upon his administration, particularly with regard to the funds at his disposal. </para>
                <para>The administration of this Bill will require the establishment of a very large Department. We must not be frightened at the expense that will be involved, and it must not be unduly curtailed by Parliament if we are to carry out properly the important duty which we owe to a very deserving section of the community. There can be no doubt whatever that branches of this Department will have to be established in every State, so that its work may be expedited, and no excuse may be given for complaints arising from delays in its administration. </para>
                <para>I am satisfied that the Commissioner will find it necessary to purchase large, as well as small, blocks of land to give effect to this measure, and it may be necessary in certain cases for him to acquire land outside present municipal boundaries in all the States, and beyond the reach of existing tram services and other facilities for transit. I do not think that there is any clause of the Bill under which the Commissioner can make arrangements for extending transit facilities to any area which he might find it desirable to purchase for the settlement of soldiers. He should be given some authority under the measure either to provide such means of transit himself, or to enter into negotiations with those controlling existing tramways, for the purpose. </para>
                <para>In the event of a model city being established by the Commissioner, he should be in a position to appoint a Board of Control, or some authority to supervise the settlement.. Recently the Public Works Committee was inquiring into the establishment of homes for workmen employed at the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow, and some little difficulty was found in dovetailing the responsibility of the Government and the local authority in connexion with the settlement proposed to be formed for the purpose. It is possible that the Commissioner may find it necessary to be in a position to settle such difficulties arising between his Department and local authorities. I do not know whether he will have the power to do so under this Bill, but if not, he certainly should be vested with it. </para>

                        <para>- I need not go into the details of the matter, but difficulties arose on those lines. Another matter which must not be overlooked is that in some of the States fairly liberal provision for homes for workmen and soldiers has already been enacted. I am better acquainted with the legislation which has been adopted in South Australia than with that of the other Sates. I may tell the Committee that in South Australia the returned soldier will not look at this scheme so long as the Government of that State continue to provide homes for workmen and soldiers on the liberal scale now operating. </para>

                        <para>- I am dealing with the appointment of the Commissioner, and with his powers and functions, and I hope that you, sir, will allow me to use arguments to show why it is necessary to increase the powers of the Commissioner under this Bill in order that its provisions may be generally availed of. For. that reason I think it well to draw comparisons between those provisions and legislation of a similar character which has been passed by some of the State Parliaments. Unless the provisions of this measure are liberalized, its operation will be found to be a comparative failure in South Australia, because the Government of that State are providing more generous terms for returned soldiers than are provided for in this Bill. Soldiers&#39; widows are provided with homes under the South Australian Act. They may, at a charge of 6s. per week, have homes provided for them which they may occupy for life. On their decease the homes may be sold, and the Government may recoup their expenditure in that way. Under the State legislation also, in such cases, rates and taxes are paid by the State for five years. </para>

                        <para>- The Repatriation Trustees did advance certain sums for the purpose. I have referred so extensively to what has been done by the South Australian Government, because I am anxious that this Bill should be made a success. If that is to be brought about, it will be necessary that full advantage shall be taken of the scheme in every State. The greater the number of people who do take advantage of it, the lower the cost will be comparatively. The Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen),</inline> I think, fixed 1 per cent. as sufficient to cover anticipated losses. I am anxious that his estimate may be realized, but if it is, the fullest possible advantage must be taken of the provisions of this measure. This should be the most generous proposal for dealing with the subject in the whole of Australia, but that cannot be said of it now. It is true that no deposit is asked for from the people who may elect to take advantage of its provisions, but some of these men will have a considerable sum of money to draw in the way of deferred pay, and will be able to put down a deposit so as to secure more generous terms. </para>

                <para>I have already informed the Minister that I do not desire to adversely criticise the Bill. No man has more sympathy with a measure of this kind than I, but I am anxious to assist the Minister in liberalizing the measure so that it may in every sense of the word be of substantial assistance to those persons who are likely to take advantage of it. I think the Commissioner should have the widest possible scope, and that Parliament should not be permitted to unduly interfere with his work. </para>

                    BOLTON (Victoria) &#91;11.47&#93;.  -  I have not previously spoken on this measure, which is really one phase of repatriation, and I would like now to take this opportunity of congratulating the Government upon the proposal to appoint a Commissioner, which is an acceptance of the principle which a minority of honorable senators have consistently advocated since the introduction of the Repatriation scheme. There are one or two matters which, in my judgment, appear to deserve consideration. I refer to the powers that may be invested in the Commissoner. I notice that it is proposed to pay him a salary of &#163;1,500 a year.

                        <para>.- It seems to me that as the clause relates to the appointment of a Commissioner, it also embraces the question of salary to be paid to him. As it is estimated, the Commissioner will control an expenditure of something like &#163;50,000,000, and, therefore, we might quite properly be permitted to discuss the question of his salary. </para>

                        <para>- My argument, then, based on these premises, is that the clause covers the whole ambit of the Commissioner&#39;s appointment, and I suggest to the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> that better results will be achieved by the appointment of a Board instead of allowing all these important matters to rest upon one man&#39;s judgment, one man&#39;s view of the position, one man&#39;s sympathy, or one man&#39;s antipathies. It may be that the Commissioner will have a predilection for one place more than another, and that his judgment will, in a measure, be circumscribed by prejudices, whereas a Board would take a wider viewpoint. This subject came up for discussion in the South Australian Parliament some years ago, when legislation for the erection of workmen&#39;s homes was under consideration, and Parliament took what I regarded as a wise course in deciding on the appointment of a Board, similar to the board of directors of a Savings Bank. Under the State Act, these men exercise all the powers which, under this clause, it is proposed to invest in the Commissioner, so I think it would be wise for the Committee to consider the alternative. In view of the variety of circumstances which must be considered in dealing with applications by returned soldiers, there will be a tendency to make the arrangement too autocratic if all the power is centred in the hands of one man. I  have  no sympathy with the creation of bureaux, pure and simple, but there is good in all things, and we ought to take the best from both systems. I should prefer a Board of three in this case. </para>

                    <para>. - My  only desire is to get the most effective machinery. There might be a good deal in favour of securing a Commission of three instead of one, if it were contemplated that a single Commissioner should carry on the whole organization himself ; but the Bill provides that he shall, if possible, utilize the existing machinery of  the </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">State Savings Banks. My conversations with the responsible representatives of banks justify the statement that such  an  arrangement is feasible, and, if it is made, while the Commissioner will be the controlling head, applications will  be  dealt with under his direction by the Savings Banks Commissioners in the various States. In the circumstances it did not seem to me that I was justified in asking Parliament to appoint and pay three men, when, if that scheme materialized, one should be sufficient. In all those matters I decline to dogmatize, because we are dealing too much with the realm of the unknown. Oh the supposition that working arrangements can be arrived  at  with the State Savings Banks, I ask  the  Committee to accept the Bill as it stands, with the knowledge that if it is not found workable it will be possible to alter  the  constitution of the Commission. </para>

It is essential to get a thoroughly good man for this job, and two things which will appeal to him are the remuneration and the tenure.

There are, however, some advantages attaching to the Public Service which, to an extent, compensate for the comparative small ness of the salaries paid. </para>

                        <para>- He will be  a  public servant in the same sense as is the Public Service Commissioner, though he will not be subject to any other public servant. Speaking for myself, I can assure the honorable senator that if I found that a suitable man for the position could not be obtained at the salary stated in the clause - a man in whom the Government could repose the most implicit confidence - I should, without hesitation, agree to pay a higher salary, and would look to Parliament to subsequently indemnify my action. That, perhaps, would be a little irregular, but I think that Parliament would say I was justified in obtaining the services of the best man, even if I had to pay a little more for them. But no appointment will be made under this clause unless the Government are fully satisfied as to the competency of the person to be appointed. </para>

But if it is to be left to the Government to determine whether one man is worth only &#163;1,500 a year, whilst another is worth &#163;2,000, I see no reason why we should not specify in the Bill the remuneration that we are prepared to pay to a good man.

                        <para>- But applicants may refuse to accept the position unless they do get it. In Queensland, we have a very able man conducting the State Savings Bank, with which is embodied the administration of theWorkers&#39; Dwelling Act, the Agricultural Banking Act, and the Discharged Soldiers&#39; Settlement  Act.  All these Statutes are administered by  a  very capable officer, whose salary is only &#163;1,200 per annum. I contend that a man occupying an administrative position  of  that character has very much more responsibility than will the gentleman  who  is appointed Commissioner under this Bill. In these circumstances, I am  of  opinion that a salary of &#163;1,500 a year  is  an adequate one. I do not anticipate  an  expenditure of &#163;50,000,000 of which the Minister spoke. </para>

What the honorable gentleman intended to convey was that the sum involved  in  housing our returned soldiers may eventually amount to &#163;50,000,000- quite  a  different thing from an expenditure  of  &#163;50,000,000 of Commonwealth money. </para>

In replying to his statement, and speaking for myself, I said  that  if I were faced with that alternative I would be willing  to  pay more. However, I do not think that it will be necessary  to  do that. Seeing that the Commissioner will have a tenure of seven years, I still think it will be possible to get a competent man for the position at the salary specified in the Bill. </para>

But I shall not vote for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton&#39;s</inline> amendment, because the amount of the Commissioner&#39;s salary is a matter for the Government to determine, and not for this Committee. In New South Wales our Chief of Police receives &#163;1,500 a year, together with  a  housing allowance of &#163;200 a year, and  a  travelling allowance of &#163;2 2s. per day. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> has already pointed out, we may probably get just as good  a  man for &#163;1,200 a year as we shall get for double that amount. Our first duty, however, is to ascertain whether he is competent to fill the office. After his competency has been proved, we shall be in a position to increase his salary if that course should be deemed advisable. </para>

                    <para>.- The Bill would be materially improved if the first sub-clause of this clause were excised, and the amount of salary were not stated. It is not wise to specify the salary which shall attach to the position of Commissioner for a longer period than he may continue in office. Even the Minister himself has pointed out that it may be cheaper to pay a suitable man a higher salary than that which is set out in the clause. For this reason I think we ought not to define the salary which shall be paid to the Commissioner. </para>

                        <para>- That is why I have raised the question. It is precisely what I thought the honorable gentleman intended to convey. I understood him to say that if a thoroughly competent man were available for the position, he would not hesitate to appoint him at a higher salary than that specified in this clause, relying upon Parliament to subsequently vote any additional money that might be required. Of course, if the Minister meant that he would first obtain the sanction of Parliament, I misunderstood his remarks. I agree with the honorable gentleman that the very best man should be appointed to the position of Commissioner, and that in the long run such a man will prove to be the cheapest. At the same time, I do not think it wise to leave the salary that is to be paid to the occupant of that office entirely to the discretion of the Minister. My own opinion is that a salary of &#163;1,500 is scarcely sufficient. </para>

I do not suggest, however, that that would be the only alternative. One other would be to arrive at a temporary arrangement with the gentleman appointed, until the matter could be brought before Parliament in the ordinary and proper manner.

If we go outside of the Government, we find business corporations paying their managers, who do not transact anything like the volume of business, or business of so important a character, salaries amounting to three and four times those received by leading Government officials. I know of a man who  is  responsible under the Government for very great financial undertakings, yet there are business men who are - so to speak - selling dolls&#39; eyes and are receiving higher salaries than that Government servant. It is a position which the Government should seriously consider.

No doubt  it  will prove  to  be necessary to relieve some of those officials of their duties, on the ground  of  incompetency, If officers to be engaged for the administration of this measure are to be appointed under the provisions of the Public Service Act, it will be difficult to get rid of them should they be found to be incompetent. The Commissioner who will be appointed under the &#34;Wax Service Homes enactment should be given the power of appointment and dismissal of his officers. I propose to move an amendment in that direction.

The Commissioner will be appointed for a term of seven years. I question, therefore, whether Parliament would be prepared to hand over to an individual holding such a brief tenure of office the right to appoint and dismiss whom he may please. He would be open to accusations of tyranny or favoritism; without any check on the part of the Parliament. In the Repatriation Department, Parliament could require the dismissal of any member of the staff immediately. It is necessary that the staff to be appointed under this measure should be given those guarantees which are represented by the Public Service Act. This clause has been inserted in its present form to assure that staff that their future in the Service will not be impaired by the likes and dislikes of any one official. </para>

                    <para>. - I support the attitude adopted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton.</inline> My experience has been that when a man is appointed under the Public Service Act, he is there to stay, whether he is competent or otherwise. Once he has become a member of the Public Service he joins a great permanent army ; or, at any rate, he requires a good deal of shifting. In the Queensland Railways Department, which is administered by the Commissioner of Railways, the latter is appointed for a shorter tenure of office than is proposed under this Bill. He has under him thousands of railway employees. He has the sole administration of the Act, and the final voice in the appointment or dismissal of all railway servants. If there is one Department which has in the past given satisfaction, so far as the staff is concerned, it is the Queensland Railway Department. The same facts  hold  good in Victoria. The Railways Commissioners have the sole charge of their staffs. In view of these facts, I trust the Minister will reconsider the clause. </para>

                    <para>. -  I agree with those honorable senators&#39; who have just spoken, from the view-point that I dread increasing our Public Service. We are becoming tremendously loaded up, and soon this community will be top-heavy. The Commissioner under this measure, when appointed, will have to apply to the Public Service Commissioner for a staff. He will have to take just those officials whom the Commissioner may allot to him. Much of the success of this project will depend upon the staff appointed. If the chief executive officer could choose his own officials, he would be more likely to secure a satisfactory staff. I do not suppose that he would be allotted the pick of our public servants by the Public Service Commissioner, for the reason that they are already actively engaged in other Departments. And, by the way, there are splendid men in our Public Service. The scheme to be established under this Bill will have greater chances of success if the administering Commissioner possesses the power to choose the men he wants. </para>

                    BOLTON (Victoria) &#91;12.45&#93;.  -  If this clause is carried in its present form the effect of it will be to practically shut the gate against returned soldiers desiring to secure an appointment in this particular branch of the Repatriation Department. Certain action has been taken by Parliament to facilitate the entry of returned soldiers into the Public Service, but there are still many difficulties in the way of returned men securing appointments in the Service. The clause provides that persons employed by the Commissioner are to be subject to the Commonwealth Public Service Act. Honorable senators will recollect that the Defence Department had quite a number of public servants in its employ, and it was necessary for Parliament to pass special legislation to enable that Department to properly deal with members of its staff who were also members of the Public Service. The Commissioner should be placed in a position enabling him to exercise his own judgment as to the qualifications required of men whom he will employ in the work of the administration of this measure.

                    <para>. -  I have been very much impressed by the arguments of Senators Fairbairn and Bolton. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> points out that, theoretically at least, this proposed building scheme is not a permanent one, and will gradually become exhausted, as it serves the purpose for which it has been introduced. The honorable senator suggests that, for that reason, we should consider that if the staff appointed to administer this measure are to be under the Public Service Act, we may find ourselves, when the purpose of the measure has been served, with a number of officers in this branch of the Repatriation Department, who may claim, under the Public Service Act, a continuous tenure of office. That is a very important consideration. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> has pointed out that the clause may render it difficult to give preference to returned soldiers in appointments to the staff. I recognise that both these arguments have a good deal of weight.. It is impossible for me to make a final statement on the matter now, and, in the circumstances, I suggest that the Committee might negative the clause, and, later on, I shall be prepared to introduce something to take its place. </para>

                    <para>. - This is one of the most important clauses in the Bill. Under it the Commissioner may acquire practically any land in any part of the Commonwealth, including land which has been dedicated, reserved, or set apart for any public or other purpose. There is a limitation upon the power of the Commissioner in sub-clause 5, which provides that before proposing to acquire land involving the expenditure of more than &#163;5,000, he shall submit the proposal for the approval of the Minister. It must not be forgotten that this means that power is given under the Bill to the Commissioner to purchase land involving an expenditure of up to &#163;5,000 at his own discretion, and without consulting the Minister. Another important feature of the clause is contained in sub-clause 4. under which the Commissioner is given power to subdivide land. It occurs to me that some returned soldiers may have land of their own on which they would like to have a home built, and the Bill should make provision to enable the Commissioner to build on land the fee-simple of which is held by a returned soldier. </para>

                    <para>. - I submitted that information in my second-reading speech, and I cannot now undertake to quote from memory the exact figures I then used. I believe that the proposal under the Bill works out at 9 s. 9d. per month per &#163;100 for the thirty-seven years&#39; lease, and that the charge in respect of a house costing &#163;600 would amount to 13s. 4d. per week. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Newland</inline> will, I think, recognise that the difference between a thirty-seven years&#39; lease and a fifty years&#39; lease is really insignificant. The increased weekly payment for the shorter lease would be very small. I venture to say that if the proposition were put to a borrower that by paying a few pence more per week he could secure his title in thirty-seven years, and by paying a little less he could not secure it until fifty years had elapsed, he would prefer to take advantage of the shorter term. </para>

                <para class="block">The purpose of my amendment is to prevent the Commissioner from selling the land to the returned soldier, but to keep it in perpetuity in his possession as Commissioner. It would be very much better for a returned soldier if, instead of having fastened round his neck the debt of a freehold property, which many a man could not hope to pay for in his lifetime, he were given the leasehold at a rental sufficient to cover the cost of the land, together with the building, making due allowances for depreciation in value. It is well known to honorable senator <inline font-style="italic">s</inline> that many private owners decline to part with the freehold. Not only is this the case in Australia, but right throughout the civilized world. If it is a good thing for the private owner - and the opinion on this question is pretty well unanimous - to stick to the freehold, it should also be good for the Commonwealth to do likewise. </para>

                    <para>. -  I do not think it necessary to detain the Committee long in discussing this amendment. It is a simple proposition that we should compel those who take advantage of the provisions of this measure to be satisfied with a leasehold. I am not going to  argue  the principle which is so dear to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant&#39;s</inline> heart, but I say that if  he  wants to bring in a big reform or change of this nature, it ought not to be attempted in connexion with a measure which deals with only a section of the people. I object to an attempt to limit this panacea to returned soldiers. Let <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> get to work as a missionary to convert the whole community, and let the whole community be treated in the same way. This amendment would be making an invidious distinction in the case of returned soldiers, and I ask the Committee to reject it. </para>

                <para class="block">The adoption of this amendment would, I think, get over a difficulty which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> and I encountered under clause 16. I think it would be excellent if this principle could be adopted by the Government in this housing scheme for returned soldiers, in order&#39; to guard against overcrowding. The area defined in the proposed new paragraph is a fair minimum for the erection of a house, and I do not think any hardship would be entailed by its adoption. We may assume that most of the land to be acquired will be in the suburbs or country districts, and, in the case of those soldiers who, perhaps, already own blocks of land, which may be too small for the erection of a home, if this provision be inserted, I do not think that any hardship will be inflicted, because it would be possible for them to dispose of it, and, under the operations of this measure, acquire a larger area. There is a good deal of overcrowding in every capital city of the Commonwealth. Even Brisbane is not free from the evil, despite the fact that millions of acres are available in that State for settlement. The present condition of affairs in our capital cities does not say much for the foresight of those who were instrumental in founding them.I trust the Minister will give this proposal serious consideration.It is not my intention to delay the passage of the Bill. I think it would be excellent if, under this measure, the Government made an effort to prevent undue overcrowding, but I am sure that a lead by the Government in this direction would have a beneficial effect on the community. </para>

                    <para>. -  I hope the honorable senator will not press his amendment. I recognise with him that there is room for considerable improvement in the matter referred to, but I again say that this is not a measure in which social reforms of this kind should be introduced. The Bill is intended to give opportunities to returned soldiers to obtain their homes. If the honorable senator will think for a moment, he will see, I am sure, that it is not desirable to make this Bill a lever for the accomplishment of his purpose. The proposition is that the area of land shall be not less than about1/4 acre. Suppose a soldier has, by saving over a long period of time, bought a small block of land, say 30 perches, and desires, under the provisions of this measure, to erect a home. If the Committee adopts the amendment, he will be precluded from making application to the Commissioner, because his allotment will be short of the statutory area, although, for business and other reasons, it may be his earnest desire to have his home in that particular locality. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks&#39;</inline> amendment would operate harshly. He has pointed out that if a returned soldier has a block of land smaller than the area defined in the amendment he may dispose of it, but I have never yet heard of a man selling land without having to pay somebody something. The transfer fees alone would involve the payment of a few pounds, and that surely would be a disadvantage. I would point out, also, that in suburban areas1/4 acre of land would probably have a frontage of from 50 feet to 60 feet, and the purchase price would involve considerable expenditure, with the result that there would not be very much of the &#163;700 to be granted under this Bill left with which to build a home. It is safe to say that in. the suburbs of our capital cities land would be worth from &#163;4 to &#163;5 a foot in many cases, so that the value of a house would be out of all proportion to the value of the land, and as a letting proposition it would be an entirely business deal. </para>

                    <para>. - An ordinary1/4acre block of land for building purposes is usually 1 chain frontage by21/2 chains deep, and at from &#163;3 to &#163;5 per foot the purchase of this land would, as the Minister says, run away with the greater portion of the &#163;700 that will be available as an advance under this Bill. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> that an endeavour should be made to prevent overcrowding, but it seems to me that a difficulty would arise by the adoption of his amendment. I have no doubt that many cases will occur in which it will be advisable for the Department to purchase land in suburban areas of our capital cities to suit the convenience of applicants who may desire to live close to their place of employment, otherwise expense will be involved in fares to and from work. Although land less than1/4-acre might be a little on the small side, if it were conveniently situated it might suit an applicant better than a block in some other locality. I think, therefore, that the amendment would hamper the Department. </para>

We are considering the repatriation of men who went away to fight for Australia, and no opposition should be offered to a proposal that such a man should be given at least 32 perches. I gather that the Minister has no objection to the principle of the amendment, but does not want to graft it on to the Bill. Last Sunday, in St. Paul&#39;s Cathedral; the Reverend C. BT.

                        <para>- That is no reason why these men should. As the Minister estimates that the cost of the whole scheme will run into &#163;50,000,000. we should put it on a proper basis, and give the Commissioner definite instructions not to cut up land into smaller areas thant 32 perches, or, as near as possible, five blocks to the acre. That should be regarded as the very minimum, and we should give him a broad hint that we want the areas to be as big as possible. At Daceyville, near Sydney, the blocks are too small. </para>

I do not disparage what has been offered by the Government under this Bill; but to prevent misconception and dissatisfaction in the future, it is as well to state that the scheme is a business proposition founded actuarially on a sound basis from the point of view of the Government, and that there is no concession to the returned soldiers so far as the loaning of the money is concerned, except the very liberal terms of repayment. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; up to 1 per cent. as the Minister indicated. It would be an improvement on an excellent scheme to stipulate that when a returned soldier is allotted a block of land for the erection of a dwelling under this Act, the area of the block shall be at least 32 perches. That would represent exactly five blocks to the acre. Such an allotment is small enough in a country like Australia. When we are told that thousands of people are living upon allotments of half that area, my reply is that that is no reason why our returned soldiers should be restricted to allotments of . 16 perches. If one takes the trouble to journey to some of our Melbourne suburbs by train, he will see any number of pocket-handkerchief allotments. </para>

If we compel soldier applicants to acquire allotments of a quarter of an acre, they will either have to pay a tremendous price for their land over and above the proportionate value of their houses, or they will have to go into the remoter suburbs if they are to get homes for &#163;700. </para>

                    <para>. -  It is quite true that the tendency in all municipalities to-day is to rate upon land values only. It is equally true that the general trend of events is in favour of exempting improvements. Where these are taxed the rates are higher in proportion to the improvements made; but in other instances the improvements are not taxed at all. There is, however, no reason why houses of a very expensive character should be built. The proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> will not interfere with the right of the Commissioner to purchase any microscopic blocks which have been cut up by land-jobbers, who are now awaiting increased values. There are thousands of these persons throughout Australia. It is only when a number of blocks have been purchased by the Commissioner that the proposal will become operative. </para>

                    <para>. -  I do not think the Committee are likely to agree to the amendment. In the first place,  it  seeks to establish two sets of conditions. It affirms that a man who is going out into a particular district shall not acquire an allotment of less than a certain area ; but the individual who is attracted by a house with, perhaps, a mortgage upon it, may acquire the allotment upon which it stands, no matter what may be its size. The result would be that some persons would be enabled to go into our slum areas, whilst others would be forced out into new areas.

                        <para>- In cutting up an area such as I have outlined, it would be found that there were corner blocks of a larger or smaller size than that stipulated in the amendment. These blocks would not be available for selection by the soldier. They would be vacant allotments, the cost of which would have to be added to the cost of the allotments available for selection, the result being  that the prices of the latter would be increased to the soldier. I have paid a good deal of attention to the town-planning scheme adopted at Daceyville, and I have never heard a solitary settler there complain, although the settlement contains many odd blocks of a smaller size than that prescribed by the amendment. But my greatest objection to the proposal is that it would apply a particular set of conditions to one class of applicants, and a different set of conditions to another class. A Commissioner will not be chosen who has no idea of town planning. </para>

                <para>The only difference between the two clauses is in respect to making provision for those applicants who are able to pay a deposit of 10 per cent. I said, in the course of my second-reading remarks, that there was a difference between the position of the applicant who was unable or unwilling to make a deposit and that of the man who was prepared to do so. By inadvertence in the drafting of clause 21, however, the provision referring to the 10per cent. deposit was not included. A man who has not paid a deposit will have the land vested in the Commissioner until, in the process of time, the nominal owner has built up, by his regular payments, the necessary amount of deposit; whereupon, he also would be in a position to obtain a mortgage. </para>

But if he desires to select his own site, or to build a house for himself, he must find 10 per cent. of the cost. </para>

                    <para>.- That is not so. Suppose that a man indicates to the Commissioner a particular house which he desires, and that he has no deposit. The Commissioner would buy, and the title would vest in the Commissioner. But if an applicant made a deposit, he  could buy, and the title would be vested in him. It is only a legal difference, because, in both cases, the soldier applicant would have the same interest in the property, and he would be occupying it. It is merely a question whether the title deed is to be vested in his name, or in that of the Commissioner. Where no deposit has been paid, the title would vest in the Commissioner until the amounts paid by the resident mounted up so as to give him the right to have the title deed made over in his own name. </para>

                    <para>.- During the course of the second-reading debate, I made some remarks with regard to the desirability of extending the term for repayments in relation to wooden buildings. I think the period should be extended to twenty-five years, and, possibly, even longer. It would be within the option of the applicant to avail himself of that extended term of not. If he could repay within ten or fifteen years so much the better for him. But an extended term would place a reduced liability on the borrower. I have had experience where men have borrowed in order to build properties, and they have found it a task to keep up with repayments; wherefore, they have asked that the period be extended. </para>

I think it would be well if power  were given. to the Commissioner to have repairs made in such a case, and the repayment of their cost spread over a certain period. Under the definition of &#34; eligible person &#34; there will be many who will not be in receipt of regular incomes, and who will not be in a position to pay in a lump sum for necessary repairs to the dwellings they occupy. I should be glad if the Minister could see his way to insert a provision to deal with these cases. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not think that a special clause is . necessary for the purpose suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior.</inline> Under this Bill the obligation is upon the occupier to keep his house in order, and it is only when he does not discharge that obligation that the Commissioner steps in and does the necessary work. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> has referred to the case of widows or other persons possessed of only small incomes who might find it difficult to pay &#163;3 or &#163;4 in one sum for repairs. I point out to the honorable senator that it will be possible for the Commissioner under regulations to provide in such cases for weekly payments of 3d. or 6d., or some small amount, to be collected to meet the expense of repairs. There should be no difficulty about that if the occupier of the house were willing to agree to the arrangement; but there is now no power under the Bill to compel the acceptance of such a proposal, and some people might resent the collection of amounts in that way. In the settlement at Daceyville they have carried the idea of collecting amounts in small weekly payments to a great extent. They not only make collections for the payment of rates in that way, but a small sum is collected each week from tenants for the purpose of keeping a communal gardener employed. That is done by arrangement, and by that means, for a very small sum paid by each tenant per week, a gardener is employed to keep the little plots of the settlement in good order. I think that it would be better to leave the Commissioner to work out these matters when he is in a position to know the wishes of the people with whom he will have to deal. </para>

                    <para>. - Under an Act passed by the South Australian Government in 1917, making provision for the accommodation of returned soldiers, there is a section which sets out that if the owner or occupier is a widow, or the widowed mother of a deceased soldier,  the cost of repairs or renovations of premises occupied by her shall be paid as to one-half out of the fund, and as to the other half out of moneys provided by Parliament for the purpose of the Act. It is provided, further, that the amount of such costs shall bear interest at 4 per cent, per annum, and repayments are to be made by the owner or occupier in equal weekly instalments, to cover principle and interest, of 2s. per cent, per annum until the amount of interest thereon is fully paid up. I mention that provision of the South Australian law for the information of the Minister for Repatriation. If the honorable senator prefers that the matter should be dealt with by regulation under this Bill, I am content. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not think that such a provision as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> has quoted from the South Australian Act would properly find a place in this Bill. It deals with a matter to which the attention of the Repatriation Commission should be directed. The Commissioner, under this Bill, is empowered to build himself, or to advance money for the building of, houses on a business basis. Under the South Australian Act which has been quoted, the State gives widows and other dependants of soldiers the occupation of houses for about one-half of their value. Any proposal such as that suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> should, I think, be met by the main Repatriation Act. Our sympathies, of course, go out to the widows of deceased soldiers. But I may remind honorable senators that, when the provision to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> has referred was made by the South Australian Government, the widow of a deceased soldier was entitled to a pension of only &#163;1 per week if she had one child, but, under the conditions existing at the present time, a widow with -one child is entitled to a pension of &#163;2 per week. The Repatriation Department has proceeded on the basis that it is desirable to give each of these women an income which will enable her to live in a humble way and leave her, at the same time, free to make her own arrangements. </para>

                <para class="block">In introducing the Bill, I pointed out that these provisions are required to safeguard the occupiers of the houses against speculation. It is intended to prevent a civilian acquiring the benefits designed by the Act to be conferred upon soldiers, and also to prevent unfair trafficking between one soldier and another. For various reasons a soldier might be tempted to give a price to secure a house which would not be a fair price. Whilst the Commissioner would not interfere with legitimate traffic under this proposal, he would be able to stand by and see that all dealings were fair and square. The proposal is made in the interests of the soldiers themselves, and I suggest that this provision, which is taken from the South Australian Act, should be adopted. </para>

                    <para>. -  I made an inquiry on this point, and I find that the constitutional difficulty may be in the way, since stamp duties are imposed by State laws. There is a doubt as to whether we might not regard these things as Commonwealth instrumentalities, in which case they would escape State taxes. If that is not the true position, merely stating in this Bill that they are exempt, would not exempt them if we have no constitutional right to so deal with the matter. The subject has been under the consideration of the Law Officers of the Crown, and they advise that if these things are constitutionally free from State taxes it is not necessary to include a provision to that effect in  the  Bill, and if they are not free, the inclusion of such a provision would not help us. </para>

But I pointed out the great disability the Commonwealth would labour under if advances were authorized upon leased lands, because if a lease were forfeited there would be the risk of the security passing into hands other than those of the Commonwealth. In the case of Canberra and the Northern Territory, however, forfeiture of leases would revert to the Commonwealth Government, and in the circumstances it seems only right, and a perfectly safe thing to do, to extend the provisions of this measure to such lands. </para>

                <para class="block">I am almost ashamed to suggest that in this case the minimum area upon which a dwelling-house may be erected shall not be less than 32 perches. When we consider that we have an area of 500,000 square miles in the Northern Territory and of 1,000 square miles at Canberra, it should not be necessary to instruct the Commissioner definitely that in no case shall a dwelling-house be erected on an allotment of less than 32 perches. In view of the manner in which houses are being erected on small areas in other parts of the Commonwealth, I believe the amendment is necessary. I do not propose to the Minister that he should provide only for blocks of that area. The larger the blocks are the better I shall like them. It is a scandal that any amendment of this kind should be required in connexion with a place like Canberra or the Northern Territory. I wish to test the feeling of the Committee by my amendment, so that at a later stage, when I move for the recommittal of the Bill to insert a similar clause dealing with freehold lands, honor able senators will be in a position to see what they have done with their own estates. I have not the slightest faith in Commissioners unless something of a definite character is laid down for their guidance. </para>

                        <para>- If the authorities at Canberra cut up acre blocks into six, fen. or twenty allotments I would not build upon them. They should not permit buildings to be erected on such blocks. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> knows that it has been necessary in all Local Government Acts to lay down a regulation defining the size of allotments for dwelling houses  in order to prevent land jobbers cutting up estates into blocks of unsuitable sizes. The Minister knows, also, that it has been necessary to resume large areas in Sydney and suburbs to rectify grave mistakes in the past by people who had no regard whatever for the welfare of our citizens. In the subdivision of Sydney and suburban blocks they provided long strips for streets and narrow frontages for allotments. &#39; On one occasion it was necessary to step in and take definite action. I think the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid was responsible for the measure which provides that no street shall be less than 60 feet in width. Up to the time that Act was passed owners of property were permitted to divide estates and allow widths of only 30 feet or 40 feet for streets. The tendency everywhere, so far as I can gauge public opinion, is to go in for town planning and provide a minimum width for all streets. </para>

                        <para>- In a case of that kind it is mandatory for the houses to stand a long way back from the street alignment. When the streets are narrow, and the houses built right up to the footpath, a bad condition of affairs is produced, especially in a fairly warm climate like that of Australia. The tendency is now for Local Government Acts to be so worded as to prevent houses being erected on unsuitable blocks. Unless there was some supervision, people would erect two or three houses where there is scarcely room for one. It is not sufficient to impose the rates on the land values only It is necessary to supplement that very excellent scheme of taxation by other provisions, such as this one. I saw recent regulations forbidding the erection of cottages or two-storied houses attached to each other. </para>

                        <para>- We have no municipality yet in Canberra, but we have a straight-out flat rate, <inline font-style="italic">a la</inline> Henry George, on land values there, with no graduations or exemptions, which is working very well. I am ashamed to have to move a provision of this kind when we are dealing with land that actually belongs to the Australian people, as Canberra does. I hope the Commissioner will spend a large amount of the money placed at his disposal at Canberra, and that the Minister for Repatriation will also spend large sums in that area. If Canberra was the property of a private individual, and he had money at his disposal as the Commonwealth has, he would not dream of expending a penny under the Repatriation Act except at Canberra. </para>

It was designed to apply to all lands that might be acquired by the Commissioner. This amendment applies only to the Northern Territory, Canberra, or any other Federal Territory. If the authorities at Canberra are so short-sighted as to cut up the area there into microscopic blocks, I hope that not one penny of the money placed at the disposal of the Minister will he spent there. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> stand for the proposition that a man who has fought for Australia is not entitled to a block of at least 32 perches in area ? </para>

                        <para>- If I had my way I would put a definite instruction in the Bill to the authorities who will cut up Canberra, to make no block less than 32 perches in area. If they do, it will be their fault if they prevent the settlement of returned soldiers on that land. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator. Millen&#39;s</inline> arguments are most flimsy, and carry no weight anywhere. I understood that Canberra was to be a thing of beauty and a joy for ever, but now I learn that there is a danger of our returned soldiers not going there unless the authorities are allowed to cut the land up into small blocks, which will be a disgrace to the Commonwealth. </para>

These women have no legal status under this Bill, and I desire to know whether some provision cannot be made for them?

This matter was mentioned on the motion for the second reading of the Bill, and I have since looked into it. I must, however, say quite frankly that I am not able to put forward any solution of the difficulty. There is at the present time a case before  the Department in which a deceased soldier has left behind a widow, an aged mother, and a <inline font-style="italic">de facto</inline> wife. There are numerous complications of this sort. &#34;Whilst many of these women have been treated with a measure of generosity by the Department, I do not know that we can do much for them under this Bill. It is idle to bring them within its scope, if their circumstances will not enable them to make the payments that would be required of them. </para>

Before such gift was accepted by the Commissioner through the Department, I assume that an investigation would be made as to whether the gift was a suitable one, and whether it could be put to the use for which the donor had made it. It would not be satisfactory to donors if land given for the erection of soldiers&#39; homes in a particular locality was afterwards sold by the Commissioner because of its alleged unsuitability. </para>

Suppose that somebody presents the Department with an allotment of land worth &#163;50 or &#163;100 for the purposes of a soldier&#39;s home under this Bill. Let us further suppose that the Commissioner advances an additional &#163;600 for the erection of a home upon that allotment. If the man becomes a defaulter, surely the Commissioner must have power to recover the amount which he has advanced upon it? </para>

I have here a new clause, which, although rather long, in effect places the staff under the Commissioner in the same position as the staff provided for under the Repatriation Act. The Commissioner will have the responsibility of selecting, appointing, and dismissing his officers. That is all contained in a&#39; few lines, and the bulk of the clause is a necessary provision to meet the case of a number of present public servants whose services may be required by the Commissioner temporarily or permanently.

                    <para>. - I am opposed to the proposed new clause. I prefer the clause which was negatived by the Committee. The Minister is now proposing the appointment of a new Commonwealth staff in connexion with which it will be possible for the Commonwealth Government as an employer to evade their proper duty. There will be on the staff men of the professional, clerical, and other divisions, who will desire to come under the provisions of the Public Service Act in the same way as officers employed in other Departments, and they will be unable to do so. I object to this proposed method of employment by the Commonwealth Government, who have to be fined to compel them to obey awards of the Court and pay fair wages. The proposed new clause will give the Government another Commonwealth Department, in which it will be possible for the Commissioner as the employer to evade his just obligation to those whom he will employ. </para>

                    <para>. -  This new Department will have at its disposal the expenditure of an enormous sum of money. No doubt the Commissioner and his staff will be provided with elaborately-furnished and palatial offices. Provision is made to enable cer- &#39; tain officers to retain whatever privileges they now possess under the Public Service Act, while the other employees of the Department are to be treated as outcasts. Why should those who will be doing the actual work of the Department be treated differently from other officers? The clause which has been negatived would give the Commissioner the power of control over the staff which is exercised by the heads of Departments under the Public Service Act, and the Minister has given no reason for this proposed departure. It may have been settled by the party on the other side that the new clause is to pass, but the Minister should give us the reasons underlying the proposal. If this Department is to do any work, and is not, like the Institute of Science and Industry, to sit  here  in Melbourne trying to catch blowflies in Queensland and to eradicate the prickly pears in that State without doing very much work, a large staff will be required. I protest against the proposed departure, and hope the Committee will not agree to it. </para>

                    <para>. - I did not explain the purpose of the new clause, because, as honorable senators will bear me out, there was a discussion on it earlier in the day. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> wishes to know the reason for its introduction, I may inform him that in discussing the clause which has been negatived <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> took the point that the scheme which will be established under this Bill will, unless something unforeseen happens, become exhausted by the effluxion of time, when the soldiers&#39; needs in this direction have been met. It was therefore considered undesirable that there should be a considerable number of permanent employees under the Public Service Act on the staff whom it might be necessary later on to dismiss. Another reason for the new clause was that &#39;brought forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton,</inline> who urged that a freer opportunity would be given to employ returned soldiers in forming the staff if the Commissioner were not tied down to the provisions of the Public . Service  Act.  I understand that for those reasons it was generally agreed that a provision such as that contained in the new clause should be adopted, and I hope that honorable senators will allow the proposed new clause  to  go through. </para>

                    <para>.- We passed a Bill the other day to meet the difficulty suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton,</inline> and in my view there was little force in the reason  for  an amendment .given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn.</inline> Under the clause which waa negatived, all persons employed, by the Commissioner were  to  be subject  to  the Public Service Act, and the Commissioner, in relation to the persons employed by him, was to have all the powers of a permanent head and chief officer within the meaning of the Public Service Act. I distinctly prefer that clause to the new clause which has now been proposed, and which will give the Commonwealth  Government  another opportunity to evade the provisions  of  the law in respect  of  persons employed by them. We are to have under consideration shortly a Bill which in this respect proposes to anticipate  the judgment of a Court, but I would not be permitted to refer to that measure at length. This will give the Government another loophole to evade awards of the Arbitration Court, and I hope it will be rejected. </para>

                    <para>. - One of the reasons stressed by Senators Fairbairn, Foll, and Bolton for the deletion of clause 15 as originally introduced has not been mentioned. They stressed the danger of an abnormal increase of the Commonwealth Public Service. It is now proposed that the men engaged by the Commissioner are not to be subject to the provisions of the Public Service Act, but they will not be any the less public servants. I mention this in reply to those who object to an army of public servants. There are many who object to the growth of the Public Service of the Commonwealth, but they forget that the functions of the Commonwealth Government are yearly increasing, and the number of public servants must be expected to increase proportionately. </para>

                <para>With regard to the suggested temporary character of this sub-Department, let me remind honorable senators that, when the applications from the first batch of applicants are dealt with, we shall be committed under this measure for a period of thirty-seven years, and there is nothing very temporary about that. Many of the returned soldiers will have to wait their opportunity to select sites, and, as time goes on, applications will continue to come in under this Bill, each probably committing us to a further period of thirty-seven years. That is too far ahead to anticipate the probability of a number of unemployed&#39; public servants. I hope that long before that time the growing needs of the&#34; country will have created a demand for many more civil workers than the number who will be employed under this Bill. The Minister, in giving the main reason for the original clause, said that if the principle adopted in connexion with the Repatriation Department were followed, it was possible that in the appointment of officers jealousies, cliques, and favoritism might creep in. I am sorry to have to admit that it is generally believed that in some centres of activity of the Repatriation Department those undesirable influences are already operating. There is a current belief in Brisbane that little cliques and coteries have been established in connexion with the branch of the Repatriation Department there, and no one outside the charmed circle is given even a look in. </para>

                        <para>- I asked a question of the Minister this morning, but he did not give a definite answer. He said that under the provisions of the Bill it would be possible for the Department to make some arrangement with the States. In States where no such machinery is likely to be availed of this would not apply, and the soldiers employed in this&#39; sub-Department would not be under the control of the Public Service Commissioner, but as this is a matter dealing essentially with the welfare of returned soldiers, it should not matter. Any obstacles in the &#39;way of employing returned soldiers should be removed. </para>

                Lt.-Colonel BOLTON  (Victoria)  &#91;5.8&#93;. -  This clause provides that the Commissioner may delegate to a State Savings Bank or other financial institutions, such as building societies, the special work of providing homes. When the repatriation scheme was initiated it was stated that the Lands Departments of the various States had all the necessary machinery to give effect to a policy of land settlement. I am not quite clear as to how this clause will operate, and I should like some assurance from the Minister that better results are likely to accrue than have been experienced in the land settlement schemes under the State machinery.

                    <para>. -  I do not think it is difficult to give that assurance, as the position with regard to this clause would be entirely different. Land settlement is dealt with by the Lands Departments of the various States, and under State laws; but under this clause, if an agreement is arrived at be tween the Commissioner and a State Savings Bank, it will be an agreement under which the Commonwealth Government will be finding the money and the State Savings Bank will be doing the work, exactly as the Commissioner himself would do if the machinery were at his disposal. In order to avoid creating his own staff, the Commissioner will be empowered to arrange with the State Savings Bank to do this particular work for him. It will make no difference to an applicant whether he deals with the Commissioner direct or if he approaches a State Savings Bank. The same principle will apply, and the same terms will be available. The object is to avoid the, creation of a special organization. </para>

                        <para>. -  I do not think it makes much difference which agency is employed, except that the State Savings Bank will probably be able to do the work much cheaper. It would not be advisable to have both Commonwealth and State Banks doing the same class of work in some places, because applicants would not know which institution to apply to. Then, again, we are confronted with this difficulty: The Commonwealth Bank has only a limited number of branches, though it has agencies at all places throughout the Commonwealth, and it has not available to it the machinery necessary for this class of work. The State Savings Banks on the other hand have their own valuers, architects, and men experienced in the working of the Credit Foncier system, and unless we utilize their services we shall have to create all this new machinery. That would take time, and I think it is advisable that we should avail ourselves of their services. I urge the Committee to adopt the clause as a much more economical method, and one which would remove the obligation which would otherwise rest upon us to create our own staffs throughout Australia. </para>

                    <para class="block">There is no policy involved in this measure. It is merely a legal and technical method of simplifying the procedure in dealing with the military estates of deceased soldiers. It does not touch the private estate of a soldier, which will still be dealt with by the ordinary State laws. There is what may be technically termed a military estate. A soldier on active service has a kit, in which he may carry from time to time articles of some intrinsic or sentimental value. When he goes to the Front his kit is stored in military custody. It is open to military inspection, and he carries these things only with the consent of the military authority. Certain payments are made to him direct; some may be made to his dependants, and others, such as the deferred pay, are kept in suspense. On the death of a soldier- on active service, it is the practice in the United Kingdom to deal with his military estate by a different law from that which deals with his civil or private estate. We have never had such a law in the Commonwealth. The civil or State  law3  are administered by the Curators of Estates. It can be easily seen that, in the circumstances in which our soldiers have gone away to the various theatres of war, considerable difficulty and irritation may be . caused by the operation of different sets of laws. For instance, a soldier&#39;s kit may be in Europe or England, and the personal effects that he has with him on active service are there also. He may have some portion of his money with him, whereas his deferred pay is here ; and it may happen, also, that he has allotted &#39;some other portion of his pay here. We have been carrying on under the law of the United Kingdom so far as effects outside Australia are concerned. That law is called the Imperial Regimental Debts Act, and deals solely with military estates. It provides that Curators of Intestate Estates may intervene as regards the property of a deceased soldier only when requested by the Committee of Adjustment, the Paymaster, or the Secretary of State, so to do, and must administer the property in accordance with the principles laid down in the Regimental Debts Act, and, subject thereto, according to the law regulating his office, independently of the Act. Any surplus in his hands must be remitted by him to the person carrying out the duties of Secretary of State, to be dealt with in accordance with the Act. There has been some doubt whether, legally, the Imperial Act applies to the Australian Forces, although, up to the present, it has been assumed that it does, and action has been taken under it accordingly. </para>

                            <para>- It has. It hinges partly on it. But there is a doubt, because we have legislated by means of our Defence Act under our defence powers in the Constitution. At the same time, we apply the Army Act to our Forces overseas, with certain exceptions, and therein lies the doubt. It is in order to remove those doubts, and simplify the procedure in the distribution of soldiers&#39; estates, and more adequately to protect the Commonwealth, that this Bill has been introduced. The Commonwealth might find itself landed in a very large responsibility if we were acting illegally, and if it were claimed that any of these moneys had been wrongfully distributed. The Bill, like the Regimental Debts Act, applies only to military estates, and does not concern itself with the civil estate of a soldier. It applies to all military estates of members of the Forces killed or dying while on war service, or within three months from the date of discharge, and irrespective of the place where the&#34; death occurs. Honorable senators can easily, see how necessary this is when it is remembered how widespread and various are the conditions under which our Forces have been operating. A &#34; military estate &#34; is defined as follows: - (1) Pay, allowances, or other money due to a member by the Commonwealth; and (2) Personal property or effects in the care, control, or custody of the military authorities at the time of the death of the member, or which come into such care, control or custody after the death of the- member. Thus, a member of the Forces may have certain valuables in his clothes at the time he is killed. These come into the control of the military authorities, and, therefore, constitute part of his military estate. </para>

                            <para>- No. That point is being considered at present, and I am sorry we were not able to come to a determination in time for this Bill. It is thought that possibly the same requirement is not present in the case of the Navy, because it is not quite on all fours with the Army. The Navy, it will be remembered, was placed absolutely under the British Admiralty, without any reservation whatever. In this Bill, provision is made for the disposal of the military estate of a deceased soldier in one of three ways. It may be disposed to his personal representative, of which there is a record which the soldier himself makes, or to any person beneficially entitled, or to such person or class of persons as are prescribed. This provision renders possible somewhat greater elasticity in the disposal of soldiers&#39; estates than obtains at present, and so permits of justice being done in cases where at present some difficulty is being experienced. Let me give an instance. It may be that the father of a soldier is dissolute and has done and is doing nothing for the care or sustenance of the family. The mother may have had the whole responsibility of the rearing and maintenance of the family on her hands; yet it may be that, under some law of one of the States, on the death of the soldier his estate would pass, not to the mother, but to the father. That is why we take power to prescribe in such cases to -whom the estate shall pass. </para>

                    <para>The Bill also provides that distribution in pursuance of the Act operates as a discharge of the Commonwealth from liability, and it exempts the Commonwealth from liability as regards the disposition of estates in pursuance of this Act, and also as regards past dispositions that have been made in accordance with the Imperial Regimental Debts Act. That provision validates what we have done. As this Act is for the protection of the beneficiaries of the soldier, and insures that they get their just due, it is necessary that in passing such an Act and taking a liability on ourselves we should protect the Commonwealth, where a mistake may have been made, or where even a wrong may have been done, against action for damages. Clause 7 exempts the Commonwealth Government from any liability as regards the disposal of money which is paid to the Curator of Intestate Estates For administration. Take the case of an intestate estate where we have not proved a will. We may pay that money to the Curator of Intestate Estates of  a  State, and he, acting in good faith, may make such distribution as the law of his State in his judgment requires him to make. He may, however, act wrongly or unwisely, although in good faith, and it- is necessary that, having discharged our liability under the State law by handing to him - where we have no other means of dealing with the estate - such amounts as this Bill authorizes us to pay, we should protect ourselves from liability for his action. </para>

                            <para>- No. It applies where they have made a will, but we must act in conformity with that will. This is the&#39; machinery by which we give effect to the will, but we have to contemplate at the same time cases where there is no will and where we cannot for some time locate the beneficiary. If there is a will we utilize the machinery of the State to give effect to it. If the machinery of the State requires that the money shall be paid to the Curator of Intestate Estates we may do it that way ; but this Bill will give us the power to pay direct. There is considerable advantage in that, because one case has- been brought under my notice where a small amount was left to be distributed amongst a family of brothers and sisters. They happened to be scattered over three States, and the  fee3  that would have had to be paid in order to enable that distribution to take place amounted to half the amount the beneficiaries were entitled to receive. It is obviously wise to avoid that sort of thing if we can, and under this Bill we shall be able to lay down such regulations as will entitle us to pay direct and avoid the payment oF these fees altogether. But there will probably be a class of case in which we shall have to pay this money to the Curator of Intestate Estates within a State, or the Public Trustee. It may happen that, after that has been done, the Curator of Intestate Estates, or the Public Trustee, as the case may be, may not be able to locate any beneficiaries. In that case we. take power under this Bill to call upon him to repay the amount to the Commonwealth Government. Under the ordinary State law it would find its way into the State revenue. Obviously, if the amount is not claimed by the beneficiaries, it should be returned to the Commonwealth. Where it is so returned we propose to pay the amount into the Repatriation Fund, so that it shall be used for the benefit of the fellow soldiers of the deceased. </para>

                    <para>Then we make provision for the disposal of the medals and decorations of a deceased soldier. That, I think, is necessary, because we wish to make sure that those  medals and decorations of honour - for that is what they are - shall not find their way into the pawnshops or the second-hand shops of this country, but into the hands of those who will value them for the sake of the men who have fallen. We have had before us many cases which may appear to some persons to be of small moment, but which, to the persons who are interested in the winding up of these estates, caused considerable irritation. We desire to simplify the procedure by which persons may get these estates wound up, wipe out the unnecessary payment of fees, and insure that the right people shall get the money. Tn order that we may do this, the Government must have a responsibility in the matter, and this Bill will give them that responsibility. As honorable senators will see, there is no important principle involved in the Bill. In it we are following closely on the lines of the Regimental Debts Act of the United Kingdom. I ask the Senate to proceed with the debate upon the second reading of the Bill, because the measure is an urgent one which must be passed before we rise, as there are a number of estates now awaiting adjustment. The Bill will, therefore, afford to a number of persons, to whom the few pounds which have been left to them are of importance, a considerable measure of relief. </para>

Instead, I am going to&#34; assist in putting the Bill through with all possible expedition, because I regard it as a very necessary measure. It is a validating Bill which is designed to deal with the estates of deceased soldiers. It does, however, contain some clauses in regard to which I shall in Committee require an explanation, which will, no doubt, be forthcoming. I am sorry that the measure does not extend to the Navy, because I think that our sailors should be afforded the same protection as it is proposed to accord to our soldiers. But I am satisfied that this defect will be remedied at a very early date. One of the clauses of the Bill which will vest extraordinary powers in the Minister is that which relates to the distribution of the medals and decorations of a deceased soldier. When we reach Committee I shall want to know how the Minister intends to dispose of these medals and decorations. I recollect that some time ago, although we had a week&#39;s discussion in this chamber upon the question of the disposal of soldiers&#39; medals, we could not arrive at any decision, the result being that the Bill relating to it was dropped. I am quite in favour of the taking of any steps which will have the effect of keeping these medals and decorations out of the pawnshop. In this connexion, I would suggest that they should be purchased and held by the Government. I should like to know what machinery is provided in the </para>

                        <para>. - I would remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDougall</inline> and the Committee that since the Military Decorations Bill was discussed here, we have amended the Defence Act in a direction which penalizes those who traffic in medals or military decorations. So that what we attempted to achieve in that Bill and failed to accomplish owing to the loquacity of certain opponents of it, has been achieved through the Defence Act. But this clause is intended to enable the Minister - where a medal has not been bequeathed by will - to direct its bestowal upon some person, or it may be, upon some public institution. For example, it may happen that a soldier who dies has not made a will, and that he possesses certain military decorations. There may be somebody who, in ordinary circumstances, would be entitled to receive his effects. In that event the Minister would approve of that person receiving his medal and decorations as well as his estate. Upon the other hand it may happen that the deceased soldier, having left no will, the person who would come into his estate may, for some reason or other, be totally unfit to receive his medal and military decorations. In such circumstances the Minister may direct that his medals and decorations shall be bestowed upon some museum, or art gallery, or public library. This power is to be given to the Minister in order to prevent such medals and decorations falling into the hands of persons who will not value them, and whose possession of them would be objectionable to the soldier himself if he were alive. The intention is that the clause shall be administered in that way. </para>

That is the portion to which I object. If it were provided that these decorations could be diverted to some institution I would not have so much objection. But under this clause power is given to the Minister to award the medal to some person who may be quite unrelated to the deceased soldier, and to whom that medal would not have been given had the dead man stated in his will where it should go. The principle in the clause is wrong. , </para>

But the Committee has not been informed whether such is the case. If a soldier has won a decoration and has subsequently died, it should be a principle that that reward should be retained in his family - all other things being equal.

But if no wills have been made out the medals will remain in the custody of the military; and we must give them to somebody. We will not keep them.

The provision is a good one. Instead of a number of medals lumbering the military stores, it is only right that they should be handed to whomsoever the Minister considers the best qualified to receive them.

                        <para>. - When the debate was adjourned last night I was dealing with a statement of the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> that counsel had been consulted in regard to the validity of this measure if it were extended so as to be operative in peace time. The Minister mentioned the names of several gentlemen whose legal skill and knowledge are matters of wide repute. I take it for granted that the opinions of those gentlemen were favorable to the project as embodied in this measure. The Minister referred to a tapering-off period. It may savour somewhat of the valour of ignorance in legal matters for me to say that I do not believe in the soundness of any legal opinion which considers that, under our Constitution, legislation which has been passed under the war power, in time of war, and which has for its object the practical supersession of all powers which under our Constitution must revert in their operative character to the States, retains its validity in time of peace. As to the Minister&#39;s reference to a tapering-off period, if the Commonwealth can make war legislation operative in peace time; if it can supersede the powers which the States have reserved to them under the Constitution; if it can make a tapering-off period of three months, where is there any inhibition in regard to the setting down of a tapering-off period ranging over six months, or twelve months, or two years, or three years, or four years, or for any greater period? If counsel&#39;s opinion in regard to the validity of war legislation in peace time is sound, I can discover no inhibition against the practical supersession for a long period of the self-governing powers of the States. It may be deemed presumptuous of me to advance such an opinion ; but many people who are now electors in the Commonwealth were only boys and girls ten and eleven years ago when certain legislation passed by this Parliament was declared by the High Court - the Judges of which are the interpreters of our Constitution - to he unconstitutional. That is to say, it was legislation which it was not within the constitutional and legislative competency of this Parliament to pass. I allude to what is known as the New Protection legislation. And upon several occasions the High Court has pronounced invalid legislation passed by this Parliament as a consequence of an ever-present desire to strain the provisions of the Constitution. </para>

                    <para>The most eminent members of the legal profession become quite different individuals when seated upon the Bench as Judges. Many Judges who would not entertain certain arguments put before them, would, as counsel, have no hesitation in advancing just such arguments. Many of the High Court Judges, I have no doubt, from time to time have as counsel pronounced opinions and advanced arguments which as Judges they would not for a moment hold to be valid. That being so, my temerity in challenging the supposed favorable opinion on the </para>
                    <para>Dart  of the eminent gentleman mentioned by the Minister may be more  apparent than real. I may be quite justified in asserting my doubt as to the constitutional character of legislation passed in war time during the war period, and which is designed to be operative after the Imperial Government proclaims or enacts peace, when, I take it, the sovereign powers of the States will be constitutionally and automatically resumed. </para>
                    <para>In another place the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> has stated that it is essential that the operation of the War Precautions Act be continued. I am not questioning the necessity for its continuance while we are actually in a state of war, but the honorable gentleman claims that its continuance is necessary in order to enable something to be done after peace has been proclaimed. I should like here to draw attention to the language of the original Act. It mentions that the Act is to be legislatively valid until peace is proclaimed &#34; and no longer.&#34; It is emphatic on that point. The expression &#34; and no longer &#34; is cumulative in its emphasis, so that there is no doubt at all that when this measure was submitted first as a Bill to the Legislature it was never contemplated that after peace was proclaimed it would be held to be operative and valid for another moment. </para>
                    <para>The Acting Prime Minister, in debating this matter, has said that it is particularly necessary that the period during which the War Precautions Act shall continue to be valid must be prolonged. Why <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> The honorable gentleman instances the metal contracts, and he says - </para>
                    <quote>

                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">Is it argued that because we have entered into metal- contracts which cover a period of ten years the War Precautions Act should be extended for a period of ten years ? That would be a most feeble argument. </para>
                    <para>While I challenge the validity of the operations of the War Precautions Act after peace is proclaimed, I do not question the validity of any contract covering a peace period which may have been entered into during the war period when the War Precautions Act, under which it was entered into, was unquestionably valid. In other words, during the war period, under the war power and under the Act, it has been constitutionally and legislatively competent for the Legislature to sanction many things, including such contracts as are mentioned by the Acting Prime Minister. If the war period ends to-morrow and the War Precautions Act becomes invalid, I do not think those contracts will be invalidated. Under .the ordinary principles of the construction of Acts of Parliament no Australian Court would hold that a contract entered into under a valid Act was not valid in itself. I think that is common sense. Although one of the masters of English literature has made the statement that &#34; the law is an ass,&#34; my experience is that the general principles of the law are the perfection of common&#39;sense. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that the Acting Prime Minister, in putting forward the fact that we had entered into metal contracts for a period of ten years as an argument for the continuation of the War Precautions Act, used a contention so feeble as scarcely to deserve to be called an argument. Any difficulty which might present itself in regard to these undoubtedly valid contracts could be met by the special legislation which the honorable gentleman somewhat vaguely indicates himself, or by operating the provisions of the Customs Act. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. I said last night that I do not for a moment  charge  the Minister with having operated his mighty powers in any objectionable way, but I&#39;do say that honorable senators, in voting for the projection of this measure into peace time, must take into consideration the position which would be set up during the tapering off period. Let the Imperial Government proclaim peace, or by an enactment declare a state of peace to have been entered into, I then wish to know whether any competent court of jurisdiction in Australasia would refuse a writ of <inline font-style="italic">habeas corpus</inline> if an application were made in respect of any person whom the Minister interned after peace had been proclaimed. I venture to say that <inline font-style="italic">habeas corpus</inline> would be operated by a Judge of any competent tribunal in those circumstances. That being so, it is an argument which I wish to adduce in support of my contention that the Act automatically becomes invalid as soon as peace time has been reached. </para>

                    <para>We have to remember that this Parliament legislates under a Constitution which is distinctly and designedly of a Federal character. The separate Australian States, in respect of the powers reserved to them in time of peace, are essentially sovereign States tinder the British Crown. Each Australian State, in regard to its sovereign power, is as independent of every other State in the Commonwealth and of this Legislature as it is of the Republic or the Legislature of France. I make that statement without fear of anything like logical contradiction. The States have reserved to themselves certain powers which can be operated, and which are their property in time of peace. How are we going to define the peace period. As we are an entity as a belligerent the peace period must be defined by Imperial enactment or proclamation. I see no other way of defining the termination of the war. I venture to say that it must eventually be so defined. If it is so defined, and it will be, does not that period at once indicate the complete revival of the powers which the States have retained for themselves? I advance the opinion that it does. That being so, honorable senators will forgive me if I use a few more arguments, which deal with matters that have been regulated under the provisions of the War Precautions Act during the present war, to illustrate the point 1 wish to make. </para>
                    <para>Under this Act and the regulations promulgated under it, what is known as a price-fixing policy has been entered upon by the Commonwealth administration. It is well known that the Commonwealth Parliament has no power to legislate in regard to price-fixing in time of peace. During the referendum campaign, which was carried out as a result of the desire of this Parliament to amend the Constitution, it was specifically asserted by important Ministers of the day that one of the principal objectives sought was the power to regulate and fix prices. The people refused that power. Consequently, it is not a valid exercise of administration on the part of the Commonwealth Government to fix prices other than in time of war. This Bill proposes the extension of the operation of the War Precautions Act for three months after the declaration of peace.  Does any one, lawyer or layman, assert that the Commonwealth can, during three months after the war has ended, interfere with the powers of the States to regulate  prices ? It is a point that might well be argued before a competent tribunal of interpretation, such as the High Court is. </para>
                    <para>In regard to companies, I advance my opinion more diffidently. I express my doubts with some hesitation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> in his address, very properly dwelt upon the inconvenience to the enterprising and energetic capitalists and adventurers of the Commonwealth that is caused by the regulations in regard to the flotation of companies. He dwelt upon the necessity of able and enterprising men having to interview Treasury officials and obtain a permission, which might be more or less reluctantly given, to float a company, to arrange a syndicate, and so on. </para>
                    <para class="block">The Commonwealth undoubtedly has the constitutional power to enact a companies law. </para>

Consequently, the State powers in regard to such a matter revive in complete force directly we reach a period of peace ; and the Commonwealth Parliament cannot, in such circumstances, continue its restrictions during the peace period. If, then, my argument has any point, this Act projected into the peace-time period, will be to that extent invalid. </para>

                    <para>In regard to the moratorium, I think the Minister has practically confessed that the power to proclaim a moratorium in regard to mortgages is, in peace times, vested in the individual States : that this is a power reserved to and exercised by them during peace. But the Minister has told us that there would be a certain difficulty if, at this juncture, we were thrown back upon the legislative resources of the States, in getting them to agree to an all-round moratorium proclamation. Again, I say, I do not believe there will be any difficulty. But the point I insist on. making is that if it is constitutionally incompetent for this Legislature to proclaim a moratorium in time of peace, it certainly cannot be invested with that power during three months after peacetime by the mere passing of this measure now. </para>
                    <para>There is another matter that came before the High Court, and which will sustain me in my seeming temerity in questioning the opinion of eminent legal authorities. I notice that one, at least, of the learned Judges of the High </para>
                    <para class="block">Court Bench did not give his adhesion to the decision that the Minister could intern anybody without assigning reasons and hold such person in durance indefinitely without bringing him to trial. I allude to that learned Judge <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Justice Powers).</inline> If I remember correctly, he did not concur in the decision of his learned brother Judges in regard to the validity of Ministerial action taken under the &#34;War Precautions Act, or those regulations in relation to this particular power. That is sufficient justification for me to maintain my attitude of query and doubt until the matter is decided by the High Court. I am emphasizing this point because there exists upon our statute-book the means of determining the doubts which have arisen in my mind from time to time in regard to the War Precautions Act, and its projected extension into the time of peace, which will come when an Imperial enactment is passed or proclamation is issued. </para>
                    <para>Undoubtedly, this question of the interpretation of our Constitution exercises the minds of the members of the Commonwealth Legislature from time to time, and it must necessarily exercise to a greater degree the minds of Commonwealth Ministers. And as evidence of that, in 1910 this Parliament, to my mind wisely and sensibly, passed an Act to amend the Judiciary Act of 1903-07. The purport of that Act is to determine points of doubt in regard to the constitutional competency of this Parliament to pass certain measures which might, to close observers, involve the straining of our powers under the Constitution. It isa short Act, and provides that cases may be stated for the information of their Honours the Judges of this important and high tribunal, the Supreme Court of the Commonwealth. It contains few clauses, and it is clearly, and I think wisely, designed for the purpose of securing from their Honours an interpretation of the Constitution when the competency of this Legislature is in doubt. I have been told - I do not know how correctly - that their Honours have refused to give judgment in regard to stated cases ; that they will not give judgment or decisions except in relation to <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> actions which come before the High Court for trial. </para>

It was a question as to whether or not the Parliament of Canada was right in providing for reference by the Supreme Court of Canada. The Privy Council held that the Parliament had power to do that. </para>

                    <para>Honorable senators will, I feel sure, as they have listened, to me, begin to understand the point I am taking in objecting to the passing of this measure. I say it is very unwise for the Senate, which is the custodian of the rights of the States, while our Constitution retains its Federal character, to sanction the supersession of the sovereign rights of the States under the guise of a war policy, and, to my&#39; mind, unconstitutionally projecting this power into the peace period. That is realty my argument.  Here is an Act passed by this Parliament, undoubtedly designed to meet such a contingency as I, at least, find facing me at the present moment. </para>
                    <para>I have spoken more deliberately than is my wont, and I desire to say that I hope to see this vast mass of legislation, in the guise of regulations, reduced at the earliest possible moment. I leave that entirely to the discretion of Ministers; but I invite them to curtail the exercise of their- undoubtedly wide powers. I believe that the War Precautions Act has validity during the war period, and I am inviting Ministers to provide for the transition period by relinquishing as much as possible the exercise of powers that have been conferred upon them by virtue of this Act. And I say that if they do this expeditiously, intelligently, and with proper spirit, the members of this chamber will do all they can to help them in the difficulties that remain after peace has been proclaimed. </para>
                    <para>I enjoyed the speech delivered by my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> last night; but while his technical interpretation of the proclamations in certain of our Acts may be correct, I do not see much that is practical in the argument, for I maintain that we shall reach a state of peace throughout  His  Britannic Imperial Majesty&#39;s Dominions directly the Imperial proclamation issues, or when an Imperial enactment dealing with the definition of the states of war and peace is placed upon the Imperial statute-book and becomes operative. </para>

The Commonwealth proclamation of peace must of necessity synchronize, ot be immediately subsequent to the Imperial proclamation of peace, for just as an Imperial proclamation involves the Commonwealth, which is an integral portion of the Empire, in a state of war, so will the Imperial proclamation terminate the state of war and declare the existence of a state of peace. I advance this opinion, and will hold it until the matter is determined by the competent interpreting authority. My opinion is that if the Commonwealth Administration did not immediately advise the Governor-General to proclaim peace on receipt of. the intelligence that peace had been proclaimed by the Imperial authorities, then any action taken under the war power during the intervening period would be invalid and unconstitutional. That i3 my contention, and it leads up to my major argument that the Commonwealth has not the constitutional competency to&#39; exercise war powers during the time of peace. </para>

The Commonwealth Administration cannot artificially prolong the state of war. They cannot project it into an Imperially proclaimed era of peace. That being so, this Legislature is also constitutionally incompetent to extend the War Precautions Act by three months, or one month, or one week after the Imperial Government has proclaimed a state of peace to be in existence. That is really the pivotal argument that I use in justifying my intention to vote or pair against the measure now before the Senate. </para>

                    <para>I hope the Administration will, at its earliest convenience, submit to the High Court a case stating the constitutional difficulties which, I think, I have discovered. If the Act which I quoted earlier is ever to be operated, surely it ought to be operated in connexion with the contingency that I see, and which honorable senators must individually and collectively distinguish. Near the end of the Minister&#39;s address introducing this measure, I invited him to get the Administration to consider the  advisableness  of submitting a case as to the validity of any legislation passed by this Parliament in pursuance of the war power and designed to be operated in time of peace, for the opinion of the High Court Judges. If the Ministry do not do this they fail in their duty, because they do not operate a measure placed on the statute-book for the express purpose of dealing with such a difficulty as we now find confronting us, or as I, at least, find confronting me. Honorable senators may think I am making a great deal of this matter. They may say, &#34; Nobody would challenge the constitutional competence of the Commonwealth in connexion with legislation like this.&#34; I venture to say it would be very, speedily challenged, and honorable senators have to remember that I am one of the representatives of the smallest State in the Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para>When war was declared I, in common with other honorable senators, cleared my decks,- so to speak, for action. I was prepared, under the war power, to vote for any measure deemed necessary by the Administration of the day, to which I was nominally in opposition, and would have been in peace times strenuously in opposition. Because I considered it my duty as a legislator to set aside all party feeling, I supported the then Administration in all legislation of the character of the War Precautions Act. In the many efforts made in this Chamber to secure the disallowance of regulations under this Act, I always voted with the Government. While a state of war is in exist&#39;ence, while&#39; Europe is in its present disturbed condition, while there are potentialities of conflict in the war areas or the areas close to them, I shall not vote for any repeal of the existing Act; but when I think that we are within measurable distance of peace, when I honestly and firmly believe that all the sovereign powers of the .State in which I live, and which I help to represent, as also of the other States, will be immediately resuscitated, I would deem it a failure of duty on my part if I voted for legislation which would be a straining of the terms of the Constitution, and which, in my humble opinion, would be declared invalid if a case based upon it was stated to their Honours of the Sigh Court Bench. If, in the event of the Administration stating a case to clear up the difficulties I have mentioned, their Honours refuse to function, I shall have to use my almost unaided judgment in determining the position that will then have been created; but my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> has been able to assure me that legislation of this kind passed by the Canadian Legislature has been reviewed, and held to be good by the Privy Council, and I learn that the Privy Council has held that it was right and competent for a case to be stated in order that the terms of the Constitution might be interpreted for the benefit of legislators by the Supreme Court of Canada. Our High Court Bench is in some measure constituted of men who cradled this infant nation in the early days, when the various Colonies came together to form the Commonwealth, who exercised their undoubtedly great abilities in helping to draft the Constitution, and made names for themselves that will float gracefully down the tide of Australian history. These men are not likely to .refuse to assist thf&#62; Administration of the day, nay more, the Commonwealth Parliament of the day, in a difficulty which confronts it in regard to its constitutional powers. I shall be very much disappointed . in their Honours of that high tribunal if they refuse to assist us in this difficulty. I hope, if my remarks ever reach their ears, that they will not think them in the least degree savouring of disrespect. I yield to nobody in paying respect to the great abilities and marked integrity of the occupants of seats on the High Court Bench of Australia. At the same time, just as I would criticise, and have criticised, sins of omission or commission, even on the part of British Prime Ministers, I do not hesitate to say that I should be disappointed in the High Court Bench if it refused to hand out a decision pursuant to a case being stated by the authorities of the Commonwealth as to the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of legislation, such as is projected in the terms of this measure. </para>
                    <para>In no spirit of captious criticism I wish to make some remarks about the mass of regulations alluded to in very significant terms by my legal colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating.</inline> A few weeks ago, in Launceston, I received a telephone message from a municipal authority, asking me if I knew anything of a regulation preventing municipalities from constructing new sections of tram lines, or disbursing municipal funds for that purpose, without the authority of the Commonwealth Treasury. I had to confess that I was in much the same position as that South Australian magistrate who said it was beyond the ability of mankind to keep track of the numerous regulations promulgated &#39; under the War Precautions Act. I advised my questioner to write to the Treasury for information. I am not ashamed to confess that, at the moment, I was unable to state whether such a regulation was in existence or not. I now believe, from remarks made last night by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> that it does exist. Two or three days afterwards I was entering the office of a solicitor in Launceston - a man who stands high in his profession in that city. I met coming out a gentleman connected with the Launceston Fruit Board. He had a whole armful of regulations that had been given to him by the solicitor. He had gone in to make inquiry of the professional adviser of the Board as to whether a regulation existed fixing the price of fruit cases, and the lawyer told him he had better take all the regulations that he could find and go through them at his leisure. The lawyer said he did not think it advisable to go through the mass himself, and for the Board to have to pay him for doing so. When I voted for the War Precautions Bill, which subsequently became an Act, I did not dream it was going to be applied in some directions in which it has been applied. The Minister very wisely and honestly confessed that some mistakes had been made. I shall not be very critical of the mistakes that undoubtedly have been made in consequence of the exercise of the supposed powers that were conferred upon the Administration by the Legislature when it passed that measure. But some very strange things were done by virtue of the regulations promulgated under the Act. </para>
                    <para>A good deal has been said about the Tin Producers Association, about tin scrap, &#38;c. , and I am very pleased to have heard the speeches which have been made from time to time dealing with this measure - a measure that is very pertinent to the welfare of the State which I represent. Some time ago it appears that some authority, vested with power by the Administration, projected the formation of a Tin Producers Association. I used to hear statements made by bankers in which queries were daily put to me bv responsible men as to what was the nature of the action which was contemplated by the Administration in connexion with the tin industry. They had heard that the price of tin was to be fixed, and that a Tin Producers Association was to be formed, and they  naturally  appealed to me as one of their representatives, and as one who had owned some small tin mines for years, for information. I had to confess that I, one of the representatives of the most important tin-producing State in the Commonwealth, was not in possession of anything like accurate information on the subject. i I sat down, deeming; it very derogatory to myself to  occupy  such a position, and  telegraphed  at the cost of some 7s. or 8s., to the Act- ing Prime Minister asking for information on the matter, and requesting that any Executive steps should be stayed until all the various interests connected with the tin-mining industry had been consulted. I can assure this Chamber that I was unable, until within the last week or two, to secure anything like definite information relating to this matter. And I find that in connexion with such a purely commercial measure as a project to form a Tin Producers Association the War Precautions Act has been used. A very important company in Tasmania engaged in the production of tin - I will not say any more about it for fear that it may be identified, itself being on the best of relations with other tin producers - was invited to send a representative to a conference in Melbourne - a conference which was ostensibly called for the purpose of launching this Tin Producers Association </para>

                            <para>- The company happened to have in Melbourne at the time a representative to whom it hurriedly cabled instructing him to attend the conference. The proceedings of that body were private, and no information as to what was done there has been vouchsafed either to this Parliament or to the people of Tasmania, who are particularly interested in one of the most important industries of the Commonwealth. That was an exercise of power under the War Precautions Act which I never  contemplated when I voted for that measure. Action of that kind was not justified in the circumstances, and was a misuse of the powers conferred upon the Administration by the War Precautions Act. </para>

                    <para>I am not criticising this measure caustically, because the Minister, as I have previously said,  has  wisely conceded the .point that mistakes have been&#34; made, and that in some instances there has been possibly a misuse of the powers granted under the Statute. I will admit that the major powers which were exercised by the Administration under the Act have, to my mind, not been misused. They have been used with discretion. But we aTe a democratic, people, and many things that we will cheerfully endure in time of war we will not tolerate for a moment in time of peace. I believe it to be a cardinal mistake on the part of the Administration to introduce this measure, intending,- if they can, to project its operation into that period of peace which will ensue after the Imperial proclamation has issued. I shall not quote further instances of the misuse of powers under the War Precautions Act. I am sure that honorable senators will agree with&#39; me that there has been a misuse of those powers, and I hope that, in that tapering period to which the Minister has alluded, the closest and most energetic effort will be made to thin out from the vast sheaf of regulations all those which are admittedly or  colorably  superfluous. </para>

The difficulty which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> foresees and the difficulties which I am discussing with such logic as I can command, will be obviated if the Government at the earliest possible moment submits a case to the High Court with a view to securing a decision as to the validity or otherwise of this legislation after the Imperial peace proclamation has been issued. I have not the slightest intention of over-labouring my arguments. I have occupied with one or two breaks the attention of honorable senators for a good hour or more. I have made my points, and whether they have force or not, the event, I suppose, will prove their character. </para>

                    <para>I wish merely to sum up my arguments, and to say that they justify me in the action which I intend to take, namely, that of either voting or pairing against this measure. If the Minister for Defence, is apprehensive of sedition, of dangerous utterances, or dangerous actions after the war has technically ended, all I can say is that I think it is constitutionally competent for this Legislature to pass a Sedition Act. I will help him to secure for his Administration all the powers which may be necessary to put down sedition, to prevent internal disturbances, to check disloyal utterances, and to do anything else that may be required. But I think that all the powers which we need can be secured by legislation which we are competent to pass in time of peace. I do not wish to see action of that kind taken under that War Precautions Act after peace has arrived. Because I believe that this Parliament has not the power to pass a Bill extending that Act into the peace period, because I believe that such action would be vexatious to a degree, because I believe it would be an infringement of the principles of Democracy, and because I believe it is unnecessary, I am going to vote against this Bill. Honorable senators will recollect that in my case there is an additional reason for my opposition to legislation of this kind in time of peace. Ours is a Federal Constitution. From the stand-point of population and territory the State which I help to represent is &#39;the smallest in the Commonwealth. The powers which have been retained by that State are very dear to it. It is geographically, separated from the other five States of the Commonwealth, and I would be doing my duty in very ill-fashion if I permitted any whittling away, obviously or unconsciously, of the powers which I believe are retained in their full sovereign strength by Tasmania and the other States, directly the Imperial Government announces by proclamation that a condition of peace has been arrived at. Of course, if I cannot induce the Administration to obtain from the interpreting authority a decision which will clear up this matter, I must use my own discretion. The submission of this measure to the Legislature is entirely premature ; and because I hold that conviction it is my deliberate intention to vote or pair against the Bill. </para>

                        <para>.- This Bill is of such importance that it has well merited the full and excellent discussion which has been aroused. I have listened with careful attention and interest to the speeches upon the subject, and I desire to briefly state my position. I well remember, when the original Bill was before the Senate, that it created no antagonism. It was passed after a few hours&#39; debate. There was very little opposition in the other Chamber, either. If Parliament had realized, however, the manner in which these powers were to be used, there would have been no hope of passing the original measure. We were told that these extraordinary powers would be exercised discreetly, and that they would not be employed for political purposes. We were assured that they would be used in a way which would do injury to no one. Members of Parliament at that time considered it wise to give to the Government the powers they sought, seeing that it was a time of war. I have  endeavoured to make it a rule not to blame -myself if I should be taken in once. But if I am taken in a second time by the same party, then I deserve what I get. The promises made in 1914 were of such a character that members were justified in granting to the Government of the day the powers asked for; but the manner in which those powers have been used upon hundreds of occasions has set the ears of the people tingling. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I do not wish to recapitulate the various experiences of the people under this measure. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> enumerated many of the regulations issued under the Act.  .His  references demonstrated the ridiculousness of their administration. The people throughout the Commonwealth are anxious for the repeal of the War Precautions Act; not only that section of the people which I represent, but opponents of our political party also. It is not desired that these restrictive measures should be retained for a day longer than can be possibly avoided. In 1914, when the original Bill was before Parliament, there were some critics who pointed out the dangers of trusting these enormous powers to any one. The predictions then uttered have proved, to Some extent, at least, correct. The Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> when introducing the amending Bill in another place, went so far as to say, in effect, that mistakes had been made in the heat of passion. <inline font-style="italic">No</inline> one will deny that the powers under this enactment have been abused. We were told that the Act would not be employed for political ends. If I were to begin to discuss the things which have been done under the powers granted, I might occupy many hours. I draw attention, merely as an example, to the voting of the soldiers abroad. Hor.orable senators know full  Well  what happened. Manifestoes were issued by Labour leaders in the Commonwealth, but the powers of the censor , were such that not a word reached the troops at the Front. At the same time, a paper was in circulation at the Front which Was edited by a paid officer of the Government; and that paper was almost wholly devoted to the Government&#39;s political purposes. </para>
                    <para>Any individual who took part as a Labour supporter, either in the election or the referenda campaigns, ran the risk of arrest and of being brought before a magistrate for some &#39;breach of the Act or its regulations. There was not one df us who was not liable to arrest without warning, and without opportunity of redress. Such a situation should never have existed in a free country. For some time after the law was&#39; brought into operation there was little complaint about the manner in which it was being exercised. Matters proceeded smoothly enough until a certain event occurred, when there was  a  dispute and a division in the Labour &#39;party. Then the trouble began. The powers exercisable under the Act were employed for political purposes, although there had been very definite promises that no such powers would be employed. At present we have Board&#39;s in control of almost every conceivable activity in Australia. I have not much fault to find with that, but the commercial and producing interests are anxious that those Boards shall be done away with. My complaint&#39; -is more against the power employed in respect of life and liberty. To me the dearest thing on earth &#39;is liberty. Material matters do- not count for so much. Life and liberty come first. But even with regard to such material matters as the welfare of the producing and commercial interests, the powers employed under the Act should not remain an hour longer than necessary. Every section of the community is up in arms against this legislation. It should be withdrawn. </para>
                    <para>The Government would be well advised to take the advice of either of my honorable friends and colleagues on the opposite side; Senators Keating and - Bakhap. The former advises that the Government should  leave  matters  as they  stand. It will be a considerable time before peace is proclaimed, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has pointed out that during that period Ministers  coUld  avail themselves of the opportunity to go through the regulations, ascertain what powers they must continue to possess, and then ask the Legislature to grant them such powers by ordinary legislative methods. This Parliament may be called together again, within a  month., or within two months, or even later, before the declaration of peace. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> has asked the Government to state a case to the High Court of Australia. That appeals to me as a sensible suggestion. We should take steps to ascertain whether Parliament really has the power which it has taken to itself. It would be unwise and dangerous to place laws upon our statute-books concerning which there is any constitutional doubt. The Government should have stated the precise nature of the powers which they required. There would not then have been any extraordinary high feeling, such as exists throughout the community to-day. </para>
                    <para>As to the many Boards which have been created, the fact cannot be denied that the members of them are men interested in the particular calling upon which they are ordinarily engaged. I do not make any accusation, but human nature is such that a man will do things which tend to his own personal interests, by reason of an entirely unconscious bias. These things have aroused feeling throughout the community. Honorable senators almost every day receive circulars strongly objecting to the work of one or other of these Boards. The people are suspicious of their administration of the various activities committed to their care. </para>

I believe that I am expressing the feelings of the vast majority of the people of the Commonwealth, not alone those who would vote for me at an election, but those also who would vote against me. I am asked whether I do not favour the control of certain industries; but even if I did, this is not the way to control them. When the people of Australia are determined that we shall have the power to control certain industries, they will give us that power.This is not the way in which to control even the profiteers. </para>

Hundreds of publications that are in circulation in Great Britain and the Allied countries are censored in Australia. Let me repeat again the silly action of the censor which I mentioned the other night. I drafted a little circular for a public meeting, and put on it the words &#34; Come and hear the truth,&#34; and the censor put his blue pencil through that. I do not think that honorable senators opposite would justify silly actions of that kind. But that sort of thing has been done under the War Precautions Act throughout Australia, and many vindictive things have also been done under it. Letters have been held up, and even a private telegram from a man to his wife has been held up. </para>

                    <para>We have been told that the extension of the operation of the Act is required, amongst other things, in connexion with the moratorium and with the control of financial institutions. We have been warned as to what will happen in financial circles if the powers conferred by the Act are not retained. We have been told that if we do not chain them down the money-lenders will crush the mortgagors, the shipping people will immediately increase their freights, and those concerned in the Wheat Pool and other organizations of the kind will at once exploit the people. This is a very poor commentary on the spirit and feeling of the men who occupy important positions in Australia. The Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.- Watt),</inline> in his speech in introducing this Bill in another place, said that the measure was necessary to prevent the ship-owners, the money-lenders, and similar people from exploiting other sections of the community. What sort of loyalty and patriotism can there be amongst these people if it is necessary to chain them them down lest they do evil to the community ? </para>

                            <para>- I have no very great animosity against the man who lends money at a decent rate of interest. I know that men of wealth in Australia have done very well during the war. I am satisfied that, the trading people have also done very well. It might easily be proved that they are at least &#163;200,000.000 better off than they were before the war started. If they have not been satisfied with the conditions which have prevailed during the last four years, and as soon as they are let off the chain will double their charges upon the people, who will not be in a position to protect themselves, that is but a poor recommendation for the persons who, in this Chamber and in another place, support the party opposite. I felt that it was extraordinary that the Government should express their opinion of the people whom they represent in the way they have done. </para>

                    <para>I dare say that some of the activities controlled by Boards might very properly be continued. I believe that the control of sugar has been a good thing for Australia. Whilst the people of this country have been receiving sugar at a reasonable rate, the company dealing in the commodity have not done too badly. I understand that their profits are practically the same as they were before the war. The powers contained within the four corners of the Bill under consideration are greater than, I think, should be vested in any Government after peace has been declared. The people of Australia have had to submit to galling conditions during the last four years. I think they deserve commendation for the manner in which they have submitted to these &#34;restrictions, but now that the war is practically over, I see no reason why these should be continued. If the Government are well advised, they will allow the Act to terminate in the ordinary course. One reason advanced for the continuation of these powers is the need for the Government to be able to deal with people who  are accounted disloyal. I have no love for disloyalists, but I think that reason is more or less a gag. There are very few disloyalists in the country, and I am quite satisfied that the good sense of the community could be depended upon to deal with them. Disloyalists would soon find themselves ostracized from society, for Australians are as loyal and as peace-loving a people as are to be found in any part of the world. It is not wise, therefore, to brand the people of Australia as disloyalists. There are so few of that class in Australia that it is not worth while keeping a measure like this on the statute-book in order to deal with a few cranks. It simply acts like a safety valve to let them say what they want to say. It hurts nobody, and no one at the other end of the world will take any notice of what some crank or other says in Australia. We shall only make ourselves a laughing-stock in the eyes of sensible people if we continue this power for the sake of dealing with one or two persons who may bc called disloyalists. I shall vote against the measure, and sincerely hope it will not be carried. </para>

                        <para>.- Judging by the expression on their faces, my honorable friends opposite would like to get a disagreeable duty over as soon as possible. I refer to the duty of voting for this measure, as they are going to do, when only a small proportion of them really believe that these powers ought to be continued. I think I am justified in believing that with some of my honorable friends party allegiance and the cracking of the party whip are stronger than their own inclinations. We are all in the grip of party politics, and I honestly believe that a number of them are just as anxious to see the War Precautions Act swept out of existence as is any one on this side, but the cracking of the party whip compels them to vote for the Bill. </para>

                            <para>- I voted for it then for the same reason as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie did, because we  were  foolish enough to believe the assurances of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce, Mr. Hughes,</inline> and others that it would be used only for the purposes of emergency for which it was passed.  It  was a war-time measure, and it was a well-known historical fact that the Government of every country when at war found it necessary to pass a measure of this sort, giving them power to act in case of emergency. A number of us who supported that Bill had serious misgivings, because we knew the powers in it were much wider than Parliament ought to give to any Ministry, or than Parliament would give to any Ministry in normal times, but we were solemnly promised, and were fools enough to believe, that the measure would be used only for the purposes for which it was framed, presented to Parliament, and passed, and for which it was supported by those supporting the Government. The sequel has shown that, during the past few years there have been done under these regulations, which have been turned out in hundreds, like sausages from a machine, things that would have almost disgraced the secret police system of Russia. </para>

For all practical purposes it has been proclaimed, and no member of Parliament believes that there is a million to one chance of this terrible war breaking out again. The real reason why the Government have brought down the Bill is that the heads of the various Controls, and the members of the parliamentary, or non-parliamentary, Boards, have asked the Government to let them have these powers a little while longer. If the millionth chance turned up, and the war broke out again, there would be nothing to prevent the Government from calling Parliament together in a few days. Then within twenty-four hours a War Powers Act could be put through both Houses to meet national emergencies. That would be an Act framed in a proper way, and not giving such wide and drastic powers as the War Precautions Act gave to a Government which no one expected to use them in the way they have been used. It is as well to remind the people in these times, when the economy cry is so often heard, of some of the things done , under that </para>
                    <para class="block">Act. In about September of last year <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor</inline> asked the Prime Minister in the House of Representatives when Parliament&#39; would be called together again. Parliament was just about to go into recess, as was supposed, only for a few weeks, because there was a great deal of really important work to be done. Now the word and pledge of a Prime Minister ought to be worth taking by the people of Australia, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> solemnly gave his word  that it was the intention that Parliament should meet again soon. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudor</inline> said he was afraid something might be done under the War Precautions Act when the doors of Parliament were closed, and the people&#39;s representatives were powerless. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> solemnly pledged his word that nothing would be done that Parliament would not condone if it were sitting. Within a very few weeks after <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hughes</inline> made that statement, members were called from all parts of Australia by a notice that Parliament would assemble on a. certain day, and when some of them had reached Melbourne, they were suddenly told that they were not wanted, and that the Government, by virtue of their powers under this remarkable piece of legislation, had decided to take the second conscription referendum. The Government determined on this course without consulting their own supporters. Never before was such a flagrant breach of a man&#39;s word committed by the Leader of any Parliament within the British Dominions. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator does not like to have these dead dogs resurrected. I know they smell, but these are the sort of things that it is necessary to resurrect, because the Government which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Plain</inline> supports are asking the Senate to grant them an extension of the very powers under which these things were done. From &#163;80,000 to &#163;100,000 was thrown away, and bitterness between the people of Australia was intensified. Soreness caused between lifelong friends by the first referendum was intensified, just when the wounds were beginning to heal, and the Government were defeated by a far larger majority Ulan on the first occasion. The second referendum could not have been taken if the country had been governed in the constitutional way, and if the representatives sent by the Democracy from the four corners of Australia to- Melbourne had been allowed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> to &#39;do those things that the people sent them here to do. But <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes, Senator Pearce,</inline> and the Ministry closed the doors of Parliament. They said to the representatives of the people: &#34; Out on you; you have nothing to do with us.&#34; In saying that to the people&#39;s representatives, they flouted the people,  and, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> suggests, they got it where they did not seem to expect it, but where, apparently, most of their supporters thought they would get it. Heaven knows what spirit of madness came over the Cabinet when they decided to take the second referendum. </para>

                    <para>Look at some of the things that happened during that campaign. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> went to Queensland, and because an egg hit him, he spent a great deal of the taxpayers&#39; money, under the war powers conferred by the Act, in establishing a special Queensland police force to protect him. That force is still in existence, although I do not know if the Queensland hens are still laying strong eggs. It might have been a very strong egg, but I guarantee that we have hens in Tasmania which lay eggs quite as strong. The one that spoilt my new hat on the night before the referendum, when I was speaking in opposition to conscription, was laid, I will guarantee, by a stronger hen than the one that laid the egg that hit <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes.</inline> I did not ask for a single special policeman to be appointed in Tasmania to protect me, and if the campaign had lasted for another three or four weeks I would still have revelled in it, because I believed I was doing my duty, as I suppose <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> believed he was doing his. These things were made possible only because Australia was being governed,, not by Parliament, but by the Ministry under the War Precautions Act and the regulations pertaining to it. </para>
                    <para>Let me cite a few more absurd instances. Probably <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> does not know that these things were happening, because he was not personally responsible for all the stupidities by the censors.  Let me direct attention to the position that existed in Tasmania. At Launceston, prior to the departure of each vessel, nobody was allowed to approach within a certain distance of a ship&#39;s sides, a space was roped off, and all the passengers&#39; luggage was searched, for fear, no doubt, that some crank in the community might take on board an infernal machine for the destruction of the boat. At the same time, at Burnie, a port equally important, only 100 miles further along the coast, vessels were leaving twice a week without any such restrictions being imposed. It was possible at any time for an enemy to take passage on the <inline font-style="italic">Oonah,</inline> and by means of bombs sink the vessel on her passage between Burnie and Melbourne. If these precautions were necessary at one port in Tasmania, surely they were just as necessary at another; but, apparently, there is no official information about this absurd position, and certainly I was not going to say anything. </para>

                    <para>Many&#39; absurd things were also done under the regulations for the control of racing. In Tasmania the Military Commandant is an estimable gentleman in every sense of the word, but he knew absolutely nothing about racing, and yet the sole control of all the little picnic race meetings was placed in his hands, because, so the Government believed, it was necessary to curtail racing. <inline font-style="italic">It</inline> would have been far better if the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> had placed this matter in the hands of a man who knew something about racing, or if this could not have been done, he had instructed somebody to advise the Commandant as to the best method for the control of sport in that State. But now that regulation has been withdrawn, and there is no longer any control of sport in the Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para>Let me also give another illustration of the absurdity of censorship administration in Tasmania. I know that no less than seven prosecutions were ordered against the editor of one paper. Seven times the editor was called upon to attend the Court, only to find on every occasion that he was not wanted, as the case had been withdrawn. I desire to be just to the man who has had charge of this matter in Tasmania. He has complained on several occasions that he had to obey instructions from head-quarters, and I know that sometimes he said he was sorry for the action he had to take. </para>
                    <para>A good deal has been said about the necessity for continuing the power with regard to moratorium regulations. That matter has been fully dealt with, so I have no intention of taking up further time of the Senate in its discussion, except to say that a member of a legal firm in Hobart told me the other day that the Act is largely a dead letter, because, whenever people approach a financier for assistance they contract themselves out of the regulations. This substantiates the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> last night. </para>
                    <para>In regard to the appointment of a secret service police by the Minister for Defence, and, I presume, the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> - I do not like to mention names, because the individuals concerned are not here to protect themselves - I have absolute proof that this system was responsible for more secret meanness than one would have thought possible in a country like </para>
                    <para class="block">Australia. The third degree has been put upon witnesses in order to extract from them information to build up cases. We have been accustomed to pity the Russian people for the iniquities they endured under the secret service police system of that country, but during the past four years things have been done in this country that would almost lead one to assume he was in Russia. </para>
                    <para>The prohibition of any statements regarding soldiers&#39; grievances at a time when the Government were asking for a large number of additional recruits hindered recruiting considerably. Unfortunately, at that time newspaper editors and proprietors were prevented from giving publicity to soldiers&#39; legitimate grievances. The powers of the censorship were exercised rigorously. I am speaking about things I know of. One paper in Hobart, the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Post,</inline> now known as the <inline font-style="italic">World,</inline> perhaps because it was a Labour paper, was treated with great severity. It will be well remembered that, in 1917, the Government declared that the press was to be free in regard to censorship, excepting in regard to statements connected with the naval or military defence of the Commonwealth. But, in spite of that, explicit orders were sent to the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Post</inline> that they had to submit everything to the. censor, although the Government had made the definite declaration to which I have referred. But the editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Post</inline> was not so foolish as to comply absolutely with the order, and frequently published articles which had no connexion whatever with naval or military defence, and it was in connexion with these transgressions that he was brought before the Court on the occasion I have mentioned, though in each case the prosecution was withdrawn. </para>
                    <para>There are one or two other matters to which I may refer. It is just about time, I think, that some information was published as to the position of the metal trade in Australia under the Government control by virtue of regulations promulgated under the War Precautions Act. A number of people interested in the metal industry are not satisfied, because there has been too much secrecy about the control. It is also suggested that the people would like to have some statement about the ships purchased by the Commonwealth. This transaction involved an expenditure of about &#163;2,000,000, and I think the people are entitled to see half-yearly or yearly balance-sheets. There ought to be some explicit information given. &#62; </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. Again, three gentlemen have been appointed to exercise absolute control over the formation of companies. It seems to me that that is rather a dangerous procedure. These men are only human, and it may be that some of their personal friends would have more consideration given to their applications to form companies than would others with whom they were not so well acquainted. Of course, it is possible that these gentlemen may have been influenced only by unconscious bias. Whether that is so, I cannot say. But I know that quite a number of persons who made applications to be allowed to form companies, with apparently very promising prospects, had their applications refused. As a result, they were very sore about it. I know, too, that other applications which did not seem to be any better propositions, were granted, and that for a long time there was a good deal of dissatisfaction experienced amongst persons who engage in this class of business. </para>

                    <para>I have been informed that all references made to the Commission which has been inquiring into certain matters connected with our Naval and Military administration were censored, and that their publication was prohibited until after the Acting Prime Minister had spoken. Only to-day I received a wire from a Tasmanian editor to that effect. Of course, we have been promised that the censorship regulations, if they are not actually lifted, will be very much relaxed in the future. The&#39; sooner that position is brought about the better it will be for the Ministry and for the welfare of the people of Australia. </para>
                    <para>I complained just now of our cursed secret police system - a system for which there was absolutely no necessity, seeing that ordinary detectives, by pursuing ordinary methods, would have been able to  secure just as good  Results  as have been achieved. But&#39; under the system which has grown up  in  Australia quite as bad things have been done here as were done1  in  Russia years ago. Fbr example, I have on several occasions&#39; referred to the case  of  a man named Kiely. I now propose to give a peculiar instance of the lack of promptitude that has been exhibited by certain officials who are responsible  to  the Minister for Defence. According to a telegram which&#39; <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> received from&#39; the honorable gentleman, this man was arrested  in  June last &#34; as&#39; a precautionary measure &#34; under our War Precautions&#39; Act. <inline font-style="italic">Since</inline> then he&#39; has been confined  im  a detention) camp1 until a few days ago.. According  to  his own statement, he had&#39; never been afforded an opportunity of confronting his accusers, and did not even know the charge upon which he had been arrested. After&#39; I had moved the adjournment of the&#39; Senate to call attention to his case,* and after I had  read  a letter from Kiely,. whom&#39; I have never seen and do not know, the Minister stated that some five or  six  weeks previously he; had ordered that a public investigation should be held into this man&#39;s case. Thereupon I pointed out that it was indeed remarkable - if that order had been given- - that&#39; this: sick man. was still being allowed to rot in gaol. </para>

                            <para>- Then the Minister has misled me, because he assured&#39; me that this man had been arrested under that Act &#34;  as  a precautionary measure.&#34; Under  no  other Act could his liberty be taken  from  him, and  could,  he be kept in  gaol for  months- without  a  trial. I do not know  of  any Statute which would permit S&#39;en&#39;ator Pearce, under his signature,  to have a  man arrested Yesterday I asked the Minister when the- promised investigation into Kiely&#39;s  case Would  be held, and. whether the accused would be allowed legal&#39; assistance. The honorable gentleman asked for notice of my question. I gave notice&#39; of it, and to-day the Minister replied&#39;  that he&#34;  had not yet received the desired information, but would probably be&#39; able to supply it later in the day. This m&#39;orning I happened to pick up a newspaper from Launceston, from which I learned that- the&#34; investigation into this man&#39;s case began in that city .  On  Friday last. Yet the Minister&#39;s officials did&#39; not know&#39; anything about it. </para>

                            <para>- I do not blame the Minister. Although I do not agree with him upon many matters, I sympathize with him because of the enormous responsibility which he fs carrying today. But he has officers, who ought to know what is transpiring.- According to the&#34; newspaper report, Kiely was brought up in chambers before a police magistrate,  in  the person of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HalL</inline> He asked that has case might be remanded, to give him  an  opportunity of obtaining legal assistance. Accordingly, he was remanded until the next day, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. M.</inline> J. Clarke, a solicitor, appeared for hint. At the same1 time <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Archie*;</inline> a member of a firm of solicitor&#39;s  in  Launceslio&#39;n, appeared for the Defence Department. A file was presented1, which contained several charges against this&#39; man, I understand, charges of disloyalty and disaffection. Thereupon <inline font-weight="bold">Ms solicitor</inline> . stated! that that was the- first time his client had  been  informed of the nature of the charge which,  was  to he preferred against him, and, consequently, he asked for a further remand, so that he might have an opportunity of CEOss-examining Kiely&#39;s accusers. Surely that was a reasonable request! Surely we ought not to assume- that every man is- guilty of the offence with which he is-, charged until he has- proved his innocence ! This <inline font-style="italic">ismm</inline> had had <inline font-style="italic">no</inline> chance of proving- his iipK&#62;Genee. The legal representative &#39; of the Defence Department also desired- a reimiamfy because: he&#39; had not received the file- of papers until that day. He stated,however; that he had received inst&#39;rtictioms&#39; from the Department to afford every facility for this investigation : to- take place. The case was, therefore1, remanded until this evening. Apparently, Kiely&#39;s liberty is not deemed to be of sufficient importance for. the Court to sit during  the ordinary hours of the day, inasmuch as his case is to be heard in chambers at 7 o&#39;clock this evening. I am not sufficiently familiar with legal procedure to know whether the fact of a case being heard in chambers implies that it is to be heard in private or in public. </para>

                            <para>- It may be so, but I doubt it. Had it not been for my repeated efforts in this chamber to secure a public investigation into this man&#39;s case, he would still have been languishing in the Darlinghurst internment camp. If a man can be arrested on the mere statement of another that he has given utterance to certain sentiments, and if he can be kept in an internment camp for six months without a trial, under the War Precautions Act - the operation of which we are now invited to extend - our vaunted freedom in Australia has disappeared. Kiely, I may add, was born in Australia, and comes of a very reputable family, who live in Warrnambool. Obviously the career of such a man was open to the police. I maintain that he should have been proceeded against under the ordinary laws of the country, and not under the War Precautions Act. If he had been brought before the Courts under the ordinary laws of the country he would have been given the same privileges as are granted to the greatest criminal. He would have been brought face to face with his accusers. A man charged with the vilest crime, so long as it is not under the War Precautions Act, is conceded the opportunity to face his accusers, and is given a chance to bring evidence in rebuttal of the accusation. This man, however, had to remain in gaol from early in June last until a few days ago. I would not vote for the continuance of this measure for one moment after the declaration of peace. I would give a hundred votes, if I had them, to wipe it out of existence immediately; because, for all practical purposes, we have peace to-day. Where is the justice of keeping this man, and many other individuals, still interned? The deprivation of a man&#39;s liberty may be a small thing to some Defence Department officials, but it is a big thing to the individual concerned. If it is proved that this man has said anything which, in the remotest degree, could be considered a menace to the safety of the Empire, I would say, &#34; Good enough for him if he gets the sentence he deserves.&#34; But, no matter what may be proved against him, the Government will never be able to clear itself of the shame of the charge that it took away a man&#39;s liberty and refused him a public investigation. The fact is, we have not been living in a free country. Things have been done in Australia, under our secret intelligence service especially, which would almost put the secret service police of Russia to shame. </para>

                        <para>An incomplete return, supplied in the House of Representatives by the Acting Prime Minister, showed that thirty-seven Boards and Commissions, some of them subdivided, had been appointed by the Ministry in connexion with Government Departments and war activities.

                    <para>I suppose those latter would, total as much as, if not more than, the sum mentioned.

They have been solicitous to help the Government - quite anxious to do so - and no doubt, they have acted in a public-spirited manner. </para>

He had not been given authority by the people, or by any section of the people, to administer the country&#39;s affairs. Neither had any other of the individuals mentioned. This is merely a way of ministerially, shelving control. The Government have thrown their duties and responsibilities upon non-parliamentary Boards; and even if those Boards have been acting in an honorary capacity, the system has not been satisfactory. Let the people either shut up the Federal Parliament and hand the Government of the country over to the non-parliamentary Boards, or let the Government take back and administer its proper powers. These Boards comprise a super-Parliament, having no responsibility to the people. The other day a report was placed before Parliament dealing with the investigations of a Commission upon Naval and Military administration. That Commission conceived it to be its duty merely to report upon the facts, .and not to make recommendations. That inquiry should have been conducted by a Judge acting as a Royal Commission, who would not only have set out the facts, but would have probably made recommendations. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Keefe</inline> has been animadverting upon the appointment of business Boards, and has suggested that the object of Ministers in making these appointments was to escape responsibility. I cannot see anything more natural in a time of war, when Ministers were called upon to undertake vast duties in addition to their ordinary work, than that they should call in men of experience to assist them, and men who have been glad to give their services for nothing. Ministers have not escaped responsibility by the appointment of these Boards. The Board reports to the Minister, but it is the Minister who must accept responsibility for any action taken. It was absolutely necessary &#39; that these Boards of highly trained successful men of business should come to the assistance of the country in the time of stress and strain through which we have been passing. I commend the Government for having appointed these Boards. I wish that they had appointed more of them, and had adopted the policy earlier. -If we look to Great Britain and to the United States of America we shall find that they have proceeded in the same direction and have employed successful citizens to run their vast commercial undertakings during the war. </para>

I have, however, been compelled to choose between statements made by Senators Ferricks and O&#39;Keefe and the statements made on behalf of the Government. </para>

Honorable senators overlook the fact that in interning men the Minister incurs enormous responsibility. If he deprived a man of his liberty upon insufficient ground, he would for ever forfeit his place in the esteem of the community. </para>

                            <para>-The honorable senator should remember that we have been at war. In my view the Minister must have completely satisfied himself that it would be dangerous- to let certain men out of custody, or he would have permitted them to go free. I hope that in reply the Minister for Defence will give some particulars of the cases which have been referred to. Liberty is the most valuable possession which a man can enjoy. </para>

Though our battalions were sadly decimated, they were kept up, and the expenditure on recruiting was money well spent.

                    <para>When this Bill was first introduced it proposed the extension of the operation of the Act for six months after the war. The Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> has since agreed to curtail the period to three months after the war, or until the 30th July, whichever is the longer period. There must be some period fixed for the termination of its operation. If it were &#34;To terminate suddenly, the result would be chaos. It must be admitted that it is necessary to continue the exercise of many of the powers conferred by the Act. We have amongst us several thousand German enemy subjects sent here from Hong Kong, the Malay Peninsula, and other places, and if the War Precautions Act were suddenly repealed, those people would be turned out amongst us. I think that honorable senators generally would not like to face that condition of things. The Wool Pool must be continued; the Wheat Pool, and the Metal Pool also. We must continue to control butter shipments. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. The honorable  senator  might just as well ask why the Wool Pool or the Wheat Pool should not be brought to an end in the same way. We cannot expect Ministers, while we are badgering them here day after day, to give proper attention to all these things. I do not think that seven months from the present time is too long to bring the operation of this measure to a close. I admit that its operation causes terrible friction, but we must give the Government a reasonable time in which to make proper arrangements to deal with the matter in an orderly fashion. </para>

He feels all the better for it, and is not subsequently so likely to indulge in any mischief. I think that there has been too much pin-pricking as  a  result of the operation of the Act. The Government will have seven months within which to bring this business to an end, and during that time  I  hope that they will terminate many of the activities  in  which they have been engaged owing to the war.  I  know that the metal industry has been greatly interfered with. I have here  a  letter from a gentleman in Wangaratta. He says - </para>

                        <para>Thanks for your letter. The provisions prohibiting forming of syndicates and companies are harassing us in mining. All such companies require Federal approval. Their ideas are no good at all. At present Federal authorities will see no one. They are trying to get the War Precautions Act extended, when they will be like adamant, and stop all new industries. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">I quite agree with. that. I hope that Ministers will take warning, and cease further interference with mining companies. I had a little spec, in a mine myself the other day. It was only a coal mine, not far from Sydney, and in a bore which we put down we struck a fine seam of coal at 1,600 feet. But we had no money, and, this war coming along, we could do nothing just then. However, the manager knew of another man who had a coal mine with &#34;a seam close to the surface, and requiring a little capital to develop it. He said if we gave him 60,000 shares in the company he would carry on the work, and develop the proposition. We had to appeal to the Government for authority, and the matter came before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mulvany,</inline> who would not hear of it. He said it was a terrible thing to have 60,000 dummy shares, and so he stopped it. Subsequently I was asked, as a shareholder, to go along and see, of all people, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collins,</inline> the Under.Treasurer ! When I entered his office, I said, &#34; G08d Lord, Collins, I thought you were occupied looking after the expenditure of &#163;100,000,000 of our revenue.&#34; He said, &#34; Yes.&#34; Then I said, &#34; I thought you were also looking after the old-age pensions, the soldiers&#39; pensions and the invalid pensions, as well as the maternity bonus,&#34; and he replied that of. course he was. I said, &#34; Apparently, you are going to supply all the wet nurses for the children. On top of all that, you are going to dry nurse the whole community as well.&#34; The thing is absolutely ridiculous. These restrictions on companies are tying up  enterprise, and there is no reason why they should be continued. But, of course, it is said that people get robbed in mining. I have heard that. They may be ; but when anybody puts money into a new mine he stands a good chance of losing it. It is very much the same as putting money on a race-horse. All new mining shows are, more or less, wild-cat ventures, because nobody knows what is ahead of the pick. It is the height of absurdity, in my judgment, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collins&#39;</inline> time should b&#171; occupied in matters connected with these Boards. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collins</inline> is one of the most experienced financial men we have. He is carrying an enormous load, and all his time should be devoted to looking after the civil expenditure of the country. We have to consider, also, the inconveniences which these restrictions on the formation of new companies entail. It is bad enough for &#39;people who live in Melbourne, but it is ridiculous that people should be obliged to come from Sydney or elsewhere to seek authority to build up small mining ventures. I hope the Government will, as soon as possible, remove all these unnecessary restrictions. Of course, there is a possibility that unless some control is exercised, money, which may be required for future war loans, will be sunk in these ventures. We must expect one, or possibly two, more war loans, and we know perfectly well that the compulsory ;provisions of the contemplated law will be applied to them. People know all this, and probably are prepared to go into these fresh ventures with a full consciousness of all that it means. I think it would be perfectly safe for the Government now to allow the wheels in industry again to revolve as in normal times. </para>
                    <para>With reference to the moratorium, I was pleased to hear honorable senators opposite suggest that the money lenders are men of such -splendid character. We have had a lot of white-washing to-night by our friends in Opposition, and I hope that when the next election  comes  round they will remember what has been said in this debate. I do not look on all money lenders as vampires. A great deal of the money is lent by big companies, life insurance societies, and corporations entirely on sound business lines. As an enormous amount of money is involved, there would be some risk if the moratorium regulations were withdrawn immediately. The situation requires to be handled very carefully. This is one reason why the Government should have a little time in order to make quite satisfactory arrangements. I do not think that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> is asking for an undue length of time, but I do hope that harassing restrictions will soon be swept aside. </para>
                    <para>I know it is difficult, once a Department is established, to do away with it, because those responsible have to consider the employees who, of course,  equire  fair notice of any impending changes. Still.  there are plenty of occupations available throughout the country, and I feel quite sure that if changes should be really necessary, the persons concerned need not be long out of billets. Indeed, the difficulty is to find men who can take up positions; so I do not think Ministers need be reluctant about closing up Departments on that account. There is plenty of work available. Unfortunately, these Boards are curtailing enterprise. We, want to be able to proceed in the old way as soon . as we can, and go on developing this country on the most up-to-date and progressive lines. This cannot be done if the business enterprise of the community is throttled by restrictive regulations, as has been the case lately. Still, I am going to support the Government in what they have asked for. </para>

But that grant of extraordinary powers to the Government of the day involved also the responsibility on the part of the Government to use the powers with discretion. I do not think there was ever any danger with regard to the War Precautions Act under conditions existing at the time it was passed. There was then a Labour Government on the Treasury benches and a Labour majority in both Houses, and I venture to say that neither the Minister for Defence
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline>
                        nor the Prime Minister
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline>
                        would have dared to act in such an arbitrary and despotic manner in administering this law if those conditions had continued. Although the responsibility for this tyrannical action rests in the first place with the Government that administers the Act, those who support them in both Houses cannot get rid of their responsibility in that respect also, because, if the Government were not secure, by having behind them a docile and pliant majority to indorse whatever action they chose to take, the War Precautions Act would not have been administered as it has been.

                        expressed astonishment that it should have been possible for men to be interned without having been charged or given an opportunity of defending themselves. He said that the Government must have had some very good reasons before such a state of things could have occurred. The Minister for Defence has made the same excuse when questions about the internees have been asked in this Senate. In reply to representations on the subject, he said, &#34; The Government have looked into these matters carefully, and  aTe  satisfied they have good reason for the action taken.&#34; The fallacy behind any statement of that sort is this: There can be no satisfactory investigation of any case where only one side is heard. And that has been the position with regard to those who have been interned under the War Precautions Act. In British communities we have built up, in the course of centuries, after great struggles against arbitrary power, certain safeguards by which the liberty of the subject is protected, beginning with Magna Charta and the Bill of Rights. Under the administration of this Act all those safeguards have been thrown to the winds, and men have been arrested, imprisoned, and detained for months without any accusation or trial, without an opportunity to meet their accusers, or to disprove the allegations against them.

                        M. Scott, which I have brought before the Senate on two or three occasions previously. He was lecturing in South Australia on the nationalization of banking when he was arrested. He had stood at the last State elections as an independent candidate for the district of Barossa, in South Australia. When arrested he was taken to Sydney, and interned. He had no opportunity of knowing what the charge against him was, or who his accusers were. When I brought the matter before the Minister for Defence on the last occasion he said it was to be investigated. It appears to have been investigated, and the man has been liberated. He is a loyal Australian-born British subject, and is extremely indignant at having been placed in an internment camp amongst alien enemies. When I learned that he was free I wrote to him, and asked him if he had had an opportunity of knowing the charges against him. This is his letter in reply -

                    <para>I suppose that case is one of many, but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scott</inline> has been released because the Government evidently found that there was , nothing on which they could base a charge against him. He does not know to this day what he was interned for. We have arrived at stich a position in this country that if anybody whispers- into the ear of the Minister&#39; or of any of his secret service staff of spies and informers&#39;  something  to blast the character of an Australian citizen, that man is  seized  and put into camp, which is practically a prison, without being given an opportunity to defend his character. Such a state of things revolts the conscience of the community, and when the Government ask for an extension of the powers which they have abused so tyrannically  and  arbitrarily we are justified in saying that we have had quite enough of this sort of thing in a free country. We have gone back to the time of the Stuarts. This is the old Star Chamber system inaugurated again in Australia- a thing that  every  real Britisher has been ashamed of, and to which  We  point with scorn now as something that could never happen in this enlightened age. No one would have believed that in these days a man could be imprisoned without knowing the charge against him, put in prison on the information of spies and informers, and held there without trial or even accusation. </para>
                    <para>Some honorable senators on the Government side, notably <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> have said that Parliament is willing to give the Government any powers that can be shown to be actually necessary during the . transition period from war to peace, and the Senate can surely demand that the Government should state specifically what portions of the War Precautions regulations are necessary, and ask Parliament to  Sanction  their continuance, while agreeing that the others should not  be  renewed. 1 hope the Government will heed that good advice, and that an end  will,  be put to the arbitrary and tyrannical administration that has been the distinguishing and dishonouring characteristic of the Government&#39;s management of the War Precautions Act during the last two years. 1 mention the last two years because I do not think there was any complaint about the administration of the Act until about the middle of 1916. Regulations of that sort are necessarily harassing, but they were administered up to that time with discretion and without causing undue hardship. It was not until the first conscription referendum campaign began, and the Prime Minister ran amok through the country, setting everybody by the ears, that the censorship and other regulations were used in an arbitrary manner, with the results described by various honorable senators. Parliament itself has not been free from the inroads of Government officials. A member&#39;s private locker was raided, and copies of his speech were taken, while the State Parliament of Queensland was interfered with, because the Brisbane Printing Office was raided, the type seized, and <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> confiscated. Such things have not happened since the days when Cromwell turned out the Long Parliament. It is only since the Labour Government left the Treasury bench, and a Labour majority ceased to exist in both Houses of Parliament, that the Government have dared to take such arbitrary and despotic action. </para>

                        <para>. - I intend to vote against the second reading of this Bill, but it is not because I support the statements that have been put forward by honorable senators on the other side, or because I associate myself with the spleen that has been hurled by them against the Government. I take this course because I consider that the Government should have approached the question of the prolongation of the War Precautions Act in a different manner from that adopted by them. Had the Government given us some indication of what regulations they desired to retain, and what to drop, they would have had the almost unanimous support of the Senate and of the other branch of the Parliament. It would be a crime for the moratorium to be wiped out without proper notice being given. Besides municipalities that have invested their funds in the war loans, and need some protection under the terms of the moratorium, a number of private individuals are similarly placed, and will need protection until the various war loans are liquidated. It would be absolutely impossible to wipe out the Act altogether  at this period, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> and others have suggested; but the Government should have given the Senate some indication of which regulations they consider absolutely necessary to  carry on the business of the country, and which they consider unnecessary now that the armistice has been signed and an early peace is probable. If they had given some such indication they would have had very little opposition from me as far as this Bill is concerned. Numberless quite unnecessary regulations have been issued by the Government under the Act. During the time of the last referendum in Queensland, regulations were poured out one after the other like sausages from a machine. They disturbed the people more than would otherwise have been the case, although I do not agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> that it was solely because of the action of the Government that the people of Queensland and other States were disturbed. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks</inline> and &#39; others on &#39;his side were equally, if not more, to blame. Regulation after regulation was issued during the last referendum campaign, until- I positively wondered when their issue would cease. &#34;We know that as the result of a little rowdyism which was displayed at one of the meetings in Queensland, which was addressed by the Prime Minister, the people of that State were subjected to the infliction of a Commonwealth Police Force. Now, df any real need existed for the maintenance of that body, of what possible use would be a force consisting of some 20 or 30 men? </para>

                    <para>Honorable senators opposite have spoken of the various Boards which have been created under the War Precautions Act, and have expressed themselves in favour of their abolition. To my mind, although a number of those Boards are utterly useless, it would be quite impossible to wipe out the whole of them at the present time. If the Government had not exercised control over the wheat produced in this country, long ere this our farmers would have been pleading with Ministers to do something for them in the direction of finding a market for their produce. There are, however, other Boards which might very well be abolished. </para>
                    <para>I object to giving the Government the powers conferred by every regulation which has already been issued, together with the powers which would be derived from the issue of further regulations of a similar character. To my mind, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> struck the keynote of this question when he pointed out that even if the Bill now before us does not become law, the Government will not immediately forego any of the powers which they wield to-day. If peace be declared within the next two or three months - a contingency which seems very improbable in the fight of the press reports which we are daily receiving - it will not be necessary for &#39;the Governor-General to issue the proclamation provided for in our War Precautions Act until .such time as the Government deem it advisable to issue it. We know perfectly well that that proclamation will be issued by the Governor-General only on the advice of his Executive. Ministers, therefore, were not obliged to submit this very contentious Bill, seeing that in its absence they will retain the powers conferred upon them by the principal Act for some months to come. </para>
                    <para>In regard to the censorship, we know that in other parts of the world it has already been relaxed. Only this, morning I read in a mining journal that very much to the relief of the persons interested in the metal trade, the Government of the United States of America  have relinquished all control of it. Yet, in Australia we are told that it would not be safe for the Government to forego their control over this and other industries. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> who is well known in the commercial life of New South Wales, and, indeed, of Australia, has very properly stressed the fact that the continuance of the regulations under the War Precautions Act, even for a week longer than is necessary, will unduly hamper the operations of the various companies which are interested in the metal industry. These companies have endured sufficient during the past four years to warrant us in restoring to them, at the earliest possible moment, the utmost freedom which they previously enjoyed. I have nothing further to add in respect of this Bill. I endeavour at all times to record my vote in accordance with my conscientious convictions, and upon this occasion I feel that the Government might have been more frank with us, and might have supplied us with more information. Had they given us some indication of the powers which might well be dispensed with at the present juncture, I would not have opposed the passing of this Bill. But, instead, they have asked us to grant an extension of all the powers that are conferred by the  WaT  Precautions Act. In view of the hysterical legislation in which they indulged some two years ago, I do not feel justified in registering a vote to enable them to re-enact that legislation. I have no desire to ventilate any personal grievance, but, as a matter of principle, I cannot vote for the continuance of the principal Act for a moment longer than is absolutely necessary. </para>

                        <para>. -This Bill has been discussed at very great length, and because of that I propose to say very little upon it. I wish to repeat nothing that has been said by previous speakers. But I do want to register my protest against the passing of this Bill, because I cannot conceive of any honest man voting for the continuance of an Act which has been so dishonestly used. Whilst I was one of those who voted to give the Government the powers which they wield to-day, I did so in the belief that they would use those powers only for the protection of the people of this country and of the Commonwealth itself. Like other honorable senators, I had not the slightest idea, when that measure was passed, that we were doing anything more than empowering the Government to deal with our enemies. Because we had confidence in Ministers, and because we believed that they would never dream of using the powers conferred upon them- in . any other direction, we supported the measure. But we have since learned, not only that they are prepared to use the Act to insure the safety of the Commonwealth, but that they are prepared to use it for the most mean&#39; and despicable political purposes. They are ready at all times to lay violent hands upon any person who happens to be opposed to them politically. They send along their minions, and I do not know whether they put them in gaol or not. It is a mystery to me what they do with them ; but they confine them somewhere or other. These fellow Australians of ours, if the Government deprived them of their liberty but conceded them the ordinary right of trial by a jury of their peers, would have a decent chance of securing fair play. Yet what is happening in Australia - the last country on God&#39;s earth where any one would have expected so great an abuse of liberty ? This is the country to which men and women journeyed after they had been forced out of their native lands by harsh and oppressive conditions. This is the country where they expected to find shelter under our vaunted freedom and liberty. They thought that this was the very home of liberty. Yet the Government of Australia have taken citizens away and deprived them of their freedom, without even giving them the rights of fair trial, to which all men are entitled. </para>

                            <para>- That is so; but the same does not apply to men arrested under the War Precautions Act. Time-honoured fair play is not to be extended to men born in this country. They are taken away and hidden somewhere without being given the right to know what is the accusation against them, or of being judged by a jury of their fellow countrymen. What is a country worth if a man cannot say what he likes and do what he pleases under its laws ? What is the good of a country if a man may not take the chances of risking whatever his country&#39;s laws may impose? If my idea of justice is correct, it means that I, as a citizen, must take the risks of the laws. If I defy the laws I accept the risks; but I know all the time that I shall not be placing those risks in the hands of any one individual, but into the keeping of a jury of my fellow countrymen, who will give me justice. </para>

                    <para>The Government, having had three years&#39; experience of administration under the War Precautions Act, have been condemned by the country. That is to be seen by the results of every election which has occurred. The Government must have a cast-iron cHeek - knowing the results of their administration of the Act and its regulations, and being aware of the opinions which the people hold concerning them - to ask Parliament now to grant an extension of the very powers which they have so misused and abused. They have not only imprisoned our manhood, but they have muzzled the press. They have appointed certain persons, who may be honest in themselves, but who have put to full use the censorship powers - and in a mighty strange fashion, too. </para>
                    <para>I will cite one instance as to which I have personal knowledge. Under the censorship regulations the editor of a Labour newspaper was prosecuted. He was charged with having failed to submit certain matter to the censor. He was fined, I think, &#163;50, with the option of six months&#39; imprisonment. But here are the facts concerning another editor of another publication. This was not a Labour magazine, so far as I am aware, notwithstanding that it has been one of the few journals through whose columns the people have been able to get a clear idea of what has been happening all over the world. I am alluding now to <inline font-style="italic">Stead&#39;s Review.</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stead</inline> published a work entitled <inline font-style="italic">Stead&#39;s War Facts.</inline> He submitted all the matter therein to the censor. </para>

                            <para>- It may not be, but it is common sense, and the people want common sense, whether it is parliamentary or not. This is a dishonest Government. When I voted to empower the Government, for the protection of this country and its people, to exercise  the War Precautions Act as it was originally presented to us, I believed the Government were honest, and would employ those powers only in the interests of the people. I cannot believe to-day, however, that any honest-minded senator will concede to the Government an extension of these powers which they now seek, in view of their knowledge of the facts. Honorable senators must know how the Government have misused their powers. </para>

                    <para>I am a party man. I make no secret of it. Everybody knows it. But surely we have some honour in this Chamber, and some individual sense of what is due between one person and another. That being so, honorable senators, surely, will not permit the Government to secure the desired extension of their powers. I have not such poor faith in human nature as to believe that that is what will happen. I cannot believe that this measure can be submitted to a deliberative assembly and passed in face of all the evidence which has been furnished against it. During the continuance of the war I had no desire to injure the Government, who were conducting the- affairs of the country. I do not believe that any honorable senator on this side would have sought to do anything to injure the Government while carrying out their great responsibilities in a time of war. But I cannot believe, either, that honorable senators will now give to the Government the further powers sought. I would be quite prepared to offer to the Government an extension of the Act if they were honest, and said, &#34; Here are certain matters requiring to be dealt with. The war is practically over, but certain powers are necessary still to safeguard the people. We ask you to grant us those powers.&#34; There would be no dissentient voice in such circumstances. But when the Government ask us now for an extension of the Act, I can only say that I frankly believe they desire the extension to continue until after the next elections. That is what is behind it all. </para>

                    <para>The purpose behind the desired extension of the Act and its regulations is not to safeguard Australia, but for the Government to save themselves. The Government want to extend the War Precautions Act over the next elections, so that they may be able to do the same things as before; so that they may publish everything on God&#39;s earth which suits them, while, at the same time, keeping men on the job censoring out of the reach of the people every argument advanced by their opponents. I am not prepared to give the Government the extension of the Act which they ask for. I admit frankly that my party feeling runs very high. I credit honorable senators opposite with believing that their party is right; but I do not believe that a majority of them are prepared to descend to the depths to which the Government ask them to descend now. I should be prepared to vote for a measure which would empower the Government to protect the people of this country, but I am not prepared to endow them for a further term with powers which they have so misused in the past. I cannot believe that this Bill will go through. I am piously hoping that it will not. The time of the Senate has been fairly taken up with the debate, and Ministers will in all probability have an opportunity to put up a defence for themselves, if a defence is possible, in connexion with this measure. They may be able to persuade their supporters to vote for it. But I care not whether the Bill is passed or not, honorable senators should know that the people of the Commonwealth are very sick of the War Precautions Act. </para>
                    <para>The Government have been very busy under this Act in robbing the people of the country, or enabling some of their friends to do so. They have professed a desire to befriend the farmers of Australia. I asked the Minister responsible for the purchase of wheat bags some time ago, which was done under this Act, what profit the Government made out of the transaction. The Minister said that he had insufficient information at the time to supply me with an answer. I had not then read the Treasurer&#39;s Budget speech, but I found later, from a perusal of it, that it discloses the fact that the Government befriended the farmers of this country by purchasing bags on which they spent &#163;2,400,000 of our money, and, in doing so, made a profit of &#163;106,000. </para>

                            <para>- No, I am talking of this year. Though I could not get the information, it was disclosed. There is the usual distributer in Flinders-street, who has a space on a wharf where bales of bags are dropped as they are taken from the ship&#39;s hold. He, has only a bit of a clerk making book entries there; but the Government sold bags to this distributor for 9s. 8d. per dozen, and they let him put on another 5d. per dozen, making the cost 10s. Id., and that  distribuor  got &#163;104,000. He was allowed to send the bags to another distributor, and not to the farmer who uses the bags. The other distributor was allowed to put the price up to 10s. &#39; 6d., and so he got another &#163;104,000. That is the kind of thing that was done by a Government who professed to be the farmers&#39; friends. The farmers of Corangamite have just shown the kind of friend they consider this Government. They have whipped the Government candidate. The party opposite may win the seat, though I think that is very doubtful; but the farmers of the district have at least shown the Government that they are taking a little notice pf how the affairs of Australia are being carried on by them under the War Precautions Act, and other Acts which they have been endeavouring to administer, but which, in my opinion, they have seriously  maladministered.  They robbed the farmers of &#163;225,000 in one deal. On the admission of the Minister responsible, they robbed the  rabbiters  of &#163;260,000. The Minister in another place responsible for the price fixing has told the country that the price-fixing business has resulted in a profit to the Government of &#163;200,000. They have not treated the big interests in the same way. They have permitted those interests in wool and in meat practically to please themselves. Honorable senators are aware that the InterState Commission made certain recommendations on the subject of fixing the price of meat. After they did so, the Government acted, and, as a result, I had to . pay 2d. per lb. more for meat than I had to pay before they took any action at all. The people of the country are paying for this kind of thing; and, God knows, it is nearly time they woke up to the fact that the Government are fooling them, and won their place in power because they said they were going- to win the war. </para>

                    <para>The war is won, and I am very glad that it has been won, but it was not won by this Government or &#34;by the elements supporting them, but by the trade unionists of Australia, who went to the Front in their thousands, and are returning now not expecting to find a country governed under a War Precautions Act. They look forward to returning to a free country as they left it. They do not expect to return to a country where the name G. F. Pearce on a minute may result in the internment of any soldier or any citizen of this country, and deprive him of his liberty without a trial by his fellow men. Our soldiers are returning in their hundreds of thousands. I have no fear of these men. I am one of them, and have worked alongside many of them. When they return the last thing they will expect is to find that the Government were given power by this Parliament to do&#39; the things they have done to some of their fathers while they were absent. I cannot believe that the Senate will consent to such a thing. But it does not matter v whether this Bill passes or not, honorable senators need make no mistake about it, the Australians who are&#39; coming back are not going to be tied down by any restrictions which this Parliament may seek to impose. They are coming back to find worse laws and greater restrictions  in their country than are to be found in many other countries, although this was a comparatively free country before they left it. They are returning to find a Win-the-war National Government in power, because they &#34; pulled the legs &#34; of the people very successfully a little while ago. They will be under the authority of the Government and their laws, and under the War Precautions Act. </para>
                    <para>What, in the name of God, is this Act wanted for? Is it for the returned soldier ? Do the Government require this power to deal with the returned soldier? If not, what do they want it for? Ministers have told us that there have been thirty-eight people interned in this country who are citizens of Australia or of the British Empire, and those people have never had a trial. They have been deprived of their liberty; but they have done no harm to this country. Bias any one else done harm to it? Now that peace is in sight, we hope to see the countries that have been at war. returning to better industrial conditions than prevailed previous to the war. Is there any one in Australia for whom it is necessary that the Government should have these powers conferred upon them? Do they require these powers to deal with the returned soldiers whom they have promised so much, the men who have won the war, and have been the spear-head in every big fight in the great struggle? Are these the people whom the Government contemplate dealing with under the War Precautions Act? If so, let the Government admit it frankly. Do they fear that something will happen when our soldiers return ? &#34;They have no evidence that those who remained in Australia are a menace to the welfare of the country. I say, deliberately, that they propose the extension of the Act and desire a continuance of their powers under it to deal, not with those who are already in Australia, but with those who are coming back. I hope that honorable senators will not pass this Bill  but whether they do or not, the men who did the things which our soldiers have done at the Front, when they come back here will wipe the floor with the mob opposite who are trying to restrict their liberties. </para>

I have never listened to &#39; a debate in which there was so much political camouflage used as has been used in this debate. I do not doubt that honorable senators opposite have believed that in saying the things they have said they were saying what would be regarded as popular. The War Precautions Act is a disagreeable Act, because it is, and has been, an interference with, liberty. Honorable senators get up and mouth that kind of thing as if they had made a discovery. They have discovered nothing. Every one knew that the Act would interfere with liberty - the liberty to do things inimical to this country during the war. Every one who has tried to do that has been interfered with, including some of the gentlemen on whose behalf we have listened to passionate appeals, and who are amongst the 4,000 or 5,000 in our internment camps to-day. </para>

                        is very much concerned as to what the attitude of the soldiers will be who are coming back. The Government are not concerned about that: We know that they will be all right. We have never had any doubt about them. It is the men who remained here when they ought to have gone to the Front about whom we have been concerned. We were satisfied that the men who went to the Front were prepared to do their duty to this country.

                            <para>- That statement is untrue. That strike was deliberately worked up for the purpose of preventing the coaling and loading of foodstuffs into our transports and hospital ships, required to bring our wounded troops back to Australia. In Sydney these men absolutely refused to coal or put foodstuffs into hospital ships, with the result that the power of the War Precautions Act had to be exercised to withdraw preference from them, and to enable men who were willing to work the vessels to obtain employment in preference to unionists who refused duty. Those are the circumstances of that strike leading up to the cancellation of preference to unionists </para>

I have been obliged to sit all through this debate and listen to insults hurled at me, but as soon as I attempt to reply there is a chorus of squealing from honorable members opposite. They know that it is the truth, and they do not like it. That is the reason why the War Precautions Act was brought into operation in that particular case, and as one who has done as much as any honorable senator to make preference to unionists and arbitration possible, in this country, in the same circumstances I would do the same a hundred times over. </para>

                    <para>I come now to the second point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner.</inline> He spoke about the repressive regulations dealing with disloyalty and dissension, and instanced the suppression of the use of Sinn Fein badges in Australia as an example of how ridiculous the regulation was. He said that these things were freely allowed in Ireland, and had been allowed right throughout the war. I tell the honorable senator that he could not have given a more unfortunate example. I say that Ireland, during this war, and owing to the actions of this section, has been a source of weakness to the Empire when she could have been a source of strength. Although it is true that Irish regiments and Irishmen have done nobly on the field of battle, it is not true of those who remained in Ireland and caused dissension right throughout the war. All honour is paid to those Irishmen who fought so nobly on the field of battle; but no honour to those who remained in Ireland. The Government were determined that these people should not be allowed to stir up bitterness and similar dissension in this country. We took action with that object in view, and I am glad to say it was successful, because we scotched the attempts of those who endeavoured to create dissension here. </para>
                    <para>I come now to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten&#39;s</inline> remarks, and I cannot help feeling somewhat satirical when I think of his reference to himself as a &#34; general &#34; supporter of the Government. It would be somewhat difficult to record the instances in which he has supported the Government, at all events in connexion with any measure that I have been piloting through this Chamber. He referred in a somewhat schoolmasterly manner to the ideas We all had when the original Act was introduced at the beginning of the war, and went on to say that all those ideas have changed, I am one of the first to admit it. When the Act was passed I had no idea of the use to which it would be put before the war was over. But, after all, what is, that admission ? It is an admission that this war itself has been a complete revelation to every nation on earth. Previous wars were fought by the navies and armies of the belligerents, but this war has been fought by the whole of the people. Every section of the people has been involved. The naval, military and economic force9, trade and commerce - everything - has been flung into the scale. We did &#39;not know that in 1914, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten,</inline> in 1918, chides us with the fact that in 1914 we did not know the uses to which this Act would be put. This remarkable statement, surely, is a startling revelation! He tells us that when We passed the Act in 1914 we did not know what we would have to do. </para>

                    <para>Tie honorable senator, in the course of .his remarks on this Bill, produced sheafs of the regulations, and perhaps to your intense weariness, sir, and  certainly  to my own, he spent a considerable time in reading and denouncing them all, and saying that all these things ought to have been done by legislation. This wisdom after the event is most startling. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> comes here as a representative of the commercial community of New South Wales, and he tells us that all these things are an interference with commerce and industry. I tell him, in reply, that this war has interfered with the commerce and industry of every country, and that if Great Britain had not interfered wth  her trade and commerce as she did, Germany to-day would have been doing so in a much more drastic manner. It is because Britain realized that the whole of her trade, finance and commerce had to be thrown into the scale that the Empire is victorious today and Germany defeated. This representative of the commercial community of New South Wales  deplores  this interference with trade and commerce. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> is against the &#34;Bill. He quoted a number of regulations which he said should be discontinued, though I notice he is prepared to admit that these regulations which are in the interests of the commercial community should be continued. But I point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> that if he would destroy the Act he must destroy these also. </para>

                        if I may judge by his speech on this Bill, holds the belief that no Ministers can be trusted. Either they are inept or untrustworthy. But his remarks as applied to Ministers were quite flattering when compared with his remarks concerning those officials whom the Ministers have gathered around them. I gather from his remarks that the staffs we have got together are either knaves or fools who cannot be intrusted with the duty of advising us on any matter. I frankly confess that
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline>
                        is beyond my comprehension. If he achieves what he is endeavouring to do, I venture to say that at the next election the commercial community will have a reckoning with him of a far more drastic character than he has endeavoured to have with this Government.

                    <para>Let me direct the attention of the commercial community and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> to one little item in which they are vitally interested, and in which they are being protected to-day by reason of the War Precautions Act and the regulations issued under it. Honorable senators of the Opposition are very frequently given to talking about the exploitations of the Shipping Combine. There is. no place in the world that has been so well and so cheaply served by shipping as Australia has been during the war; but if the War Precautions Act had been lifted from shipping for five minutes we would not have had a solitary ship left on &#39;our coast, and the Shipping Combine, as it is called, could have made immense fortunes, because freights elsewhere have been five or six times higher than those which they were allowed to earn on the Australian coast. We have not only held the ships here, but we have also held the freights down. Although freights have fallen elsewhere they have not fallen to anything approximating the Australian rates. If we were to lift the War Precautions Act at the present time the Australian shipping companies would in six months make more than they have made during the whole course of the war. </para>

                            <para>- I know that it will not happen, because the Government, and its supporters,, and those who are in favour of this Bill will, not allow it to happen; but if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> had his way it would come about as soon as peace is declared. </para>

                    <para>I apologize to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> for not being able to grasp his arguments in regard to the proclamation; but, as it appears to me, we would be placing ourselves in an extraordinary position if we adopted the course he has suggested. The United Kingdom has passed a specific Act which provides for the declaration of the date of the termination of the war at a date not later than the date of exchange or deposit of the ratifications of the treaty of peace. The Imperial Parliament is not Imperial in the sense that its laws extend to, and are enforceable throughout all parts of the Empire; but is Imperial in the sense that it controls the foreign policy of the nation. Our enemies, our Allies, and the neutral nations look upon the British Empire, not as a number of nations, but as one nation. When the Imperial Government issues a proclamation declaring that peace has been achieved on that day, every portion of the British Empire will be at peace. But, according to my understanding of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has said, there can be a proclamation by the Empire, saying that the state of war has passed, and inferentially that means that the people who are in the internment camp at Liverpool are our enemies before it is made, but cease to be such once it is published; and, on the other hand, we can have a proclamation in an integral part of the Empire a month or six months later, declaring that peace has been achieved, and in that period between the proclamation  by.&#39; the . British Empire that peace has arrived and the proclamation by the Governor-General of Australia that peace has arrived, these people may still be regarded as our enemies. </para>

I did not infer that by some feat of legerdemain on our part there was a tapering period during which the war power of the- Commonwealth would shade into the constitutional power. All I meant was that there was a tapering period from, say, prior to the armistice, when we were continuing to exercise these powers freely. For instance, until the Bill we are now dealing with expires there will be a tapering period, during which we shall ease down in our exercise of the powers given by the War Precautions Act until they finally pass from us. </para>

                        speaks of the Kiely case as if some military officer in Tasmania had said about somebody that he had made a statement that was wrong, and telegraphed that over to me, and I said, &#34;Off with his head!&#34; and had signed my name to the warrant. It was not done that way. The military officer in Tasmania receives police reports that a man has done and said certain things in certain places. The Military Commandant considers the reports, consults with the police, and recommends to us that the man should be arrested, and he is arrested. The officer sends the file to us, and the Chief of the General Staff examines it, and recommends to me what course they think should be taken. In the case of every person who is British-born, although not necessarily of British nationality - he may even be of German nationality - the papers, with all the. recommendations, have been taken to Cabinet, and the full evidence read to the Cabinet. In every case there has had to be a majority of the Cabinet in favour of the internment before the man was interned. When certain members of the Irish Republican Brotherhood were interned, exactly the same statements were made about them. We had an inquiry before

                        Harvey, and there has been a remarkable silence - a silence that could be felt - ever since that report was published. I give that as an instance to show that there, too, the Government were denounced as having acted without due warrant. When the people get the evidence on which the Government acted, no public demand is made in any part of the Commonwealth that the men should be released.

The facts showed that we were right, because he had in his possession books that would have been of the utmost value to an enemy of this country. In almost any other country, he would have been shot. He was an employee in the Navy Department, and one of our &#34; comrades.&#34; He was a man of British birth, and everything that could have been said about Kiely could have been said of him. He had a British name, and was born of British parents; and yet he was going about the city, knowing that under Navy regulations he was committing a crime. Honorable senators opposite have been speaking as if everybody in this country was harmless and loyal, and would do absolutely nothing against the interests of Australia. I am sceptical, because I have seen too many instances to the contrary. We have in Liverpool Camp to-day men who we have absolute proof were the secret agents of Germany. They were spies in this country, and more than one of them was born in&#34; this country. </para>

As a matter of fact, they were done, and done with the knowledge of the party, when the Labour Administration was in power. In other words, British-born persons were interned without trial, and the Labour party knew of their internment, because they were informed of it by myself in the Labour Caucus. They knew also that consideration was given to every one of these cases by the Cabinet, and that it was not on the decision of the Minister alone that this procedure was adopted.  <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas.</inline> - That provision was put in by the Labour Caucus itself. </para>

                    <para>I must express my surprise at the attitude taken up by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poll,</inline> who says that he is opposed to this Bill because the Government is not in a position to state definitely tonight which of the regulations under the Act it is prepared to drop, which of them it proposes to perpetuate, and what regulations are to be amended. Is that a reasonable attitude for him to take up ? I ask. the honorable senator to examine it for himself. Parliament has been sitting continuously ever since the signing of the armistice. Does the honorable senator realize the pressure under which Ministers have to work? Does he realize how impossible it is, while Parliament is sitting, and attention has to be given to the preparation of Bills and the answering of all sorts of questions, for Ministers to get together for the purpose of discussing anything more than business actually arising out of out parliamentary proceedings. &#34;Would he have u3 deal with these regulations in a slipshod fashion? The very fact mentioned by him, that hundreds of regulations have been framed under the War Precautions Act, shows that to examine them with a view of determining which  of them can be dropped, which can be amended, and which ought to &#39; be continued, is not the work of a day. Such examination cannot be made in a spare hour now and a spare hour then, but must necessarily occupy some weeks. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll,</inline> however, will not give the Government an opportunity to make that careful examination. He says he will vote for the Bill to cease automatically with the declaration of peace, because we are not prepared to state now which of these hundreds of regulations we propose to drop, continue, or amend. </para>
                    <para>That is not a responsible attitude for a Government supporter to adopt. I would describe it rather as the attitude of a senator who desired to harass the Ministry. A supporter of the Government should give some consideration to the pressure under which Ministers are working, and to the time which must necessarily be occupied in dealing with questions of this sort as they ought to be dealt with. If the honorable senator has correctly stated the basis of his opposition to this Bill, it is not reasonable. </para>

                            <para>- I do not. I notice that President Wilson and representatives of the other Allied nations are  now meeting. I  presume that the object of their meeting is to determine what they are going to do with respect to the peace terms, and that the Peace Conference itself may be convened only to ratify the decisions already arrived at. In that case we might have the declaration of peace before the end of January.  President  Wilson has said that if the Peace Conference is to continue until March he must return to the United States of America. </para>

Had <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poll</inline> questioned me on the subject, I might have shown him a cable from the British Government telling us what they were doing, and suggesting that we should act on similar lines.

                    <para>- I would like to sav that the amending Judiciary Act, to which reference has been made, was passed in 1910, and that in principle it is founded upon a similar Statute which operates in Canada. . It has been said that after we passed the Judiciary Act of 1910 one  of  the Justices of the High Court, in a private capacity, expressed an opinion adverse to its constitutionality. But I understand from inquiries which I have made that there has never been any judicial pronouncement upon the subject. Neither the High Court nor any Justice of it has judicially expressed any opinion upon the validity of that Statute, or upon our competence to pass it. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I wish, also, to mention that in 1912, a similar issue to that which is involved in such connexion, came before the Privy Council in an action between the Attorney-General of Ontario and the Attorney-General of the Dominion of Canada. That was an action in which the Attorney- General of Ontario and the Attorneys-General of several of the Provinces questions the validity of somewhat similar legislation in the Dominion. They expressed a doubt as to the competence of the Supreme Court of Canada to determine the validity of certain Provincial Statutes. The matter came before the Privy Council, which, after hearing the arguments advanced, decided that the Federal Statute was valid, and that the Supreme Court of Canada was required to express its opinion upon the hypothetical case which had been submitted to it. Apart altogether from the existence of the Dominion, it held that such a power was reposed in a free constitutionally-governed community. It was a power which was enjoyed by the provinces before Federation, in respect to their own laws, and the establishment of Federation did not cause that power to disappear. It existed somewhere, and that it existed in the Dominion Parliament the Privy Council had not the slightest doubt. Although one of the Judges of the Supreme Court of Canada had said, &#34; This is not doing the work of a Court, and I do not recognise this as judicial work,&#34; the final tribunal held that the Dominion Parliament had the power to require the Supreme Court to give its interpretation upon a hypothetical case. I hope that when the Minister is referring to the Acting Attorney-General the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap,</inline> he will direct attention to the important case decided by the Privy Council two years after this Parliament passed the amending Judiciary Act in 1910. </para>

If the amendment is carried, the Act must expire on the proclamation of peace, or not later than the 31st July. It is reasonable to argue that, before that date, the Government will have ample time to be able to submit to Parliament some definite proposals regarding the powers they may desire to exercise after the declaration of peace. It has been pointed out over and over again that the uncertainty as to what the Government intend to do is holding up a number of business enterprises and developments that will proceed when the commercial community knows definitely what is to happen in connexion with the powers now exercised under the  WaT  Precautions Act. </para>

As honorable senators are aware, a longer period of extension was provided in the Bill as originally introduced in another place, but a compromise was arrived at, and is embodied in the Bill. I think the compromise is fair, and I ask the Committee to stand by it. </para>

                    <para>- The amendment is one that ought to commend itself to the Committee. I, too, realize, as the Minister for Defence does, that President Wilson&#39;s force of character and dominating personality, and the position he occupies in relation to the  JV  Allied Powers, may help to promote the declaration of peace much earlier than the most optimistic of us anticipated some time ago. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>In that event, is this Act to remain in force for five or six months after the war is officially ended? That would be a negation of the very compromise to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has referred. Suppose that peace is declared some time in February, if this clause is passed in its present form, the Act will still remain in force until the 31st July. 1 understand the amendment to mean that if peace is declared before the 31st July the Act shall cease to operate immediately; but, on the other hand, if peace does not come till September, or for several  year3,  the Act will terminate on the 3lst July. It may be urged that if peace did not come in the interim, it would be a hardship and an in convenience if the Act ceased to operate on that date. That would not be so, because the Government would be able to sta long before the 31st July that it was necessary to take other action to further extend the Act, or to substitute for it some other legislation more in consonance with the circumstances of that day than with the circumstances of the day when war was declared in 1914. Therefore, I do not sec that either hardship or inconvenience will result from the adoption of the amendment. On the contrary, if the amendment is agreed to, and peace does come upon the world formally and technically early in the new year, the Act will cease to operate on the day the state of war is ended, instead of remaining in operation for some five or six months afterwards. </para>
                <para>I hope that the Committee, apart from any party feeling, will consider the position with regard to this Bill. I have in mind two considerations that I think should influence any honorable senator in giving a vote upon this measure. Throughout the war period, I have never hesitated to give to any Government who were in office any powers they asked for, and I have never been associated, directly or indirectly, with any person who sought to annul any regulation the Government chose to pass. I have trusted them implicitly. But we are approaching normal peace times, and I think the amendment will have the effect of speeding up the officers of Departments, who at the present time are intrusted with extraordinary powers under the &#34;War Precautions Act and regulations, to a realization that the termination of their abnormal powers is imminent. But if they know that the Act will remain in force till the 31st </para>
                <para class="block">July at least, and possibly for an indefinite period beyond that date, there will be no disposition on their part to shed their powers with any alacrity. Let the Act terminate on the declaration of peace, or not later than the 31st July, and we shall find that the officials in whom these powers have been vested will be on their guard to prepare themselves for the new conditions and circumstances that will attend the change from a state of war to a state of peace. </para>

                    <para>. - I ask the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator&#34; Pearce)</inline> if he intends to do anything with regard to paragraph 2 of section n. of the original Act. The Committee has decided to insert in the original measure the words &#34; and for a period of three months thereafter or until the thirty-first day of July, One thousand nine hundred and nineteen, whichever period is the longer.&#34; Reading that into the original Act we find that it is associated with the phrase &#34; until the issue of a proclamation by the Governor-General.&#34; Is it proposed to retain those words? If they remain, there will be a considerable amount of doubt as to the position. Already the Minister and I are not in accord, in our opinions, concerning when the Act will terminate. If an amendment is not made now with respect to the issue of a proclamation there will be still further doubt. The retention of the words means that we shall be making the issue of a proclamation a condition precedent to the termination of the war for the purposes of this Act. There is in the minds of many people misconception as to the effect of a proclamation. There is no proclamation necessary either for the declaration of war or of peace. It is not an indispensable condition precedent to either. Proclamations have been a source of great trouble in the development of the Constitution of Great Britain. The Tudor monarchs legislated by proclamation, and the Stuarts followed them; &#39;and the last king who attempted to legislate by proclamation did so at the risk of his Throne. That was James II. It was contended on the part of the Crown that those proclamations had legal effect, and, to some extent, it was recognised; although Lord Coke, when invited by the Crown to declare the effects of proclamations, said the Government could not by proclamation make anything which was law not law. A proclamation is only an announcement, in so far as it proclaims a state of peace or of war. Some proclamations are necessary, however. For instance, under the Navigation Act, the law provides that the Act shall come into operation on a date to be fixed by proclamation. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>That proclamation is a condition precedent to the operation of a law passed by this Parliament; but these other proclamations are not indispensable to peace or war. A proclamation might be issued in Great Britain declaring that the state of war had ceased on the 1st May, but there is no obligation on the part of the Governor-General, or the Governor of any Dominion, to issue a similar proclamation, lt is an intimation of the Royal will - of what it is the pleasure of the Crown to announce to its subjects. The Government could delay the issue of a proclamation, because the proclamation does not make peace, but only announces that a state of peace exists. It may serve as evidence afterwards, and that is all. </para>

                        <para>- Not at all. The proclamation referred to will still remain, unless we do something, as a proclamation for the purposes of the Act - for the purpose of terminating the operation of the Act.. We are now providing that the operation of the Act shall cease at the termination of the war, plus three months, or on the 31st July next, whichever is the longer. And are we to complicate the position by leaving in the provision that the present state of war shall continue until the issue of a proclamation by the Governor-General ? The Government have power to defer the issue of that proclamation just as long as they please. I am not talking about the constitutionality of the powers to be exercised; but the Government may choose to keep the measure on the statute-book, and delay  the issue of the proclamation&#39; until three weeks or three months after the Imperial proclamation. </para>

                    quoted from a Statute passed by the Imperial Parliament , to declare when the war is terminated. I do not know what the particular Statute is, but it is obvious that there was such a necessity imposed on the Imperial Parliament. The Defence of the Realm Act simply states that &#34;  His  Majesty has power, during the present war, to issue regulations/&#39; and so forth, and there is an obligation on the Imperial Parliament to define when the present war terminates. We have already done that by providing that it shall depend upon a proclamation, and now we say that it shall be three months after the termination of the war.

                        <para>- I do not suggest that the Government would do that, but I can conceive that a Government might justifiably intimate that they were not going to issue a proclamation, say, on the 1st of a month, but that it might probably be the 15th or the 2 1st of the month. There may be some necessary cleaning ud to do; and that is why we made the end of the war, for the purposes of this Act, depend on the issue of a proclamation, for which the Government is responsible. I would sooner leave the power and responsibility as it now is with the Government. </para>

                        <para>- It does not matter whether they do or not. That will not affect this Act. We, in the exercise of our own legislative power, have decided that, for the purpose of these extraordinary powers, the term of their enjoyment shall be fixed by the issue of our own proclamation. I think that we acted wisely in making that provision. We did it with the deliberate intention of investing the Government with discretion to issue the proclamation when they were ready. It should be remembered that we passed our measure after the Defence of the Realm Act was passed. Our Act was assented to on 29th October, 1914. The Defence of the Realm Act was assented to on 8th August, -1914, or only four days after war was declared. The Imperial Parliament made no provision for defining the period or the end of the war. We did, and in doing so had regard to the fact that there might be a lot of matters to be cleared up, and we therefore left it to be determined by the issue of a proclamation by the Governor-General. </para>

                <para>I have pointed out that in the Electoral Act, and in the Act providing for the suspension of patent rights, we included no such provision. It was seen that a certain number of institutions, systems, and regulations would be brought into being under&#39; the War Precautions Act which could not be terminated in a day, and which would not go out of existence the moment a cable was received from the Imperial authorities that peace was proclaimed. So we said that for the purposes of this Act - but not for general purposes - the present state of war means the period from a certain date until the issue of a local proclamation. I have pointed out, also, that there is no necessity  for the issue of a proclamation by the Governor-General, either at common law or under constitutional law; but we have said that, for the purposes of this Act, the state of war shall terminate on the issue of such a proclamation. </para>

That would not make those persons enemies when, according to the honorable senator&#39;s own argument, the Imperial proclamation would have made them friends. The whole argument of the Government in this matter goes round in a vicious circle. Another Minister points out that it is necessary to extend the Act for the period proposed because certain arrangements had been entered into abroad.

                        <para>- Because it would be inconsistent with what the Government are now proposing to do. In this Bill the Government are adopting entirely different lines in defining when the state of war will cease. When this Bill was introduced in another place, the Acting Attorney-General at great length went into the circumstance that the Imperial Government had appointed high and eminent legal authorities to exactly define when the. war will have ceased. &#39;As a matter of fact that had no bearing whatever on the issue. The war will have ceased, so far as our Act is concerned, as set out in paragraph 2. The Government are now passing something which will be in direct conflict with paragraph <inline font-style="italic">2,</inline> and if that is adopted I say that we should repeal paragraph 2 of the original Act. As sure as guns are guns, there will be litigation about this Act, and I say that we should not, with our eyes wide open, add to the complications and difficulties of the community, and increase the crop of litigation, which is likely to arise. If we do not repeal paragraph 2 of the Act, and yet at the same time carry the provisions of this Bill, there will be a fruitful field for controversy as to when the Act will have ceased to operate. One will say that it will have ceased three  months after the actual exchange of ratifications; another will say three months after the proclamation, though the proclamation may not issue at all, and there is no obligation to issue it; and yet another will say that it will have ceased to operate on the 31st July. I submit my amendment with regret, and only because it is in harmony with what the Committee seems bent upon doing in connexion with this Bill. </para>

The time during which the measure shall continue in operation is referred to  as   &#34; the present state of war,&#34; which is defined in the original Act to mean the period from the 4th day of August, 1914, until the issue of a proclamation. The Bill amends the original Act by providing that it shall cease to operate three months after the termination of the present state of war, or on the 31st July next, whichever shall be the later date. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> has said about the issue of a proclamation is irrelevant. He proposes to omit the definition of the original Act. I ask the Committee not to do that, because it is necessary, and will have effect should the present state of war continue after the 31st day of July. </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister says that it is necessary to retain the definition of &#34; the present state of war &#34; in the principal Act : but speaking earlier in the discussion, he flaunted the definition contained in an Imperial enactment. Why did he do that ? Does he propose to apply that definition? If not, why was it quoted? And why did the Minister who introduced the Bill in another place spend half-an-hour in explaining to an attentive audience that the Imperial Government had appointed eminent legal authorities to determine the precise moment at which the present state of war could be said to cease. I am inclined to think that this is all camouflage. Now the Minister tells us that we have in the original Act  a  definition suitable for our purpose. We had that definition when the Bill was introduced, and are going to retain it. Yet it is proposed to embody in the law a provision inconsistent with it; and I contend that, in such circumstances, the definition should be struck out. An Imperial statutory definition is necessary, because the Defence of the Realm Act does not define the present state . of war. If the Government were determined to stick to the definition in section 2 of the principal Act, why did they introduce this Bill? They say that the Bill is required, because there is some doubt of when the present state of war may be taken to end, and that a tribunal has been appointed in England to determine what that exact point of time will be ; but now we are also told that we have in our own Act a sufficient definition to which the Government are determined to adhere. Furthermore, it is proposed to embody in our legislation a provision inconsistent with that definition, which will make the measure more unintelligible, more a subject for controversy, and a discredit to the draftsmanship of the authorities, or to the legislative ability of the Parliament. </para>

                <para>I do it for this reason: The Committee has already passed a clause that practically extends the operation  of  the Act  to a  minimum date, the 31st July. . It may be longer, owing to delay in the proclama tion. Consequently,  we  cannot have any alteration of the War Precautions Act before 31st July, and by that time I hold it will be the clear duty of the Government to submit to Parliament specific legislation with regard to  any  further control that may be required. As one who, by virtue of his platform pledges, tries to think independently and fairly upon national matters, I cannot stand for giving extended powers to the Minister such as are contained in the second paragraph, because it would then be within the province of the Government to issue a proclamation at any time between now and the 31st July, or five years, ten years, or, perhaps, fifty years hence. </para>

                        <para>- I think, speaking from memory, that a contract  in  connexion with metals has been made  by  the Metals Association with the British Government for ten years, and I should like the Minister to state specifically that this clause does not apply to contracts such as that, made not by the Government, so far as I understand, but by private associations of smelters. Much as I respect the present Ministry, I cannot stand for giving any Government such extended reserve powers as are contained  in  this  &#39;Clause.  I do not think that any honorable senator has at his fingers&#39; ends the full effect  of  all the regulations in connexion with trade and commerce. I am pleased  to  learn from the Minister that the effect of this clause will be retrospective and not prospective. He has told us that from this date forward to the expiry of the Act, no regulations will be made that will continue beyond the expiry of the Act. </para>

                    <para>. - There  will  be no danger in passing  the  clause, because the regulations to which it applies are already made, and it is  within the control of Parliament to deal with any that may be made thereafter. All these regulations are within the control of Parliament. Before the Act expires Parliament will meet again, and if the honorable senator fears the effect of some of the regulations he can inquire at &#39;the Attorney-General&#39;s Department, and if he thinks that any one of them should not continue in force he can give immediate notice to move to disallow it. Such a motion will take precedence over all Government business. I suggest that this is a reasonable course for the honorable senator to follow. </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me that no regulation can continue in force when the Act under which it has been framed has been repealed. I do not feel inclined to leave this great reserve of power in such an indefinite form. The Minister should have been able to tell the Committee exactly what are the various extensions of powers the Government seek. Instead of that, he asks me to inquire at the. Attorney-General&#39;s Department after the Bill is passed and this power is given by Parliament. I think that the tame for information is here and now, and that we should define the powers we propose to repose in the Government. </para>

A &#39; minimum of seven and a half months is  sufficient time to enable the Ministry to consider the whole position and bring down legislation- to take the place of any regulation which gives them power which they wish to have extended for an indefinite period. Consequently I press the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- It would not have that effect. In so far as regulations may be  construable  as conditions of contract, they may persist in validity, but it seems to me that ordinary regulations promulgated by virtue of an Act which I believe to be unconstitutional must be in themselves unconstitutional. Therefore the whole of clause 3 is not soundly based. But when we deal with the second portion of the clause we find that there is an attempt to give vitality and validity to regulations that have been promulgated&#39; under an&#34; extended Act, which even in regard to its extension has expired. Unless it can be shown that these regulations are vitally and legally  construable  as conditions of contract, they are invalid when the Act itself has expired. If the law says otherwise, I do not know the law. </para>

The law, if properly understood, is nearly always consistent in communities such as this, but to my mind here are inconsistency and invalidity piled upon inconsistency and invalidity. With the reservation I have made, I do not think any part of clause 3 is really valid. I do not believe the extended period sought by the operation of this measure in constitutionally valid, and I shall therefore have no hesitation in voting for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten&#39;s</inline> amendment, because I consider the whole clause to be operative only under an Act which is in itself invalid. </para>

But I question whether they would have validity, as they are founded on the Act. After the Act ceases to operate, it seems, <inline font-style="italic">ipso facto,</inline> that the regulations lapse. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> drew a contrast between a regulation as such and regulations which might be construed to be part of the conditions of a contract. In the latter case all the validity they would have, if any, would be their validity, not as regulations, but as conditions of contract. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pratten</inline> is entitled to a clearer indication from the Minister of the nature of the particular regulations to which it is proposed to give extended life.

                        <para>- Possibly they would not be all. I do not believe that many of the officials administering these regulations have more than a nodding acquaintance with them. Otherwise the Government would have been able to give &#60;5oth Houses long before this exact details, showing which they wanted to retain, and which could be put out of existence at once. Every honorable senator then could have compared the Government statement with the regulations in the books. I do not believe the Government can do that. I do not blame Ministers for it, because, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator. Pratten</inline> said, no man could carry them all in his head. I believe few of the officials know much about them. On the other hand, some of the men who administer regulations are simply saturated with information. </para>

                    <para>. - Two instances in which this provision &#39;operates have been brought under my notice. One is the active service moratorium regulation, &#39; which provides that the time for any payment of principal money secured by any mortgage, or due under an agreement of purchase, contracted by a soldier or his female dependant before he became a member of the Australian Imperial Force, or before the 1st January, 1916, shall be postponed until &#34; six months after the cessation of the present state of war, and not earlier.&#34; Surely it is desirable that that should be continued. The other relates to enemy shareholders, and gives power to the public trustees to hold enemy shares for twelve months after the end of the war. </para>

                    <para>. - The provisions of this clause are inconsistent with an opinion expressed by the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> in his reply to the second-reading debate. I understood him then to say that an Imperial proclamation of peace would apply throughout the Empire in matters relating to foreign policy, and that for the purposes of war if a proclamation were issued in Great Britain it would have effective application in Australia. If that is so, this clause seems to be aiming at something at total variance with . that statement. Basing an assertion on the honorable senator&#39;s statement, then despite the issue of an Imperial proclamation of peace the Australian Government could, under this clause, set about the preparation of something which would lead to the continuance of war. The interpretation given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> to the application of a proclamation was not, in my opinion, very involved, and I have come to the conclusion, after listening to the debate, that this amending Bill overlaps the principal Act. If it does, then we shall have confusion worse confounded. I wish to know from the Minister whether, despite the issue of an Imperial proclamation relating to peace, preparations could be continued in Australia for treating individuals as enemy subjects. Once peace is declared in Great Britain on behalf of the Empire, then, in the Minister&#39;s words, &#34;Who shall be our enemies&#34;? </para>

                <para>I am reminded of the story of a Roumanian who, when, about to leave New York for his own country, said that he had been recalled to the colours, and that he was going home to fight &#34; the enemy.&#34; When questioned as to who &#34; the enemy&#34; was, his reply was, &#34;I do not know; but by the time I reach Roumania my country will have found for us an enemy to fight.&#34; We are providing in this clause for the internment of enemy&#39; aliens for perhaps twelve months after Great Britain has proclaimed a state of peace. It has been conclusively shown by honorable senators that our proclamation will not come i&#171;to operation . automatically under the original Act, but that action must be taken by the Governor-General upon the advice of his advisers - the Government of the day. I ask the Minister for Defence if an Imperial proclamation is issued declaring a state of peace to exist, will Australia be bound, by it ? He said that Australia was an integral part of the Empire. That being so, would such a proclamation be binding on Australia as an integral part of the Empire, and, if so, what becomes of the&#34; proposal contained in this clause? </para>

                    <para>. - How does the Minister reconcile the position set up by clause 4 with that which he has already taken up? It is proposed by this clause to treat as &#34; enemies &#34; &#34; alien enemies &#34; and &#34; persons having enemy associations or connexions,&#34; such persons as could be so treated during the actual stages of the war. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was most emphatic in attempting to deal with the position which I put up, and he declared that  an  Imperial proclamation of peace would at once establish a state of peace for the whole Empire. I agree with him. It would certainly establish it so far as our external relations are concerned. Of course, it may be argued that this clause is intended to apply chiefly to our internal relations. In one breath, the Minister says that the issue of the Imperial proclamation in  regard  to peace will terminate the state of war which exists in Australia; and yet, in this clause he asks us to permit the Government, after the war, to treat our &#34; alien enemies&#34; as enemies, and also to regard as our enemies &#34;persons having enemy associations or connexions.&#34; We are dealing, therefore, with a very important matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has, perhaps, properly taken exception to the opening remark of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ferricks,</inline> to the effect that he did not trust the Government. But I would remind the honorable gentleman that he has had some experience under the principal Act, and that I have had no occasion to call into question the exercise of his discretion under the extended extraordinary powers that have been conferred upon him. But it is now proposed that the operation of the War Precautions Act shall continue until July next. Suppose that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> goes to London next month, and that somebody else takes his place. Shall we be able to repose the same confidence in his successor&#39;s capacity to deal with these important powers?  I  think it is desirable that the Minister should inform the Committee of what is intended to be accomplished by the clause, and what is the justification  for  it. </para>

That is the explanation of why the words to which attention  has  been drawn  have  been inserted. </para>

I am certain, from the debates . which have taken place upon this Bill, that few honorable members have taken the trouble 4o look up the principal Act, and that few, if any, are aware that the words to which I have directed attention have a special interpretation. The clause which we have just passed contains the words &#34; during the continuance of the present war.&#34; Clause 2, on the other hand, refers to the &#34; state of war.&#34; I ask the Minister &#39;to consent to the insertion after the word &#34; war &#34; in the second paragraph of the preamble, of the words &#34; as in the said Act defined.&#34; </para>

                        <para>. - During the second-reading debate some excellent speeches were delivered by senators on the Government side, and it would have strengthened the conviction of those who believed that the Bill should pass through all its stages to-night if even one senator, other than the Minister for Defence, had risen to state the reason why he believed the Bill should be agreed to. It surprised me, that out of twenty-four members on the Government side there was not one honorable senator prepared to rise in support of the Bill, with the exception of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn,</inline> who spoke very briefly. In those circumstances, the Bill should not be rushed through the third-reading stage in this manner. The principal Act will continue for a considerable time to come, and, although the Standing Orders have been suspended to enable the Bill to pass through all its stages without delay, the Government are in too great a hurry in asking the Senate to agree to the third reading to-night. If the third reading were delayed until the next sitting possibly improvements in the measure might be suggested.

                        <para>. - I wish to record&#39; my final protest against the passage of this measure because I honestly and sincerely believe, in the absence of contrary judicial interpretations, that the measure, in so far as it projects its operations into the peace period by virtue of the exercise of a war power, is beyond the competency of this Parliament, and, therefore, is unconstitutional. That being so, I, as a Federalist, cannot consent to the straining of the Constitution as a matter of expediency, particularly when the application is sought to be made during thy peace  period  to the measure passing through the Chamber to-night. When there exists ample opportunity for consultation between the Commonwealth Administration and the Administrations of the various States to remove the difficulties which, perhaps, may require to be removed in connexion with various matters, I cannot even impliedly condone any legislation passed by this Parliament by a straining of the provisions of the Constitution, which is so precious in its Federal character to the different States which compose the Commonwealth, and are sovereign in respect of the powers that have been reserved to them. I do not intend to delay the third reading, or to challenge the measure. I have risen merely to make my protest. I do not say that the War Precautions Act is one that should not be placed on the statute-book. </para>

It is a measure which we should , have on the statute-book during the continuance of a state of war, but it does not at all follow that that measure is necessary for the ensuing time of peace, and- I certainly advance the opinion that it is outside our constitutional competency to endeavour to prolong the validity and vitality of the Act in the way we are doing. </para>

                        <para>. - I join in the protest by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> against the passage of this Bill - not because I do not think it necessary to continue the War Precautions Act until peace comes, but because I think that the Government are making an unwise- and premature attempt , to continue the patchwork of legislation which has caused much dissatisfaction. The business community will be extremely disappointed that we have not fixed a more definite limit to the War Precautions powers. Any honorable senator who has conscientiously . and honestly opposed the Bill during yesterday and to-day will have no need to regret his action; and I venture to surmise, and even forecast, that within a very few months further amending legislation will be required, and we shall regret that we did not delay until international conditions -had further developed themselves the -legislation which is now before the Senate. I protest against the Bill going through in its present form. I hope that it will do no harm, but I cannot see that it can do any good, having regard to the fact that the. Government already possess, and will continue to possess, all the power they need for the few months yet to intervene before the international position clears. That would have given more time to further consider the matters than they have had up to the present. </para>
