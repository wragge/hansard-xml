                        <para>- I ask the Minister for Defence if he is in a position to farther explain his answer to a question I put yesterday? He told me that the practice in the Defence Department was to call for applications for appointments, hut immediately afterwards he said that a senior man had been appointed without applications having been called for. Is the rule abrogated when a senior man is appointed ? </para>

(8) Will the Government give attention during recess to the question of making wireless the monopoly of the Commonwealth similar to the telegraph and telephone systems? (9) Will the Government take into consideration the agreement between the Marconi, Telefunken, and Amalgamated Wireless Companies with private ships, and if they are found to be unreasonable and exorbitant, will the Government introduce legislation to cancel all such agreements? </para>

                        <para>- In view of the present position with regard to the sittings of the Senate, I presume that the honorable senator desires that a reply to his questions shall be furnished before we reassemble. If that be so, and he will provide me with a copy of his questions, I shall see that they are placed before the Minister concerned, and will endeavour to have a reply forwarded to him later. It is evident that there must be a little delay in connexion with the replies to some of the questions, which call for Cabinet consideration. </para>

I gave instructions recently that a copy of these papers should be obtained in order to inform Parliament as to the steps &#39;taken in connexion with this matter. When the papers were brought to me yesterday afternoon, I discovered a discrepancy between a cable and ,a later communication. Certain valuations were cabled for from America, and other particulars regarding the plant and&#34; injunction generally. One of these cables from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Vaughan</inline> gave the valuation of a certain plant at $4,000. In the letter which went on to the Board of Trade, and which, of course, covered all the papers in connexon  with the matter, the figure of $4,000 became $40,000.

                        <para>- I saw the paragraph which the honorable senator refers to, and read it with some surprise, because only the day before it appeared we had received a cable from the military authorities in Egypt as to the disposal of these horses, and no suggestion was made in that cable that they should be shot, whilst other suggestions were made for their disposal. I may inform the Senate that the return of the horses to Australia is impossible, owing to the close quarantine of animals. Honorable senators are no doubt aware that some of the countries adjacent to Egypt aTe the homes of almost every kind of animal disease. I have no information that the order referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bolton</inline> has been issued, and no means of checking the correctness of the statement other than the fact that, as I have said in the cable received regarding the .disposal of the horses, no mention of shooting them is made. I am inclined, therefore, to think that the press cable is not correct. </para>

                            I propose to continue this debate. We cannot claim that we have not had time to consider the Bill, because there are only three or four clauses in it, and its purport is quite clear. But the Government have by no means made out a good case for establishing in this particular instance a pension provision, which has been emphatically condemned on previous occasions by the Federal Parliament. When the Judiciary Bill was introduced in 1903, by the then Attorney-General
                            <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Deakin),</inline>
                            it contained a provision for pensions for the Judges, on a scale based on length of service, rising from two-tenths for a certain number of years up to seven-tenths for fifteen years&#39; service. The questions of the position of the Judges and their salaries, and the desirableness or otherwise of giving them pensions, were then discussed in all their bearings. We are often told that that Parliament contained all the. wisdom of the Commonwealth, and that the calibre of its members was much superior to that of any succeeding Parliament, and that body, by a majority of twenty-nine votes to twenty, struck out the pension provision. During the debate comparisons were made between the salaries proposed to be paid, which are those being now paid, and those obtaining in the States, and in other countries. It is surprising to learn that in the Dominion of Canada, the salaries of the Judges of the Supreme Court are only about half of what we are paying, while in .the great Republic of the United States of America, with its population of 100,000,000 - probably it was about 80,000,000 or 90,000,000 then- the salary of a Supreme Court Judge is only &#163;2,100 per year. I am not arguing that the salaries we pay our Judges are too high. If anything, in comparison with the salaries paid to State Judges in Australia, a good argument could be put up to show that they are too low. If that is the difficulty, the remedy is to increase the salaries of the High Court Judges. I believe such a proposal would obtain considerable support from members of both Houses, but that is no justification for introducing this pernicious system, which has already been condemned, of pensions for public servants.

                <para>I am strongly against the principle of pensions, except in well-defined cases. Everybody agrees that the soldier who has been disabled in the service of hi3 country should be provided for, and we have also established the principle, which I think is a good one, that where that ill-matched pair, age and want, come together, it is the duty of the community to provide, perhaps, not adequate support, but at least some amount in necessitous cases. With those two exceptions, our Commonwealth should be kept free from the system of pensions. But here we are asked to indorse the principle for the highest paid official of the Commonwealth, with the exception of the Governor-General, who can hardly be called an official. This special provision is made for the Chief Justice, while certainly more necessitous cases are left altogether unprovided for or are inadequately provided for. We all know the extreme difficulty we have had in this and another branch of the Legislature to induce the Government to make provision for the dependants of soldiers. I remember that last year, when the first Repatriation Bill was before this Chamber, we had a big fight with the Leader of the Senate over a proposal to allow the benefits of that scheme to be applied to the widows of soldiers. </para>

When we find that difficulty in applying the pension principle in such cases as those, although we are all agreed that it is proper to apply it there, and when we find that even at the present time there is the greatest difficulty in getting an extension of these pensions to returned soldiers and their dependants, it comes with rather a bad grace from the Government to propose a pension of &#163;1,750 per annum to the highest paid official in the Commonwealth, who is receiving a salary of &#163;3,500 per year. I notice that complaints have just been made in another State of the inadequate provision made for wounded soldiers and their dependants. According to this morning&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> one man with both legs off is getting 30s. a week, and 12s. a week provided by the Repatriation Department, while a man totally unable to work is getting 7s. 6d. a week, and a man totally blind is receiving 40s. per week. There are scores of other instances where the greatest difficulty is experienced in inducing the Government to give these paltry allowances. </para>

That is a supposed right which has been flagrantly violated in connexion with the Postal Department, not by this Government, but by previous Governments. The public servants thought when Federation was brought about that that section absolutely secured them in all the rights, privileges and emoluments which they enjoyed under the State laws. It is notorious that in the Postal Department in South Australia, - at any rate, quite a number of postal officials were, on transfer to the Commonwealth,- reduced in some cases to the extent of &#163;130 per year. The Minister knows that to be a fact, and a list has been published, giving the salaries and perquisites they enjoyed from the State, and the reduced amounts they received from the Commonwealth. Some technical point by the High Court has deprived them of those rights. Various Governments have promised to consider the question, but nothing has been done, and those men, or. in many cases, their widows, are still suffering under that disability. </para>

                    Lt.-Colonel O&#39;LOGHLIN.That is not the point under discussion. The question is whether certain public servants were deprived of what the spirit of the Constitution intended them to have. By no stretch of imagination can the present Chief Justice of Australia be  called a transferred officer. The position was not in existence when the Commonwealth was inaugurated. He was not transferred. He was quite free to take the position or not when it was offered to him. and his acceptance of it was entirely voluntary. This attempt to put him in the position of a transferred officer, and to argue that, therefore, he is entitled to the pension which he would have received as a transferred officer under the provisions of the Constitution, has no force whatever. When the proposal was debated in the first Parliament, and struck out by a majority of twenty-nine votes to twenty, amongst those who opposed it were two members of the present Ministry. The Minister for the Navy
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline>
                    not only opposed the payment of a pension, but proposed to reduce the salary allotted for the Chief Justice from &#163;3,500 to &#163;2,500 per year, which he said was ample for the position .. I think it was
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mauger</inline>
                    who proposed to strike out the pension clause. Among those who voted against the granting of pensions was one of the present Justices of the High Court - I refer to
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline>
                    Isaacs. On the other hand,
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Higgins,</inline>
                    who is also a Justice of the High Court, voted for the proposal, as did
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline>
                    Barton, who, being a member of the Ministry at the time, was naturally one of its supporters.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Poynton,</inline>
                    another member of the present Government, also opposed the principle. The division which took place was entirely upon non-party lines. That is shown by the fact that amongst those who supported the proposal were two members of the Labour party, one ex-Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, and the other, the present Prime Minister, the Right Honorable W. M. Hughes. But a majority of the Labour party, including its present leader
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tudor),</inline>
                    voted against the granting of pensions. Since then the number of High Court Judges has been increased from three to seven, and in looking through the records of those days one cannot help remarking how the old estimate of the cost of Federation has been increased from a few thousands of pounds to some  millions.

                    O&#39;LOGHLIN.No doubt it was absurd. It has been urged that it would be a calamity if a man occupying the distinguished and onerous position of a Justice of the High Court should attain a state of senility and still hold on to his office. But the remedy for that state &#34;of affairs - and I see no reason why it should not be applied - is to insist upon the occupants of the Judicial Bench retiring, just as do other public servants, when they reach the age limit. There is far more reason why that limit should operate in the case of Judges than in the case of other public servants. If, for example, the head of a Department gets into a doddering condition, and is unable to discharge his duties with the energy and ability of a younger man, his Department is invariably carried on by some of -his subordinates, so that nobody suffers to any great extent. But if a Judge develops a condition of senile decay, he cannot transfer his duties to anybody else, and there is thus the gravest danger to the lives and liberties of the people of the Commonwealth. Consequently, if there is to be a retiring age at all, it should apply to all Judges.

                        <para>.- It has also been said - and very properly - that a Judge should be entirely independent of political influence. But if the principle which we are now asked to recognise is to be regarded as a precedent, it will undoubtedly tend to sap the independence of the Judicial Bench. If the Justices of the High Court are to understand that their right to receive a pension upon their retirement will depend upon the favour of the Ministry of the day, it will unquestionably have a tendency to sap their independence by inducing them to try to please Ministers. Consequently, if we are to sanction the payment of pensions at all, they should be extended to the whole of the Judicial Bench, in which case there would not be so much objection to the system. I repeat that if this Bill be passed, there will be a tendency on the part of our Judges to consider that it is very desirable that they should placate the Ministry of the day, in order that, upon their retirement, pensions should be provided for them. </para>

                        <para>. - I regret that I cannot support the proposal of the Government. But before stating my objections to it I wish to say that, although I do not profess to know sufficient about law to decide whether or not the present Chief Justice of the High Court has been a great lawyer and a great Judge, since his appointment to the distinguished office which he fills, I, in common with many other honorable senators, have heard numerous opinions of him expressed by leading barristers, who have all agreed that he is a brilliant lawyer and Judge. So that whatever objection I may entertain to the granting of a pension to him is not prompted by any suggestion that he has failed to discharge his duties efficiently, because I believe that he has discharged them with conspicuous ability. I happened to be a member of the other branch of the Legislature when the Bill dealing with the question of the salaries to be paid to the Justices of the High Court was introduced. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Loghlin</inline> has pointed out, the House of Representatives decided that no pension - should be granted to those Justices, and that decision was indorsed by the Senate. The first Federal Parliament laid down the great principle that no pensions should be granted to civil servants. That determination was arrived at a number of years ago, but nothing has since occurred to make me waver in the attitude which I then took up, in common with the majority of the members of this Parliament. If we grant this pension to the Chief Justice of the High Court, we cannot logically withhold pensions from other civil servants, for the Chief Justice, after all, is but a civil servant, able and distinguished though he be. One argument which has been used in favour of the granting of pensions to Judges is that, when barristers give up their profession in order to accept positions on the Judicial Bench, they make very great monetary sacrifices. There are some persons who would have us believe that, as a rule, barristers forego, for the sake of their country, enormous fees in comparison with which the salary of a Judge is a mere pittance - that, prompted solely by patriotic ideals, these legal luminaries &#34; scorn delights and live laborious days &#34; as Judges. That idea is a delusion, a snare, and a big bluff. In this connexion I was rather interested in reading the official report of a debate which took place in the New South Wales Parliament many years ago, at a time when the present Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> was a member of that Parliament.

He spoke of barristers at the head of their profession in New South Wales who enjoyed incomes of from ?6,000 to ?8,000, and even ?9,500. I quite admit that if there are barristers in our midst who are earning so much in fees, they would have to make a great sacrifice in order to accept a position on the Judicial Bench at a salary of ?2,000, or even ?3,500. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crick</inline> then said - </para>

At that time- his fees would not amount to much above ?4,000 per annum. He gave up his practice to become a Judge in this State at a salary of ?2,700. It should not be overlooked that pensions are granted in Victoria. It must be remembered, however, that every Judge does not necessarily receive a pension. A certain amount of money is allocated for pensions, and the sum has to be pooled. If there are a number of Judges already on the retired list, it is possible that another, upon, retiring, would not secure a pension. </para>

                    <para>The sacrifices which our leading barristers make by accepting positions on the Bench  are not what some people would have us believe. </para>
                    <para>In moving the second reading of the Bill the Minister Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> advanced the argument that, had <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith remained on the Queensland State Bench he would have Been entitled to a pension; and, that by accepting the Commonwealth High Court Judgeship, he had had to sacrifice that pension. Therefore, he contended, we would be doing no more than justice by granting a pension equal to what <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> had foregone in Queensland. If that be the case, the same applies to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Rich, for the reason that, being a Judge in the State of New South Wales, he was entitled to a pension. But <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith accepted the transfer with his eyes open. There was no compulsion. He was not a transferred civil servant. </para>
                    <para>The point which has already been stressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Loghlin</inline> is really the most important feature of the proposal. The honorable senator rightly stated that it is a dangerous precedent to pay a Judge anything over and above what was granted to him upon his appointment. The effect might be that a Judge would seek to curry favour with the# powers that be. Some years ago, I was talking with a distinguished barrister, and I remarked that I bad often thought it hard that a barrister might be appointed as a puisne Judge, and that, at a later stage, the Chief Justiceship might become vacant. In such circumstances, a barrister - junior in his profession to the puisne Judge - would probably be promoted over the head of the latter. I added that I should have thought that an individual who had been chosen as a Judge would, on account of the experience thus gained, have proved the more suitable occupant  of  the position of Chief Justice. The barrister replied that such a promotion would never do, because once a Judge had been appointed under our present system, he had no right to look for further advancement. That, is a sound principle, because if a Judge accepted, an appointment with the idea that he might later gain promotion, there might be a tendency to seek favour from those in authority. It appears to me then, to be a dangerous precedent to appoint a Judge on a fixed salary, and with no promise of a pension, and afterwards to grant a pension. There was no secret understanding, in the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith that he would get a pension. The Federal Parliament has laid down the principle that civil servants shall not be entitled to pensions. I will vote against the Bill. </para>

                        <para>.- I oppose thi3 Bill. I remember reading some years ago the history of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith in the Queensland. Parliament, and I recall his subsequent appointment to the High Court Bench of Australia. Though I have not been brought into contact with him, I have been led to conclude that he is a man of very great ability, and that he has performed his duties with satisfaction to the community. But his remuneration has been handsome in comparison with the salaries received by occupants of similar positions in other British communities. I have no objection to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith receiving a fair salary; and, if the occupant of a Judgeship were not being paid what seemed to me an adequate sum, I would not hesitate to support an increase. T agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Loghlin</inline> that it is extremely unwise to introduce the pension system into the Commonwealth Civil Service. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith may not be regarded as a civil servant, but he is a servant of the Commonwealth, and we should remember that many years ago Parliament laid down the principle that there should be&#39; no pensions for civil servants. It strikes me as extremely unfair to propose paying a pension to a high-salaried official, while others in the Service - people who have served the Commonwealth quite as faithfully - have no hope of a pension.  The introduction of this principle will cause a great deal of dissatisfaction, especially to civil servants in receipt of salaries from &#163;200 to &#163;300 per year, because of the fact that they have no right to expect similar privileges. It is well known that when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel&#39;</inline> Griffith was Premier of Queensland he introduced a Bill to increase a salary of the Chief Justice of that </para>

Subsequently, when the position of the Chief Justice of the Commonwealth was created, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> sought and obtained it. He took that course of action with his eyes open, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> has said, because it was definitely stated at the time that the position would carry no pension rights. </para>
                    <para>I have no doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel.</inline> Griffith has done his work very well. So have hundreds of others in the community, who have little hope of a pension when they retire. Already, many persons are beginning to complain. I have in mind a gentleman, a leading official in the Customs Department, whose time for retirement will come shortly. He was formerly a servant of the State, and, like <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith, came over to the Commonwealth Service. He is going to get very little when he retires. The man who is working for 6s. or 7s. a day - and I know a lot of men who get this wage - has no hope of any relief except the old-age pension. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Of course, they may get a ration with the wage, but that is all the money they receive. A few years ago a large landed proprietor told me he never gave more than 12s. a week to his employees, and I know of one employer who called one of his men &#34; Faithful John &#34; because he would work for sixteen hours a day, and was always ready to do anything that- was asked of him. When at last that man lost a little of his vigour, his employer said to him, &#34; John, don&#39;t you think it is time you applied for the old-age pension?&#34; .He wanted then to get rid of &#34; Faithful John,&#34; who had always been so willing to work and do things which other men did not care to do. The old man came to me, and I was instrumental in securing the old-age pension for him. Line repairers - men who are out all day and in all weathers - get no pension when they retire, and, generally speaking, right throughout the community the men who produce the wealth can only look forward to the old-age pension. </para>

                            <para>- I know that; but the people outside do not look at these matters in that way. They think that provision should be made to meet these cases. The officials of the, Pensions Department are sympathetic, and&#39; also hold the same opinion. I know of a woman in a delicate state of health whose stepson was killed before he went to the Front. He was not giving her very much, but during his absence his father died, and the woman who was left with some young children was unable to get any pension, because she was only the stepmother of the soldier boy who had been killed. These things, when they become known, touch the hearts of the community, and naturally people will be up in arms at the proposal to pay this pension to the Chief Justice. </para>

                    <para>I believe that in what I am trying to say I am expressing the view, not only of 1 Labour supporters throughout the Commonwealth, but also of a large number of people who do not support Labour. They do not want this system introduced into the Commonwealth Service. I say that if a man in receipt of &#163;3,500 a year for .a long period cannot make provision for his old age, it is very largely his own fault. If a man getting &#163;4 a week makes no provision for his old age, the bulk of the community express the opinion that it serves him right for having spent his money instead of having put something by for his old age. If it is right in one case to pay a pension, it is right in other cases. Thousands of people are eking out an existence on a miserable remuneration without any hope of relief, except the old-age pension. I suppose the Ministerial party have come to a decision in this matter, and that there is not much hope of the Bill being rejected; but I trust it will not be taken further. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith has no doubt been a good servant, and I sympathize with him in his infirmity; but that is no reason why we should introduce the pension system into the Commonwealth Service, and apply it all round. If we do not apply it all round in an equitable way, we shall be doing something that is unfair. I express in these words my strongest opposition to the measure. </para>

                        <para>. - I must protest against the proposed pension being granted to this man. It was laid down at the inception of the Federal Parliament that no pensions should be paid to the Judges of the High Court. I remember that in the debates of the Federal Convention it was contended that the system of pensions prevailing in the States should not be grafted on to the Federal Service. Honorable senators are aware that it was provided in connexion with the Public Service that, in lieu of the pensions to which many public servants were entitled in the State Services, they should be compelled to insure so that they might provide their own pensions. I remember that the same principle was applied to the police in Victoria, and it was decided that those appointed after a certain time would have to make provision for themselves when they had arrived at the age for retirement. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>It cannot be said that by refusing the proposed pension, we should be doing any. injustice to the man who has held the important office of Chief Justice of the High Court, because he has received an adequate salary for his services. This Parliament undertook to provide an adequate salary, so that the occupant of the position might be able to provide for himself when he arrived at the retiring age. Why should not pensions be paid to members of Parliament if it is right to pay a pension in this case? The argument in the case of members of Parliament is that they are paid adequate salaries, and are therefore entitled to no remuneration on their retirement, which may be forced upon them by people outside. Why should not members of this Parliament be entitled to some remuneration when they retire, in respect of the services they have rendered to the country? I have been a public man for thirty years, and when I die I shall leave very little behind me for those who may be dependent on me. If at the end of my term as a member of the&#39; Senate, I am shouldered out into a cold and cruel world, what sympathy do honorable senators think I will get. The friends I have helped, and those for whom I have worked for over a quarter of a century, will, if I should complain, turn round and say, &#34; You were damn well paid, and should have made provision for your own old age.&#34; </para>

                            <para>- I believe that is so; but that is the kind of thing that would be said to me. Honorable senators are aware that every member of Parliament is called upon to make many contributions which are not demanded from other people, and he has comparatively little of his salary left for himself. Here is a man who has been receiving &#163;3,500 a year, and has drawn from the public &#163;80,000 for the services that he has rendered the country. Yet we find the party in power in this Parliament are prepared to give him a pension of &#163;1,750 a year to retire upon, so that he will have no cause to fear want in his old age. We were told that the present was a Win-the-war Government, and an economy Government. They were supposed to economize in public expenditure, and yet they do not hesitate to submit such a proposal as is contained in this Bill. </para>

                    <para>It would be better to provide pensions for all public servants than to adopt this method of providing for a special case. I have rendered services in my small way, probably equal to the services rendered by this man ; but they will not be rewarded in the same way. The general body of public servants are not to be provided for in this way, because it is contended that they are paid adequately for their services and should make their own provision for old-age. It seems to be assumed that this man, who has received a salary of &#163;3,500 per year, and has drawn altogether &#163;80,000 from the community, could not have made any provision for the time when old-age creeps upon him. In his case a grateful country is supposed to say, &#34; You have certainly been paid an adequate salary for your services. We have paid you &#163;80,000 for those services, but will you kindly take a pension of &#163;1,750 a year. We think that you ought to be properly provided for. We do not desire that the wolf should knock at your door, or that you should suffer the pangs of hunger.&#34; It is a strange world we live in, and one of the strangest things in it is that it is the fat- pig that gets the most grease. I remember the protests that were made against the establishment of old-age pensions, and the difficulty we had to convince people that they should be paid. Personally, I should like the old-age pension proposed under this Bill, and many people outside I know would be glad to accept it. This Parliament provided the Chief Justice of the High Court with a salary sufficient to enable him to provide for his old age, and did so on the distinct understanding that he would not be entitled to a pension. </para>
                    <para>There is another very serious phase of this question which requires to be considered. We see that the benches on the Government side are practically empty, but when the whip is cracked and a vote is taken on this Bill it will be carried by a vote recorded on party lines. That means, if it means anything at all, that a Judge of the High Court is dependent upon a political party for a pension. Public opinion concerning the present Government is undergoing a change, as has been indicated by the result of the Corangamite election, and in the course of time a different Government will take their place. The members of that Government may, in the case of a Judge of the High Court reaching the retiring age, say to him, &#34; You have had a royal time. You have been in receipt of an adequate salary, and could have made provision for your old age. We do not propose to give you a pension.&#34; It is not proposed in this Bill that pensions shall be paid to all Judges of the High Court, but to a single individual, and so the other Judges apparently are to be left dependent upon the view taken concerning them by the political party that may happen to be in power when the time comes for their retirement from the Bench. That is unfair and unjust to them. If a pension is to be paid to one, all should be entitled to similar treatment. </para>
                    <para>When twenty-four or twenty-five years ago I was advocating the payment of pensions to our aged people, I was told that to establish a system of old-age pensions would undermine thrift. It was suggested that if such pensions were granted, men who at that time were getting 4s. 6d. and 5s. per day would not be encouraged to be thrifty. Here is a man who has been receiving &#163;3,500 a year, and apparently it will not in his case undermine thrift if he is given a pension. Under the proposal submitted by the Government it would appear that there is to be favoritism, selection, and preference in the payment of pensions to Judges of the High Court. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins, for instance, comes to retire there may be a political party in power that will take an entirely different view of his case. The Government then may say, &#34; You were adequately paid, and we do not think you are entitled to a pension.&#34; This is a vicious procedure to adopt because of its possible party aspect, and it is objectionable also on the ground that if it is right that a Judge of the High Court should be paid a pension, then the Administrator of the Northern Territory and other public servants holding high positions should be treated in the same way. In fact, all in high positions in the service of the Commonwealth should be entitled to exactly the same con.sideration on arriving at the retiring age; otherwise it is unjust. If this Bill is passed, the other Judges will expect the same  treatment when they retire, but there may be a change of Government, and a retiring Judge may be disappointed. </para>

                            <para>- I protest against this political patronage being conferred on Judges or any one else. If this pension is to be granted, the Government should take into consideration the question of pensions to members of Parliament when they are forcibly retired from public life. I am an old man now, and when my time comes to be retired into private life I shall not have provided for my old age, and may have to knock at the door of the Pensions Office to ask for an old-age pension. I cannot get from a grateful, or ungrateful, country a pension of &#163;200; or even &#163;100, let alone &#163;1,750 per annum. Look outside to the thousands of men and women who are struggling under conditions altogether different from those which this man has experienced, and who have never had the opportunity to provide for a rainy day. When I first had to struggle for my living under conditions that I should not like to detail to the Senate, I was told that I must provide for a rainy day. It has been raining every day with me ever since, and it has rained continuously for many other people. </para>

                        <para>. - I enter my protest against the indiscriminate granting of pensions to public servants, no matter how high they are in rank. When I was supporting a Government on the other side, I always opposed anything of this description, and while I am here I always shall. A man enters the Public Service of the Commonwealth with the full knowledge of what it means to him, and what the conditions will be when he retires. It is not fair or just that when he is about to retire the Government should bring down a Bill to specialize in his case -for a pension or retiring allowance. I do not propose to compare the recipient of this pension with a returned soldier or anybody else. It is the principle I oppose, as I always have done. Persons in these high positions in the Public Service receive sufficient to protect themselves from want when they have to retire. When this gentleman left the State Service he knew where he was going. He could estimate roughly how many years of life remained to him, and he should have made provision during his working years for himself and those dependent on him. Since the very inauguration of Federation the principle has been laid down that the Commonwealth must be free from that incubus of pensions to public servants which the States have always borne. If we are to have pensions for public servants generally, let us know it. I cannot say that I would very strongly oppose a scheme by which men during the time &#39; of their service contributed a certain amount of their salary, and their employer - the Commonwealth - augmented the fund, to provide pensions for them when they retired. But under present conditions! they know full well when they enter the Service that they have to provide for themselves. If the salary is not sufficient for them to do so, let us give them more. I was sent here specially to help to discontinue the system by which the States have had for many years to provide large pensions funds for public servants. In New South Wales I have Been public servants retire at a very early age, when they were quite capable of giving years of good service. Those who walk in the same paths of life as I do, know full well that during their working years they have to save from their scanty earnings sufficient to keep them in their old age from the asylums of the State. There is no superannuation or pension for them. They are the hard-working members of the community who produce the wealth. That is the principle upon which the foundations of this Commonwealth were laid - the principle that public servants must  stand alone, and not rely on the charity of the Commonwealth when their time comes to retire. I have always opposed measures of this description from the highest to the lowest, and so long as I am here I shall continue to do so.  </para>

                        <para>. - In the vernacular, this Bill is an effort to &#34;grease the fatted pig.&#34; It is one of the most impudent proposals that the Government have yet submitted to the Senate. If it were a general proposal it would not be entertained for a moment. I disagree entirely with those who say that it would be a good thing to have a general Federal scheme of pensions subscribed to by those in the Public Service, and supplemented by the Commonwealth, unless at the same time an equally satisfactory scheme is made applicable to those who are not inside the charmed circle. Those who have permanent positions should not be continually trying to aggrandise themselves at the expense of the unfortunate small wage earners outside. In New South Wales we had the greatest possible difficulty in getting the local farmers to agree to a general scheme of old-age pensions, not of &#163;5 per day-- </para>

                            <para>- Yes, the pension was going to sap the moral fibre of the workers. Their backbone was to fizzle out, and they would not be able to stand up. We were always told that we ought to stand on our own resources, to make provision for the rainy day, and not- to rely upon the State for a pauper dole. Many things might be said against even a general scheme of old-age pensions, but the weight of argument is certainly on the side of those who favour a scheme of old-age pensions to be paid from the Consolidated Revenue, and to apply to all citizens alike. At the present time the old-age pension fund is being administered by the Commonwealth, and the payments from it run into between &#163;3,000.000 and &#163;4,000,000 per annum. Invalid pensions, also amount - to a substantial sum every year, but this Bill is an effort to make special provision for one man. I do not know how long the present Government may be in office, but if ever I have an opportunity, I shall certainly make one to repeal this measure. Why should the Commonwealth be called upon to pay a pension of this kind, and when I say &#34; the Commonwealth,&#34; I mean the men and women who constitute the nation? It is a humiliating, disgraceful fact that the Commonwealth Administration is raking up coppers from the whole community at every possible point, largely from the poorer sections, to give this money to a man who has been drawing at least &#163;10 per day, not for one day or one month, but during a long period of years. What an impudent proposal it is to levy a tax upon the whole community year after year in order to provide an annual pension, contribution, or dole to a- man who has been getting so substantial a salary for so long a period ! If such a proposition were submitted to a vote of the electors, not one man on the other side would be returned who made it a vital plank of his platform. He dare not do it; and honorable senators opposite support it only because their party happens to be temporarily in office, and they think they can get it through. There are tens of thousands of people in this country who do not average an income of &#163;3 per week. The Chief Justice of the High Court, however, has for many years been receiving far more than that amount per day. Yet it is now proposed to give him a pension which represents daily very considerably more than the average weekly earnings of the workers of this country. A pension of &#163;1,750 a year is equivalent to more than &#163;5 per day. That is a proposal which ought not to be entertained for a moment. There is no justification for it. If a man expends his money f  foolishly,  that is his affair. I do not know the Chief Justice, and I do not know whether he has been unfortunate in his speculations, or otherwise. That is not my business, nor is it the business of this Parliament. But I do know that he hap received enormous sums from the Commonwealth. He is, I understand, the highest paid official in Australia. Yet, through his friends here, he comes along, and begs, and prays, and cadges, asking that the pennies collected from the widows and children of deceased soldiers should be handed over to him. </para>

It is quite true, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> suggests, that the taxes levied on the small people are to be paid into a Commonwealth fund, but whereas the widow of a deceased soldier after a long struggle may get a pension of &#163;2 per week,- we are invited to grant the Chief Justice a pension of more than &#163;30 per week. Why should <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith get a pension of that amount, while the widow of a deceased soldier receives only &#163;2 per week. If men -will squander their money, and act foolishly, that is their business. There are many public servants who do that sort of thing just as there are many other persons outside the Service who do it. But we do not go to their assistance, and why should we go to the assistance of the Chief Justice of the High Court? What steps have been taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith and his friends to bring such pressure to bear on the Ministry as to induce them to commandeer this money ? </para>

                        <para>.- The Bill now before honorable senators leads me to believe that the system of pensions operating in Australia, is based upon wrong lines. I believe in a pension system - a system by which every citizen of the Commonwealth, upon attaining a specified age, should be entitled to the advantage of a pension. In other words, I believe in a system analogous to our old-age and invalid pensionssystem. </para>

                            <para>- No. The men and women who have pioneered Australia, and who have made it possible for gentlemen like the Chief Justice of the High Court to be appointed to such a. position, are entitled to some consideration. If that gentleman is in necessitous circumstances in his old age, let him take- advantage of the system that is operating in Australia by accepting the old-age pension. If that pension is not sufficient for him, it is not sufficient for other people, and should be increased. I recollect that, some years ago, the Chief Justice of the High Court was the Attorney-General of the State of Queensland. Seeing that this Bill has been submitted for the specific purpose of providing a . pension for that gentleman, it is impossible, in discussing it, to ignore the personal aspect. &#34;When <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith was Attorney-General of Queensland, as the result of an arrangement which was arrived at, the salary of the Chief Justice of that State was increased from &#163;2,500 a year to &#163;3,500 a year. As soon as that had been done, he accepted the position.- The increase was made in order that the then Liberal Government of Queensland might get rid of his opposition to them. It is a noteworthy fact that most Judges seem to have their eye firmly fixed on the main chance. It reminds me of the way in which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine used to preach about conscription and the war. But as soon as he was offered the position of Chief Justice of Victoria, he accepted it, and said no more about conscription. </para>

                    <para>When Federation was established, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith had served on the Judicial Bench in Queensland about one-half of the term necessary to entitle him to a pension of about &#163;1,500 a year. Suggestions were then thrown out that he should be granted a pension of &#163;1,750 a year as Chief Justice of that State, notwithstanding that he had served only about one-half the statutory term, to enable him to enter the first Federal Parliament. He was a statesman, and a great constitutional authority, and he desired to enter that Parliament if, in addition to the salary of &#163;400 a year then payable to its members, he was guaranteed by the State of Queensland a pension of &#163;1,750 a year. Remembering these things, it is galling that we should now be asked to pay him a pension of &#163;35 a week for doing nothing. Queensland has had some experience of highly-paid pensioners who have retired <inline font-style="italic">do</inline> civil life. Many of them have immediately be taken themselves to London, where they have drawn pensions of &#163;S,000 or &#163;9,000 a year, without ever giving a thought to the State they had left. The same thing may happen if we grant this pension. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith may say good-bye to Australia. We all know that some of the individuals who have been pensioned did not really require the pensions which they received. But they nevertheless accepted them. Whether they gave the money to their relatives in Australia or elsewhere is not known. But it is known that the money was taken from the taxpayers of Queensland. We have heard repeated homilies in this chamber on the necessity for the exercise of economy on the part of the Government. I think that I may fairly call <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fairbairn</inline> the leader of the Economy party in this Senate. Is he going to support the Bill, and thus give evidence of inconsistency? If he does, he should for ever abandon the preaching of economy. It must be very edifying to returned soldiers, who, in many cases, are not being fairly dealt with, to realize that a pension of &#163;35 per week is to be paid to a gentleman who, at least, is not in want. I was rather surprised - indeed, I was pained - to hear an expression which fell this morning from the lips of an honorable senator opposite. I am one of those who made no lavish promises to our soldiers before they went to the Front. I did not promise them the moon on their return. But lavish promises were made, and when this morning <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Loghlin</inline> quoted the case of a soldier who has lost both his legs, and complained that this unfortunate man has not been provided with suitable employment, or with an adequate pension, an honorable senator opposite interjected that perhaps he would not work before he went to the war. </para>

                            <para>- However high may have been the qualifications of. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith, there is one attribute which he cannot claim - eminent jurist though he be. He has never been and never would have  been  a good Australian, in the Federal sense. In the interpretation of constitutional questions he always adopted the narrowest and most immovable aspect of the Federal Constitution. When the Judiciary Act was passed in 1903, it was specifically stated that no pension would attach to a Federal Judgeship. That having been laid down, a rate of salary commensurately high was fixed. All the Judges of the High Court, including the Chief Justice, accepted their appointments with their eyes open. It is not fair that a position which was guarded against at that time should now be established by means of a side issue. The subject of this measure has demeaned himself by permitting it to come before the Federal Legislature; and,  if  he accepts the pension, his attitude will not be  in  keeping with the dignity of his office, nor will it be justified by the amount of salary he has drawn since his elevation to the Federal Bench. It  is  an unwarranted proposition to confer upon any individual a pension at the rate of &#163;35 a week. When we are asked to pass such a measure as this, and when at the same time we realize the tense times ahead of Australia financially, we might well be led to believe that the disposal of these odd thousands is a mere bagatelle to the ruling powers. We are well aware of the hardships suffered by many people to-day-  .  We fully recognise that the rate of payment for old-age pensions, though it has been increased to 12s. 6d. per week, is nothing like adequate. I cannot appreciate the attitude of those honorable senators who preach economy. I can only describe their support of the Bill as inconsistent; I do not wish to employ a harsher term. In view of the evident intentions of honorable gentlemen in this chamber; and recollecting the numbers upon the division in another place, I am forced to believe that the matter is being decided on party lines. The most urgent phase of the pension question to-day has relation to returned soldiers. I intend to draw the attention of all returned men who come to me with their complaints of unjust treatment to the action of the Government in granting a pension of &#163;35 a week to one man in Australia. </para>

In addition to the money mentioned in the report, incapacitated soldiers are provided with necessary medical attention. I do not say that that is adequate to meet the case of a man who has lost his legs; but I point out that the payments and attentions which this man receives are just what were set out and agreed upon by Parliament. The next case mentioned was that of a man who could not work, having been shot three times in the leg, and it was. stated that he was in receipt of 7s. 6d. a week. The Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Millen)</inline> has informed me that a man in those circumstances is entitled to a pension of &#163;2 10s. a week, with free medical attendance until he can work. The pension would continue until he was able to do work of a remunerative character; and, in fact, he would get such a sum from the Repatriation Department as would insure that his receipts did not fall below &#163;2 2s. per week. The third case recorded in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> has to do with a blind man who is getting 40s. a week. I understand that blind returned soldiers receive &#163;3 10s. per week, and there is a proposal now for the sum to be increased to &#163;4, which is little enough. </para>

                            <para>- Quite true, and I am glad that I have arrived at an age when I can claim the old-age pension any day. A man who has served Australia as well as the Chief Justice of the Commonwealth High Court should receive generous treatment from the people. It is true that I am very much in favour of economy, and I point out that if we capitalize, at 5 per cent., the whole of our liabilities for pensions, and add that to the municipal, State, and Federal debt, it will be found that the burden on Australia is &#163;1,000,000,000. But I do not want to be mean, and I think it would he mean and unworthy of Australia if we failed to treat decently, in his declining days, a man who has given Australia of his immense ability. </para>

                        <para>.- I want to say that we should treat generously and well all public men who serve this country faithfully and honestly. Because I belong to the class which can never expect anything but a small pension, it is not my desire to withhold adequate recognition from those who occupy high positions in the Public Service. My desire is not to drag them down to the level occupied by the people of the class to which I belong, but to lift the latter to the higher levels. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think the honorable senator has heard me advocate pensions at all before to-day. Here is a man with a magnificent record of public service in Australia. I ask honorable senators to consider what have been his functions during his career. Important union actions, upon which, perhaps, millions of pounds have depended, ma&#62; have been brought before him for decision as the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia. I do not mean to say that, to such a man, the prospect of a pension at the end of a career is calculated to make him dishonest; but I do say that if a man knows he has something to fall back upon in his declining years he will, perhaps, be kept out of temptation. As far as these pensions are concerned, I would like to see an immense increase in the amount given to all our people. I cannot expect, of course, that the amounts will be raised to the dizzy heights contemplated by the measure now under consideration; but I am plodding along to do what I can to make the position better. What better argument could I have from the public platform than to be able to point to the magnificent pension given to a gentleman who has occupied such a high position in the Commonwealth Service, and then ask the Government to treat as generously the mother who, having reared a family well, has thus rendered equally good service to this country? </para>

                        <para>.- Iii my opinion, it is outrageous to propose paying a pension of &#163;1,750 a year to a man who has had such a long career in the public service at a salary of &#163;3,500 a year, which, honorable senators will recognise, is somewhat more than  a  living wage. Surely we should expect a man, who has been so highly eulogized during the course of this debate, to have sufficient moral fibre to recognise that this country expects him to furnish an object lesson to the rest of the community, and that at the end of his days, unless some extraordinary circumstances arose, he should not require any assistance in the form of a pension. </para>

                            <para>- And the people who are supporting this proposal would use the same argument again in regard to pensions for the other sections of the community. What justification is there for this Government to pay a pension to a man who has been drawing such a high salary, when a majority in this Parliament declares that 12s. 6d. per week is enough to keep another member of the community? I am willing to admit that the man who shears sheep would not, at the end of his days, expect to be placed in a position of being able to spend &#163;35 a week; but I do say it is not fair to ask him, as one of the taxpayers of this country, to share the burden involved by this proposal. Parliament provided a salary sufficient to enable people in the position occupied by the Chief Justice to make their own provision for their old age. If all other sections of the community had been treated as generously as , has the Chief Justice, there would be no need for the old-age pensions scheme. I am quite certain the working people of this country would have scorned the idea of drawing pensions at the. end of their lives if they had been paid decent wages during their earning period. </para>

                            <para>- I know that; but I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> of what happened in the State of Tasmania some years ago. Members of the State Parliament were paid &#163;100 per year, and when one member had the audacity to move that the amount be increased to &#163;150 a year, he had all the Tory element in Tasmania, per medium of the Tory press, following him for months. Exactly the same element is behind this proposal. </para>

                    <para class="block">They would deny this privilege- to one section of the community, but their friends occupying high positions can spend what they like, and after they have done it all in, and find at the end of their lifetime that they can earn no more, all they have to do is to come along to their representatives in Parliament, who will obligingly hand out to the extent of &#163;35 per week. This outrage, I repeat, should not be tolerated. The amount involved in this proposed pension would provide for seventy old men and women. These old-age pensioners are expected to go to the old-age pension office, in the rain or any other kind of weather, to draw their 12s. 6d..a week, but in the case of the Chief Justice, if this Bill be carried, he will have a cheque for &#163;1,750 a year paid&#39; into his account, without having any trouble about the matter at all. The thing is worse than an outrage. Twenty of our brave men who have lost their limbs and eyesight in the war could, when they come back to this country, be kept upon the same amount as this one man will draw. It is nearly time the country awakened up to the fact that there are in power people who are prepared to dip their hands up to their elbows into the pockets of the taxpayers and hand out pensions to their pals. It is all very well to say, as some people do, that we all ought to get pensions. We know we cannot all get them. </para>

Such a proposal is usually to be expected from those who mostly hold the reins of government all over the earth. They are generally in a position to he able to do what they like. Their friends can go on the &#34; razzle &#34; every day, and they mostly do, and then, when they get to the end of their tether, their pals will hand them out as much, and, indeed, more than ever they were worth when they were fit to work. I do not believe the Bill will be carried; at all events, I hope it will not he. And I want here to say that there has been a rumour abroad lately that the Government contemplated robbing the women who, in travail, bring forth a man child for this country, of the &#163;6 which at present is paid for them. </para>

I feel sure that no words of mine of the most emphatic eulogy could add to the lustre of- his Honour the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia. His great services have been admitted. In an historical sense he will be a very great figure, for, quite apart from his high qualifications, he is the first Chief Justice of the High Court of this young nation, whose territories embrace the area of a whole continent. I hope I am not going to unfeelingly speculate on the length of years to which he may attain, but undoubtedly when a man is seventy-three years of age, in the ordinary course of nature, the shadows must be long upon the hill of life for him. </para>

                    <para>A great deal has been said about economy, and it is absolutely essential in the conduct of the financial affairs of the Commonwealth. But has it struck honorable senators that it might, in this and similar instances, be the very perfection of economy to do what this measure contemplates doing ? I cannot imagine anything more uneconomical or dangerous  than to have on the High Court or any other Bench in the Commonwealth a Judge whose vital powers may have been considerably impaired, who may be almost in his dotage, but who, for a Judge, may be in a state, financially, of practical penury. Such a man would naturally retain his seat on the Bench until such time as Parliament cared to remove him, which is a thing that Parliament would be very reluctant to do, except in the case of one who had acted improperly. Let me say that I am in favour of a pensions scheme applicable to the whole of our High Court Judges. But, in the absence of a pensions scheme, such a Judge as I have referred to might retain his seat on the Bench very much to the disadvantage of the proper construction of the terms of the Constitution and of the interests of litigants in such important actions as might be carried as far as the High Court </para>

                    <para>Honorable senators, in debating this Bill, have contrasted the pension proposed with the pensions paid under our old-age pensions system. I understand that the Chief Justice of the High Court is seventy-three years of age. If the .age entitling a person to receive an old-age pension were fixed at seventy-three years, I venture to say, without very close reference to the conclusions of mortuary tables, that we might, out of the amount now dispersed for old-age pensions, raise the amount of the pension to &#163;5 per week. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable senators opposing the Bill have referred to the apparently high salaries paid to Justices of the State Supreme Courts and of the High Court. But the salary paid is not so very high when we&#39; consider what is demanded of a Judge, and bear in mind the state of social isolation in which he is compelled to live. There are friends of mine in civil life who have become Judges, and while I differentiate between reserve and courtesy, there is no one whom I address with so much reserve as a Judge of my acquaintance. I feel that on his becoming a Judge something has intervened between him and me which makes just the old relationship between us impossible. </para>

                    <para>The parliamentary allowance made to honorable senators is, in the eyes of most people, a very large sum of money. But how many of the members of this Parliament are financially better off than when they were in civil life? There were years long before I contemplated entry into parliamentary life when I made a smaller income than my parliamentary allowance, but there have been years also when I easily made a great deal more, and I can say that I was very much better off before I became a member of Parliament than I am now. What is the ordinary experience of a member of Parliament? I venture to say that on every day in the year except Sundays he is in receipt of a request for a subscription. Do honorable senators think that Judges are exempt from such importunities? </para>

                    <para>It is necessary, not only that the business of our tribunals should be conducted in at atmosphere of unimpeachable integrity, but that a lack of integrity may not be suspected because of the impecuniosity of any particular  Judge  or number of Judges. I hope I shall not allude in any improper sense to recent happenings in connexion with this Parliament. I suspend my judgment upon them because proceedings may supervene of a character which can only at present be indicated. But I feel sure that every member of this Legislature regrets very keenly the imputation that has been put on the  honour and  integrity of certain of their fellow-members. If we regret such a thing in connexion with our Legislature, surely we should avoid the very appearance of it in connexion with a High Court Judge. </para>

                            <para>- One might very easily argue in favour of such pensions. If pensions should be paid to those who administer our laws it is not a great stretch of the argument upon which such a conclusion would be based to claim that those who make our laws might legitimately claim to be similarly treated. In an advanced Democracy in which the true principles of Democracy would be properly appreciated, such a scheme might very well be introduced.1 I believe in a scheme of pensions for Judges all round I hope that when the burden of the war has been somewhat reduced it will be possible for us to increase our old-age and invalid pensions. I believe in pensions for widows, and long ago supported such a proposal. </para>

T think that  His  Honour the Chief Justice of the High Court, long before he was placed on the Bench, did what all of us have done with success or with failure in the course of our lives. He made investments which turned out to be merely speculations  of an unsuspected- kind. Many a thing which a man regards as an investment turns out to have been only a speculation. It is an open secret that the Chief Justice of the High Court- did make investments of that character, which have involved him throughout the whole period of his occupancy of a seat on the Supreme Court Bench of Queensland and on the High Court Bench in financial liabilities which a man of his high sense of honour could only attempt to discharge. </para>

                            <para>- It is an argument. There are bankruptcy  laws, and the Bankruptcy Court is often the refuge of the financially afflicted, though, unhappily, it is in some cases, also the refuge of the knave and the scoundrel. We  should  not expect Judges to adopt the attitude of libellous miscreants of the Critchley Parker standard, and seek to discharge their liabilities through the Bankruptcy Court. A Judge can only suffer in silence and pay. All his debts are debts of honour, and he must pay them, though he might perhaps legally repudiate them if he cared to do so. I believe that the Chief Justice of the High Court has done what a man like him might reasonably be expected to do, and during the long course of his life on the Bench has endeavoured to discharge, to the extent of his financial ability, the liabilities which he incurred and which many fairly honorable men of the ordinary community would long ago have repudiated. </para>

Where has it gone? It is an open secret that it .has gone in the discharge of the liabilities which he incurred and  which  he has discharged as a man of honour. It is for that reason that, without making of this case a precedent, I am prepared to vote for the Bill. </para>

                            <para>- A Judge lives in a much more isolated atmosphere than does a member of Parliament. If I go down the street and familiarly address an acquaintance with the words, &#34; Come and have a drink,&#34; no one will regard that as a sacrifice of dignity on my part. But if a Judge were to do the same thing we can well imagine what a wringing of hands there would be and the holy horror that would be&#39; expressed that  His  Honour should so forfeit the dignity of the Bench and degrade its status. Thousands of Mother Grundys  would give utterance to such remarks, and I repeat that a Judge is compelled to live in an atmosphere of isolation and restraint. </para>

                    <para>Can we not strain a point, even those of us who profess a slavish regard for principles which may, after all, not be very excellent? Can we not regard as exceptional the case of this old man seventy-three years of age, who has done most honorable service in the civilian life of his country, and will stand in history as the first Chief Justice of the High Court of this nation of which we are so proud? I say that, irrespective of the fact that a superficial misapprehension of this measure may make it an unpopular one in the country, I am prepared to do what I think is right, even though my action may be criticised. Knowing what I do of the circumstances, knowing the great abilities of this great man, knowing that in the evening of his life he is beset .with considerations which he thinks may force Lim to adopt a certain course of action,- and to let his remaining years flicker out in a state of penury- unbecoming to the dignity of the position of a man who was once Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, I vote for this measure with alacrity. </para>

                        <para>. - There is one aspect of the matter which does not appear to have excited as much attention in the course of this debate as its importance warrants. We all recognise that beyond legal obligations there are moral ones, and it is a poor individual, and a still poorer nation, that would rest contented and satisfied in its legal obligations, without regard to its moral ones. When <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith came over from the service of the Queensland Government, he was actually, although not technically, a public servant. In leaving the one Service for the other he abandoned and sacrificed certain rights that would have been his had he remained in the employ of the State. </para>

Had <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith been a clerk in the Public Service of Queensland at &#163;400 a year, and come over to the Commonwealth Service, he would have brought his pension rights with him. It was merely owing to the technicality that the Judges of the State, as of the Commonwealth, are outside of the scope of the Public Service Act, that it is not possible for him to obtain a legal transfer from one Service to the other. The principle that made us include in our Public Service Act the provision that where officers were transferred they should bring with them their rights, imposes upon us a moral obligation- </para>

The principle is exactly the same. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith came over, as he did, sacrificing those accrued interests which were his, and the fact that he was willing to do it ought not to be any justification for us to avoid what I regard as a moral obligation resting upon us. It is not so much a question of whether we -wish to pay a pension in this case to a Judge or not, but whether we shall accept that obligation which I think was involved- when we invited <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> -to come over and take this office, which he has filled with so much distinction and satisfaction during his occupancy of the Bench. </para>

                        <para>- It is not. My object is to see whether honorable senators opposite are prepared to extend to the men and women of Australia the same generous treatment as is given to those who have drawn a magnificent salary for the best part of their lives. We were told a few minutes ago that if the age limit for old-age pensions was extended to seventy-three, we - without any further expenditure - could pay the recipients &#163;5 per week. If we increased the old-age pensions to the rate proposed in this Bill, the cost would run into from &#163;60,000,000 to &#163;70,000,000 per annum. Apparently, we are not prepared to do that, but I wish to give an opportunity to those here who are anxious to feed, feast and fatten one man who has been well fed and fattened all his life, to deal out evenhanded justice to the rest of the people. We are now paying a miserable pension of 12s. 6d. per week under the Old-age Pensions Act, and the Minister recently told us that the present was not an opportune time to increase it. There are tens of thousands of people who would be delighted if we could only increase the pension to 15s. per week. </para>

Briefly stated, the position is that the law advisers of the Government entertain a good deal of doubt as to the power of the  President  of the Arbitration Court to authorize his  deputy  to act during his absence. It is proposed to overcome this difficulty by vesting in the Governor-General direct power to appoint the  deputy.  The amendment is not being introduced because of any desire to make an alteration in the principal Act, but merely for the purpose which I have outlined. </para>

                    <para>.- Knowing that the Government possess a majority, I am content to allow the responsibility for this measure to rest upon their shoulders. It is only a reasonable thing that the Arbitration Court should have power to inflict penalties in order to enforce its awards.  But if we cannot constitutionally endow it with that power, the Government ought not to lose a single moment in attempting to acquire the power to do so. But any defect in our constitutional powers should be disclosed by the High Court. </para>

                        <para>- I would not like to say that. The most peculiar feature about the present position is that while the Arbitration Court may make awards, it has no power to enforce them. Of course, the reply of the Government is that the High Court has decided that their enforcement would be unconstitutional. Assuming that the position taken up by the Government is unassailable, I ask them to amend the principal Act by empowering a Justice of the High Court to enforce any awards which may be made by the Arbitration Court-. If it is alleged that that course would also be unconstitutional, by all means let the question be tested. It will be a very serious thing to the biggest industry in this country if the Australian Workers Union is obliged to send lawyers miles over the back country in order to plead its cause. In such circumstances, it would be practically tied up; and the union, which has loyally stood by the principle of arbitration in the settlement of all its disputes, and which desires to continue to do so, will be forced to take other action.. The Government will lose nothing by agreeing to the amendment which I intend to submit. But the Australian Workers Union will then shoulder the responsibility of securing from the proper tribunal an authoritative decision as to whether that amendment is constitutional or otherwise. We shall exhaust all constitutional means within our power to achieve our purpose, and we shall not resort to other measures unless we are compelled to do so. This is a very serious question, and I ask the Government to take a serious view of it. The insertion in the Bill of the amendment which I intend to submit will not in any way affect the remainder of its provisions. </para>

                    (Victoria - Vice-President of the Executive Council &#91;4.30&#93;. - In moving the second reading of this Bill, I pointed out that it &#34;is merely a temporary measure. It is not intended to interfere with the good features of the Arbitration Act. It is designed to overcome a temporary difficulty until we are in a position to deal with that Act in a more comprehensive way. But the Court has been robbed of its power to enforce awards. We nave no alternative but to deal with the Courts now in existence. The delays which have occurred when various organizations have sought to approach the Arbitration Court have been a source of great inconvenience, and have proved one of the principal causes for the unpopularity of arbitration to-day. The easier we can make it for the people to secure a hearing in the Arbitration Court for even the lightest grievance the better it will be for all. It is not desired that any section of the public should be forced to go to the High Court with a plaint. The Bill does not intend that the lower Courts shall have power to impose penalties, but that they shall merely act as policemen to enforce penalties. The nearer the people are to the Courts with which they have to deal, and the cheaper the cost of approaching those Courts, the better it is, of course, in the interests of the public generally. If the Bill is lost we do not know where the Arbitration Court will stand during the next few months, before Parliament meets again. I emphasize that this is only a temporary measure.

                    is evidently not quite clear in regard to the powers of the Courts. They are intended to act in the sense of policemen by enforcing the awards of the Arbitration Court. Where organizations to-day are limited to the Arbitration Court, they are now to be given opportunity to approach any Court.

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Loghlin</inline> yesterday asked me for a further explanation with regard to a question put to me as to the rule governing applications for appointment in the Ordnance Branch of the Defence Department. He asked what is the rule, and, if applications are required, why are they dispensed with in certain cases, and why was the rule abrogated in the case to which he referred. The answer is, applications for appointment to positions in the Defence Department are invariably  invited. The case under review was a promotion, in which no supersession of other employees was involved. </para>

                    <para>That the amendments be agreed to. As previously drafted, the Bill gave the Commissioner power to sell the estate and interest of the customer with whom he was dealing but it is possible that the latter might have no estate or interest, leaving the place, or falling into arrears, after a week or two. In that case, he would have built up ho interest to sell, and the proposal is to give the Commissioner discretion to cancel the agreement. There is a difference between the purchaser who buys under the conditions referred to and the applicant who becomes a borrower. In the latter case, the necessity of proceeding by the usual legal procedure is continued. </para>

                        <para>. - In reply to a question put by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gardiner)</inline> yesterday in regard to the demobilization of our overseas troops, I intimated that before honorable senators dispersed I would probably be in a position to make a short statement to the Senate. I shall now proceed to -redeem that promise. Since the termination of hostilities, the demobilization, embarkation, and repatriation of the Australian Overseas Forces has received the unremitting attention of the Government. Intimate consultation by cable has been conducted between the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> and the Cabinet. As the result a scheme for handling the important problem involved has been adopted. This necessitates the creation in Britain of a control embracing military and civilian <inline font-style="italic">personnel.</inline> The work to be accomplished at the other end includes - in addition to the &#34;shipping, feeding, and clothing of our men between the period of actual demobilizaton and embarkation in Britain - the great task of providing suitable occupation and training for so extensive a Force during the inevitable period of idleness. This period, it seems, will cover from nine to twelve months, however excellent may be the shipping arrangements to return our men to Australia. The &#34;Government&#39;s desire is to see that to men who desire, during this period of waiting, to secure training in the primary or secondary industries to which they formerly had been engaged, or wish to be engaged, the opportunity will be available. This phase of the question must be regarded as preparatory to repatriation. After reviewing the whole matter, the Government have now decided that this work must be presided over by a responsible Minister. Official, or indirect, responsibility for matters affecting so closely the interests of the men who have splendidly fought for the safety of Australia will not be satisfactory to the people or Parliament of the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister will return as soon as the duties of t&#34;he Allied Conference and the Peace Conference permit. It is, of course, impossible to fix a date at the &#39;present moment. The Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Joseph Cook)</inline> must return for the visit of Lord Jellicoe, who is leaving England in February to review the naval programme and outlook of the Commonwealth. It will, therefore, be necessary to despatch a Minister to Lon- don to arrive in sufficient time to take over the organization and administration there. This will be arduous work, with little opportunity to learn the elements of the business. The Cabinet has, therefore, requested <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> the Minister for Defence, to proceed to London to discharge this important undertaking. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has consented, and his departure will be conditioned by the receipt of more definite information as to the movements of the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy at the other end of the world. This statement deals, as honorable senators will see, with the problem as it presents itself in Great Britain. As indicated on former occasions, the Government is developing, with proper care, suitable machinery at this end to deal with the reception, training, and reabsorption of the Forces from overseas. It is hoped that the measures adopted will satisfactorily cope with this most important question. </para>

It was intended that this power should also extend to any institution, such as a museum, public library, or art gallery; but, through an oversight, we neglected to do this.The other branch of the Legislature has now remedied this omission. </para>

                <para>The first of the two clauses will commend itself to honorable senators. It is to the effect that an officer who has been on active service shall have preference, with regard to promotion, over an officer who has not seen active service. With respect to the second clause, under the Army Act, enlistment releases the obligation of an apprentice to his employer. That has not been provided for in our Act, and, in the course of the present war, it has been found that if an apprentice enlisted he was liable to a civil action for breaking the terms of his apprenticeship. And, if he went to the war and returned, he could not call upon his employer to complete the teaching of his trade. This proposed clause will embody both those considerations. In the one case, enlistment will not be regarded as a breach of apprenticeship on the part of the employee; and in the second circumstance if the employee returns and wishes to complete his articles, the employer must re- employ him and complete the period of training. </para>

I should like to take the opportunity, on behalf of the Government, and, if I may presume to do so, on behalf of honorable senators, to tender you, sir, our hearty thanks for the assistance which you have rendered in the discharge of public business, and to the unfailing courtesy and eminent fairness with which you have presided over our deliberations. I should like, also, to include in this expression of our thanks the officers of the Senate for their unfailing courtesy and the assiduity with which they have striven to lighten our labours. I desire, further, to include the gentlemen of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff. We have to remember that those who report our speeches in this Chamber are members of a staff charged with the duty of reporting speeches in both Houses; and whilst, on many occasions, as during the last week, the strain upon them has been extremely heavy, consequent upon our extended sittings, their labours have been intensified by the extra pressure imposed by the sittings of the other House. May I also be permitted to extend the thanks of the Government to members of this Chamber for the assistance they have given during the session, and particularly do I wish to  thank  those members who at great inconvenience have remained tonight in order to complete the business programme of the Government. Perhaps, without wishing to create any invidious distinction, I might be permitted to extend our special thanks to members of the Opposition. I should like, also, to wish you, sir, and honorable senators, the best wishes in connexion with the approaching season. I trust honorable senators will have an enjoyable Christmas, and that they will enter upon a prosperous and satisfactory new year. </para>

                <para>There is one other matter which I should like to mention, and that is, it is probable, if circumstances fall out as it  is likely they will, and the intention of the Government materializes, that when next we meet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> will not he with us.  I  feel  I  shall express the feelings of honorable senators if  I  take, this opportunity of assuming that the trip he will undertake has been successfully accomplished, and that he will have entered upon his responsible duties in England.  I  have, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> been a member of the Senate since the inception of this Parliament.  I  was thinking tonight of the changes which we have mutually undergone during that period. When the Senate first opened, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> and  I  sat on the benches opposite, with just the gangway between us. After a while, in the whirligig of politics, the honorable senator deserted me to occupy a seat on the benches on this side. With very much greater consistency,  I  remained opposite, a consistency for which  I  do not take too much credit. After a while, other changes occurred, and brought <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> and myself side by side on these benches.  I  must express <inline font-style="italic">my</inline> appreciation of my association with the honorable senator, and my firm conviction that, if he should go to London, he will discharge the heavy responsibilities which will fall upon him there with advantage to the country, and with credit to himself. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so. I believe it is due to the want of tact of the Administrator. I should not have referred to the matter at this stage only that I do not desire that it should go out to the country that the trouble in the Northern Territory is. due to a rise in the price of beer. That is not true. Personal friends and schoolmates of mine, who have worked in the Territory, tell me that there will never be harmony while <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline> remains there. They say that he is deficient in tact; and we know that an ounce of tact is often worth a ton of bounce. The trouble, it appears to me, is that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline> does not understand the Australian temperament. As an evidence of this, I may mention that he employs at Government House, Port Darwin, a staff of Chinese servants, whilst Australian, white girls have to leave the Territory for want of work. The policy of the Commonwealth does not stand for that. Before the war, and before the establishment of any censorship due to the war, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline> initiated and established a censorship in the Northern Territory. The Judiciary and the whole of the civil servants there are in the palm of his hand, and not a letter could leave the Territory without its contents being known to the Administrator. That kind of thing is not in harmony with Australian ideas of freedom.  Any civil servant who falls foul of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline> might as well leave the Territory. I may mention that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carey,</inline> the Government Secretary, seeing an opportunity to advance himself, applied for, and obtained, a position as sub-manager of Vestey&#39;s Meat Works. When he accented the office, the whole of the staff, including the manager, promptly resigned, because they would not work with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.- Carey.</inline> We have received sheaves of correspondence and personal communications from residents of the Territory, which lead us to believe that there will be no harmony there while <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline> is retained as Administrator. I commend to the Government the suggestion to appoint a more tactful man, and one more conversant with the developmental policy of Australia, if the occupation of the Northern Territory is to be a success. I am convinced that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline> does not desire it to be a success. I believe that there is an Australia-wide conspiracy in certain quarters to make a failure of it. I hope that when <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gilruth</inline> next comes to Melbourne the Government will seriously cross-examine him  on  the. results of his administration. Since he has been in the Territory there has not been a Minister in charge of it, and not even a Labour Minister, who has been able to grapple with the position and assert the authority necessary for the proper conduct of affairs there. Each Minister appears to have taken all that the officials say as gospel, and no representations to the contrary have had any weight: Until there is a change in the administration there will not be harmony in the Northern Territory. </para>

I have also to thank all honorable senators on both sides of the Chamber for their unfailing kindness, generous treatment, and uniform courtesy towards myself, and the assistance they have always given me in the discharge of my duties. It has been a pleasure to me to preside over the deliberations of the Senate, because of the good feeling that I believe has always existed between myself and every member of it.

                <para>In speaking on a similar motion last, session, I expressed the hope that by the time another year had rolled by, the angel of peace would have unfolded its wings over a tortured world, and that we should be able again to enjoy the blessings which peace alone can bring. I believe we can now congratulate ourselves that, if peace has not already been reached, it is at any rate within measurable distance, and likely within the very near future to be an accomplished fact. A great portion of our thanks for bringing about that peace must be due to those splendid sons of Australia, who went overseas to take part in the gigantic struggle. They have worthily upheld the name of Australia while fighting side by side with the sons of the Mother Country and of the Allied Nations in th&#38; dreadful struggle which has just terminated. Side by side with them they have endured all the horrors of this terrible War. Together with them they have marched into the mouth of hell in some of the dreadful battles of awful and gigantic proportions that have taken  place. Together with them they hare sometimes endured the tortures and humiliations that accompany a retreat, and now, after a glorious victory, they are enjoying a triumphant march side by side and step by step with the sons of the Mother Nation and the Allied countries to take possesssion of German territory across the Rhine, and .insure that the Huns shall no longer torture the world. We ought to felicitate ourselves on the great services our splendid sons have rendered to the Allied cause, and in defence of the integrity of Australia. Their services should always be held in grateful remembrance by this Parliament and by the people of Australia, and the debt that  we  Owe  to them should be repaid in generous measure, nor should we ever cavil at the cost, no matter what it may be. </para>
