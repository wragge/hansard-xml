                        to-day&#39;s newspapers there appears a statement by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jensen,</inline>
                        in which he refers to a conversation which&#39; took place between him and myself at my house in St. Kilda. . As that statement is in conflict with my recollection of what took place I wish to. take this opportunity to put before the. Senate and the country what my recollection of that conversation is.
                    </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>It is quite correct that Iinvited <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jensen</inline> to come out on a Saturday afternoon to see me at my house. On his arrival, I, first of all, congratulated him on the fact that the Royal Commission&#39;s report had, in ray judgment, cleared him from any charge of having improperly received money in connexion with the Shaw wireless contract. I expressed my pleasure at that. I then proceeded to say to him that, in my opinion, the report of the Commission in regard to his administration was a weighty and severe indictment, and one that I thought would tell very heavily against him in Parliament and in the country. He contested that, and we then proceeded to go through the report, of which I had a copy. </para>
                <para>
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jensen</inline>
                    put to me the view he held in opposition to that which I had stated. He said that if he had an opportunity he could put a case which he believed would exonerate him both in Parliament and in the country from any charge of laxity or want of administrative ability. I told him eventually, after our conversation had proceeded for some time&#39; on those lines, that, in my opinion, that was not the case, and -that I felt that if he came before Parliament with that report as a Minister he would be condemned on the report.
                </para>
                <para>I pointed out, further, that if he came before Parliament as a member of &#39;the Government, the Government would also&#39; have to accept the responsibility of that condemnation, he being a member of it. I mentioned that the acts for which the Commission had condemned his administration were acts, not of the present Government or of his administration while a member of the present Government, but of his administration while he was a member of the previous Government. I said that even if any members of the present Government took his view that he had a good defence to the condemnation of his acts of administration, and they put that view forward, they would at once be open to the charge, not that they were trying to save <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jensen</inline> from public or parliamentary condemnation, but that they were trying to save themselves and the Government to which they belonged. </para>
                <para>I told <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. .</inline> Jensen that I was speaking to him entirely on my own responsibility, that I had not been asked to do so by the Acting Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> or any member of the present Government,and my only justification for speaking was that he and I had been associated with the Labour party together, that we left the Labour party for the same reason at the same time, that we were members of that section of the Labour party which coalesced with the Liberals, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> was at present away in England, and that I felt it my duty as an old colleague to give him the benefit of my views and of my advice. I told him that, in my judgment, he would put himself in a better position to defend his administration if,  before the Cabinet met to discuss this question, he placed his resignation in the hands of the Acting Prime Minister. He contested that view, and said that he believed that if he had an opportunity to come before the Nationalist party he could convince the members of the party, and they would agree to his remaining in the Government. I then pointed out to him that under the system of Cabinet responsibility Ministers have to take a collective responsibility for the acts of the several members of the Cabinet. I said that if the first Administration of which he was a member at the time these things were done had continued in office, he would have a perfect right, in my judgment, to ask that that Administration should share- his responsibility, although they might justly have said that, in regard to some of the matters on which the Commission reported, those things were done without their knowledge. I said that the position was entirely altered by the fact that the majority of the members of the present Government were not members of the Government under which these things took place, and that a majority of them, also, did not even belong to the party which the previous Government represented. I said that, whatever claims he might have on Ministers who were his colleagues at the time these transactions took place, he bad no right to ask the other Ministers to share this responsibility with him. </para>
                <para>I said that if he resigned he would come before the House untrammelled by Government responsibility, free to make the best case he could to Parliament, and that Parliament would honour his action in resigning from the Government in order to avoid placing responsibility on his colleagues. I said that he would be in a better position, and receive a better hearing from Parliament and the country, after having done that, than if he attempted, as a member of the Government, to make the Government as a whole shoulder responsibility for transactions in which a majority of them had had no voice. </para>
                <para>
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jensen,</inline>
                    to my mind, seemed to be impressed with what I put before him, and on leaving he thanked me for the advice I had given him. He said that he recognised that I gave it to him as a friend, and promised that he would consider what I had said before he came to a decision.

Will the Minister say if any similar action, or any action of an allied nature, has been taken by corresponding bodies in any of the other States, or whether those corresponding bodies have made any representations similar to those contained in the reasons given for the resignation of the Victorian State Board. </para>

On learning from the press that the Board contemplated resigning, I telephoned the  Chairman,  and asked him to give me an opportunity of. meeting the Board. He declined to say yes or no to that request himself. He said that the Board would be meeting that afternoon, and that he would place my request before the members, when the Board would have to accept collective responsibility for acceding to that request or re- &#39; jecting. it. The Board did not give me an opportunity of meeting them before taking action. </para>

                        <para>-  This matter has been considered by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and myself. We know from matters within our personal knowledge that the cost of living has gone up considerably. During the war we both set our faces very strenuously against giving any increases in salaries. In these circumstances we thought that the grant of a war bonus to the lower-paid servants of Parliament who had dependants was not only justifiable, but an incumbent obligation on this Parliament. Consequently, we have made a recommendation to the Treasurer on behalf of all the Departments connected with this building, that a sum of money should be made available to us to pay a war bonus of &#163;10 for this financial year to each of the servants of Parliament who are receiving under &#163;204 a year, and who have dependants. This will apply to all who come within that description except the female cleaners. In their case we have recommended that the bonus should be &#163;5. The reason is that only about one-third of their time is occupied in this building, and that they are free during the rest of their time to do as they please. A bonus at the rate mentioned will preserve about the due proportion between them and those who are working full time. The only others to whom this recommendation will not apply are the gardeners. The reason for this is that during this financial year, through the recommendation of the Joint House Committee, they are already receiving a war bonus of1s. per day, which will amount in their case to more than the &#163;10 to be received by the others. We have not yet received the Treasurer&#39;s decision on our  &#39;recommendation, but that is the only bar in the way of the payment of the money. As soon as the Treasurer&#39;s warrant authorizing the payment is received, the money will be paid. If the Treasurer refuses to grant the bonus we can do no more. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. The profit resulted chiefly owing to the careful grading of the skins, and the keen demand by the American buyers. Australian requirements were met at practically normal rates. Under these circumstances, it is intended to retain the profit in the Consolidated Revenue. </para>

To the credit of a number of these lads, be it said, upon attaining their eighteenth birthday, they were either in military camps in Australia, or at the Front as members of the Australian Imperial Force. As the boys, who at eighteen years of age were either in camp or at the Front, were precluded from passing the necessary qualifying examination, this clause is intended to permit them to remain in the Service without undergoing any examination.

                <para class="block">I venture to say that every honorable senator would only be too glad to support any such proposal. But the clause goes a great deal farther. It provides that after section 34c of the principal Act the following section shall be inserted : -  &#34;34d. (1.) Where the Commissioner reports to the Governor-General that it is not desirable that the system of examination should be applied in relation to an appointment to a specified position, or appointments to a specified class of positions, in the General Division, there may be appointed to that position, or to a position in that class, a person who has not passed the prescribed examination.&#34; </para>

                <para class="block">If the Vice-President of the Executive Council will accept such an amendment, the clause will then provide exactly - for what he wishes it to provide. With me, an educational test in regard to admission to the Public Service is a fundamental. I should be very sorry, if, in regard to entrance to the General Division, we fell back upon the system of patronage rather than of merit. Of course, I have no hesitation whatever in removing any difficulties that may stand in the&#39; way of admission to the Service of those who have served at the Front. Quite a large number of these men will return to Australia and resume their normal occupations here. They will not wish to enter our Public Service. The result will be that in the course of a few years the proposed new section will automatically cease to operate. I know that some persons desire to abolish the educational test. Some time ago, the Postmaster-General himself declared his intention to disregard it. If the Government do not believe in an educational examination, they ought to say so, frankly; but they ought not to ask Parliament, behind a boy who has enlisted in the Australian Imperial.

I do not see why&#39; the same provisions should not also be applied in the Clerical Division. The Minister feels strongly that the concession should be granted, and that it is only fair to youths who have missed the opportunity for examination, because they were away fighting or were in camp. At that no one can cavil. If my amendment . is not accepted, the trouble will be that any one who has stayed, at home nursing his feet may secure the same concession. </para>

Its dominating feature, however, is to permit returned soldiers who, by their .absence at- the Prout, have been placed under a disability to enter the Service without undergoing examination. There can be no exception to that principle. When a position is advertised in the General Service, it is set out that preference is to be given. But, of course, where there are not enough returned men available to take all the openings offered, the positions must still be filled. Therefore, the Public Service Commissioner may, by recommendation to the Governor-General, suspend the necessity for examination in certain cases. That suspension is limited, in the first place, to the .General Division. Let us suppose the Commissioner requires half-a-dozen labourers. As the Act stands,&#34; he must advertise, and applicants must be given an examination. Clause 3 gives the Governor-General power to exempt successful applicants in certain cases, also, from insurance. A man, who is given employment as a labourer, may be so old that insurance charges would be excessive. It is desired, therefore, to exempt such an individual from what would be an unfair tax, in the form of insurance. Suppose a driver of a steam launch were required, and that it was necessary that he should undergo examination . It would be a farce to test him in the ordinary way. What such a man would require would be a practical test. He would need to be put on a launch and &#34; tried out &#34; as to his practical knowledge and experience. The Commissioner would judge that man upon his certificates as an engine-driver.. -

                    a person would be required to undergo an examination of a practical nature, because there is an art in&#39; digging a post-hole and erecting the pole. There is an art also in the trimming of posts and the fixing of wires. But in the case of a watchman or an office cleaner, surely the Commissioner should not be required to make a man go down on his knees and scrub the floor before giving him a job. It would be a farce. It is not the intention, however, to abolish examinations in any case where a test of a practical nature would reveal the degree of skill or merit of the applicant.

He was not as industrious as he might have been, but he was exceptionally smart and was well educated. The other employees in the same office admitted, without hesitation, that he could beat them all. On one occasion the postmaster at that centre was the examiner, and there was not a single candidate who could have passed a test under that individual. He could not pronounce a word correctly, and I am not sure that he was not partly intoxicated when making the examination. </para>

                <para>Among the fifty or sixty who were undergoing the test hot one had a hope of succeeding, because of the postmaster so badly mispronouncing his words &#34;in the dictation examination. I know of another, young fellow who gained almost the maximum of marks in the writing test and in arithmetic; but in the dictation examinanation, a piece was read which introduced geographical terms that - this candidate had never heard before. He misspelt a word or two. Although he gained 200 marks more than most of those who passed the examination, he failed. We should insist upon common-sense methods in examinations for the Postal service. It is a farce if a man can do his work efficiently, but fails in an examination because he cannot spell some word of which, perhaps, he has never heard before. We ought to get back to common sense in examinations of candidates. </para>

                        <para>- I want to correct any false impression that may have been created. It is not the practice now to require examinations of applicants for certain positions, because . the Public Service Commissioner takes a commonsense view of the Act, although in omitting to require examinations in respect of these applicants, he is breaking the law, and I do not think he should be placed in that position. Continuing, he states - </para>

                </continue>
                <para>If examinations are held for these positions, and only one or two appointments are made within the eighteen months during which candidates are eligible for appointment, there is complaint by the unappointed successful candidates that they wasted time and money in undergoing the test and paying the entrance fee. </para>
                <para class="block">That often happens. I have known of vacancies occurring for certain positions for which, perhaps, between 200 and 300 persons have applied and have attended for examination, although there was a certainty that about 90 per cent. of them would not be successful. It is a serious matter for working men to be required by the Act to lodge 7s. 6d. as an application fee and then attend for examination,. losing half a day, or a day, over the process, when it is not necessary. Though this provision might be all right in the case of a position carrying a salary of&#163;500 a year and where there is something at stake. The Commissioner adds - </para>
                <para>In a skilled position such as mechanic and lineman, it is a fairly easy matter to arrange appropriate practical tests, and judge the relative merits of the candidates. But in an unskilled position such as labourer or office-cleaner, it is not practicable to do so, because the nature of the work will not admit of it. Even in some skilled positions, practical tests cannot be arranged. For example, if an appointment is required as coxswain or engine-driver on a steam launch, it would be necessary to test the candidates by securing a steam launch for a lengthy period, and ask the candidates to perform the actual work of the position. That would be impracticable, and should be unnecessary, as the Commissioner could satisfy himself by evidence such as certificates issued by the Marine Board of the efficiency of the applicants, and make a suitable selection. </para>
                <para class="block">I ask honorable senators not to be led away with the suggestion that it is the intention of the Government to abolish this system of examination. That is not the intention of the Government or the Public Service Commissioner at all. I trust, therefore, that the amendment will not be accepted. </para>

                <para class="block">Every member of the Senate is in favour of that. The Minister said this clause of the Bill was for the purpose of allowing persons who had been connected with the Australian Imperial Force to enter the Public Service without the necessary examination, and I repeat that we are all agreed upon that. But now he goes further. This clause, which, by the way, is supported by Senators McDougall and </para>
                <para class="block">Guy, conveys the impression that it is the intention of the Government to do away with examinations. I am strongly in favour of some examination, but I realize that it would be an absurdity to put applicants for the position of telephone linesman through a Latin or Greek test. The examination should be of a practical nature to determine the competency of the applicant. If the Minister says that there are some other Departments for which an educational test is not required, he should definitely and clearly indicate all the circumstances so that the situation may be dealt with. In my judgment, an educational test is a fundamental qualification for entrance to the Public Service. The Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Webster)</inline> has told us that he is against examinations, and I understand the employees of the Postal Department number between 12,000 and 15,000. The Postmaster-General has also stated that there are a number of incompetent persons in his Department, and that it is his intention to shift them. I think it probable that he finds this rather difficult because of the operation of the Public Service Act. I do not know to whom the Postmaster-General refers when he speaks of incompetent employees, but I have not the slightest doubt that it will be found upon inquiry that in every single instance persons charged with incompetency are those who entered the Service without examination. </para>
                <para>Some members of this Parliament have had no experience in a State Parliament, and no knowledge of a Public Service not under the control of a Public Service Commissioner. In common with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and other honorable senators, I have, as a member of a State Parliament, had experience of a Public Service that was not under a Commissioner. . . From that experience I look with perfect horror upon the establishment of a Public Service, the entrance to which would not be by examination. </para>

                        <para>- Then why does not the Minister accept my amendment, which would limit the entrance to the Commonwealth Public Service without examination to members of the Australian Imperial Force? In view of what the honorable senator has stated I shall ask leave to withdraw my amendment in&#39; order to move for the insertion of the word &#34;Clerical&#34; before the words &#34;and General&#34; in sub-section 1 of the proposed new section. If this is to be limited to members of the Australian Imperial Force, as I think it should, I do not see why a young fellow who has been to the Front, and is competent to write a letter, should not have the same opportunity to enter the Clerical Division of the Public Service as is given to a member of the Australian Imperial Force, who can put up a telegraph post, to enter the General Division of the Service. I shall test the sincerity of the Government on the subject of preference to members of the Australian Imperial Force for entrance into the Public Service by proposing an amendment which will secure to them this preference in respect of appointments to the Clerical Division without examination as well as to the General Division. If the Minister desires that there should be some provision to enable the Government to deal with people who are required to clean offices., I have no objection to that. No one asks for an educational test for such employment. </para>

                        <para>- Decidedly we should not. I have on several occasions directed attention to the fact that for years now we have had an Acting Public Service Commissioner, when we should have had a permanent appointment to that office. I say this, though I have a high opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edwards,</inline> who is the Acting Public Service Commissioner. The Government propose to give the Acting Public Service Commissioner the power to say that certain persons may be admitted to the Public Service without examination, but that returned soldiers are to receive preference. A returned soldier may be turned down because he is unable to pass the medical test. For permanent appointments I am in favour of a medical test, even in the case of returned soldiers. I think that returned soldiers who cannot pass a medical test should be invited to take advantage of our repatriation legislation. </para>

The question really is whether a returned soldier is a fair average clerk, and if he is he should be given preference in appointment to the Public Service. That has been already provided for. </para>

                        <para>- There have been many special examinations held of members of the Australian Imperial Force. It is not reasonable to expect them to have an up-to-date knowledge of subjects with which one loses touch after being a few years away from school, and so members of the Australian Imperial Force&#39; are submitted to a simplified educational test. I am sure that I could make a. pledge on behalf of the Government, and of the whole of the people of Australia, that if the examination which they are required to pass were of so high a standard that an ordinary clerk who has been on active service could not pass it, it would be simplified. </para>

                        <para>- The Government are. willing to co-operate with the honorable senator to secure compliance with the absolute spirit of the rule of preference to returned soldiers to give those men the opportunity to obtain permanent employment, which, by reason of their service to the country, they deserve. In view of the special provision already made for a simplified examination for members of the Australian Imperial Force, I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> will not press his amendment. </para>

                    BOLTON (Victoria) &#91;4.|26&#93;.  -  Honorable senators must realize that the members of the Public Service have very important functions to perform, and no reasonable man with a sense of responsibility would suggest anything that would be detrimental to the Service. It seems to me that the  pro.posal  in this Bill relating to members of the Australian Imperial Force should &#34; aPply&#62; not only to the General, but also to the Clerical and Professional Divisions. Other things being equal, a returned soldier capable of carrying out the duties of an officer in either of these divisions should be given preference. Instances have been brought under my notice of men temporarily employed in the Clerical, and also in the Professional Division, who, after performing the duties of their office for six or twelve months, have failed to receive a permanent appointment because of the examinations and other difficulties in their way. If a returned soldier has carried out the duties of an office as a temporary employee for six months or a longer period, that should surely be regarded as proof that be is qualified for a permanent appointment to .such a position. The country is justified in making some concession to the men who have served it so well at the Front. If,, with due regard to the efficiency of the Service, we can in this way show our gratitude to these men for the services they have rendered, I say that we will be fully justified in appointing them to permanent positions regardless of examinations, and provided only that they can perform the duties required of them. I strongly support the amendment.

                    O&#39;LOGHLIN (South Australia) &#91;4.29&#93;.  -  I support the amendment on the ground that it is desirable that we should give the. widest possible opportunity to the boys who have been fighting for us at the Front to secure permanent employment in the Public Service if they so desire. We cannot put a man accustomed to labouring work or deficient in education in a clerical position; but it is not necessary that a man appointed to such a position .should have a knowledge of a foreign language.&#39;

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guy</inline>
                    regard the system of examination as not altogether satisfactory, but it is the most satisfactory that has been devised, and is in existence in every Civil Service in the Commonwealth and the British Empire. While I admit that it is not perfect, it is our principal safeguard against nepotism and favoritism. That is why it was introduced. The Commissioner cannot have a personal knowledge of all those under him, and therefore must depend on the recommendations of his subordinates. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent any of them recommending some thirty-first cousin for preferment to a position to which some one else is better entitled. The Minister is full of good intentions, but we should legislate on definite lines. Only to-day I had an instance of how regulations are disregarded. I asked the Minister for Defence
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline>
                    whether it was the practice in the Defence Department to call for. applications for positions, and whether a certain position had been filled without applications being called. The Minister said, in answer to the first question, &#34; Yes&#39;, it is the practice,&#34; and then coolly told me that that particular position had been filled by the appointment of the next senior man, without applications being called for.

                        <para>- It applies right through. We must, therefore, not expect to bring about the millennium by doing away with the examination. I would much rather give the returned soldier every opportunity to enter and remain in the Service until he has acquired the necessary knowledge. I would then require from him a full satisfaction of the test of examination, just as I would of anybody else. We do not want to make the Public Service weaker simply through our desire to be sympathetic. We must not only show sympathy to the men who are coming back, but we must also make our Public Service strong. All <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> will achieve by his amendment is to make a further amendment necessary in the Public Service Act. I would even allow the candidate from theAustralian Imperial Force to enter the Service, and postpone the examination for him for twelve or eighteen months. </para>

                    <para>. - I have a good deal of sympathy with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> and those who are anxious to make it easier for the returned soldier to get into any branch of the Federal Public Service where there is a vacancy and for which the applicant is suitable, but I foresee great danger in opening the doors of both branches of the Service in the way this amendment would open them. The examinations for the Clerical and General Divisions have been in the past the greatest safeguard that we have had against the use of political, social, or any other kind of influence in securing appointments to the Service. The result of that method of entry into the Service has been that a certain* privileged section has grown up, but I do not see how we can avoid it in the present circumstances. Of the two evils, it is better to have that privileged section than to throw open the door to conscious or unconscious influence by the Public Service&#39; Commissioner. Ministries may change, and the Public Service Commissioner may change, so that we have to look to the possibilities of the future. Keen and anxious as I am to do everything possible for the returned soldier, we must guard against filling the Public Service with a large proportion of men who may not be competent. </para>

                    <para>. - I think that this question might very well be considered from the stand-point of what is meant by an examination. In my opinion the matter hinges upon the class of examination that is applied to any candidate. When the Postal Commission was conducting its inquiry into the Post and Telegraph Department it came across no end of ridiculous examinations, to which common labourers were subjected when they were seeking employment in that Department. They were obliged to undergo a difficult educational examination, notwithstanding that the duties which they were required to perform did not partake in the slightest degree of a clerical nature. Yet they were compelled to submit to most difficult, and even &#34; tricky &#34; examinations. I was under the impression that this silly practice had been abandoned years ago, and I was indeed surprised to learn that we have before us to-day a measure relating to it. It would be difficult, if not impossible, to prescribe an examination for admission to the Clerical Division which would be suitable to all Departments of the Service. The different Departments perform very different classes of .work, so that, whilst a man might make a very suitable clerk <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> the Postal Department, he might be utterly unfitted to fill a clerical position in the Attorney-General&#39;s Department or the Department of Trade and Customs. Consequently any examination which applicants may be required to undergo should be founded upon the class of duties that they are to be required to perform. The same remark is also applicable to the Professional Division. But I am very strongly opposed to dispensing with competitive examinations for admission to our Public Service. The moment we adopt that course we shall be acting unwisely. At the same time, for the position of a watchman, a labourer, Or cleaner, it is ridiculous to prescribe any educational examination whatever. </para>

                        <para>- One would have to form an opinion of his honesty from his general character. So many activities are carried on under the Public Service Commissioner that unless different examinations are prescribed for different branches of the Service, all sorts of inconsistencies will arise. In the Weather Bureau, for example, the work performed by the officers is utterly different from that which is performed by officers in any other Department. I do not consider that the work required to be done by the officials of the Postal Department is of a very high quality. </para>

For returned soldiers who desire to enter the General Division of our Public Service we cannot make the conditions too easy. The nature of the work required of officers in that division is not difficult, and so long as we do not interfere with the Clerical Division, I think we may safely accept the proposal of the Government. </para>

Personally, I am sorry that the Committee has declined to extend this concession to our soldiers, to admission to the Clerical Division of our Public Service. 1 strongly favour the retention of the system of entrance by examination to the Public Service. Entrance should be upon merit every time. But I am prepared, so far as members of the Australian Imperial Force are concerned, to alter the present method, first out of gratitude to our men who have fought, and, secondly, because within a few years the concession will have (become automatically a dead letter. As the position stands, however, the Commissioner may dispense in any case with an examination. It is only fair to the Government to admit that provision has been made for preference to returned soldiers. My amendment is intended solely to limit that preference - that is to say, the concession of dispensing with examinations - to returned soldiers- </para>

The Commissioner should be relieved of the necessity of putting an applicant for a watchman&#39;s job under examination. In referring to this clause in my second-reading remarks, I dealt with the general principle of preference to soldiers. There was no intention on my part to suppress anything, and I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> to accept, that explanation. I object to the. repeated taunt that I have sought to suppress any feature of this amending Bill. If an advertisement were inserted for the. filling of. a vacancy on the list of Customs watchmen, the chief qualifications of an applicant would be honesty, reliability, and sobriety. Probably there would be 200 applicants for such a vacancy in Melbourne to-day. They would be compelled, under the Act as it stands, to furnish a. deposit, and they would have to lose time in undergoing an examination. The Commissioner would want only a man who could be trusted. All but one of the 200 applicants would have to go away disappointed. </para>

                        <para>- The position would be the same. What kind of an examination can be held in the matter of appointing a watchman? If the proposal now before the Committee is accepted, the procedure will be that preference will be absolute so long as there is one suitable soldier available. In the event of there being no soldier available) ordinary civilians will be eligible. Under this clause, also, exemption is proposed, both with regard to soldiers and civilians, in the matter of compulsory insurance. Many men who apply for such positions as that of watchman are of an advanced age. To compel an old man to takeout an insurance policy would be penalizing; him heavily. And, with respect to returned soldier applicants, it might Be that, on account of injuries received during the war, the rates of insurance would be exceptionally heavy. It would not be right to compulsorily impose such penalties. </para>

                    <para>.- I am not clear with regard to the. statement of the Minister that, until the list of applicants was exhausted, preference would be given to returned soldiers. If there were 100 applicants waiting, and an advertisement were inserted for twenty watchmen, I take it that those positions would be filled by suitable returned soldiers, whose names were listed. That might exhaust the number of returned men just then awaiting employment. Soon afterwards, however, another advertisement might call for more men. There would be numbers of returned soldiers looking for. jobs, but their claims would not be prior to those of civilians having their names on the list, who had been overlooked when the original twenty watchmen were appointed. I want to know whether those returned soldiers would have to wait until the whole of the civilians left upon the list had been absorbed. </para>

                    <para>. -  I do not quite agree with the Minister when he states that absolute preference will be given to returned soldiers until the whole of such applicants: have been placed. The clause provides for a special set of conditions in relation to a special type of applicant. There is nothing to prevent the Commissioner from calling for applications in the ordinary  way and filling vacancies from among persons who have passed the requisite examination. The clause specifically provides that returned members of the Australian Imperial Force may enter a certain division of the Public Service without undergoing an examination. It does not say that no other person shall receive appointment. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas&#39;</inline> amendment were incorporated, it would then be quite clear that the provision would apply to returned soldiers only; but that, at the same time, the hands of theCommissioner would not be tied so far as other persons were concerned. It is not likely that returned soldiers will be put into the Public Service in a haphazard manner. They must approach, to some extent, the standard required of candidates for the Public Service. It would be unthinkable if a returned soldier, without qualifications of any kind, were appointed to a vacancy in the Service &#39;merely because he was a returned soldier. The clause will open the door of the Public Service to returned soldiers so far as manual labour is concerned, but entrance into the other section of the Public Service will not be so easy. -I hope the Committee will agree to the amendment, because I should regret to think that we are throwing open any section of the Public Service to the general public without -examination, unless, of course, we were prepared to abolish the system of examinationsaltogether. </para>

                <para>SenatorRUSSELL (Victoria- Vice-President of the Executive Council) &#91;5.17&#93;. -I think there is some misunderstanding. I agree entirely with all that has been said by SenatorNewland, but we must remember that the clause will affect,notonly the masculine section of the community, but the feminine also. When vacancies are available for women we give preference to widows and close relatives of members of the Australian Imperial Force, and as the Act stands at present, if they wish to become permanent employees, they are required -to undergo some examination. There should be a generous interpretation of qualifications so far as the Australian Imperial Force applications are concerned. A man on his return might be a bit nervy as a result of war experiences; and allowance should &#39;be made for his condition in order that he may be able to settle down. </para>

Since I spoke on the second reading I have had a communication from a number of Public Service officers, who desire a clause to be put in to the effect that they shall receive not less than a full day&#39;s pay in such circumstances. I do not agree with that, but I believe that if a man is brought in to work on a public holiday he should receive not less than one half day&#39;s pay, and if he is working for more than half-a-day he should receive a proportionate amount over and above the half-day&#39;s pay provided. </para>

                    <para>. - The minimum payment for duty  performed by any officer on a holiday may be provided by regulation. The honorable senator&#39;s suggestion might operate in an undesirable manner. A telegraph messenger boy, for instance, might, on account of a rush of business on a holiday, be required to work for half-a-day, and if he were paid according to the terms of the amendment, he might get only 2d., 4d., or 8d., which would be quite ridiculous. If his holiday is broken into he should get at least 3s. or 4s. On the other hand, it would be equally unfair, if an officer in the Professional Division, drawing up to &#163;800 or &#163;900 a year, received as a minimum half a day&#39;s salary if he were required to work an hour or two on a holiday. It would be ridiculous to propose that a man in receipt of such salary should get half a day&#39;s pay for a few minutes&#39; service. The purpose of subclause 7 of this clause is to fix a regulated scale which will enable us to be. generous to the lower-paid officers called upon to work on holidays. </para>

                    <para>. - My proposal in no way affects the minimum which may be provided for under sub-clause 7. What I suggest would be fair to every officer in the Service. Under the Government proposal, if a man is brought back on a holiday for. only an hour, he will be paid for only an hour, and I wish to make it quite clear that if an officer is brought back on a holiday at all he shall receive not less than half a day&#39;s pay. The Service organizations who have circularized honorable senators on this subject ask for a full day&#39;s pay in such cases, but I am not prepared to go so far as that. I move - </para>

                    <para>. - Some years ago, before the application of Arbitration Court awards to the Public Service, officers received all holidays gazetted by Federal or State Governments. I find from one report on the Post and Telegraph Department that in Queensland alone, during the year 1910, in addition to the statutory holidays provided under the Commonwealth Public Service Act, as many as 374&#189; special holidays were proclaimed. Holidays are proclaimed in various parts of a State in connexion with shows, the opening of railways, the holding of carnivals, and so on, and in such cases a  postal official, if employed on the holiday, was entitled to a day off in lieu of the holiday. In December last, in accordance with the rule, what is known as Separation Day being proclaimed a holiday in Queensland, postal officials got their holiday, and if they worked on that day were entitled to a day off instead. I should like to know from the Minister in charge of the Bill whether, now that the Arbitration Act is applied to the Public Service, officers of our Service are entitled to a day off in lieu of holidays on which they work? </para>

                    <para>. -  There are eight holidays in the year which are common to the State and Federal Public Services, and are provided for in awards of the Arbitration Court. The granting&#34; in addition of all holidays proclaimed by a State Government was found to be objectionable, because it led in some of the States to officers receiving ten holidays in the year and in others receiving; sixteen holidays in . the year. It is felt that the number of holidays should be uniform for the Commonwealth Service throughout Australia, and so, in addition to the eight statutory holidays, it was decided to grant four extra days in each of the States. The Arbitration Court awards provide only for eight holidays. </para>

                        <para>- I am sorry that the honorable senator is not prepared to do so.  His  amendment does not go far enough, and does not meet the views of the public servants. It might be suggested that if an officer attends his office for an hour or two on a holiday he is adequately paid if he is paid a proportionate amount for his actual lost time. But it has to be remembered that if a man has to attend his office in the morning, his holiday is destroyed. In the circumstances, it is only fair that he should be paid at least half-a-day&#39;s pay, and, in my opinion, he should receive a full day&#39;s pay. What I propose would not interfere with the proposed power of the Public Service Commissioner to pass  a  regulation fixing a minimum pay for those who are not receiving a living wage. </para>

                <para class="block">It is not wise to leave too much to the Commissioner. It is much better to have in the Bill a provision which will give a clear and distinct understanding to every one concerned than to leave it to the Commissioner, who may put through one regulation to-day and a few days later send abroad another modifying or repealing the first. We have had too much of that sort of thing under the War Precautions Act, the Unlawful Associations Act, and the Defence Act, and no one knows where he is so far as those Statutes are concerned. </para>

It is an attempt to usurp the functions of the Arbitration Court, which has been duly constituted by Parliament.

In my opinion, the words used by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers aptly describe the position. The Bill has been brought forward for one purpose, and one purpose only, namely, to strangle the award of the Arbitration Court, and to defeat the course of justice.

                    <para>.-This Bill deals principally with the question of holidays. The clause dealing with the question which has been touched upon by Senators Senior and McDougall, is clause 5, which I intend dropping from the Bill. The Arbitration Court will then be left unfettered to deal with the whole subject of holidays. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Senior</inline> has referred to cases in which holidays, in addition to the statutory holidays, are granted. Now, if a Commonwealth officer in New South Wales is entitled to thirteen holidays, obviously a Commonwealth officer in Tasmania ought to be entitled to the same number. Similarly, if an officer in Victoria receives twelve holidays during the year, an officer in New South Wales should get an- equal number. Under our Public Service Act, officers receive twelve holidays a year in addition to three weeks&#39; annual leave. That is to say, they get one full day out of every ten for complete rest, and if we include Sundays they get two full days out of every ten. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McDOUGALL</inline> (New South Wales) &#91;6.10&#93;.- This clause distinctly says - </para>

                    <para>. - I am very jealous of the rights, privileges, and awards of the Arbitration Court. I owe my present position very largely to the fact that I am a believer in arbitration. I stand for arbitration in preference to direct action or any other method of remedying the wrongs of the people. For that reason I am anxious to avoid doing anything to interfere with an award of the Arbitration Court. I confess that I do not understand what will be the full consequences of clause 8 if it be carried. As far as I can gather, it appears to represent an attempt to get behind any award which may have been made in connexion with our Public Service. We must recollect that Arbitration Court awards are made only after very exhaustive inquiries. Our Public Service Association is given every opportunity of calmly and dispassionately putting its case, and so, also, is the particular Department which happens to be concerned in such litigation. Upon the evidence thus tendered an award is made. Yet, under this clause, we are asked to annul half-a-dozen awards which have been made by the Arbitration Court. At any rate, that is my reading of the position, and the remarks made by other, honorable senators fortify me in my belief. Therefore, I do not intend that my vote shall give the Government the power they seek. If we are going to do away with arbitration and Arbitration Courts, we should proceed in a straightforward manner. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not understand the exception which is being taken to the provision under discussion. In the Education Act of this State the authorities do not necessarily leave it to regulations to set out the compulsory ages of attendance. Take also the Factories Acts of Victoria. There are certain trades in which employees are not allowed to work more than a stipulated number of hours. There are provisions, also, for the observation of health and sanitation conditions. Regulations governing those matters are part of a comprehensive law. The Courts have dealt with the subject of holidays. The old Public Service Act did the same. In Tasmania, for example, there are ten Public Service holidays in a year. This  measure provides for the recognition of twelve, which means an increase of two public holidays in that State.In Queensland, public servants are given sixteen paid holidays in a year. The Government cannot justify granting public servants in one State sixteen holidays on full pay and those in another State only ten. Therefore, an average has been arrived at. In only one State will there be a reduction in number, whereas in all the other States Federal public servants will secure an increase. It is a compromise in the interests of uniformity. </para>

                    <para>. - The provision regarding public holidays was brought forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers; the award was given on the 15th June, 1915. In South Australia there are nine general holidays throughout the year, and three others - making twelve in all. One of the nine public holidays, which is celebrated throughout the State, is Foundation Day, namely, 28th December. Another such is the King&#39;s Accession Day. That, naturally, is also generally celebrated. There is the Prince of Wales&#39; Birthday, too. There are now outstanding five such general holidays, for which payment has been claimed and refused. Three of those days have reference to the year 1916, and the other two occurred in 1917. Several thousand pounds in wages are unpaid, and the Arbitration Court has said that that amount should be paid. It cannot be reasoned by the Minister that this clause will cover that situation. The clause is clearly defined - although I do not accuse the Government of so intending - to get behind the award of the Arbitration Court. I would like to see subclauses 5, 6,. and 7 left out. That would then throw the whole position back upon the awards of the Arbitration Court, both as to payments and direct holidays. We have not asked the Government for this Bill. This clause is calculated to override the decisions of the Arbitration Court with regard to payment of public servants who are called upon to work on public holidays. </para>

                        <para>. - I suppose. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that I have to thank the Government for giving me this opportunity of speaking on this very important question. If any honorable senator thinks that I am going to offer any defence of myself, because my name happened to be mentioned in conversation in connexion with this business, he will be grievously disappointed. I am perfectly satisfied, from the manner in which my name has been mentioned, that my long career in the public life of this country will prove a sufficient safeguard against the breath of any scandal. But there is something very much more important than any breath of scandal as concerns me or any public men. We have to deal with the . report of the Commission. I venture to say that that report is a most extraordinary one, not only as to the subject-matter, but as to the manner in which evidence was collected, and, what is worse than all, the bringing in of a finding absolutely against the weight of evidence, </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>In the course of my address I shall make frequent quotations from the evidence, and if I weary honorable senators I would like them to understand that since the report was placed in my hands I have been working on it for more than the customary eight hours a day, and yet I have not found time to read all the reports and all the exhibits brought before the Commission; and, . as I have not had time to digest them all, it is possible that my address will be more lengthy than otherwise would have been the case, because, in order to place the position before the Senate, I shall be compelled to give the facts, not in my own words, but by reference to exhibits, evidence, and statements made before the Commission.. </para>
                    <para>Why am I called upon to speak?&#34; I have said that this was a most extraordinary Commission, and I venture to say that I am addressing the Senate on the most extraordinary situation that has ever arisen with regard to Governments in this country. The Commission&#39;s report is, in effect, a vote of censure on the first Hughes Administration absolutely, and it appears to me that no one is left to defend that Government but myself. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> was good enough to-day to make an explanation concerning the conversation that took place between himself and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jensen.</inline> With regard to that conversation, all I want to say is that if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jensen</inline> is called upon to leave the Government because of the Commission&#39;s report, so is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> so is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell,</inline> and so is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> for the simple reason that the purchase of the Shaw Wireless Works was as much a business transaction of the Government as a business transaction carried out by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jensen.</inline></para>
                    <para>But I am not here as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jensen&#39;s</inline> defender. He may defend himself. I am here to-night as the &#39;defender of the action of the Government in purchasing the Shaw wireless plant, and never did I approach a question with as much misgiving of my own powers as I do on this occasion. I feel like a man who is passing through a horrid nightmare, seeing danger and frantically but vainly trying to raise an alarm, I would like honorable senators, if possible, to see the question as I see it, but I feel that my own powers are not sufficiently strong to make them realize the gravity of the situation. </para>
                    <para>What is it that I am called upon to do? Let me begin at the beginning. The Commission was appointed by His Excellency the Governor-General, as representative of His Majesty the King. I wish to put the whole of the Commission on record, as follows: - </para>

                <para>I have read the Commission for the special purpose of reminding honorable senators what the Commissioners were asked to do, and I say that the manner in which, the evidence was taken is calculated to bring  His  Majesty&#39;s Commission into disrepute and ridicule. They took evidence in a way absolutely abhorrent to our sense of British justice, and they reported absolutely contrary to the weight of evidence brought before them.. I have inquired, as far as my limited powers would enable me-, into the character of the Commission. I hold the Government responsible for their appointment. I can find nothing as regards the standing and character of the men about which I can complain, and I do not complain. But as. regards the manner in which the duty intrusted to them was discharged, I do complain, though. I cannot hold the Government responsible for that, unless they make themselves responsible by adopting the report. </para>
                <para>What is their report?. I venture to say that the report has created in the minds of honorable senators, and in the minds of the general public, the impression that the Hughes Government purchased the Shaw wireless works for &#163;55,000 when it might have been purchased for &#163;25;000, the option held over it by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Rupert</inline> Clarke. My task tonight is to show, not from statements of my own, but from evidence given before the Commission, not only that &#163;55,000 was a fair price, and this a good business transaction, but that in. making the purchase on those terms . the Government secured a real bargain. I realize, however, that greater ability than I possess would be required to dispel the impression which has been created in the minds of honorable senators and the general public that a huge price was paid for an inferior business concern. But I am going to tackle the task, and, as- I have already told honorable senators,. I shall bring no evidence to bear except facts which were in possession of the Commissioners when they arrived at their finding, as set out in the report laid on the table of the Senate. </para>
                <para>The Government have taken drastic action with regard to this report, and I am entitled to assume that in arriving at  their decision the Government assumed that the Commissioners found in accordance with the evidence. My effort is to show that the Commissioners took evidence in a way that was quite unwarranted, and brought in a verdict - because it is a verdict, whether they pretend it is or not - against the weight of evidence, and inflicted punishment on some people in this community. Now, let me take the question of the price. There was a volume of evidence before the Commission. Shall I be guessing too much if I say that not one member of the Ministry has read the exhibits placed before that body? Of course, Ministers may contradict me if they wish, but I venture to say that no man could go through those exhibits, in conjunction with the evidence, without coming to the same conclusion that I have come to. Why the Commission brought in a report contrary to the. evidence I do not know. That they have done so I shall endeavour to prove. I assert that there were before this Commission three men well qualified to give evidence as to the value of the plant. These are the three men : Mr. Ross, , of the firm of Messrs. Boss and Rowe, accountants, of Sydney, than whom no man stands higher in his profession in the &#34;opinion of the people of that city;Mr. Cornwell, manager of the factory, who, upon oath, before the Royal Commission, swore that he  considered &#163;63,000 a fair valuation, and not a false one; and Radio-Commander Cresswell, a man whose qualifications- are recited in the report. It is not necessary for me to read them, as honorable senators may read them for themselves. These three men. had full knowledge of the value- of the Shaw Wireless Works, and it can be shown from the evidence that, notwithstanding all. the cross-examinations, they positively swore that the value of the works which we purchased for &#163;55,000 was &#163;63,000. I fail, therefore, to see why the press of this country should placard the purchase of these works as a public scandal. There is the evidence of one man who disapproves of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ross&#39;</inline> valuation, but honorable senators, if they look. up. the report, will find how he withered under examination. </para>
                <para>I have read the powers of the Commission, and, perhaps, it will be in order now if I read the letters from Archibald Shaw putting forth the proposition to the Government. These are the letters - </para>

                        <para>- I hope that honorable senators will permit me to put my own case. There are numbers of the outside public, thanks to the big headlining of the press, who absolutely believe that. One man said to me, &#34; How do you propose to defend buying for &#163;55,000 a . plant that was worth &#163;25,000.&#34; I am going to show now what the option meant. Father Shaw had a mortgage of &#163;25,000 with a certain bank. He had put, not only years of labour, but his hard earnings into this plant. Finding that he could not get another penny from the bank, he managed to get <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Rupert</inline> Clarke to relieve him of his difficulties by giving his name to the bank, and, in return for an advance of &#163;27,000, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Rupert</inline> Clarke received certain shares in the wireless works and a mortgage over a certain part of the property in the plant at the particular time when the deal was completed. Of course, I can only get my figures from the report of the Commission. When Father Shaw finally disposed of his plant, he paid <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Rupert</inline> Clarke&#39;s solicitors &#163;25,000; he paid to Peters and Company, who had stores on which they had a hold in the plant, &#163;7,000, and he paid to the London Bank &#163;4,900 for the mortgage they held over the title deeds and houses which were included in the Clarke mortgage. All the mortgages against Father Shaw on the plant amounted, approximately to &#163;37,000. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I am not going to talk about business men. Because I am a Labour man some persons may ask, &#34; What can a Labour man know about business?&#34; I know this much about it, and it is that there are very few men in this Parliament or elsewhere who can get &#163;37,000 from business people in this country unless they have a property worth at least &#163;55,000. I can appeal to business men to say whether that is not a sound proposition. If a test of the value of the Shaw Wireless Works were required, it was already provided in the fact that the money lent upon it amounted to &#163;37,000. </para>
                    <para>I am slowly clearing away the mists that have been created to obscure this business transaction. The extracts given in the report of Father Shaw&#39;s business show that there were mortgages amounting to &#163;37,000 over the property which we purchased. This property was valued as carefully as any property ever purchased by any one. Honorable senators can see the evidence given before the Royal Commission, and they will find that the Commissioners report that no valuation of the stores was made and that some &#163;13,000 worth of obsolete stores were there. A most careful valuation of plant and stores was made by three persons, and after that valuation had been made they examined the stock-sheets and took stock of the whole property. Their stock-taking revealed the fact, and the evidence proves it, that the stocks were not of the value estimated, but exceeded it by some &#163;500. There was a valuation of the stock. I will not say by Sydney&#39;s most competent valuer, but by one of the most prominent and competent business men in Sydney, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ross.</inline> There was a valuation and estimate of the stock and plant by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cornwell,</inline> and there was a check of the valuation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ross</inline> by a departmental officer, CommanderCresswell. </para>
                    <para>Let us see how it is possible to throw doubt on all those valuations. We might assume that they were not to be trusted. It is said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ross</inline> had a conversation with Father Shaw before he valued the works. We might assume that Cresswell was not to be trusted, or that Cornwell was not to be trusted. We might assume that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas,</inline> the Chief Accountant, who assisted Commander Cresswell to make out his report, was not to be trusted. We might assume that the members of the Ministry who dealt with the matter were not to be trusted, and if we got so far, we might assume that this was a dishonest transaction. But have we reached the stage at which we can assume so much without evidence? The. press has assumed it. The Commissioners have assumed it, and the public, misinformed, have assumed it. But it is still quite contrary to the fact. I will read here a reference to the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ross</inline> as valuer. These are the Commissioners&#39; words - </para>

                        <para>A valuation of the machinery and plant at the works was obtained by the Minister from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> E. Boss, of the firm of Messrs. Boss and Rowe, architects and engineers, Sydney. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ross</inline> was selected for this purpose in the following manner: - Father Shaw (to whom <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ross</inline> was a stranger) asked him to visit the works, and on his arrival there Father Shaw . inquired whether he would be prepared to act as valuer as between Father Shaw and the Department. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ross</inline> said that he would. Father Shaw later mentioned <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ross&#39;</inline> name to the Minister as a suitable valuer. The Minister put himself into communication with the Minister for Lands of New South Wales (the  Hon.  W. G. Ashford), inquiring as to the suitability and reliability of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ross</inline> to represent the Navy Department, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ashford</inline> strongly recommended him. </para>

Father Shaw asked him if he- would act as valuer between the two, and he agreed to do so. We must assume that Ross was not an honorable and straightforward man. in making his valuation before we can say that there is anything wrong with it. I am borne out by the. Commissioners&#39; report&#39; when I assume that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ross&#39;</inline> reputation in his particular line stands as high as that of any other: man in Sydney, and that a conversation of a minute and a hall with Father Shaw was not calculated to corrupt him. Is that a fair assumption ? No one will deny that it is. </para>
                    <para>Before referring to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ross&#39;</inline> report, I want to say this in regard to it. He was closely examined upon it by the Commission, and the examination not only vindicated his report, but, tested by the keenness of an expert barrister and three capable business men, when he left the box so satisfactory was his examination that they never saw occasion to recall him. Here is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ross&#39;</inline> report, and when honorable senators censure the Government - because I am speaking of the Government who made this deal - for making a bad deal, I think they should have before them the documents which were before us as members of that Government, whilst added to the information supplied in those documents was our knowledge, which I venture to say would compare favorably with the knowledge of the Commissioners who were reporting upon this matter two years after the transaction occurred. There was our own knowledge, not only of the plant and machinery in a well-equipped concern, but also the conditions that threatened to overwhelm the Government in keeping things going so far as Australia&#39;s share in the war at that period was concerned.

I remember preparing a speech to be delivered on a motion regarding .wireless plant then before the Senate, and that preparation took me carefully through all the papers dealing with the settlement of the Marconi business.

                    <para>Say  the schedule of the equipment was .handed to me by the Shaw Wireless people at my request, as the Navy Department did .not .furnish me with lists as arranged  -  I took the schedule, together with my own notes, and went through the workshop. The schedule provided by the Shaw Wireless people was incomplete. There are a great many items omitted from that; and, of course, I made those items good in my own notes. Then, having .inspected the plant, its. character and condition, I devoted about five days, including a good deal of night work, in pricing those items from the material I had available. I inquired also from merchants in -the business .as -to .values. I consulted the tenders and prices accepted for equipment for Government purposes of .about that -date, ;and as regards the items in stock, consisting  of  a large collection of miscellaneous manufactured stock, nuts, small screws, bolts, and insulations. I inspected those, and inquired the prices at that time, in order to check the values of this stock. As regards the stock, a sheet was given to me of the stock, of the number of items in each section, which I referred to in my statement to the Government; and I took a note of what  Stock  was mentioned as being in the bin. That is to say, I selected here and there at random entirely, without any suggestion, from different bins,  and  examined the contents of those bins, and in a few cases I counted the contents, although I did not intend to take stock in that sense - but I examined the quality and condition of the stock; and then, taking the sheet, which had prices opposite the various items, I checked those items  Dy  inquiry in the mercantile world in Sydney; and therefore, in a sense, I did make  a  valuation of the stock, subject to the quantifies being correct. </para>
                    <para>You made your report, and your report gives &#163;40,406. That has no reference to the stock! -Yes; it &#39;has, most decidedly. </para>
                    <para>What does it covert - The stock represents &#163;12,000 of that item; and if you refer to my report, I say, &#34; In respect of the store stock .  a valuation has been taken as from the stock-sheets as on 31st May, 1916, and as forwarded to me by you. I have, however, checked throughout these lists the values, &#38;c, and  find  in every case the valuations stated are fairly correct.&#34; So I did not check the quantities, but checked the values. </para>
                    <para>And  then  you made a valuation of the plant? - 1 would  like  to say, at this stage, as regards  that stock,  I discussed it with Commander Cresswell - in fact, we could not possibly count all this miscellaneous stock - and Commander Cresswell told me that departmental officers would check the quantities. </para>
                    <para>With your report, did you send in a detailed schedule? - I sent in fifty-seven pages, altogether, of a schedule. </para>
                    <para>Is it all there on the file? - It should be. In my  letter,  I referred to the number of schedules, and what the various items are in detail. </para>
                    <para>In valuing the plant, what was the basic principle of the valuation which you followed out? - My instructions were such that I could only  take  the plant without any regard to its utility, and it was nothing to me if I found a grand piano  there,  or a machine for making ginger beer, I valued that as a machine for the purpose, whether it suited the Navy or did not. I did not have instructions to value for Navy purposes, and so took everything at its value as a going concern, assuming the utility  of  the machine was  there,  provided it was not obsolete and suitable for the purpose. </para>
                    <para>The valuation,  then,  was based upon the things <inline font-style="italic">in situ</inline> assembled and ready as a profit* making concern? - Yes, as a going concern. </para>
                    <para>And regardless, as you said, of its particular value in the business? - Quite. </para>
                    <para>Did you value it entirely as new machinery? No; that would not be valuing. </para>
                    <para>Yon allowed for depreciation? - Yes, and  I  allowed for appreciation. </para>
                    <para>Appreciation caused by the war? - Yes. I took it that there was somebody willing to sell and somebody willing to buy certain plant at that time, and that both parties were willing to do business. </para>
                    <para>Can you express it in percentages at all as to what was the appreciation all round on pre-war prices? - It would be impossible to do it, but I had it in much closer detail than that. I took every individual machine, and I referred to the English, American, or local prices where available, and I took the ruling conditions. - . </para>
                    <para>May I ask you how you got the appreciated price. For instance, a lot of material could not be obtained in Australia at the time. What prices did you take for that? - Where it could not be obtained in Australia, what I did was this: I took my English list of John Birch, and taking the average of that class of machine, I assumed that the same appreciation would apply to these particular machines. That, I considered, was a very sound position to take. </para>
                    <para>Did you apply that same principle to the stock value? - Yes. Most of the stock values I checked by quotations. The same principle was applied. </para>
                    <para>And you went into the question of any depreciation that you saw?- -Yes. </para>
                    <para>That is with each particular machine? - Yes, it &#39;was gone into in detail. </para>
                    <para>Did not that strike you as a very high valuation? - Certainly not </para>
                    <para>To take each particular machine and not look at it as a whole? - Absolutely, no. </para>
                    <para>You were taking it substantially at its replacement value, less depreciation? - Yes, most decidedly. That was the market value of the plant. As a matter of fact, those machines could have been sold since at a price exceeding my valuation. </para>
                    <para>You would have dismantled them. It means money to dismantle? - Dismantlement is a very simple thing compared with setting. </para>
                    <para>We understand the basic principles of your valuation, but how did you go about the depreciation? - If a machine were tight in its bearings and not worn out at all, and the accuracies are there, &#38;c, I allowed practically no depreciation at all, because it is for the purpose a new machine, and years make . no difference. A machine may be used three times in two years, and, under the circumstances, I would take that as a new machine. Obsolescence, of course, is taken into account. </para>
                    <para>Could that be so on the basis of your valuation? - I claim it was taken into account. </para>
                    <para>You told me that, quite apart from the utility of _ the machines at all to the works, whether ginger beer machine or a pop-gun, you took it at its market. value less any depreciation. What application has the principle of obsolescence to such a valuation as that? - In a few cases, and in this particular instance, in a very close association with Commander Cresswell, I wrote down almost entirely certain things that were obsolete, and from the nature of which could never be anything else but  obsolete, because they had an express purpose, and that purpose was past, and if they were no good to the Shaw Wireless they were no good to any one, such as certain generators. Wherever that principle could be applied it was applied. </para>
                    <para>I suppose, without a detailed examination, you could not tell me what amounts were involved in the obsolescence? - Not very much. I could not tell you the amount of the obsolescence. It referred more especially to wireless instruments, and certain instruments that were obsolete and of no value to anybody. It was not whether they were of value to the Navy Department, but of value to anybody else. </para>
                    <para>Or of value to the owner? - Or anybody. </para>

                    <para>Then you made this report, and, in your opinion, it was a fair and just valuation? - Absolutely. </para>

                        - The instructions were in regard to plant and machinery and stock, and nothing to do with buildings? - Yes. I would like to point out that, at the beginning of the address by counsel, a mistake was made which might have some impression on the minds of the Commission. The statement was that I did not value the stock. As a matter of fact, I did. 1 took their stock sheets at their valuation, and I found they were correct. Therefore, I did value the stock, because if there were things not included in the stock, they were given credit for, and it is part of my valuation; but I did not estimate the quantities. I checked the quantities in a few cases; but, as a matter of fact, that was left to tile other officers.

Here is the reportof <inline font-weight="bold">Mr, Cornwell.</inline> who had at the time the submitted it been more than &#39;a year managing the works for the Government.

The value of these installations, allowing reasonable profit, is estimated at &#163;350.  it is thought that the developments pf wireless telegraphy within the Commonwealth, apart from the wireless telegraph demands consequent upon the outbreak of war, justifies the Government in establishing its own workshops for the manufacture and repair of all wireless apparatus used by the Government.

At that time, when there were floating mines around our coasts, it was specially necessary, for the preservation of life, that vessels should be equipped with wireless. The Amalgamated Wireless Company was then presided over by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hugh</inline> Denison. That company is practically the German Telefunken Company and the Marconi Foreign Company. Honorable senators scarcely need to he reminded, so far as that last-named company is concerned, of the Marconi contracts scandals in Great Britain during- 1912. I will show, based upon reasonable evidence, that one of the chief reasons for the attack which has been made upon this purchase is that the Shaw plant, left in the hands of the Government, would materially increase the benefits and prosperity of the people of Australia, and would decrease the profits of the Amalgamated Company and the Telefunken and Marconi companies. I intend to prove that statement with the aid of dockets at my disposal. I will continue now with Commander CressVeil&#39;s evidence. First, however, I must refer to what I term a rather cowardly attack by the Commission - although I should not be angry enough to say &#34; cowardly,&#34; I suppose. But when a Commission attacks Commander Cresswell and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas,</inline> his chief accountant, as being weak in their estimates, I can only say that I happened to be sitting in the Court when those gentlemen were examined. And, although the Commission has said that their statements were weak, I came away from the proceedings with the conclusion in my mind that they knew their business from A to Z. I want the Government to look carefully into their reports, and see how their estimates worked out on the actual estimation of the plant. Under critical examination they showed that they considered that the output of work for the first year &#34; amounted to &#163;16,000, and showed a profit of 9 per cent. - deducting 4 per cent, for depreciation, and leaving 5 per cent, interest. The ten and a half months&#39; working of the plant returned &#163;18,000 worth of work, and showed a profit of 11$ per , cent. With those figures sworn before it, and having&#39; all the particulars in its possession, what am I to think of a Commission which says that those gentlemen were weak and did not understand their business? </para>
                    <para>All the evidence which I have so far quoted was in the possession of the Com- . mission before it presented its findings., I hold the Government responsible for the Commission, but not for its means and methods of taking evidence. But, if the Government persist in defending and supporting the Commission in the teeth of the evidence placed before them, then the Government must be charged with responsibility for this report also. Up to that time I have made no charge against the Government. Here are extracts from Commander Cresswell&#39;s evidence - </para>

It enabled, the ship to receive- submarine warnings, what tracks to avoid, what -enemy ships to- avoid, and so- on..

Whether the Commission intended it or not, it has- created in the public mind the idea that Commander Cresswell at that time, in the report which he made to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jensen,</inline> considered the sum of. &#163;40,000 a. fair value of the works. I had the advantage of sitting in Court while Commander Cresswell and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas&#39;</inline> were undergoing examination. Under conditions which were different  from the ordinary process of examining- witnesses, those gentlemen gave such evidence that. I left the Court with the clear impression, in. my mind - and a close perusal of that evidence will similarly affect the minds&#39; of honorable senators2- that Commander Cresswell had never intended his statement to mean that &#163;40;000 was- enough to- give for- the plant. H?e positively and&#39; clearly swore that &#163;40,000* should be the amount at which negotiations&#39; should1 commence. While- he considered&#39; &#163;57,000 was a* fair valuation-, he held that &#163;40,000 was a fair sum- upon which the Minister should begin negotiations for the deal. He clearly put- before the Commission, not that&#39; &#163;40,000 was the value, but that- it was the amount at&#39; which he reckoned negotiations should be- begun. Now, there- has- been much fuss and&#39; clou-ding-, of the- issue as- to the valuation of the property. I think that Mr: Jensen, in another- place, has defended himself-. Mb. Jensen, in his sworn evidence, said that be asked Commander Cresswell if the &#163;57,0.00 was too high, or. the-  &#163;40,OOO  was too low. That- was the position he took up. I ask honorable, senators to wipe away the suspicion that has been created by this Commission, owing to. its- inability to accept evidence, as, shown by the casual way in which, .they set it down as being in the nature of weak statements that they did not understand.. </para>

At the present time the works are doing better, because they are paying interest at the rate of4&#189; per cent, on capital and 7&#189; per cent, depreciation, which is a total of 11&#189; per cent., so that they are doing 2&#189; per cent. better in actual practice than What we estimated they would do. </para>

                        <para>I want . you to explain that reference in Commander Cresswell&#39;s recommendation of &#163;&#39;40,000. Apparently he . discussed that with you? - When . the matter . of the works arose it was &#39;.seen quite clearly that the jump from , a little works costing &#163;5,000 to a works of the character of the Shaw Wireless Works could only be justified if there was work for such a works. I, therefore, sat down and endeavoured to see what sources there were open for the necessary work, and although I cudgelled my brain as much as I could, and ran out <inline font-style="italic">pro formA</inline> profit and loss accounts, I could not see that we would be justified in . assuming responsibility for works at a capital value higher , than &#163;40,000 or &#163;45,000. The cardinal  thing which guided me was although, as war expenditure, emergency expenditure can : be justified, . from a peace point of view it might be found the works could not be carried on profitably. As to the actual value of the work, we did not bother whether it was &#163;60,000, or &#163;70,000, or &#163;80,000, but we did bother about what we could secure them at, because on that depended whether we could make a success or failure of it. When the Director came to dictate the last paragraph, I pointed out to him, as he was the responsible man, if he failed he would have to take a share of the blame, but if he could get it at what a tyro in business would know was a figure at which we could make a success of it, then it would be all right. There were <inline font-style="italic">only two</inline> possible- buyers, I pointed out to him, and I also pointed out the financial position of the works. We knew the bank was advancing money to Father Shaw; we knew there were mortgages over the works; and I had a very shrewd idea Father Shaw had an option, and . I made a  shrewd  guess that the option was &#163;28,000.I said to the Director, &#34;You offer &#163;40,000; pin yourself to it,&#34; and he put it in. </para>
                        <para>From your point of view, as accountant, you did not think the works in Government hands could carry a heavier capital charge from &#163;40,000 to &#163;45,000 ? - I was not going over that, but the works have been doing better than we thought. </para>
                        <para>At that time? - Yes; at that time I do not think we could have stated the case any higher. </para>
                        <para>If that were so your attitude was this: &#34;I am of opinion that on  a  purchase price of &#163;57,000&#34; - you have now jumped from &#163;45,000 to &#163;57,000 - &#34; these works should earn, after paying ordinary maintenance and running charges, interest and depreciation amounting to &#163;4,700 &#34; How can you justify  a  statement like that? - Because we are dealing with war time. That would be the result; we could earn interest on &#163;70,000 during the war. </para>

                    <para class="block">I listened to the evidence, and I left the Court with the impression that Commander Cresswell and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Williams</inline> were both of the opinion that &#163;57,000 was a fair valuation, but that in a spirit of caution, and knowing that  there  was an option over the works and that&#39; money was tight, they thought &#163;40,000 was a fair basis for negotiation. I leave the question of the values at that, but I ask if the Commission and the press were justified in saying that a scandal had taken place in regard to these negotiations. </para>
                    <para>I want also to give some figures that were submitted to the Commission. This is not guesswork. They are actual figures of working operations for two years. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas</inline> said that, taking into consideration the wages-sheets, interest at 5 per cent, on &#163;55,000, and allowing 4$ per cent, for depreciation, an output of &#163;16,000 would earn 9 per cent. Reference to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas&#39;</inline> evidence will show that for the first ten and a half months of working, on an output of only &#163;18,208 2s. 9d., the return was equivalent to Hi per cent., whereas he had calculated it would be 9 per cent, on an output of &#163;16,000. In the face of- this result the Commis.sion expressed the opinion that &#39; the valuation of the plant was weak. But let us see what the output was in the next year, and again I remind the Senate that these figures were placed before the Commission. In the second full year of working to 13th June,  1918,  the output was &#163;31,459, and the return was equivalent to 19 per cent.- If charges for management and cost&#39; of material were the same as last year, these figures establish definitely that the valuation was a fair one, and completely dispose of the statement made by the Commission that it had been arrived at on a false basis. </para>
                    <para>Now I am going to draw on my reason to suggest why this thing has happened. I do not propose to throw about any wild or reckless charges, but I am certainly going to say something about influences which are at work in our community to discredit Governments, to spread slanders about purchases, and in a general way to make out that every one trusted in this community is, more or less, corrupt and tainted. I say that, in connexion with this particular wireless project, I am justified in putting before the Senate some reasons wiry some very interested persons are very anxious that the Commonwealth Government shall not continue the manufacture of wireless plant. I referred a little time ago to the Marconi scandals in Great Britain, and I intend now to make one or two brief quotations from the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of the House of Commons in connexion with the matter. I find that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir H.</inline> Norman, speaking about the agreement entered into with Marconi, said - </para>

                        <para>But if the constructional part of the agreement is astonishing, the provisions regarding -royalty are still more so. The Government are to pay the company 10 per cent, on the gross receipts for a period of twenty-eight years. The Marconi master-patent, the well- known &#34; four sevens &#34; of 1900- the validity of which is being challenged in the Courts by <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> rival company - expires in eighteen months.  . . If the company to-day invented, or bought, a new process for wireless telegraphy of the greatest importance, its life could not exceed fourteen years.&#39; Yet the Government are to pay a royalty of 10 per cent, for twenty-eight years. </para>

And let it be remembered that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Marconi</inline> himself is a foreigner, and that the Marconi Company is in the most intimate relations possible with half-a-dozen foreign companies bearing the same name. These clauses, like the five years&#39; building monopoly, were, on the face of them, so intolerable that the Postmaster-General has already partially abandoned them. </para>

The Marconi Company have, from the beginning, done everything in their power to establish a monopoly in wireless. I do not blame them for this. As a commercial company, they want, and rightly want, to make all the profit they can, and nothing is so profitable as a monopoly. They did everything in their power to prevent the adhesion of this country to the Radio Telegraphic Convention of 1906, adhesion which was, nevertheless, recommended by a Select Committee of this House. </para>

                    <para class="block">Honorable senators might reasonably ask why I should go all the way to England to quote something against the Marconi Company, but I intend to refer now to what was done in Australia to show the reason why they should prevent the Commonwealth Government having a monopoly of wireless in Australia. &#34; Let me tell honorable senators that the Australian Commonwealth wireless system, though it may have been surpassed in the last few months, which is not at all likely, was, when we made this purchase, absolutely the best wireless system in the world. It had been reported upon by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swinburne,</inline> who was brought from </para>
                    <para class="block">Great Britain for the purpose in connexion with a case, then pending between the Marconi people and those conducting the Australian system, in the High Court of Australia. Realizing the difficulty with which they were confronted in dealing with this question, the High Court asked for an expert of experience to report upon and give evidence in connexion with the wireless systems affected, and the expert who was brought from Great Britain was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swinburne.</inline> The case is pending, the. expert arrives, and he examines the Commonwealth patent. I will say here, taking full responsibility for the statement, that the Australian Commonwealth wireless patent, although registered in the name of Balsillie, was the invention and production&#39; of Father Shaw and one of his best workmen, Mulrooney, I think, by name. I say that, in all fairness, these gentlemen handed the patent to Balsillie to be registered as the Commonwealth patent without seeking to make money out of it. I could quote Mr: Swinburne&#39;s report, which I have here; but what was his opinion upon the Australian wireless station? It was that it was by 33 per cent, a better system than either the Telefunken or the Marconi; that it was no infringement of their patents, and that it was something entirely new in the way of wireless. What happened ? The High Court were .awaiting for the evidence of the expert to give their decision, and, beyond all possibility of dispute, the verdict must have gone &#163;o the Commonwealth. There was correspondence going on with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swinburne,</inline> who wrote a report and made statutory declarations, and on the 4th June, 1914, the Government, represented by their solicitor, met the solicitors of Marconi and arranged an agreement. The agreement was that the Marconi people surrender to the Australian Commonwealth all interests in all their patents held in Australia for &#163;5,000, and the case would be settled, each party paying their own costs. Perhaps some honorable senators might think that I am throwing some aspersions on the Government who made that agreement. I am going to do nothing of the kind. It transpired afterwards that all that we have purchased were patents that expired within two months after that agreement was signed. The papers are on the table in the Library for honorable senators to see, and they will show that there was no doubt that if the case had been continued the. Government must have won it. To be fair to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn,</inline> I should say that there were prospects of other law cases. However, that agreement was entered, into. No one will say that to buy patents which expire two months after wards, and which we were not using - and we were using Father Shaw&#39;s system, which was by 33 per cent. abetter system - was a. bad bargain. No one will say that it was a scandal, or represented a corrupt practice. </para>
                    <para>When this wireless company came to the Governmentsitting at the table with their solicitors, they offered the Marconi interests in all their Australian patents. I. was in office before the. agreement was finally signed. It was signed by the previous. Government before going out of office, and we had to complete the agreement and protect the interests of Australia as best we could. We thought that we were buying from the Marconi Company their Australian Tights in the same patents that they held in England. But we were doing nothing of the kind. The basic patent of all wireless patents, known as the Goldsmidt patent, was being used by the Marconi Company in Great Britain. But when the agreement with the Commonwealth came to be looked into carefully, the solicitors found that the Marconi Company had not registered the Goldsmidt basic patent in Australia. It was registered by the Telefunken Company, who were acting in co-operation with the Marconi Company. . We were tricked out of that patent by the. Marconi Company at the conference. That can be substantiated by a reference to the papers, which are not secret and can be seen. They have often been referred to, as well as the correspondence between the Government and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swinburne,</inline> the expert. A perusal of the papers will show that the Marconi Company, through their representatives at the conference table-, deliberately tricked the Commonwealth Government into the belief that they were getting the same patent rights in Australia which the Marconi Company were exercising in Great Britain, whilst at the same time. the. patent rights that were of most value were registered in the name of the Telefunken Company, and we were cheated out of them. The competitors of the Australian wireless system are still those who control the Marconi and Telefunken systems, with a few Australian shareholders thrown in. Honorable senators may say that, these statements have no relation to the case under consideration, but I shall show that they bear very closely upon it. </para>
                    <para>I say that a conference sat to deal with the matter in 1914. I do not want to go exactly into the figures, but I know that they will stand examination. After the Cook Government were defeated at the polls the agreement was signed. I am not going to say that there was anything wrong with the action of the Cook- Government in signing that agreement. They conducted careful negotiations; and arrived at the conclusion that they were making a good bargain.. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swinburne&#39;s</inline> letters are amongst the papers, and let us see what sort of a hand we would have held if the case had been fought out to a finish in the High Court. I venture to assert that had <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Glynn</inline> known that the Marconi Company were keeping back two or three of the. most important patents he would have fought the case to a finish, and no one can doubt what the decision of the Court would have been.

Last time I saw Isaacs, about three weeks ago, he told me they had decided to drop the &#39;action on the patent corresponding to the English 7777/00, : and . to amend it to get the first claim right, and they would then start again on the amended patent and on the Telefunken patents. I told them that the amended patent would still not hit us on infringement, and an amendment would not effectively alter the meaning of -the Australian documents. I also &#39;reminded them &#39;that if they were successful, they would get damages assessed by arbitration from the time . of amendment to &#39;the expiry . of the patents. I also pointed out that the Telefunken patents did not cover &#34; quenched spark&#34; systems broadly. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Isaacs</inline> said he &#39;would have the position of the Telefunken patents examined, fcnd would then communicate with me. I have just had a telephone message from him to say, after full consideration of everything, they have decided to go on with the original action. T presume this means they will not amend, and will not sue under the Telefunken patents. At the -some time, if I could propose any amicable settlement, they would be only too glad -to fall in.

                    <para class="block">The sinister influence of these companies&#39; can be traced all through this case. When the works were about to be purchased, an article appeared in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Sun,</inline> and simultaneously <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Denison</inline> wrote a letter to the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> from Sydney. I have not looked the matter up to see whether the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> acted on that&#39; letter or not; I am simply showing what was done by the head of a great company, the majority of the shares of which are in the hands of foreigners. We know that Germans are among them. I do not know whether the Government have taken action in that case to wipe the German Interest out, but they could wipe it out with benefit. to Australia.. If this case does nothing else but make public the huge interests that are at stake, and let the people of Australia know that the Commonwealth Government have in their possession at the present time a wireless system which, if properly handled, will become the United British system, it will not have occurred in vain. The Imperial Conference of 1906 stood by, and for, such a united British system, but it has been intercepted, by the Marconi interests. I went through all these papers when I was Assistant Postmaster-General, in order to be able to answer innumerable questions on the subject, and also to speak on a motion moved in this Chamber. Seeing that I had all these facts within iny own knowledge, and the question arose of purchasing a wireless works which would equip Australia to free itself from this huge monopoly, am I to be charged with lack of business acumen, lack of foresight, and lack of ability to. understand the position? These powerful companies, which want to get Australia in their grip that they may earn big profits, have the influence of the press behind them, and that press brands as a scandal a transaction which was a fair and good bargain. That is my position. I had before me, not only the reports, but the broad interests and outlook of this concern. Let me see what influences have been at work. </para>
                    <para>I have given figures to show that the Amalgamated Company earned &#163;10,800 profit from ninety vessels in a year, or practically &#163;100 a year from every vessel installed with their apparatus. During the week I tried to get from the Navy Office the exact cost of the installation of fifteen of our Australian vessels with Marconi wireless apparatus in England, and the exact cost of fifteen similar vessels fitted with our own system. Unfortunately, the figures are not to hand, but I have other figures which show that there is a profit of about &#163;100 for every vessel to the Australian Amalgamated Company per annum. One hundred vessels installed with our own plant would not give us the huge profits that the monopoly take, but they would return us an ample profit, and at the same time provide for our shipping people a wireless system better than that of a monopoly at a cheaper rate. In these circumstances, cannot honorable senators see why there are influences at work in this country to discredit our transactions? Honorable senators do understand that, and know it is a fact, and the world will yet know that it is a fact. What do honorable senators think of this idea of the monopoly of besmirching every one who fights them ? Honorable senators know how they fought our former Postmaster-General, the late Charles Frazer - fought him to the grave. I will not let my feelings carry me away, or I might say that it looks to be a dangerous thing to oppose big foreign companies. I had better buttress everything I have to say by documentary evidence, because the days are coming when members of Parliament will not be believed, even on their oath, seeing that the company commands the press, and the press forms and commands public opinion. </para>
                    <para>This is the letter I received from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Macandie,</inline> Naval Secretary, dated 19th December, 1918, in answer to the inquiry I alluded to above - </para>
                    <para>Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner,</inline></para>
                    <para>Regarding your request of the other day,I regret that I have been unable to get a proper comparison as to the cost of the Commonwealth fitting wireless installation in a merchant ship and of the Marconi Company doing the same. I find that our wireless workshops have offered to fit ships of the Commonwealth Government line at, say, &#163;450. The Marconi Company work on different lines. They charge hire of installations - that is, they require a ship to pay a sum of &#163;225 or &#163;250 for a period of ten years. The installation always remains the property of the Marconi Company. Out of the money they receive they undertake to pay the wages of one operator up to &#163;100 per annum. So that, you see, an exact comparison is hardly possible. </para>

                        <para>- I think there are other means by which operators can earn more. Even that letter shows that from plant which our shop could put in for &#163;450, the amalgamated companies draw a profit of &#163;100 a year. Multiply that by a hundred ships, and, in view of the prosperity ahead of us in the near and distant future, by thousands of ships, and surely honorable senators can see that this is more than a party matter. It is a matter&#39; in which Australian interests are threatened. If Australian interests are managed as they should be, the Australian patent will become the British patent. The Australian wireless system will become the United British wireless system, and the amalgamated companies know it. I read of proposals to link Australia up with the rest of the Empire. Will it not be better to link it up with Imperially-owned wireless stations, with an establishment in which we can manufacture and repair all our requiremnts, and leave out of consideration the interests of these foreign companies which are fighting so bitterly and discrediting so effectively every public man who dares to stand in their way ? </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I shall leave the matter at that, and conclude, but it will be a long conclusion. I shall conclude with a review of the serious question of the way in which the evidence was taken, and finally with an amendment to the motion, recording the disapproval of the Senate of the method and manner of obtaining and taking evidence, and the fact that the report is against the weight of evidence, and calculated to bring  His  Majesty&#39;s Commission into disrepute, ridicule, and contempt. That is a serious amendment to move, but I am going to justify it by analyzing the manner in which the evidence was taken. I have already shown that the decisions of the Commission were against the evidence. Let me see the manner in which the evidence was obtained, and how it was taken. I am certain that it was illegally taken. Our Royal Commissions Act authorizes Royal Commissioners to send for witnesses, and compel them to produce papers. I am not attributing dishonest purposes to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McBeath.</inline> I dare say he has found himself in a position in which a great many more able men have found themselves before to-day -that is, a position entirely new to him, and that he knows nothing about. It is no discredit to a business man to say that he does not know how to conduct the proceedings of a Royal Commission. But when he has discharged his duties in a way which reflects discredit on the Commission and on the Parliament,thefacts should , be placed before the Senate. I hold <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McBeath</inline> responsible for every officer employed by the Commission. In this connexion, I propose to refer to the way in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> was inveigled into a conversation with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cornwell,</inline> which was placed upon record by a shorthand writer who was secreted on the other side of a wall, with a telephone held to his ear. What would we say of a High Court Judge who allowed his shorthand writer to go down to a secret interview of that kind, for the purpose of taking notes ? Would we say that it was a fair method of obtaining evidence? There are two written records of that interview in the exhibits which are in the hands of the Commission and of the Government. One of these records was written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Price,</inline> the shorthand writer to whom I have referred, and the other was written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cornwell.</inline> In <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cornwell&#39;s</inline> record, there do not appear the names of two senators who are mentioned in his evidence. </para>

Then, I would remind honorable senators that a Royal Commissioner can no more delegate his powers than can a Supreme Court Judge. A Royal Commission is at liberty to call witnesses, and compel them to produce documents. But it is not empowered to do what this Commission did, namely, to instruct <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brentnall</inline> to direct <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barton</inline> to go to a bank and examine my private banking account. As a matter of fact, I am heartily glad &#39;that the Commission did examine my account before I learned of it. That account showed that, apart from my parliamentary salary, no amount higher than &#163;5 had been paid into it, for the simple reason that I have no income other than that which I derive from politics. I am a professional politician, if people choose so to regard me. But this matter is not a personal one with me. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Starke,</inline> in examining me, said, &#34; I understand that you have given permission for your banking account to be examined?&#34; To that I replied, &#34;You should understand nothing of the kind.&#34; I have since found that the examination of my banking account took place months ago. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> was treated in the same way, and it is quite probable that every other honorable senator has been subjected to similartreatment. </para>

                            <para>- It was statements like that which broke down Carroll&#39;s evidence. He knew so little about political matters that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Starke</inline> soon discovered that his statements were so absurd that they stamped him as an unmitigated liar. The result was that he was not called before the open tribunal. In, these circumstances, I appeal to honorable senators to say that these secret tribunals must end. The honesty of several members of Parliament was impugned by Carroll without their knowledge. Any honorable senator can verify my statement by reference to the document which is in the hands of the Prime Minister. In this matter the Government would he well advised if they called to their aid the High Court Judges, put into their hands all this secret information, together with the Commission&#39;s report and findings and asked them to report upon the entire business. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Now, let me say what I think of the whole transaction. I believe that Carroll and Lynch conspired to blackmail certain people. I. believe that anybody who goes into the evidence and documents, as I have done, will arrive at a similar conclusion. I have already said that, until I read the Commission&#39;s report, I regarded Cornwell as a reputable man. But every charge of corruption preferred against any public man in the proceedings of the Commission can be traced directly to Cornwell, as indeed can all the evidence to buttress such charges. Cornwell and Lynch were working together. Cornwell was Lynch&#39;s superior officer. Upon the death of Father Shaw, Lynch got a communication from Carroll sympathizing with him, and asking for a memento of Father Shaw Lynch&#39;s mother then came to Melbourne and interviewed Carroll. Some time later, Lynch came to Melbourne, and met </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue>
                    <para>Carroll in Collins-street. They went into Collins House, and had tea together. Then followed a letter from Carroll to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jensen</inline> asking for employment. Lynch had already asked for employment. The letter asking for employment was simply a means to insure a meeting with the Minister. A few days later, Carroll presented his card at the Navy Office, and wrote upon it, &#34; Business - Shaw Wire- less.&#34; One can see the blackmail at work. Cornwell and Lynch had been together. Lynch had met Carroll, and almost simultaneously the blackmailing of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jensen</inline> started. He, too, met Carroll. A day or two afterwards, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jensen,</inline> getting wind of how things were going, played the trick of secreting detectives at the Navy Office; and at a certain stage in his interview with Carroll, he introduced them to him. That is a point worth knowing. </para>
                    <para>Now, let me get back to my statement that all the evidence in regard to corrupt charges may be traced to Cornwell. He was foreman of Father Shaw&#39;s works. Upon the death of Father Shaw, he took certain cheques to the bank to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Willis,</inline> who informed him that on the preceding Saturday, Father Shaw had drawn ?5,300, which could not he traced. Cornwell, upon thinking the matter over, evidently, for some purpose of his own, must have desired to trace that money. I am of opinion that he anticipated some favours from Father Shaw - favours which he would probably have received had that gentleman not died suddenly. Lynch, in his evidence, admits having expected certain favours from Father Shaw, including a trip to America. But there is ?5,300 not accounted for and a works manager under the Commonwealth Government becomes a private investigation officer. He meets Miss Hoad. She visits his house. She tells him she has a letter in which it is stated that two members of the Parliament were to get ?2,000 each. A little while after that Cornwell writes to her. She meets him in Moore street, Sydney, and he introduces her to the secret commissioner.  Her  story is told. She has not Father Shaw&#39;s- letter, but has quite a dramatic story to tell. </para>
                    <para>Honorable senators will find all that information in the secret exhibits. Cornwell has imputed corruption. Lynch has imputed the same; and Miss Hoad had a letter. If there was ?5,300 missing, is it not possible that Cornwell and Lynch put their heads together, assisted by this infamous Carroll, to blackmail certain people ? </para>
                    <para>I will turn to the evidence now, and will refer to the manner in which it was taken ; not the secret evidence, but evidence adduced in open Court - evidence which imputed dishonour to men against whom no charge of dishonour could be levelled. I will not call it evidence. It is a series of statements which have discredited the fair fame of a dead man. I propose to direct attention to the utterances of Cornwell; and honorable senators&#39; reputations, as well as those of Cornwell, are involved. I wish to put on record, first, some details with respect to Carroll&#39;s character - </para>

                            <para>- This lady was first examined in secret; but it is only fair to say that I am now quoting from the official public documents, so the evidence is not secret. But the point I wish to make is that the man at whom this evidence was aimed was dead, and his friends knew nothing about the inquiry, and had no opportunity to defend his character. These Commissioners - the &#34; trusty and well beloved &#34; McBeath, Verco, and Taylor - were so keen upon business matters that they have degraded His Majesty&#39;s commission. I am not saying that offensively; but I claim that, by taking such evidence as this, and publishing it, they have defamed the fair name of a dead man&#34;. And any member of the Government who indorses the report of the Commission must accept that same condemnation. This was a business Commission. Let us see how it pursued its investigations. The brutality of the Hun scarcely exceeds this examination of a lady. I will quote from Miss Hoad&#39;s evidence, as follows :  - </para>

                        <para>How did he address you? - By my christian name, Evie; as a matter of fact, he had a nickname for me, &#34; E--.&#34; He said in that letter the works were sold, and he would soon be . back in Sydney. He said he had drawn a lot of money out of the bank - I am not sure of the amount, but I think he said between &#163;6,000 and &#163;7,000, and he said, &#34;Long will probably get about &#163;2,000 of it. Jensen about the same,&#34; and there were some other names he mentioned that I cannot remember. </para>
                        <para>Have you thought over them since? - Yes. I could not remember them now. </para>

Was. the name &#34;Cresswell&#34; mentioned.?-I would not be sure whether it was mentioned in the letter, but he often spoke about Cresswell to me. I really could not remember what he said about him. I could not say if it was mentioned in the letter. </para>
                        <para>Was the. name of &#34; Russell &#34; mentioned ? - No. &#34; Gardiner &#34; ?- No ; I could not remember that. </para>

                    <para>Had those answers been different they would have impugned the reputation of men who knew nothing of such questions being put to a witness concerning themselves, who were not aware that an inquiry of such a nature was proceeding. Now let me show where the Commission, went off the track, and how it got away from the business side of its inquiry. And, by the way, I point to a discrepancy in the evidence of this lady. She swears that a letter from Father Shaw, written on a Sunday in Melbourne, was in her possession in Sydney on Monday. I do not know of any mail service which could make that possible. It may be held that this is only a slight discrepancy; but the fair fame and good reputation of a dead man rest upon such evidence. </para>

                            - How long had you known him? - My father had known him since he was a boy. I knew him since March or April, 1913 or 1914.
                        </para>
                        <para>And was it in 1914 he asked you to marry him? - Yes. </para>
                        <para>He was then a priest, as you understood? - Yes. </para>
                        <para>And still remained in the church? - Yes. He said he would leave the church as soon as he could. As a matter of fact, he asked me several times to marry him secretly; but, of course, I would not do that. </para>
                        <para>And he still remained a priest of the church ? -I suppose so. </para>
                        <para>Your relations were of the utmost intimacy, were they not?- What do you mean by that? </para>
                        <para>Sexual intercourse took place between you? - No. </para>

                    <para>That was an emphatic answer. Here is a business Commission pursuing a business inquiry; and, without one scintilla of evidence, except a woman&#39;s uncorroborated statement, it defames the name of a dead man by publishing such evidence. It will be seen how all this witness&#39;s womanly instincts revolted at the brutal course which the Commission was pursuing; And McBeath, &#34;the trusty and well beloved &#34; Commissioner, degrades His Majesty&#39;s Commission by pursuing an inquiry of that nature. And will the &#34; trusty and well beloved&#34; Executive advisers of His Majesty continue the degradation by allowing records such as these to remain in the archives of the Commonwealth ? </para>
                    <para>I will pass now to the worse than libel -the perjury of Cornwell; and I will  prove that that man&#39;s perjury was directed to the very same purpose, namely, the defamation of the memory of a dead man. Here is Mr.Cornwell&#39;s evidence - </para>

                            - In this report it is said on the Monday night before Father Shaw was taken ill there were two girls in his room. What does that refer to? Was it a fact that two girls were in his room? - Yes.
                        </para>
                        <para>During the night? - I could not say that. </para>
                        <para>There is a suggestion that merely two girls were in his bedroom, or was it that he was misconducting himself with the girls? - The girls were in his room that evening. </para>
                        <para>What did you infer from it? - I thought there was misconduct there, yes. </para>

                    <para class="block">I appeal to honorable senators to read the evidence, and carefully note the answers, and then remember that Cornwell was in Sydney, while the late Father Shaw was in Melbourne. The Commission also were aware of this fact, although they never took any steps to check this evidence, upon the strength of which this infamous scandal has been published broadcast throughout Australia. </para>

                    <para class="block">That was a month before Father Shaw died. I appeal to the Government that this is a most serious matter. Here is a witness who has sworn certain evidence about Father Shaw, and, in another part of his examination, admits that he had not seen Father Shaw for a month before he died. The Commission have allowed the fair fame of that man to be maligned when they had knowledge that the evidence was unreliable. If the Government permit this report to become an official document - if they do not withdraw it - I can only express my disgust at such a disgraceful method of conducting evidence. </para>
                    <para>I am not raging about McBeath. He may have undertaken a job he did not understand. He may have thought it was his duty to pursue this inquiry into the personal character of certain individuals in this way. But I ask: Is this practice to continue? I said earlier in the course of my remarks that we had taken one step along a very dangerous path, or that we had jumped back to the Dark Ages of the Star Chamber, with the result that even the dead are not exempt from the calumny of perjurers. I would not like my character to be besmirched  by  evidence of this nature. And, mark you, the man does not live whose character is so high as to be free of the menace that one day he might he held up to ridicule and contempt on the evidence of the most degraded and most disreputable being in the community. This is the reason why I have spoken to-night. This evidence is before the Government, and I say that the matter cannot stop where it is. It has gone either too far or not far enough. Let there be the fullest inquiry into the value of these works. . Let the Government select, not an expensive Royal Commission, but three competent men, and get their opinion as to the plant. The stores may have gone, but the books will show the turnover of the property, and the amount it has earned. Let them express an opinion as to whether the property was worth the money given for it. </para>
                    <para>Then, as regards the method of taking evidence, I say, let the Government submit all the exhibits and all the evidence, as well as the manner in which it was taken, to their advisers, and let them act as honorable men should act. I impugn not the Government. They are responsible for the appointment of the Commission, but they cannot be held responsible for the manner in which it conducted its business.

Already, as the result of the evidence taken at this secret inquiry, one public man has lost his position. Is that not punishment? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to-day gave his version of the interview which he had with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jensen.</inline> He was quite right to explain his position.

                    <para>The Commission knew this man was speaking, not of his own personal knowledge, but from a police report . Upon these three questions I earnestly urge the Government to carefully reconsider this report. They will have time before the Senate meets again, and I feel that even my statements are sufficiently serious to warrant consideration. And being so serious, I need not expect a reply tonight. </para>
                    <para>Let me conclude by saying that, as far as the Hughes Government was concerned, not only did we inquire into the exact value of these works before they were purchased, but the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> will bear me out when I say that we had depleted Australia of the weapons we would have been called upon to use had. Australia been attacked at that time. Here was an opportunity to secure a well-equipped plant - a plant capable of turning out 18-pounder guns, shells, and other munitions. I may add that we had already commandeered portion of this machinery, in order to increase the output of rifles. With all these facts before them, the Government decided to purchase the works. Imagine a man, in such circumstances, being called to the bar of public justice to answer for his action. I have answered for the Hughes Labour Government, which for two years of the war administered the affairs of this country in a manner that will bear favorable comparison with that of any later Government. I have not regarded this matter as a personal one;but I have spoken feelingly because of the imputation contained in the report of the Royal Commission that the purchase of the works was a blunder. I say it was a good bargain. I challenge any one to prove that it was not a good bargain. The value still stands. It cannot be questioned. And I emphasize the fact that its value to the Commonwealth was infinitely greater when Australia was threatened with invasion. That Australia was not attacked was due to the fact that the tide of war turned the other way, and the menace passed. But, I may ask, did not the Government carry out any other great undertakings without consulting subordinate officials? Did not the Hughes Government spend nearly &#163;2,000,000in the purchase of shipping? And on that occasion did we ask the advice of the Navy whether we could do so or not? If the war had ended within three months, any fool in the country could have risen and branded us as business bunglers. But the war lasted long enough for those ships to pay for themselves, and this business Commission will not inquire into that transaction. I have no feud against business men. Like other men, they are right enough in their own sphere, but, as , this Commission has demonstrated, if business men get outside their own sphere they are capable of doing things which are a discredit and a disgrace to them. I have no more to say, except to thank honorable senators for their attention. </para>

I have ascertained the facts in connexion with the dispute in the Court, and have had an opportunity of perusing the recent remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Powers. As a result, I propose omitting from the Bill all words that make it retrospective in character.

                <para>The public debt of the Commonwealth at 30th June, 1918, was &#163;284,022y072. Of this amount &#163;245,467,006 is accounted for by loans raised for war purposes, and our indebtedness to the Government of the United Kingdom for the maintenance Asc., of the Australian Imperial Force to the same date. In September last a further loan - the .seventh - was issued. The subscriptions to this loan totalled &#163;44,029,130. A further loan of &#163;4,750,000 was also raised by the Commonwealth in London for the States in August last. Allowing for these loans and for minor transactions, of the .public debt, the total public debt at the 30th November was &#163;332,615,059.  This includes the total of subscriptions- to the seventh War Loan, although&#39; some of the instalments pf that loan are still outstanding. </para>
                <para>War pensions in force at 13 th December, 1918, numbered 145j538,&#34; representing an annual liability &#34;of &#163;4,394,776. The expenditure .in 1917-18 was &#163;2,772,220, an- increase of &#163;1,622,968 over the previous year. A further increase of  &#163;2,227,790  is  expected this financial year. Provision is accordingly made  for  &#163;5,000,000. The average fortnightly rates of pension granted to date are &#163;1 16s. in the case of incapacitated soldiers, and &#163;11s. 2d. in the case of dependants. </para>

                        <para>. - It is exceedingly unfair of the Government to delay the presentation of these accounts until this moment. It is contemplated that Parliament will rise for a recess, probably to-morrow, and it is quite unfair to ask us to pass.Estimates for over &#163;13,000,000 with only a few moments&#39; consideration. I trust this is the last time the Government will do this. Parliament has a right to have ample time placed at its disposal, and senators, individually and collectively, should be in a position to express their opinions about the way in which the taxation wrung from the people is expended.  A  very profitable discussion could take place regarding the expenditure on the naval works at the Henderson and Flinders Bases, and on a variety of other sources of expenditure. I regret that the Government did not bring the Bill forward earlier so as to give the Chamber an opportunity of expressing its opinions fully and freely on the expenditure of this vast sum. I content myself at this moment with expressing my desire that on the next occasion they will give us a week or a fortnight to discuss a measure of this magnitude. </para>

I am not asking for a Government monopoly of shipping, but it would be a good thing if we had at least one line of mail-boats carrying our mails from here to Great Britain. It would take the place of the Orient line when the contract with them is finished.

It is, however, one of the matters that will be taken into consideration as early in the recess as that can be done conveniently. </para>

                        <para>.- I suggest that the Government, now that hostilities have ceased, might well reconsider its shipbuilding programme. The price that it has contracted to pay for wooden vessels  is a war price  that is altogether out of the question in peacetime, and the vessels themselves will not be needed. I understand that there are three keels laid down, but that it is impossible to get the labour that is needed, and under present conditions the vessels will not be afloat for years. I have already spoken of the need for organizing labour for this work, but nothing has been done. A skilled mechanic cannot be brought into existence by a wave of the hand. Men have to be taught, and it takes years to learn the shipwright&#39;s trade. I believe that we are paying &#163;32 per ton to have wooden vessels built which, when they are built, will not be worth &#163;12 per ton; indeed, they will be obsolete and useless. My suggestion to the Government  is  that&#39; it should get expert advice, and not throw the taxpayers&#39; money away. We are told that seventy vessels will be on their way to Australia before very long, and we may soon have more than we need. I should like to see the steel shipbuilding industry established here, but wooden ships are out of date. Ministers might well consider whether they cannot break the contracts which have been made for the building of wooden vessels, or, at least, see that no more such vessels are laid down. </para>

                        <para>. - I understand that the Commonwealth line of steamers has paid for itself. It has been carrying wheat for the farmers at 4s. per bushel, but freights have now been reduced by 25 per cent., and I hope will soon be reduced again by 50 per cent. Even then they will be much higher than pre-war freights. The rural industries would get an immense lift if we could provide that the farmers would make another 2s. per bushel from their wheat. That might be done by reducing the freights on wheat carried on the Commonwealth ships. As those ships have now paid for themselves, they could carry freights very cheaply. </para>

                    <para class="block">The future of Australia depends on the profits made from our primary productions, and if, before the New Year, we could assure the farmers of anything up to 6s. per bushel for their wheat, there would be an immense increase in production next year, and an immense increase in the national wealth. I do not suggest that we should take money out of the pockets of the taxpayers. What I say is that if our ships have paid for themselves, we can he content with freights that will cover working expenses, and thus allow rural produce to be carried at the cheapest rates possible. </para>

                        <para>.- Of course, everybody would like to see the farmer gets his wheat carried cheaply, and carried for nothing, if that were possible. But I would point out that the Government are dealing not unfairly by the farmers in regard to the very ships to which the honorable senator has referred. Quite recently these vessels could have earned &#163;15 per ton, instead of which they were utilized in bringing cornsacks to Australia for &#163;5 per ton. A loss of &#163;10 per ton was thus incurred in order to give the farmers of this country bags at a cheaper rate than would otherwise have been possible. Still more recently these boats refused , a further offer of &#163;15 per ton in order that they might carry wheat at &#163;8 per ton. In connexion with these vessels the Government have adopted a policy which is in vogue on the railways - a policy under which, whilst not losing sight of the commercial side of things, endeavours to give substantial aid to those who are engaged in our rural industries. </para>

                        <para>During recent years the long delays in deal ing with the Estimates have been responsible for the holding up of increments in the higher classes of the Public Service until the money was voted by Parliament. </para>
                        <para>In respect of automatic or statutory increments, however, it has been the custom to pay the amount of the increment from the date upon which the officer became entitled to it, evidently on the presumption that the officers of the Service on lower salaries - to whom statutory increments in general apply - would be harshly treated in being deprived of their increments for any length of time. </para>
                        <para>In connexion with theEstimates for the financial year 1918-19, however, a decision has been circulated by the Department of. the Treasury to the effect that increases in salaries provided for in the Estimates may be paid before the Estimates are passed only in those cases where the salary will not be increased beyond &#163;200 per annum, and where the increase is automatic under Act, regulation, or Arbitration Court award. </para>
                        <para>In the majority of the services of the Commonwealth automatic increments extend beyond &#163;200 per annum either by Act, regulation, or Arbitration Court award, and an officer cannot be legally deprived of his increase unless it is proved that his conduct, diligence, or efficiency is unsatisfactory. </para>

                            <para>- I have read the statement made in the newspapers. I do not suggest that because <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Higgins was unable to float a company in England that the proposition is not a good one. But we have men in Australia associated with the iron industry, and if the property is so very valuable it seems strange that they have not seen their way to take it up. That fact, however, does not necessarily imply that the proposition is a bad one. I wish to know whether the Government intend to take up the option, and what they propose doing with these deposits if the experts who report upon them affirm that they represent a good proposition. In such circumstances, do the Government intend running them as iron mines, and are they going to erect smelting works there? </para>

                        has asked what are the reasons which have induced the Government to acquire this particular option. In reply, let me say that the Government recognise that we have already started the iron industry in Australia upon a fairly big scale as an initial effort. We also recognise that it is highly undesirable that that industry should be allowed to grow up as a monopoly. Whatever may be said of a State monopoly, nobody doubts that there would be a considerable danger if we permitted this industry to develop into a private monopoly. When this proposition was submitted to us, the Government, realizing the tremendous possibilities ahead if anticipations were realized, thought it would be an excellent thing if by securing this option and thoroughly testing the mine, they could possess something which private persons might afterwards come in and take, or which the Government themselves might decide to work. We have acquired the option without any fixed policy as to what shall be done if we act upon that option. At present, the Government are endeavouring to supplement the information which has already been obtained. They are utilizing the services of local experts, so that it is possible that it may not be necessary to engage experts from the other side of the world

                        <para>. - I know the Blythe River district well. The Tasmanian Government have withdrawn from selection by prospectors all of the many large areas in their State which are presumed to contain iron ore deposits. The Blythe River deposits are by no means a new discovery. Substantial efforts, by way of prospecting, were made years ago, even before the railway was extended along the North-West Coast, from Ulverstone to Burnie. One of the great advantages of the Blythe River field is that it is within the immediate vicinity of the northern seaboard of Tasmania. The State authorities have from time to time caused examinations to be made of these deposits. With regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Twelvetrees,</inline> he has occupied high positions in Russia. He has been engaged upon mines in Turkey -in-Asia, and in other parts of the world, and is famed as a petrologist throughout the world. The Commonwealth Government are wise in that they have decided upon a substantial examination of the deposits; and, as I have indicated, that policy has been supplemented by the Tasmanian authorities, in that all important iron deposits throughout the State have been withdrawn, temporarily, at any rate, from the attentions of prospectors and speculators. It may seem a remarkable thing that a deposit, such as the Blythe River field, has not already been exploited by capitalists ; but it should be remembered that to open up an iron mine costs a huge sum of money. </para>

Any one who has made himself acquainted with the subject at all will know that the Blythe River deposits are among the best in Australia.

The Western Australian Government Geologist <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jacquet)</inline> investigated the Blythe River field some twenty years ago, and reported glowingly upon it. &#39; </para>

                        <para>. -  I draw attention again to the fact that we are not doing very much  for  the development of the Northern Territory. I am in fairly frequent communication with persons in the Territory, and reports received from that source have not been particularly creditable either to the Government or to anybody else. No attempt has been made to remedy the very unsatisfactory state of affairs existing there. Only within the past fortnight T have received communications complaining bitterly of the administration in certain directions. I communicated with the Minister, as I always do,  as I have no desire to go into unnecessary details in the Senate; but I hope that during the&#39; coming recess, the Government will do something practical. It is a matter for regret to&#34; those who take an interest in the Northern Territory to know that since the Commonwealth took over the control of that tremendous area practically nothing has been done to develop it. It is true that a section of railway has been constructed at the northern end, but nothing has been done so far to facilitate communication and induce settlement. I noticed by to-night&#39;s paper that the dissatisfaction there has become so acute that the Administrator has been assaulted. . This is a frightful state of affairs. It almost suggests that we are drifting into the condition of some of the South -American Republics, where, when they become, tired of a  President,  they assassinate him. One does not take so much notice of fighting between individuals in the streets - and -in Port Darwin streets you can get as much fighting as you like: - but it is a very serious matter indeed when the Administrator is publicly assaulted. </para>

                    <para>The expenditure on the Federal Capital site is another matter to which I desire to direct attention. I notice that in another place an attack has been made on the Government for what is termed lavish expenditure of public money. My inclinations are not in that direction. My. complaint is that, the Government are not spending sufficient money in certain directions, and I am afraid that parliamentarians are apt to pay too much attention to -agitation which originates in Melbourne as to the expenditure on the Federal Capital site. It is the policy of the Melbourne newspapers to protest against the removal of the Commonwealth Parliament to Canberra, and .if by alarming the people of </para>
                    <para>Victoria and Australia about expenditure at the Federal Capital they can influence the Government, their object will be achieved. I am anxious that work at the Federal Capital site should be gone on with. And, in connexion with this matter, there was a strange incident a few days ago. Certain members in another place led an attack upon the Government for what they termed lavish expenditure of public money, but the very next day the same gentlemen sought to press the Minister for Home and Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Glynn)</inline> to spend more money on Federal Capital works. I am supposed to be a member of the Territories League, but my political conscience was not sufficiently elastic to induce me to join in that deputation, which is, as I have said, comprised of members who the previous day were protesting against public expenditure. A considerable amount of money has already been spent on roads in the Federal Capital Territory and I am sorry to say that these roads are now being washed away by floods. </para>
                    <para class="block">Another reason why we should not shut down altogether on all public works expenditure is the fact that we shall shortly have large numbers of soldiers returning, and if works are not authorized there will be lack of employment, which would be a serious matter. There is another unfortunate feature of this economy craze among a certain section of the people to which, I regret to say, the Government are giving way. During the period when public works were being proceeded with, the Government gathered together a staff second to none in Australia. These men, the best the States could produce, were drawn from the various State services, but, owing to the policy of economy, many of them have been dismissed from the Works and Navy Departments. This is a most serious matter, because in the future when the people will assuredly demand that these Commonwealth works shall be recommenced, it will be extremely difficult to replace those men who are being dismissed , and are scattering throughout the length and breadth of Australia. When it is desired to secure the services of professional men, those who are in reasonably good positions with private employers, or the State Governments, will not be attracted to the Commonwealth Service, in view of this fear that, in the course of a few years, the Government, again acting under pressure from the press, will once more initiate a policy of economy. </para>
                    <para>In the Northern Territory it is essential that some scheme for local government should be inaugurated, so that the people up there will have some right to regard themselves as citizens of the Commonwealth. At present they are practically outcasts. They have no vote, and no connexion with the Commonwealth, though they are called upon to pay taxation. It is time the Government gave serious attention to this matter. </para>

                        <para>. - Some time ago I drew attention to. the condition of the hotels in the Northern Territory, as the result of information received by me from a number of travellers, who represented that the accommodation there was most inadequate. I think, on that occasion, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Russell</inline> stated that my information was not altogether correct, and that a certain sum of money had been spent by the Government in improving the hotels. Since then I have met a number of friends from the Territory, and they have assured me that the conduct of the State hotels there is anything but satisfactory. I also took the trouble to write to friends in Port Darwin, and have obtained some photographs of these hotels, which I shall forward to the Minister. One hotel seems to be rather a flash affair; but I understand that, on last year&#39;s trading, it lost approximately &#163;6,000. The other two hotels, judging by the photographs, are little better than broken-down &#34; humpies,&#34; but I am informed that they showed a profit of &#163;19,000. I think the Government should utilize some of this huge profit in an honest endeavour to provide better accommodation. I would suggest that these two hotels be pulled down, and decent places built. I hope the Minister will give the matter attention, and that some steps will be taken to remove the grounds for complaint. </para>

                        has made a reference to a disturbance that has occurred in the Northern Territory, and I find from the press that certain telegrams with respect to it have been censored. It is important that we should receive accurate information about the Northern Territory. If we are to be allowed to receive only such information as the Government or their officers choose to let through we shall not be in a position to deal with questions affecting the Territory on their merits. We had an assurance that the censorship has been removed except in regard to two matters - the employment of troops, and our relations with our Allies. I should like to ask whether the disturbance which occurred in the Northern Territory affects either of those relations in any way. If not, why have these telegrams been censored?

                        <para>. - I desire at the close of the session to impress on the Minister for Defence the fact that, for all practical purposes, the war is over. In the internment camp there are a number of people who have not been brought to trial and found guilty of any offence, and they should not be detained any longer. The Minister stated recently that there are thirty-eight Australian-born persons interned. There can be no question of the deportation of any of these men, as they cannot be deported from their own country under any ordinary law. What is the use of keeping them interned any longer? It may be said that it is necessary to do so for the public safety until peace is signed. Many of these men have been interned because of injudicious and unwise things they have said. I have in mind one man of some wealth, a land-owner, Australian-born, of German parents, who resided in the Albury district. Since the last conscription referendum he has been interned with two Germans.  His  parents were Germans, but he was himself a man who occupied in the Albury district, even after the war started, a very prominent position as  President  of the local Shire Council. He is a man against whom I venture to say, in the early period of the war, nothing could be urged. The Government owe much to his assistance in dealing with a  district in which there are a great many German settlers. The Minister for Defence, I am sure, knows the man to whom I am referring. </para>

They wear a different complexion to-day to what they wore while the war was proceeding. The case which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has mentioned, and which I know, because the honorable senator corresponded with me in connexion with it, is one  of  these cases. With a number of others it has been reviewed within the last few days, and instructions have been issued for the release of the man referred to. The cases of Australian-born internees are under review in the same way. Speaking from memory, I do not know of any Australianborn internees who, for any reason, should be deported. </para>

                        <para>. - I invite the attention of the Minister for Defence .to the fact that there are forty or fifty members of the Australian Imperial Force locked up in Darlinghurst Gaol, Sydney, because they have committed some military offence. I have in mind in particular the case of one. man who enlisted, and was for  a  considerable time in camp at Liverpool. During his stay there he was unwell, and for three months  Was  in hospital suffering from a wounded hand. He was of opinion, that he was of no further use to the military, and when he was able to leave the hospital he openly handed in all property belonging to the Defence Department and walked out of the camp. &#39; He was absent without leave for a considerable number of months; but recently he was discovered, arrested, and tried, and I think, was given a sentence of 120 days&#39; detention. What is the good of keeping  a  man of that description in gaol? 1 do not know the particulars of other&#39; cases,  but I have, no doubt that in a considerable number of them the offences were more or less of a nominal character. I know that in the Military as well as in the Naval Service a good deal of discipline must be maintained; but now &#39;that the war is over no good purpose can be served by keeping these men in gaol. I hope that the Minister for Defence will at once review these cases, and will liberate if not -all, then as many of these men as possible.- </para>

Still, the Minister might take the matter into consideration and see whether it is not possible for correspondence addressed to his Department to be more promptly replied to. &#39; . </para>

If there is a prospect that the formal declaration of peace will be considerably delayed, these cases will be reviewed before peace is declared.

                            <para>- It has to be remembered that men do not necessarily become morally reformed when they enter a military camp. The sentences in these cases come before me, and. I know that men have been convicted of stealing from their mates. For an offence of that character committed in camp the offender should be treated in the same way as if the offence were committed outside. Because there is a prospect of peace there is no more reason why such an offender should receive his liberty than that a man in a civil gaol who committed a similar offence should be released.- In the case of military misdemeanours during a state of war severe sentences must be imposed-; but. now that the military situation has been altered there is good reason why those cases might be reviewed. </para>

                    <para>As to the delay in answering correspondence, <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> can only say that the Department does its- best in this matter. The correspondence with the Department seems to - come in waves, and may &#34;be largely increased by the alteration of a regulation, by an alteration of pay,, and so on. It would . astonish honorable senators to know what an enormous increase in correspondence the declaration of the armistice brought upon the Department. As soon as it was known that the armistice was signed people wrote to ask why their boys could not be at once sent back to Australia. The volume of the Department&#39;s correspondence increased by 25 per cent, immediately upon the signing of the armistice. Honorable senators will realize that we cannot immediately increase the staff by 25 per cent, in such cases, but I shall endeavour to see that no avoidable delay occurs. </para>

If there is one branch of science which more than another has proved of value in time of war it is aviation. I think that it might be applied with equal benefit to the country in time of peace. I should like to know whether it is the intention of the Government to continue the Aviation School with a view in the not distant future of supplying some of the back-blocks of Queensland, beyond such places as Longreach and Cunnamulla, where the people get mails only once a fortnight, with an aerial mail service. It would be a Godsend to the people of remote districts in all the States if by co-operation between the Defence Department and the Post and Telegraph Department an aerial mail service could be provided. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not want to commit myself to an aerial mail service, as that does not come within my Department. I can say, however, that I regard it as the duty of the Government to encourage aviation. I think I have shown that by what I have done in this direction on the military side. We believe that it is essential in the interests of defence to encourage aviation. We can have a large number of trained aviators at much less cost than by keeping a large staff of military aviators, who would have to he fairly highly paid. The policy we have decided to adopt in regard to the military side is to keep a nucleus and instructional staff of military aviators, and we shall try to get the Government to agree to encourage private aviation in every possible way, so that when war comes we will not only have the military aviators trained, but will be able to call in all those private aviators, train them for military service, and use them in time of war. I shall bring the honorable senator&#39;s suggestion with regard to mail services under the notice of the Postmaster-General. </para>

                        <para>On the 12th May, 1916, Father Shaw saw <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cotes,</inline> one of the directors of the Shaw Wireless Limited, and informed him that he thought he had a good chance of selling the works to the Government, and asked for, and on the 15th May, 1916, obtained, an option of purchase of the company&#39;s interest&#39;s for &#163;25,000. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>That paragraph has created the impression outside, as well as inside, Parliament that the late Father Shaw sold to the Commonwealth Government for &#163;55,000 a general electrical engineering plant, with land and buildings, over which he had an option for only &#163;25,000. In my judgment, that paragraph was so worded by the Commission as to produce upon the press and the public mind the impression I have indicated. The fact is that Father Shaw&#39;s interests and shares in land and buildings equalled the amount of the option obtained from the company, and were not, and could not be, , included in such option, hut formed part of the assets that were subsequently acquired by the Commonwealth Government. From January, 1916, Father Shaw held these works under lease, from the company for the manufacture of munitions, an undertaking that involved the introduction of new and special plant, which was added at Father Shaw&#39;s sole expense, the company having no liability whatever for its installation. In addition, the land upon which a 150-horse-power plant was erected, the land on which a large two-story &#39;building was erected, and is now used, by the Navy Department for- offices, and a considerable area of land which is not built on at all, were assets over which Father Shaw had an option. He alone contracted, and was the only one who could contract, for their sale. and transfer to the Government, without ,any reference to the company. The public should know the facts. </para>
                    <para>In order that the public might know the facts, I wrote to ifr.. P. R. Cotes, of the firm of Whiting and Aitken, who* was a director of the Shaw Wireless Company at the time of the sale, and pointed out to him the opinion that had been formed of the option given by his company to the late Father Shaw. I received from him the .following reply.: - 19th December, 1918. </para>

                    <para>I have your letter of the 18th inst., in which you say that the &#39;impression has ,got about that the late- Father Shaw sold to the Commonwealth Government for &#163;55,000 an industrial undertaking -over which he &#39;had an option for &#163;25;000. </para>
                    <para>If any -such impression has been created it is erroneous, for the property over which Father Shaw  had  .an option -for &#163;25,000 was .a portion only, of what .he sold -to the (Commonwealth for &#163;55,000, and the other .assets which were included in the sale .by Father Shaw to the Government were of vital -importance for .-the successful carrying on of the works, as a perusal .of my evidence given before the Commission will show. </para>
                    <para>In reference to that evidence, I have not carefully perused it, but I know that at least one important misprint has been made, for I am recorded as having said that the rent to  be  paid to the company by Father Shaw, as lessee of the works, was to be &#163;15,000 for the first six months, whereas the amount which T stated was &#163;1,500. </para>

                    <para class="block">I say without hesitation that the impression referred to has been created both in the public mind and in the minds of members of Parliament. In justice to myself, if I am entitled to any justice, and to the memory of the man who is dead and gone, the Government should take the earliest possible opportunity&#39; to clear up this -matter, and -show the -public of Australia that in those works, quite independently -pf what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Herbert</inline> &#34;Ross, a competent valuer, said, the Commonwealth received full value for the money paid for them. I do not propose to go into the question of whether the Government did or did not get the utmost value for .the. money, because I am not competent to offer an&#171; opinion, nor have I ever claimed to know everything, about the value of the machinery, or the buildings, or the land on &#39;which they were erected. All that I am guided by is the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ross,</inline> of the firm of Ross .and Rowe, who went thoroughly and exhaustively into these valuations, . and sent his report on to the Government. I think it was that report which largely influenced the Government in purchasing. I shall give one instance to demonstrate the very conservative view that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ross</inline> took, in valuing the works for the Government. Some honorable senators -know the tremendous steel tower .erected at the works. It is 210 :feet high, with a spread at the &#39;base of about 30 feet /square. The very (best steel was used in its construction. In valuing it for the &#39;.Commonwealth Government, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ross</inline> .set &#39;.down its value  .at &#163;250, which would -not &#39;he mere  than  sufficient to pay for the bolts used in its .construction. That is one instance to show how .careful <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ross</inline> was not to overestimate the value of .any .article or machine, or other part of the plant, which it was proposed by the .Commonwealth Government to acquire:- </para>
                    <para>In the Commission&#39;s report it is stated, in large type, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> drafted the letter containing the .proposition for the sale of the works to the Minister for (?he Navy. That is perfectly true, as I have already told the Senate and as I told the Commission. I have here the . document which I did not draft, but helped Father Shaw to draft, so that I am. not entirely responsible for it. It consists of a dozen lines, and its&#39; language is most formal. I am reading it, so that honorable senators may .estimate the influence that that language would be likely to have upon the mind of a Minister or of the Government - . </para>

The works comprise stock, electrical, casting, and wireless manufacturing plant, and recently one of the most up-to-date shell factories has been added at a cost of &#163;4,500. The Postal Department did not at the time feel disposed to purchase. Now that your Department has taken over complete control of wireless, I have the honour to offer to you the whole of my company&#39;s plant, &#38;c, which will include the Shaw wireless patents, for the sum of &#163;57,000. My company has spent &#163;100,000 in establishing these works, and I may also point out that the whole of the machinery is in first class order, carrying a full staff, and, therefore,I present the proposition to you as a complete and well-organized going concern. </para>

This was his concluding paragraph - . </para>
                    <para>The whole manufacturing plant is in very excellent condition, not more than three machines are showing signs of wear, and in this case the tools are such that accuracy is not called for or necessary.

                    <para class="block">The statements made by the Commission have, I realize, reflected very seriously upon me. These statements, though unsupported by evidence; have been accepted with as little hesitation by the members of my own party as by those on the Government side of the House. Consequently, as I feel that no man against whom rests the slightest suspicion of improper conduct should occupy a seat in a National Parliament, I have, after a very careful consideration of the, matter, determined, in the interests of parliamentary honour in the first place, and of my own party&#39;s reputation in the second, to tender to the  President  my resignation as a senator for the State of Tasmania. I shall do this with the full consciousness that I am guilty of no wrong against my own reputation or the interests of the country. The only offence with which I can be justly charged is that I have endeavoured to give effect to that plank of my party&#39;s policy which says that the Government shall manufacture its own requirement&#39;s in respect of all its public activities, and, perhaps, that I assisted a good old friend in what I deemed a legitimate way. That he chose to reward me for that help beyond the bounds of generosity is a circumstance for which I should not be held responsible. What assistance I was able to render him I have no cause to regret, and never will regret so long as I live. He was a friend with whom I am proud to have been associated, notwithstanding the vile slanders that have been levelled at his memory by certain witnesses who appeared before the Commission. I shall place my resignation in the hands of the  President  at the earliest possible moment. </para>

When we were discussing the proposal to impose a war tax of&#189;d.  on  postal matter, I said that it was a pity that it was not proposed to charge&#189;d. on every newspaper that went through the Post Office. If such a charge were made, the authorities would not have much objection to registering publications as newspapers. I can understand that at present, when a number of copies can be sent together in a bundle, not exceeding 20 ounces, at a charge of 1d., the authorities are not anxious to increase the number of registered newspapers. But if, as in New Zealand and in England, every copy posted had to pay &#189;d., the position, so far as the Department was concerned; would be different. </para>

It exists chiefly for the propagation of certain political views. I would not press for the registration as a newspaper of a publication that should not be so registered; but it is difficult to know why <inline font-style="italic">The Nation</inline> has been refused registration. I should be glad if the Minister  who in this  Chamber represents the Postmaster-General will obtain, within a reasonable time, a fuller statement of the attitude of the Department in this matter, and I hope that the Postmaster-General may see his way to register <inline font-style="italic">The Nation.</inline></para>

                        <para>. - I would point out that the publication of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> has  just  spoken is the official organ of the Victorian branch of  theSoldiers&#39;  Political Federation, and that  a  similar newspaper, which for the past two years has been published in Queensland for the Queensland branch of. the same organization, is registered by the Post Office as a newspaper. I should like to know why a publication is registered in one State as a newspaper and in another refused registration? It would seem that the refusal to register <inline font-style="italic">The Nation</inline> is the act, not of the Postmaster-General,but of some of his subordinates, who are not desirous of increasing the number of publications carried at newspaper rates. Inasmuch as <inline font-style="italic">The Worker</inline> and various other political rags are allowed  to  spread their views broadcast, the soldiers&#39; political paper should be given the same opportunity. </para>

                        <para>.  - Since the&#189;d. war tax was imposed, the summonses and quarterly accounts sent out by the friendly societies have been charged postage at the rate of1&#189;d. each. This charge isa heavy burden on societies which have many expenses, and whose difficulties have been increased by the war. The summonses to which I refer are printed forms,  on  which  is  filled  in in  writing the amount of dues owing by members of the different bodies. Because of  a  few figures in writing, they are treated by the Postal Department as private letters, and charged postage accordingly. The Government might show some leniency towards the friendly societies in this matter, seeing that these societies are doing . so much for the people of Australia. Not merely the State Governments, but the Commonwealth Government benefit by the organization of friendly societies, directly and indirectly. It would be  a  boon to these societies if the Government applied penny postage to the carriage of their letters. On behalf of these organizations, I desire to direct the attention of the Minister to this very desirable reform. </para>

                        <para>. - It is quite impossible to understand why the Postmaster-General should refuse to register certain newspapers. His action is  a  fair sample of the annoyance to which persons are subjected when they engage in a perfectly legitimate enterprise. I have been informed that it is the intention of the Postmaster-General to review the registration of newspapers. I think that Parliament should indicate to him, in an unmistakable manner, that no action in that direction will meet with its approval. Newspapers  are  the best mediums for disseminating  information  throughout the country, and any suggestion to remove their registration,  so  as to increase the rate of postage upon them, should not be tolerated. It is bad enough that they should be subjected to the increases which were recently imposed under the Postal Rates Act. If the Government are going to remove the extra postage which has been placed upon the letters of friendly societies, it should also remove the additional postage which has been imposed upon the correspondence of trade unions. </para>

I allude to the position of the members of the Royal Australian Garrison Artillery, who are at present  stationed  at the  Queenscliff  Forts.Senator Earle, it will be recollected, asked some questions in respect of this matter the other day, and I wish to quote the following newspaper article dealing with it :  - </para>

                        <para>Members of the R.A.G.A. serving at the Queenscliff forts recently asserted that the Minister of Defence had done them an injustice when he stated in the Senate last week that they had been enlisted to replace the permanent men who had gone on active service. They contended that they had joined the R.A.G.A. with a view to being drafted into the siege reinforcements for service abroad. The Minister for Defence, in alluding to this contention yesterday, said that while it was true that the siege reinforcements had been drawn from the R.A.G.A., men enlisting in the R.A.G.A. since the outbreak of the war had only taken an oath for service in the Military Forces of the Commonwealth. Reinforcements for the Siege Brigade could only be absorbed slowly, and some time ago, when reinforcements for other arms of the A.I.F. were urgently needed, an offer was made to men serving in the R.A.G.A. to transfer to the A.I.F., but only a few men responded to the invitation. Regarding the demobilization of the men now serving at the forts, he stated that it would be necessary to retain sufficient men to man the guns until the permanent troops attached to the R.A.G.A. returned from overseas service. </para>

                    <para>The grievance of these men is that the Minister&#39;s statement that they were given an opportunity to enlist in the Australian Imperial Force, and refused to do so,  is  somewhat unfair.

They enlisted in the A.I.F. -for the purpose of reinforcing the troops in France, and it is an insult to say that they enlisted &#34; to replace men on active service,&#34;&#39; when they were eager to. proceed to France and risk their lives in the service of their country. The statement is further misleading in that they did not (at any; rate knowingly,) enlist in the R.A.G.A.; they enlisted in the A.I.F. They were drafted by the military authorities into the Siege Artillery, presumably on account of their physique and general fitness for big gun work. If the terms of their enlistment were as stated, the military authorities should have made it quite clear to them at the time, when I am certain few, if any, would have entered the Siege Artillery. </para>
                        <para>Now, shortly after the signing of the armistice, it was stated by the Government that no more reinforcements would be sent, and that all in camp, would be released, yet the Minister states, in regard to the Siege Artillery, &#34; their release was now under consideration.&#34; The Minister is evidently not, cognisant with what has taken place, or he would be aware that a large number of Siege Artillery men who&#34; enlisted months later than my son have already been released, and, this being the case, what need is therefor &#34; considering &#34; the release of the remainder? On behalf of my son and other men&#39;s sons similarly detained, they should be relieved of their duties without further delay. - I am, &#38;c, </para>

But. the position there seems to be inconsistent with the. statements which I have already quoted. </para>

                    <para>Doubtless the Minister has been misinformed as to the true position, and trust that you will give the true facts of our position. </para>
                    <para>Just prior to the armistice about twenty man of the R.A.G.A.. applied for transfers: to the A.I.F. general reinforcements, and after some time elapsing permission was given them to do so. Their reason for so doing was with the idea of getting away for active service sooner than they would have done had they remained. </para>

                <para>It seems to me that these men have  a  genuine grievance. A number of them were desirous: of going to the Front, and were prevented from doing so, and they resent, the Minister&#39;s statement that they were given an opportunity&#39; to enlist in the Australian Imperial Force, but refused to avail themselves of it. I also desire to know whether an attempt cannot be made to release these men from further duty by replacing them with men who have had experience in siege field battles abroad. </para>

                            <para>- That is not my fault. If I take an oath I read it and see exactly what I am swearing. In addition to that, there was a question read out to them when they enlisted, and that question was not the question which is read out to men who enlist in the Australian ImperialForce. These men were sworn to obey the Commonwealth Military Force regulations. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll,</inline> in one of the letters which he quoted, supplied the answer to another letter which he read. One of his correspondents affirms that these men were only given an opportunity to enlist in the Australian Imperial Force some two years ago, and that that opportunity related to the Field Artillery. Later on he states that they were given an opportunity to transfer, and that some of them did so, just before the armistice was signed. </para>

                            <para>- I may add that some mouths before that a number of these men, through their friends, were pressing to be sent to the Front. The Officer Commanding the Australian Garrison Artillery said that it would be useless to send them to England to do nothing. Thereupon I said &#34; Well, give them an opportunity to transfer to the Australian Imperial Force.&#34; That offer was published in every one of the camps, and very few of the men accepted it. These are the facts of the case, and I have nothing to add to them. They are backed , up by documentary evidence in the Department. </para>

I know of the case of one&#39; man who was shot through the kidneys and the legs, and who applied for a pension, but was put off with 7s. 6d. a . week. Before the war he had been accustomed to earn about &#163;4 a week in a rather strenuous form of employment, but, owing to his wounds he could not return to that means of livelihood. I understand that he is a single man. It is not fair that he should receive such a miserable amount of pension. He is not even able to work full time upon the class of employment in which he is engaged. </para>

                            <para>- It is, in the way of creating the impression that the country is not looking after returned men. Every person who professes a desire to assist in repatriation should make it his business to be able to tell men placed like the returned soldier just alluded to all the facts, so that he may secure the benefits held out to him under the repatriation scheme. It was discouraging to me to learn of a blind man getting up in a meeting of the Returned Soldiers&#39; Association recently, and complaining that he had been left to live a dog&#39;s life on 30s. a week. Every man present, and certainly every officer, should, have immediately put that unfortunate man out of his mental troubles by informing him of the sum he could receive through the Repatriation Department. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> will give me particulars of the case he has mentioned I will endeavour to trace that man and tell him how to secure the benefits to which he is entitled . </para>

                    He must know, however, that there is a natural desire to close the proceedings of Parliament in order that honorable senators may be in their own homes at Christmas tide. Christmas Day will be on Wednesday next. . If we do not complete the business before Parliament by to-morrow there will be no prospect of a number of senators reading their natural desires for that occasion.

                    <para class="block">As honorable senators are aware, there has been, amongst a certain section of the community for some time a considerable agitation for the repeal of the War-time Profits Act. The Government has considered the matter very fully, and has come to the conclusion, for two main reasons, that it is not advisable to repeal it at this juncture. The Government has also  recognised that the existing legislation imposes hardships upon certain people, and it is the intention of this Bill to remove some of the objectionable features of the Act, so that it may rest with greater equity upon the business community. A memorandum has been circulated amongst honorable senators setting out in the usual form the effect. of the proposed amendments. In clause 8 certain additions are made to the classes of businesses to be exempted from taxation, amongst them being shipbuilding in the Commonwealth, and such mining businesses, not including coal, as are specified by proclamation. Agencies are also to be exempted, so far as concerns income which is the result of commissions and not the utilization of capital. There is also an important alteration of section 11 of the principal Act. Under the present law, if a business has not one pre-war standard, the Commissioner has power to grant relief from the taxation to insure the financial, stability of the business. It is now proposed to widen his discretion. There are, of course, running through the Bill some other important alterations, but as this is an amending measure, I suggest it would be more appropriate if I were to deal with the various provisions at the Committee stage. The principles of the Bill do not need discussion, as they were debated when&#39; the principal Act was before the Senate. I assume, therefore, that I shall be suiting the convenience of honorable senators if I refrain from  detailed explanation until the Bill is in Committee. </para>

                        <para>. - The whole principle of the Bill is founded upon a wrong basis, and 1 think it is very much to be regretted that the Government has not . seen its way clear to repeal the existing legislation in regard to this matter. I am sure this course would give a great  deal  of satisfaction. I am informed on very reliable authority that notwithstanding all the care which seems to have been taken by the Government to insure that new businesses shall not be unfairly handicapped, they will be severely hit by this Bill. I am pleased to see, however, that amongst the amendments made to the existing law is: one which treats cooperative societies in a more satisfactory manner than under the original Act. I. understand1 it is proposed to exempt them altogether  from  taxation so far as concerns  profit  the result of trading with members of the society That clause will afford  very much-needed  relief, and I hope it will not be interfered  with  in Committee. The Government appears to be determined to pass the measure, but I think it is absolutely unfair to place a comprehensive amendment of a complicated and troublesome piece of legislation in our  hands,  and expect us to give it intelligent consideration in the few hours now at our disposal. </para>

                        <para>. - It is, indeed, reducing the powers of review, constitutionally possessed by this Senate, to a farce to expect us to systematically review an intricate financial measure  of this kind  at,  this hour  of the morning, remembering that yesterday morning we were  also  sitting at about, this  time.  How can jaded senators, even of the keenest mental attainments,  instantaneously address themselves to anything like a. sensible review of a  measure like this ? The Bill has, no doubt, been substantially amended in the other Chamber, &#34;which was most deliberate in its treatment of it. It was before that House for a considerable time, and it has now been brought before the Senate in its amended form. But this is not the last word. So perfunctory seems to have been the handling of the measure in another place that, notwithstanding the time occupied in deliberating upon it, we now have placed in our hands a whole page of amendments upon this amending Bill for insertion at this late hour. No doubt, circumstances over which the Government have not complete control have brought about this pass. I am not in the habit of making rash statements; and although I shall always, as far as my physical powers; permit me, remain up to assist in sittings necessary to clear away the business of the Senate, I will not, if I am present at any future sessions of this Senate, consent to anything of this kind again. I warn the Minister in charge that if anything of a similar nature is attempted in any other session of this Senate at which I am present, I shall vote against the suspension of the Standing Orders, so that something approximating studied consideration may be given to measures, particularly those of an. intricate character. </para>

                    <para>I regard the Act which this &#39;Bill is. introduced to amend as. a -most pernicious measure, and I am sorry that it remains on the statute-book. The conditions of life in New Zealand are almost identical with the conditions in Australia. The people there are our people, they speak the same language, and. belong to the  same Empire, they prosecute their adventures and enterprises in similar circumstances, and yet, after .one year&#39;s experience .of a -war-time profits tax, the Parliament of th.at Dominion, repealed it <inline font-style="italic">in toto.</inline> If the &#39;Commonwealth were well-advised they would, have taken an exactly similar step,. I. am not going to oppose this amending Bill because it&#39; to some extent ameliorates the unpleasant incidence of the original measure. &#39; I was so astonished at the phraseology of the clauses&#39; pf  the  &#39;original Bill when I came to examine them minutely that I said that I washed &#62;ny .hands of all responsibility in connexion &#39;with that measure. That attitude on my part towards -this legislation is well understood by my constituents. I have protested against the provisions of the War-time.. Profits Act ever since it Was under consideration in this Chamber. </para>
                    <para>Though&#39; the Treasurer may derive &#163;1,000,000 or &#163;2,000,000 &#34; of revenue from the operation of the existing Act, the fact must not  be  lost  sight  of that by .reason of its existence damage to the extent of tens of .millions of pounds has been inflicted upon the enterprises; energies, and commercial life of our people. This is not a country in which large sums of money have been made as war-time profits by (people who are called profiteers. I am satisfied that there are a great many industries which the assessment under the Act will disclose have not provided &#163;1,000 as available for this taxation. We have already on the statute-book taxation measures by means of which profits can be levied upon in the interests of the community. The Income Tax Act is a .measure of that description. In this country, inhabited by 5,000,000. of people, who will presently find themselves burdened by hundreds of millions of debt, every energy should be bent upon the stimulation of production. But the War-time Profits Act may be said to have held a shadowy and sinister hand over all the activities and enterprises of the people.. In connexion with every industry of which I can think, many more enterprises would have- been .launched if it had not been passed. I suppose that it is the reluctance of ;the Acting Prime Minister (M.r. Watt), who is also Treasurer, to relinquish anything in the way of a substantial amount, of revenue that has induced the Government&#39; to propose to amend, rather than to repeal,&#39; the existing Act. We are told that a &#34; &#39;bird in the - hand is worth two in the bush,&#34; and that a &#34;.sprat may be used to catch, a mackerel,&#34; but I venture -to say that in business eagerness to secure a small amount of profit may sometimes prevent a man from being in a position to avail himself of the opportunity to make a much larger profit. It is a distinct mistake, by legislation of this Character, in order to collect &#163;l/000;000 or &#163;2,000,000 in. taxation, to check enterprise -. which would result <inline font-style="italic">m</inline> a long period of fruitfulness, not only from the &#39;Stand-point of the taxpayer, but in regard to the production of &#39; wealth, which is so essential to .the welfare of the people at this juncture. I do not think that any one can closely estimate the vast amount of&#34; damage which the existing Act has inflicted upon the Commonwealth&#34;, and I -most earnestly desired to see the Government repeal the measure, as was done with a similar Act in New Zealand. </para>
                    <para>We can deal with the Income Tax Act in such .a way as to levy upon any large profits. In fact, they automatically come within the ambit of that Act. &#34;This mea- . sure, to- be properly styled, should be called &#34;The Bar to Enterprise Act.&#34; I believe that it will ameliorate the incidence of the operation of the existing Act, and I shall, therefore, support the second reading. When the original Bill was -under consideration I contended that the industry of tin-mining was one which should be specifically exempted from such legislation. The price of tin went up to an abnormal point during the latter portion of the war period, but it is tumbling down like the waters of a cataract at the  present time. A further fall is .announced in the newspapers which have ju.st been circulated, and no one can now put a limit to this falling tendency. I should like to know whether the assessments disclosed anything like big war-time profits in this industry. The high price of tin did not stimulate production in Australia, for the simple reason that the -existence of the </para>
                    <para class="block">War-time Profits Act barred enterprise and checked the necessary&#39; inflow of capital, without which new tin ventures could not be started. </para>
                    <para>There is a retrospective feature of this Bill which has been much commented upon in the press, and it affords an additional buttress to my argument for the repeal of the original Act. We are unable at this hour of the morning to discuss the features of this amending Bill which are pernicious or are beneficial as amendments of the existing law, which, no doubt, some of them are. </para>

It may. be contended that tin-mining can be exempted .by the new wording of sub-paragraph <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> in clause 3,. but that process requires a proclamation, and conditions the undoubted promise made by the Administration that tin-mining would be exempt. Tin-mining is not mentioned&#39; in sub-paragraph &#34; <inline font-style="italic">i,</inline> although right through the tin-mining fields of Australia it was expge&#39;ted and understood, and indeed proclaimed by&#39; the press, that tin-mining was to be exempted by the provisions of this amending Bill. There are times when it is necessary for the Minister in charge of a measure. to be inflexible, but I submit that this is not one of those occasions. A great deal of friction will be obviated, and much of the existing unpopularity of this tax in mining districts will be removed, if &#39;my amendment is accepted. It does specifically what was expected to be done, but has not been done. I move - </para>

                        <para>. - It-ike no exception to the moving of the amendment; indeed, I appreciate the courteous manner in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> stated his views ; but -I regret that I am not free to accept his proposal. The clause empowers the authorities to exempt tin and other mineral propositions under circumstances which seem to justify such an exemption. No doubt, the honorable senator would like to make&#39; the exemption certain. I do not know on what he based the statement that a definite promise was given that it would be made certain. No doubt, a sympathetic reply was given to those who sought that concession, but there was no definite promise - I speak from memory, and may be at fault - that &#34;tin-mining would be exempted. There is reason for leaving the question of exemption to  be determined according to the circumstances of any particular mining company. There might be circumstances which would justify an exemption at one time, and at other times make it unnecessary and unfair to the industries that are taxed. Where a good case can be made out, the Administration will be inclined to give a concern the benefit of the exemption.- Possibly, if I represented tin-miners to any great extent, I would be better pleased to have the exemption set out in the Act; but the Government has endeavoured to deal fairly with, those who have approached them, and the Administration . might well be left to determine whether an, exemption shall or shall not be given. If it be thought that that might provide opportunities for favoritism, I would point out that a clause is to be Introduced which will make it necessary&#39; for the Government to immediately inform Parliament of what it is doing in this regard, so. that Parliament may have&#39; an opportunity to take any steps it likes to &#39;check improper action by the Administration. </para>

                        <para>. - I regret that the Minister cannot see his way to accept the amendment. I am not sure that it could not be- introduced in a more appropriate place, and in better form ; but the object which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> and Others have in view would be achieved if it were carried. This matter was discussed at considerable length when the principal Act was before the  Senate, and from the moment that that Act became law until the introduction of this Bill, representations have continued to be made to the Acting Prime Minister and Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt).</inline> Instance after instance of the actual working of the Act, in its relation to tin-mining, has been brought under his notice. I believe that every honorable senator and honorable member who waited on the Acting Prime Minister on this subject is aware that the reply given by him was not only very sympathetic, but one which led all to infer that tin-mining would be dealt with in the manner proposed by the amendment.Senator Millen says that the reply of the Minister might have been sympathetic, but that it did not contain any definite promise. I shall go further, and say that subsequently, just as the Bill was about to be introduced, an intimation was given to me which resulted in my sending to Tasmania the statement that the principle embodied in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap&#39;s.</inline> present amendment was incorporated in the Bill. </para>

I shall support the amendment, and I trust that other senators will do so too. On a previous occasion- it was by a very narrow majority that a proposal to include tin-mining among the exempted businesses wasdefeated. </para>

                    <para>SenatorBAKHAP (Tasmania) &#91;3.11 a.m.&#93;.- I did not wish to divulge any confidence but undoubtedly an intimation was made to me in very definite terms by a member of the Government, who prompted me to assure all the members of the tin-mining community that I met in Tasmania and in Melbourne that tin would be specifically exempted. The indefiniteness of the permission to exempt makes increased production impossible. Notwithstanding the high prices of tin, it is practically impossible to obtain any capital for Australian tin-mining ventures, though any quantity of money can be obtained for enterprises to be registered in Malaya. People say that, as bin is a wasting asset, it will be better to leave it in the ground until such time as the profit obtained from the mining of it will no longer be taken away under a war-time profits tax. Although such high prices ruled during the latter part of the war, the production of tin in the Commonwealth has not increased. I shall not say much about the attitude of the primaryprodiucers towards this Administration, but surely Ministers can see the writing on the wall. In two recent elections representatives of the primary producers have defeated the candidates of this party. That has happened because it is believed that the Government is not sufficiently considering the interests of the primary producers. A gentleman in </para>
                    <para class="block">Launceston, whose influence has always been worth at least from 50 to 100 votes . for the Liberal and National parties, has told me that if the measure is not amended in accordance with the implied promise that was given, under no circumstances will he again vote, for a Nationalist candidate, and he . will vote for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating</inline> and myself only on personal grounds. That is a straw in the stream which indicates the trend of public opinion. This gentleman has spent between &#163;4,000 and &#163;5,000 in taking machinery from a mine which was exhausted some years ago, and in placing; it on his own mine. Realizing the profits likely to be won from the tin ore in this long-exploited mine, he says, &#34; If the implied promise to exempt tin-mining is not fulfilled&#39; I will shut down my mine, and discharge the sixteen or twenty miners who are employed upon it at present.&#34; He recognises that he- cannot obtain, a fresh yield of tin every_ year from the old and exploited mine which he is endeavouring to rehabilitate. This Bill will, therefore, check tin production. If honorable senators choose to stultify themselves, if they are willing to forget that the attempt to exempt tin-mining in connexion with the principal Act was defeated by only one vote, I shall be sorry for such of &#34;them as have to deal, with tin-mining- constituencies. Directly the armistice was proclaimed the price of this particular metal commenced to tumble, and since the 10th November its price has fallen as much as &#163;70 or &#163;80 per ton. With a market so unstable, if tin-mining is not to be specifically exempted from &#39; the operation of the Act, I despair of the&#39; intelligence of members of this National Parliament. </para>

                        <para>. - In reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap,</inline> I would point- out that the very class of. mine that he has attempted to portray - the mine which is up against adverse circumstances - will be met by the clause which we are now considering. But, in addition to that, class of mine, .there are tin mines which are reaping handsome profits. So long as the war-time profits tax is in operation there is no reason why one business which is returning a handsome profit should pay the tax, while another venture, which is making- ah equally handsome profit, should be exempted. That would not be equitable. What the Bill provides is that we shall collect the tax on the profits which are earned, but if there are any mining ventures which,- . because of the circumstances&#39; to which reference has been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap,</inline> are not yielding a fair profit, we will exempt them from taxation. </para>

In Tasmania, where a good deal of this class of mining was carried on for many  years, one could go into the tin-mining centres of the north coast at  any time during the last couple of years, and find there scarcely one eligible man. Why? Because they had all gone to. the Front. The result- was that tin-mining was. dependent for labour on men who had been associated with it for the best part of their lives, but who were beyond the recruiting age. -The effect of this Act has been to disperse that labour. </para>

That circumstance, however, has no relation to the principal Act. I repeat that tin-mining was dependent for labour upon men who were not eligible, but who had spent the greater part of their lives in mining operations. Since the slump took place in tin-mining, to which our war-time profits taxation largely contributed, the lessened labour which was previously available has been dispersed. When tin-mining is revived in these centres it will be very difficult to obtain suitable labour. </para>

It will be necessary for people to embark upon those ventures before they can ask for the proclamation. Will they embark upon them when they are in the position of uncertainty described by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> ? I do not think so. There will first be the difficulty of assembling &#39;the requisite labour which has been dispersed, and, over and above this, those who contemplate embarking upon this enterprise will say, &#34; If we do so, we have no assurance that we shall be exempt from the operations of the wartime profits tax,&#34; These are the circumstances which make the outlook for tin-mining most unpromising. </para>
                    <para>The Minister has referred to the necessity for laying a proclamation upon  the  table of both Houses, which will then be able to deal with the action of the Government, but that state of affairs cannot arise unless there is a proclamation of exemption.

I do hope that honorable senators will follow the course which they followed on a previous occasion, and realize the importance of the tin-mining industry. </para>

The purpose of this clause is that a man shall not &#39;be exempt; but if, side by side with the income arising from his own personal exertion, he is also earning an income from some capital employed in the business, that portion of his income shall be subject to the Act. This clause will extend a large measure of. relief to a considerable number of people throughout the community. </para>

                    <para class="block">The idea in this amendment is very simple and just. Sometimes a property is let on a lease, and one of the conditions is that certain improvements are to be effected, which: improvements ultimately fall in for the benefit of the owner of the property, at, the expiry of the lease. This clause permits the lessee to deduct a proportionate amount of the value of those improvements for the purposes of his assessments. Take, as an example, a lease for a term of ten years, on which  &#163;1,000  worth of improvements have been erected. The lessee could deduct, over that period, at the rate of  &#163;100  per annum. </para>

                        <para>.- I join with other honorable senators  in  expressing the hope that this will be the last occasion upon which we shall be called upon to pass legislation in this way. It is. impossible for honorable senators, wearied and jaded as they are, to handle intricate measures at such short notice. I protest against this course. The Senate being the house of review, should really have more time to consider carefully the effect of the amendments that are brought before it. This Bill has been carefully considered in another place, but that is no reason why we should neglect our duty. It is particularly unfair to expect the Senate to deal with a Bill like this, brought down at such a late hour, and. in the last day practically of the session. </para>

                            <para>- It does, and I point out it is the fault of our present parliamentary system. If the session lasted a month or two months longer the position would not be altered at all. Sooner or later some system will have to be devised by which, possibly, the Senate will be enabled to initiate legislation. At present the trouble is so many Bills are, under compulsion, introduced in another chamber, and the Senate is kept waiting at one end of the session while the work in the other House is crowding up. Unless something can be done to ease the situation, in the way I suggest, I am afraid that, despite our protests, we shall invariably be confronted with this congestion at the. end of the session. </para>

                    <para class="block">It  is  hardly necessary for me  to  do more than formally submit the Bill. Honorable senators are aware that its purpose  is to  make provision for a pension  of  &#163;1,750 per annum for the Chief Justice  of  Australia upon his retirement. I have  no  doubt that honorable senators are also aware of the distinguished career and great public service rendered by the present occupant of this&#39; office. The chief reason which, I think, can be advanced as a claim for . support of the Bill is the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith, who was Chief Justice  of  Queensland, would have been entitled, had he remained in&#39; that position for another five years,  to  a pension  of  &#163;1,750 per annum, the amount stated in this Bill.  By  coming over to  the  Commonwealth Service, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith not only lent lustre  to  the office he occupied, but rendered great public service  to  the people  by  his interpretation  of the Constitution. But he forfeited all the rights of a pension that would have been his had he remained in the State Service for another five years, as against the  ten  years&#39; service which he has given  to  the Commonwealth. I am aware that objection has been taken  to  the principle  of  pensions by some honorable senators, but,  in  view  of  the circumstances  to  which I have referred, I ask them not  to  allow  it to  be said that a great public servant, who has served the Commonwealth  so  well, should  be  called upon  to  make a sacrifice through having left the Queensland Service  to  become the first Chief Justice  of  Australia. </para>
