                        <para>- I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate whether, in connexion with the projected shipbuilding scheme, the Government propose to utilize the wonderful natural facilities that exist in the State of Tasmania for shipbuilding purposes. I noticed from a statement in the press that a certain gentleman recently visited Tasmania, and, perhaps, the Minister will say whether ho had any authority from the Commonwealth Government to investigate the facilities I have referred to. . </para>

I should like honorable senators . generally to accept the intimation that if questions of this character are submitted on the Thursday, it is impossible for the Departments concerned to obtain replies to them on the Friday. . For the convenience of the Senate and of Ministers I trust that, so far as possible, honorable senators submitting such questions will put them on the notice-paper for the first day of the following week. </para>

                <para class="block">The proposed appropriation covers a period of one month, and provides for the ordinary services of Government and war services, so far. as they are payable out of revenue. The total amount of the schedule is &#163;1,211,615; omitting refunds of revenue, &#163;45,000, the total is &#163;1,166,615. The amount thus asked for is less than one-twelfth of the total estimated expenditure under annual votes, namely, &#163;1,308,960. Supply has already been granted up to the 31st December of last  year.  The amount provided, omitting Treusurer&#39;s Advance and Refunds of Revenue, is &#163;6,913,386. Excluding Treasurer&#39;s Advance and Refunds of Revenue, the total provision which will bo available to meet expenditure to the 31st January, 1918, is &#163;8,080,001. I remind honorable senators that the total amount provided on the Estimates previously submitted amounts to &#163;15,707,522. Deducting from that amount certain items, for which no provision appears in this month&#39;s Supply Bill, the available appropriation amounts to &#163;14,129,852. Seven-twelfths of that amount is &#163;8,242,413, but the total provision which will be made if the Senate approves of this Bill will only be &#163;8,080,001. It will thus be seen that the proposed expenditure for the seven months is less than seven-twelf ths of the total expenditure for the year <inline font-style="italic">set</inline> out in the Estimates. No provision has been made in the Bill for any service which has not previously been approved  by  Parliament. In connexion with increases to salaries, provision has only  been  made for such increases as fall due under Arbitration Court awards, or which are automatic under the Public Service Act. Provision has not been made for increases to salaries   in the higher divisions of the Service. These increases will not be paid until the Estimates are passed by Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- In this case, I am merely doing what I think is  necessary  to meet the convenience of honorable  senators. At the same time we must not overlook an obligation which is upon us to deal with the country&#39;s business when it is available. I admit it is extremely difficult for me to forecast the happenings even in this Chamber, let alone the other branch of the Legislature, so I am unable, at the present moment, to do more than submit the motion in the terms indicated, because I think it would be regarded as a reflection on this Chamber, and we might be charged with a dereliction of duty if it should happen that the other House was prepared to send business to the Senate, and we were not ready to receive it. In these circumstances, I think it is better that honorable senators should suffer some little inconvenience rather than cause delay in the transaction of public business. An adjournment is necessary, but I shrink from placing this Chamber in the position of being absent if there should he work for us to do. </para>

                    <para>. - My only reason for suggesting to the Leader of the Senate that we should adjourn till the following week was the futility of calling us together next Thursday. It has been the custom hot to transact business in the Senate while a censure motion is under discussion in another place. A no-confidence motion ha3 been accepted by the Government, and the debate on it will occupy the ordinary sitting days of next week. </para>

                        <para>- I am simply stating the fact that the debate will be prolonged, and if we are to meet on Thursday next, it will only be for the purpose of securing another adjournment, as it is extremely improbable there will be any business for us. After the censure motion has been disposed of, the Government, I understand, intend to introduce a Supply Bill for two months, and that measure is not likely to get through the other House either on Thursday or Friday. Honorable &#39; senators opposite must understand that we have placed a restraint upon ourselves on the present occasion, but when the other. Supply Bill comes before the Senate they cannot expect us to pass what has been done during the past three months without a full-dress debate. Personally, I am quite sure that if we meet on Thursday next, we shall have to adjourn till &#39;the following Wednesday, because it will not be possible in the time between Thursday and the following Wednesday to deal with the old Government that went out of office. </para>

                    <para>.- May I point out to the Leader of the Senate that it is possible he has overlooked a distinct arrangement entered into &#39;between the two parties in the other House last night? Part of that agreement has been given effect to by the transaction of business in the Senate this morning. I understand that a discussion took place regarding the period for which Supply should be granted, and that one month&#39;s Supply was to be given at once without debate, and that the Government would accept a want of confidence motion, upon which they would give five clear days&#39; debate. </para>

                        <para>- The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> said that if members of the Opposition wanted -more than five days they would have a lot &#39;to say. I submit, therefore, that if the agreement is to . be given effect to in the other Chamber there will be five full days&#39; debate, and obviously it would &#39;be unfair to bring senators from the other States back to Melbourne on Thursday when there is so little prospect of the no-confidence debate terminating before the latter end1 of next week at the earliest. I invite <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> therefore, to adjourn until a later hour in the day, and ascertain if- a contract has not been entered into between the parties, and1 thus obviate any inconvenience to members living in tie other States by requiring them to attend here next week. </para>

                    <para>. - Honorable Senators will recollect that be fore the sitting was suspended I had moved a motion that the Senate at its rising adjourn until Thursday next. The purpose of the suspension of the sitting was- to enable me, if possible, to form a more accurate forecast as to what was likely to be the course of events in another branch of the Legislature. I have done what I could to ascertain the probabilities&#39;&#34; there, but I now find myself unable to do anything more than resubmit the motion which, with the sanction of honorable senators, I previously withdrew. I therefore move - </para>

                <para class="block">I should like to admit at once that I can conceive .that it will be quit&#169; possible that when honorable senators re-assemble on Thursday next I may then have to ask them to adjourn to the following day. On the other hand, it is also possible that if the Senate adjourned over the following week there might be public business waiting and no Senate to deal with it. Faced with &#39;these alternatives, I believe that honorable senators will agree with me that it is better that we should be inconvenienced a little than that public business should have to wait. </para>
