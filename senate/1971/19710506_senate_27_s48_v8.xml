Is it correct that considerable advantage would flow to Australia by becoming a member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development?

I feel that I should take the question on notice because any pronouncements or any decisions in relation to this matter, which is a matter of policy, naturally would stem from the Treasurer, as he mentioned, or the Prime Minister. 1 recognise the interest that the Leader of the Opposition has displayed in this subject and I recognise the merit of some of the points he has raised. I think the Leader of the Opposition should put his question on the notice paper in order that the appropriate Minister can comment on it. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister for Works. The Minister will recall a previous question that was asked concerning the metric system of weights and measures and the progress being made by the Department of Works in setting a timetable for its introduction into the Department's activities. I also refer to the liaison between the Department of Works and private construction industry generally. Can the Minister inform the Senate as to what are the actual arrangements between the Department of Works and the private construction industry in the implementation of the metric system? </para>

            <para>- The actual liaison between other sections of the industry is carried on by reason of the fact that the Metric Conversion Board has appointed 10 advisory committees, one of which deals with the Building and Construction Advisory Committee. That Building and Construction Advisory Committee has established 4 standing sub-committees. In the government construction sector <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Milton,</inline> the Director, Metric Conversion, in the Department of Works, is the  Chairman.  That sub-committee of the government construction sector includes representatives of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, the Public Works Departments of the States, the Department of Housing, the Department of the Interior, and the Council of Local Government Associations. So the whole thing has been co-ordinated through the Metric Conversion Board, but the Department of Works, through <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Milton,</inline> as  Chairman  of the government construction sector, is responsible for bringing together that sector of the construction industry and it, in association with the other 3 sub-committees, wi)l have liaison with the Board's 10 committees on this one committee of the Building and Construction Advisory Committee. That is the situation so far as the Metric Conversion Board is concerned. But then under the auspices of the Standards Association of Australia there is a series of committees, and there again <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Milton</inline> will operate to liaise with those committees and integrate the work with the Metric Conversion Board. </para>

            <para>- My question which is directed to the Minister for Civil Aviation refers to the recent answers given by the Minister relating to charter flights generally and the application made to the Minister by World Airways Inc. in connection with charter nights between the United States of America and Australia. I ask the Minister: Is it a fact that the application of World Airways, Inc. is based on the proposal for IS charter flights into Australia, which would not detrimentally affect existing services of Qantas Airways Limited to the United States of America? Would the acceptance of the proposal entitle Qantas to a reciprocal 15 charter services, and would these charter services be profitable for Qantas? Has the Minister approved of this proposal? What is the current position in respect of his consideration of the proposal for Qantas to enter the charter business generally on a full time basis? </para>

            <para>- I, like the honourable senator, have had the advantage of reading this morning's newspaper in which there is said to be a statement around the place produced by a consultant to the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, said to be 8,000 words in length and said to be made available to parliamentarians. I cannot find anyone who has it. I would like to get it in order to have a look at it because I would be interested to know what it had to say. Some of the questions that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> asks have an obvious relation to this, and I have the same interest in them as he has. The position of World Airways Inc. is that it made an application for 15 charter flights. I received a cable from the  President  of World Airways about a week ago to say that he was quite prepared to defer the application for consideration until 15th June. So he is in no urgency about it. I have been considering it very carefully, as has the Department. As I understood the application, it contained . a guarantee that the people who would be brought in the 15 charter flights would be a captive market of World Airways. The company would bring them here and' would take them away. If it did not bring them here and take them away nobody else could or would. If that is the case, as the company stated it to be, obviously there would be no opportunity for Qantas so I would want to investigate that a little more carefully; Secondly, what Qantas does about charter flights is essentially a matter for the Qantas board and management: They are charged with running the company, not the Minister. I have great interest in what they are trying to do and I encourage and help them, and so does the Department, but' I do not give them directions. </para>

In view of the fact acknowledged by the Government that many rural holdings which constituted an economic unit some 10 or 15 years ago are no longer so because of inadequacy of area, has a determination yet been made in response to the representations of the Upper Murray Ex-Servicemen's Land Settlement Association at Loxton; South Australia, for permission for block holders to purchase at departmental reserve prices neighbouring land settlement blocks, the leases of which have been surrendered? </para>

            <para>- I address my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration. Why is it necessary for the Department of Immigration to bring migrants to this country by ship at  a  dearer rate than that for which they can be brought here by air - naturally using Qantas Airways Ltd? My reason for asking this question is that one reads of the large number of air pilots who seemingly have received notice from Qantas, no doubt because there is no work. It puzzles me why the nation pays more per head, I understand, for sea travel for migrants than it would if they were brought to this country by air. </para>

            <para>- The honourable senator's question involves 2 matters which I think should be investigated before an adequate answer can be given to him. First there is need for verification of the assumption upon which the question is based, namely, that it does cost more to bring a migrant to Australia by ship than by air.. The second point is the substance of the question he asked- as to why the change cannot be effected if the assumption is correct. I will convey the question to the Minister for Immigration and endeavour to get a reply for the honourable senator. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister for Civil Aviation. In reply to a question by me on 16th February the Minister stated in a written reply that the only applications for specific traffic routes which were pending were from the Netherlands and Germany. I also asked what applications had been made for regular landing rights in Australia by overseas scheduled airlines in the last 2 years, what applications were pending and what was the status of each application. The Minister made no reference to any application by Aeroflot or the Soviet Union. Will the Minister tell us whether any application  has been pending? Was there at the time I asked this question? Is it a fact that the Soviet Union and Aeroflot have been pressing heavily over the last 2 years for regular landing rights in Australia? </para>

            <para>- It is not a fact that Aeroflot has been pressing heavily for landing rights in Australia. What is a fact is that the Soviet Union, in the normal process, would have had some discussions with the Australian Government on a foreign affairs level. I think that last year,' in about August, the new Soviet Ambassador made a courtesy call on me, which was very kind of him, and he discussed the general question of Australia-Soviet Union flying relationships. He undertook to come back and discuss the matter further before' the end of last year, if there was anything more that he wanted to talk about. I have not seen him since then, nor have I personally received any application. Australia always  is looking at opportunities for profitably extending its air traffic network: No opportunity exists which we . do npt take if it is one which can be successfully and sensibly taken. To the best of my knowledge at this time my Department has no firm application from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics or its carrier Aeroflot. </para>

            <para>- Has the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Transport seen a report that the recent ship stewards' strike has cost shipowners some $20m? Would not this big cost have an adverse effect on freight rates, encouraging further increases? Also, would not the full cost of this strike be far greater than the $20m and would it not include added cost and considerable inconvenience in Tasmania and Kangaroo Island in South Australia, which have no alternative means of transport? As this type of costly and unnecessary strike has been encouraged by the militant attitudes of some union leaders, will the Government do all in its power to discourage and check this type of industrial action which is so costly? </para>

            <para>- It would be true, without doubt, that the stewards strike cost a. lot of money. It cost a lot of money to the shipowners, the Australian public and the people involved. I cannot say how much it cost; as the honourable senator said, one report states that it cost $20m. It would certainly have an adverse effect on Tasmania. It is equally true that the Government deplores strikes and hopes not to have them at all, but it will take an active part in resolving them once they have begun. </para>

I seek an explanation as to why the Minister for Immigration gave an answer to a question identical to one asked by me yesterday to which I could not receive an answer. The question related to methods to be used in relation to our immigration cutback from various countries and I had alerted the Minister in this place several hours before the Senate convened. Secondly, I refer to the prolonged delay in giving me an analysis of the share handled by Qantas Airways Limited and the other airlines in the 60 per cent of migrants transported by air to Australia. </para>

            <para>- Two specific questions are asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> and they raise a number of connected matters. The first question he asked was why I was not able to give him an answer to a question which he asked yesterday when the Minister for Immigration who, of course, is in another place, was able to give an answer to a similar question when it was asked in the other place. The simple reason is that I did not have the information before me adequately to answer the honourable senator's question. I inform him, however, that the major part of the reduction in the immigration programme for 1971-72 will be in the field of assisted migration. This has been reduced by some 23,500 from the programme for which the funds were initially appropriated in the 1970-71 financial year. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The reduction in this programme has been spread over most or all of the countries from which assisted migrants come. Precise details of the reduction in individual programmes have not yet been determined. I regret that the honourable senator was not able to have the information supplied to him yesterday notwithstanding that he had given me some indication of the nature of the question he was proposing to ask. I trust that he appreciates that at this time of the session we are all working under pressures and that is the reason why the information was not available. With respect to the other matters which the honourable senator raised. I suggest that he either ask me a question on notice or a question without notice. </para>

Is it not a fact that Adelaide and the South Australian economy generally are suffering a series of continuing handicaps through lack of connection with the transcontinental standard gauge railway complex?

            <para>- I think it will be agreed that I have answered quite a number of questions about this vital matter to South Australia on behalf of the Minister for Shipping and Transport both to the best of my ability without information and with information when I had it. At the present time all I can say positively is yes, the Commonwealth Government will do all it possibly can to expedite this essential link. We know how important it is to South Australia. We are not the only party involved in this project but we have some consciousness of its importance as has any other honourable senator from South Australia particularly the honourable senator who asked the question. </para>

            <para>- I say immediately in response to the last question the honourable senator asks that the answer is no. However, I think it is unwise to attempt to categorise the activities of the Department of Health in the rather narrow way with which the honourable senator concerned himself. The Department has many functions which do include preventive health measures but primarily it administers the various pieces of legislation which are approved by the Parliament. Additionally, the Department has taken part in considerations of the National Health and Medical Research Council on questions of smoking and health generally. The Department has certain health education functions in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory and involved in this health education programme is the giving of information, particularly to school children, on the hazards involved to health in cigarette smoking. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As the honourable senator is aware, the Department has taken part in the negotiations with the tobacco manufacturers and le commercial radio and television stations with regard to the voluntary code of which an announcement was made this week. The honourable senator has also requested certain details about the expenditure of the Department He would be aware that the amount voted for expenditure by the Department of Health in the past year was $477m. There is no specific allocation for advertising in respect of disease, but the Department does issue many publications which stress those aspects. As to the expenditure of a specific sum on advertising the ill effects of smoking, no part of the expenditure can be regarded as directly allocated to that function. </para>

            <para>- The honourable senator's question covers a very wide field and much of the information he seeks is of a detailed character. I suggest that, if he wants the detailed information, he approach me or the Minister for Immigration or put the question on the notice paper. However, I can give him some broad information which may be of assistance to him. In the first place, no statistics are maintained of the individual airlines which bring to Australia migrants who make their own travel arrangements, but there are some statistics of those airlines which bring to Australia migrants who come as assisted migrants either on charter flights or on commercial flights. Summarised, the information which has been supplied to me indicates that, where the bookings have been made by the Commonwealth Department of Immigration, roughly 56,500 in 1970-71 were booked through Qantas Airways Ltd and approximately 1,000 were booked through other airlines. With regard to those bookings that are made by the Inter-governmental Committee for European Migration, about 12,000 in that year were booked through' Qantas and approximately 3,000 were booked through the other airlines. </para>

            <para>-I  address my question to the Minister representing the Treasurer, although it is a social services matter. Is he aware of the very severe financial shortage which besets homes and hospitals for the aged and infirm throughout Australia? Is he aware, for instance, that one large home for the aged in Victoria - the Greenvale Village for the Aged has at least 1,300 people listed as waiting for admission, but at the same time, due to a financial shortage, is unable to staff and run 2 wards of 36 beds? Is the Minister aware that it is virtually impossible to increase fees in such homes as more than 90 per cent of the patients are age pensioners and the amount payable by them is limited to two-thirds of their pension? Will the Minister seek to secure more Commonwealth funds to assist such worthy institutions, upon requests for such funds from the several State governments? </para>

            <para>- The honourable senator asks me a question that is linked to budgetary considerations. So I think it is proper to put it to the Treasurer rather than to the Minister for Social Services. I am aware of the circumstances of some homes for aged people, and I am aware of certain financial contributions that are made through Government agencies to assist such homes. This is a budgetary matter and quite obviously the Government, in the preparation of its budgetary proposals which will come forward in August, will be looking at all these matters as it normally does, and any decisions on policy that are made will be reflected in the Budget. </para>

            <para>- Yes, I have had the matter to which the honourable senator refers brought to my attention. The opinion of the contributor to the seminar has been noted. Of course, the figures of students unable to obtain places in New South Wales universities do not allow for the fact that many students submit multiple applications and are successful in obtaining entry to one of the universities to which applications have been submitted. On 27th April, in reply to a question, the Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that private overseas students enrolled in bachelor degree courses at Australian universities represented only 5.9 per cent of the total full time enrolment and had little effect on the admission of qualified Australian students. This fact was brought to the attention of the forum by representatives of the Department. While some of the developing countries have succeeded in meeting their requirements for medical training, others continue to need assistance at both undergraduate and post graduate levels. Until more effective forms of training become available it is hoped that places will be found in the quotas established by the medical faculties of Australian universities for appropriate candidates from developing countries. </para>

In a written reply I was told that the matters referred to in the question were being considered by an interdepartmental committee, that the evolving of guidelines- and standards to ensure the effective conduct of child care centres needed considerable investigation and that a full exploration of the possible approaches was being made. However, the day before yesterday, in another place, the Minister stated that, because of austerity reasons, the Government had decided not to proceed with the establishment of child care centres?

It is permissible for me to remind the honourable senator that there was a time interval between the 2 answers and that this afforded time for further consideration of the matter. The result of that further consideration was announced by the Minister for Labour and National Service in another place 2 days ago. </para>

In view of the fact that the Government stated recently that selected Asiatics are admitted as migrants to Australia, what was the reason for admission of an average of 1,500 unselected Mauritians - that is Indians - each year for the last 5 years? </para>

        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir KENNETH</inline>ANDERSONOn 30th April 1971 <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> asked me the following question without notice: </para>
      <quote>
        <para>Can the abnormally protracted negotiations between the Commonwealth and New South Wales Governments on the release of land on the foreshores of Sydney Harbour for park purposes be attributed to either the failure of the New South Wales Premier to reply promptly to a request from the former Prime Minister or the high selling price of the land that has been determined by the Commonwealth, which is in contrast with the practice followed by the Government of the United States of America in its relations with the various States in that country? </para>
      </quote>
      <para class="block">The Prime Minister has informed me that neither of the reasons given by the honourable senator has caused any undue delay in the conduct of the negotiations for the release to the State Commonwealth land around the Sydney Harbour foreshores. The proposed transfer relates to a number of areas located at North Head, South Head, Middle Head and Dobro Point and detailed Commonwealth proposals concerning these areas were submitted by the then Prime Minister to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Askin</inline> in July last year. The Premier replied in October and indicated that the proposals were generally acceptable to the State, though at the same time submitting some further proposals concerning boundaries, conditions of tenure, access and the use of certain buildings now used for Commonwealth purposes. These proposals required further close study and the Prime Minister replied to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Askin</inline> in mid-April, and suggested that some of the proposals would be better resolved by early meetings of Commonwealth and State officials. </para>
      <para>It is not correct as the honourable senator suggested that the prices required for Commonwealth land released to the State authorities have delayed the negotiations and I have nothing further to add in this regard to the advice given to the senator by the then Prime Minister in his letter of 7th September 1970. Once the outstanding matters have been satisfactorily resolved it is hoped that the overall agreement can be finalised quickly between the Commonwealth and State authorities so that the foreshore land to be released can be made available to the people of Sydney for recreation purposes at the earliest practicable date. </para>

            <para>- On 25th March 1971 <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland</inline> asked me the following question: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>Is the Minister representing the Postmaster-General aware that new episodes of the Australian programmes 'Homicide' and 'Division 4' are being stockpiled by commercial television stations until September next so that the stations concerned can get credits for such programmes when the new Australian drama quotas come into effect and that old repeats of these productions are now being forced by the stations onto the Australian viewers? Does the Minister agree that if the allegation is correct the commercial licensees, who as late as last week illustrated their influence on the ranks of the present Government, are seriously violating the aim of the quotas, which is to secure increased local productions, and that while Australian artists do not receive residual payments for repeat programmes their skills, abilities and talents are being exploited by commercial licensees? Will the Minister refer this matter as one of urgency to the Australian Broadcasting Control Board and insist in the public interest and on behalf of those engaged in the television industry that action be taken by the Board to stop any stockpiling that is being indulged in while repeat programmes become the order of the day? </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Postmaster-General has now furnished me with the following information in reply: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I have received representations from several quarters on behalf of an organisation called the T.V. Make It Australian Committee, which has alleged that stockpiling of Australian drama programmes is taking place. </para>
            <para>The Australian Broadcasting Control Board has informed me that the 'Homicide' and 'Division 4' programmes are televised in two series each week by the Melbourne stations originating these programmes. One presentation comprises, designedly, repeated episodes only; the intention to do this was made clear in publicity when the presentation commenced. I presume the question refers to the other presentation. The Australian Broadcasting Control Board informs me that it has been the regular practice since the inception of the programmes in question to include some repeat episodes. The programmes are thus available to a much wider audience than would be the case if they were presented only on a single occasion and accords with overseas practices. The Board's inquiries indicate that for the time being approximately one in every four episodes of 'Division 4' is a repeat of an episode first televised at least 12 months beforehand. A similar proportion of episodes of 'Homicide' televised so far this year have been repeats. </para>
            <para>It is to be noted that it is the common practice, all over the world, for repeats to be included in what might be described as 'first run' series, since it has nowhere been found possible to produce such programmes on a 52-week basis. Production of new episodes of 'Homicide' and Division 4' is proceeding at the same rate as in past years. </para>
            <para>The present practice does not amount to any violation of the aims of the Board's requirements in regard to Australian drama programmes. </para>

The suggestion was made that that procedure will be followed until September in order to obtain credits for Australian produced shows. I have been contacted today by the  Chairman  of the T.V. Make it Australian Committee, who suggested to me that our television industry is in a desperate position. I ask the Minister to treat this matter as urgent and to determine whether the suggestions made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland</inline> are factual before we decide in this Parliament on any further action to be taken.

              <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> the report just presented to the Senate should, if the aims and desires of the Committee are fulfilled, be a valuable social document for the serious consideration and subsequent action of- governments and the people of Australia. Since it was set up on 25th November 1969 the Committee has worked assiduously on a task it realised was of great magnitude and social importance. We held 64 meetings and heard 213 witnesses. As a result of their submissions and our questioning, the transcript of evidence amounts to over 6,400 pages. We sought and received many up to date and valued research documents and, through the co-operation of the Parliamentary Library, we will make available to research scholars and other interested people, as a supplement to our report, a comprehensive bibliography of 456 references. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>We commenced our task with little real knowledge of drugs or the problems they pose; but we approached our inquiry with open minds concerning the answers that were required to the broad terms of reference. As a result of the evidence received we have set out our conclusions and have made 26 specific recommendations. I believe these recommendations, and the reasons given throughout the report for making them, should be carefully studied as a matter of urgency by those in authority. It is true that 2 members of the Committee found it necessary to make reservations on 3 of our recommendations but I would .stress that all of the remainder of the report has the unanimous support of the Committee. </para>
          <para>I believe our report is comprehensive and that our conclusions and recommendations are a true assessment of the evidence and knowledge placed before the Committee. Not only do I stand firmly in favour of them all; I believe also that they are reasonable and can be put into operation with good and lasting effect. I am convinced, consequent on numerous conversations with many people during the last 15 months and from the evidence and much reading that I have done on the subject - one which has never been out of my thoughts since I was honoured to be appointed  Chairman  - that many people have been awakened to the problem. Perhaps what is more important is that many of those dependent on drugs, their families and friends have been helped to realise that relief. or recovery from this illness is possible and is very rewarding. </para>
          <para>The very fact that this Committee was established has, I believe, already proved of benefit to the community. Due to the excellent publicity given to the proceedings of our inquiry we were I believe acting as a catalyst in making the people and Governments more aware of the problem of drug abuse in Australia and making available valuable information on what could immediately be done to start the long hard drive to stem the rising tide of abuse of drugs among all age groups of our society. Many sectors of the community were at least partly informed of actions they could take to help people suffering or on the threshold of the illness of drug dependency and perhaps they could save others from becoming drug dependent. </para>
          <para>To many up till, now, mention of the drug problem conjured up thoughts of heroin, LSD, cannabis and the other illicit drugs. Without trying to diminish the serious situation these drugs pose in our society, it became very evident early in the inquiry that currently in Australia the major drug problem, so far as the health and welfare of the mass of the people are concerned, revolves round the abuse of the socially acceptable and legal drugs - alcohol and tobacco and the therapeutic substances - which in the majority of cases are either legally prescribed or purchased through legal sales outlets. This factor has led the Committee to be explicit in its recommendations both for the short and long term action it advises for dealing with this widespread and serious problem. </para>
          <para>The Report is neither an attacking nor condemning document. It seeks to assess the present position in Australia in respect to all forms of drug abuse. It sets out our belief of the causes and effects of this abuse and makes recommendations for the treatment of those suffering from drug dependency. Importantly it stresses that the long term solution lies in education. Our Report suggests a revolutionary recasting of the present approach to education in schools and if those concerned are strong enough and big enough to accept it I believe Australia will become a far happier place, not only in terms of defeating drug abuse but in the contribution education can make to what I call 'living in the community'. And equally important we must by education, through the minds of our people, give them the reasons and the motivation not to provide a sales market for those drugs which break through our barriers. </para>
          <para>We recommend the strongest measures against those parasites in our community who commit, in my mind, the heinous offence of trafficking in drugs. AH the relevant evidence clearly indicates, that just as this rich and developing, affluent country is the new frontier for tourism, so is it the possible new lucrative area for the narcotic drug traffickers to attack. Therefore our own preventive measures must be expanded. We as a nation must accept the challenge that the traffickers will offer to us. A serious ill effect of drug dependency, particularly where the illicit drugs are concerned, is the turning to crime by the victims who are forced to procure the rottenly high price charged on the black market to provide themselves with the drugs, which they feel they cannot do without. In these circumstances crime and drugs become partners. </para>
          <para>Statistical information concerning all aspects of drug use and abuse in Australia is extremely weak and unreliable. Your Committee believes this factor to be an important missing link in the chain of knowledge required to deal with drug abuse. Stress is made in the Report on the necessity for joint Commonwealth and State action to ensure the availability in the future of all relevant statistical knowledge, so that the growth or, more hopefully, the decrease in drug abuse may be known with greater precision to all those concerned in dealing with the problem. </para>
          <para>Our report does not minimise the misuse of drugs currently  in  Australia and it acknowledges the great dangers besetting this country if we do not forthwith take remedial action.. We do recommend a plan for treatment, and  in  both the short and long term we set out what we believe are realistic ideas for a combined and continuing drive aimed at decreasing the causes and limiting as far as is possible in respect to illicit drugs, the sources of supply. In regard to the legally and socially acceptable drugs, and the admittedly greatly needed and beneficial therapeutic substances, we advocate the means of decreasing promotion of their sales and earnestly hope the unwise prescribing, which is apparently doing great harm  in  the community, will be eliminated as far as is practicable. </para>
          <para>Of all our conclusions and recommendations we believe that those referring to education and we make admittedly far reaching pleas in this regard, are the foundations on which must be built the entire Australian structure to save this country from being engulfed in the rising tide of drug availability, which we know has swept, and is sweeping, through other countries. It is my firm belief the Senate has timed its action on the drug phenomenon just in time, if the national spirit is willing to save this and future generations from the ravages of drug misuse </para>
          <para>I want here to record the Committee's appreciation of the voluntary action of some 100 young people who came to talk with us but not necessarily to give evidence. Some were users of drugs, in various stages of or approaching dependency, while others were experimenters. We learned some of the basic causes which led them to turn to drugs. These included alcoholic and drug taking parents, broken homes, the problems and stresses of the society into which they have grown and, their own personality defects for which society - our system of living - has not provided the necessary help and motivation for them to overcome. Add to these the deficiencies of our school education system; they all play some part in causing the drug habit. </para>
          <para>I pay a sincere tribute of thanks to my Committee colleagues, our staff and advisers. They have been worked hard; they have responded generously with dedication. Careful reading . of the report will indicate a theme or thread running through its fabric enlisting from all who take any part in the cause of careful and prescribed drug use, and the prevention of drug abuse, an attitude of help and compassion for those suffering the illness of drug dependency but a firm and unremitting fight against the careless prescriber, the trafficker and the infecters. What could be a grim picture faces us, but Australia is forewarned. With great sincerity, I believe our report provides helpful and practical answers to some of the problems posed. My colleagues and I have done our best. I hope Australia will . judge our effort as being worthwhile and worthy of the Senate from which our report has emanated. </para>
          <para>I move: That the Senate take note of the report. </para>

            <para>- First of all, I would like to thank the members of the Opposition and of the Australian Democratic Labor Party whom I believe have agreed that 1 should speak at this stage. There is a good reason for it in that I will not be here when the report is to be debated. It would be right at this stage that I should pay a personal tribute to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Marriott</inline> for the dedicated and impartial way in which he conducted this inquiry. I think we all realise that this was a controversial subject but he managed to weld together a team of people, despite our differences when we started, which produced what is almost a unanimous report. I respect my 2 colleagues who saw fit to make certain observations. I would remind the Senate that they are observations and not dissenting reports. As I have said it is a controversial subject and I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Marriott</inline> did a remark- able job in welding us together as a team. Before leaving that side of the matter I want to pay a personal tribute to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Arthur</inline> Higgins who in the last 15 months just lived with the task of producing a report of which the Senate would be proud. </para>

              <para>- 1 take the interjection from my friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> but 1 would not want it to be taken the wrong way. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Higgins</inline> would never need drugs to do the sort of job he did. 1 found this a fascinating and absorbing inquiry because it dealt with people. They were troubled people; that is the point. As we went along we found that these people were at odds with society. They apparently could not fit, as I believe all of us ought to try to fit into what I say is the accepted way of life. We were dealing with people who just did not fit into it. They needed some help - a crutch - and their crutch was drugs. Those drugs varied from simple analgesics - for the benefit of people who do not know, an analgesic is simply an aspirin, Be powder or Pc taken to make one feel well - right through the whole gamut to heroin. This was the crutch they sought in order to fit into a society that they found difficulty in living with. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>One witness who impressed me greatly said that there was no such thing as addictive drugs, only addictive people. I ask honourable senators to think of that statement again: There is no such thing as addictive drugs, there are only addictive people. That remark impressed me so much that from then on I pursued the line of asking witnesses whether they agreed with it. A number of men eminent in their professions did agree with it. I think the remark was exaggerated to make a point but nevertheless I believe that the pressures of our present day society do create addictive people. I am convinced that one of the factors causing this is the overcrowding in big cities. One of the biggest single causes of drug abuse is the fact that we tend to live in an affluent society where there is overcrowding, pressure and tension as a result of centralising people in big cities. This has been proved. Anybody who gets around to reading the transcript of evidence will find that the greatest incidence of drug abuse is in the big cities. We did not find much drug addiction in small country centres, but we found it in the bigger country centres. When you crowd people together, under the pressure of modern day living they will escape in some way and they escape to drugs in some form. The people who will be in the Senate when I leave it will have to look into what should be done about planning. </para>
          <para>There is another factor. I do not know whether my fellow Committee members agree with me but I felt that some addiction was due to pressure by parents on their children to succeed academically. In the affluent 1970s in which we live there seems to be pressure by parents on their children to conform to the idea of. having their own home and a 2-car garage. A lot of young people revolt over this. They protest against our perhaps square belief that the thing we ought to be trying to achieve is financial security. Their form of revolt is pretty drastic. They say: 'No, we do not want this. You may want it. You may like it. But we do not want it.' They have a slap at Dad and Mum. They revolt and turn to drugs perhaps as an experiment. Fortunately in most cases we found that after these young people reached the age of 25 years because of responsibilities they may have accepted such as marriage or perhaps promotion in a job they gave away the more spectacular type of drugs. I believe and I say with deep sincerity to my colleagues, that the tragedy of affluence is that it breeds boredom. By far the greatest number of people who resort to drugs of some sort are people who are bored with their lot. The great majority of people who are resorting to drugs in some form are over the age of 35. </para>
          <para>I believe - I speak from experience - that in times gone by when one was battling to make a crust and rear a family I never heard of drugs other than the legally accepted drugs, alcohol and tobacco. We were all far too busy trying, as I said, to rear a family and make a living. At the end of a hard day's work we were probably all far too tired to be bored. Society has created this problem and society has to cure it. But society cannot do that in any other way because it is a people's problem not a drug problem. I think that as legislators we have a direct responsibility in this matter. This is a serious problem and anybody who is going to read this report should look at page 85. </para>
          <para class="block">It contains 6 simple lines under the heading: Causes of Drug Abuse'. I shall read those 6 lines but I am going to emphasise 3 of them out. They state:  lack of awareness of the dangers of drugs- </para>
          <para class="block">I am convinced that people are not aware of the dangers of drugs -  the affluent society; the stresses of modern life; the personality factor; the living environment; and advertising and the news media. </para>
          <para class="block">The 3 aspects which one must look at in the future in an affluent society are (1) the stresses of modern life which I believe are a big factor as to why people try to escape; (2) boredom; and (3) the living environment. I believe they are the 3 real factors which cause drug abuse. If honourable senators look at the Committee's recommendations I think they must turn to No. 8. It is a simple, short recommendation and it states: </para>
          <list type="decimal-dotted">
            <item label="8.">
              <para>The living environment. The priority being placed on growth, development and material wealth should be critically examined so that greater resources may be devoted to improving the living environment of the community. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">I do not think I can stress that recommendation enough. I have already said that I subscribe to the fact that there are not addictive drugs but there are addictive people. What makes addictive people? I have canvassed that point enough. I want to pay personal thanks to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> who was most conscientious in his attendance at meetings. Whenever I found myself with a problem of what I shall call conscience', in respect to the inquiry, I discussed it with the  Chairman  first. I would then turn to my friend Jim Cavanagh and he would always suggest a realistic solution to the particular problem. He showed a capacity to ask himself how he would deal with the problem if he were confronted with it. I found that approach to be of great assistance and I publicly place on record that he greatly assisted me. </para>
          <para>I personally hope that this report will not be placed in a pigeon-hole. I do not think it will, but even if that does happen, the Committee has achieved something by making people aware of the drug problem. I spent about 4 months in the United States of America and I would not like to have reared 4 sons to live in a community such as I saw there. The Committee has justified its appointment because people have become aware of the problem. Journalists who for a long time have been writing about drug abuse may have been given a little hope from our public meetings that the Australian people will be made aware of the extent of the problem. I do not think that the problem is out of hand at present, but it could get that way if we did not take steps to remedy the situation. I believe that members of this Parliament will be very grateful to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Marriott</inline> and his Committee for the wide coverage and examination of what has become a terribly important matter in Australia. </para>

          <para class="block">The main purpose of the Bill is to amend the Loan (Farmers* Debt Adjustment) Act 1935-1950 to enable funds available to the States arising from that Act to be used for the same purpose as the funds to be provided by the Commonwealth under the Slates Grants (Rural Reconstruction) Bill. The Loan (Farmers' Debt Adjustment) Act 1935 authorised the making of grants to the States for the purpose of discharging in whole  or  in part, the debts of farmers by means of compositions or schemes of arrangement between farmers and their creditors. The States were empowered to use the funds to make either grants or loans to farmers. One condition laid down in the Act was that repayments to the States by farmers were to be used for the same purposes as the initial Commonwealth grants, so that such repayments constituted a revolving fund for the purposes specified in the Act. At 30th June 1970 the States had cash balances totalling $7. 6m, and loans outstanding to farmers totalling $4.6m, arising from the operation of the Act. </para>
          <para>During the recent discussions with the States on the rural reconstruction scheme, it was agreed that the States would use the balances available to them under the Act for the purposes of the new scheme, which are wider than those laid down in the Act. The Bill will enable the States to proceed accordingly. It provides that repayments to the States by farmers of loans made from these balances for the purposes of the new scheme may be used again for the same purposes. A further provision in the Bill is intended to fulfil the undertaking given to the Tasmanian Government, arising out of the 1968 drought in Tasmania, that the Commonwealth would take action to enable the State to use the funds available to it under the Act for the relief of farmers affected by that drought. Finally, as a consequence of recent bankruptcy legislation, the Bill provides for the repeal of section 9 and an amendment of section 10 of the Act. </para>
          <para>I should also like to take this opportunity of announcing that, as a further means of facilitating desirable structural adjustment in rural industries, the Board of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation has agreed to widen the lending activities of the Commonwealth Development Bank. At the present time, the Bank does not normally approve loan applications for property purchases not involving substantial developmental features. It has now been decided that the Bank will consider loan applications for the purpose of assisting farmers to acquire additional land to build up the size and operational efficiency of their farms. Those eligible for assistance will be working farmers whose properties may be too small to constitute an enterprise viable in the long run, or farmers who by acquiring additional land will assist the adjustment process through enabling uneconomic farms to be purchased. Loan applications will normally be considered only from persons whose main source of income will be the farming enterprise concerned. </para>
          <para>The terms and conditions attaching to such loans will be the same as those currently applied by the Development Bank. In particular: </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">This is a short Bill of only 4 clauses. Its purpose is to provide parliamentary approval for the execution on behalf of the Commonwealth of an agreement between the Commonwealth and the States for a rural reconstruction scheme and to appropriate funds for grants to the States for carrying out the scheme. The details of the scheme are set out in the agreement which is contained in a schedule to the Bill and in a schedule to the agreement. The agreement provides for the expenditure of $100m over 4 years. This scheme is one of a series of measures designed to help meet a crisis situation in the rural industries and particularly the sheep and sheep-wheat industries. However, no agricultural industry is excluded from the scheme except for farm build up cases eligible under the marginal dairy farms reconstruction scheme. It is recognised that in respect of farm build up the particular circumstances of some industries such as the horticultural industries may need additional consideration of their special problems. These will be looked at separately. </para>
          <para>At the present time the price of wool is averaging about 30c per pound greasy. This is the lowest level wool prices have reached for 23 years. Receipts by the wool industry fell by nearly$100m between 1968-69 and 1969-70, giving rise to the necessity for the emergency financial assistance scheme for wool growers introduced late in 1970. This was intended as a short term measure which it was recognised would help only a proportion of the cases of financial hardship caused by the fall in prices. Returns for 1970-71 could be down a further $170m. They would have been lower still if it had not been for the operation of the Wool Commission. A Bureau of Agricultural Economics survey in 1966- 67- a reasonably good year for the wool industry - indicated that some 20 per cent' of wool growers in Australia had net farm incomes of less than $2,000 per annum to cover servicing of their debts and living expenses. Today that percentage has doubled. The decline in actual receipts by the industry over the last 2 years is the major element of the economic problem of the industry. A further important fact has been the decline in expectations about the industry's future profitability. The immediate capital loss that this has involved in revaluation of wool producing assets, including sheep, could well amount to over $2,000m. In this situation the servicing of existing debt and the raising of new credit for continued operation have for a substantial part of the industry become problems of considerable gravity. </para>
          <para>The industry's outstanding debt has increased from $980m in 1966-67 to about $ 1,200m today. Net income calculations for the wool industry can only be approximate but with the fall in wool prices, drought in some areas, and a decline in wheat incomes not offset by improved beef returns, the industry's net farm income in total has probably fallen from some $760m in 1966-67 to about $450m in 1969-70 and to $290m in the current year. The debt position has moved in consequence from one where debt represented something like 11/3 times net farm income in the industry in 1966-67 to 2i times in 1969-70 and about 4 times in 1970-71. In the current year about one-third of the industry's average net farm income of some $3,000 per property is required simply to meet interest payments on existing debt. </para>
          <para>With the combination of a substantial loss of income in each of 2 successive years, a substantial decline in capital values, and .little expectation that with likely price and cost trends profitability will recover to earlier levels, the industry is in a critical position and a particularly critical situation in the immediate short term. I am talking, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Acting Deputy President,</inline> about Australia's largest rural export industry, lt is an industry on which this country has depended very greatly for foreign exchange. The export of wool will earn in the current year almost S600m. Even though this is some $400m less than in 1963-64, the peak year since 1950-51, wool remains the single largest export commodity and accounts for about 15 per cent of the total export income. Australia may no longer wholly ride on the sheep's back, but the wool industry continues to be of major importance to our economy. </para>
          <para>It is also of major social importance to the Australian community. There are some 89,000 wool growers running flocks of 200 sheep or more. It is a major contributor to the well-being and way of life of the majority of our country districts. Whole communities depend on it. We cannot contemplate a situation in which the forces against which we b ave been working but which seem to encourage a continual movement of people from country areas to the already overcrowded cities are accelerated by a mass exodus of wool growers because their properties have become unprofitable and they have reached the end of their credit resources. This has arisen in part because of drought; in part because of rising costs; in part because of a disastrous and unexpected fall in wool prices; and in part because of loss of confidence in the industry by some lenders. </para>
          <para>There seems no escape from the unpalatable fact that there will have to be a substantial restructuring of our rural industries. There is reason for hope that wool prices will recover from the present drastically low levels. It would be unwise to assume that the extent of the recovery will be sufficient to permit the servicing of all debts contracted when property values and investment in property improvement reflected the profitability which did exist in the industry before the effects of the cost price squeeze began to produce the difficulties which are only too apparent today. </para>
          <para>The wool industry is a very large industry. The solution to its problems put forward by some people is the apparently easy way of providing price support. In round terms each lc per pound in price support would cost the taxpayer $20m per annum. There are some producers whose costs and debt structure is such that they would need price support in excess of 20c per pound above present price levels in order to meet their commitments. The burden on the Budget of a price support scheme of the magnitude required would be enormous. Apart from this it is essential for the health of the industry that it should not be fully insulated from the effects of changes in demand as reflected in price. The approach that has been adopted after an expert examination by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics and after extensive discussions between the Commonwealth and State Minister most directly concerned is represented by the agreement set out in this Bill. </para>
          <para>The rural reconstruction scheme provides for assistance by way of debt reconstruction, farm build-up, and rehabilitation of those obliged to leave the industry where this is necessary to alleviate conditions of personal hardship. A complementary scheme to provide retaining assistance to farmers obligated to leave the industry is being formulated by the Department of Labour and National Service and the Department of Primary Industry in consultation with State authorities. Details of this scheme will be announced as soon as practicable. </para>
          <para>To obtain debt reconstruction assistance an applicant must be unable to obtain finance to carry on and thus be in danger of losing his property or other assets if he is not provided with assistance. Debt reconstruction assistance may involve a rearrangement or a composition of debts to allow more time for payment. The authority may advance money for repayment of a proportion of the debts and for carry on expenses, livestock and further property development. Such advances may be for up to 20 years and the authority is required to ensure that the interest rate on </para>
          <para class="block">Commonwealth money advanced under the scheme will average 4 per cent per annum. </para>
          <para>The farm build-up provisions are intended to encourage amalgamation of properties which are too small to be economic under today's conditions. Finance may be provided either to the owner of an uneconomic property to buy adjoining land to build up his property or to an adjoining owner to enable him to purchase an uneconomic farm. Grants may be made at the discretion of the authority to cover, in whole or in part, losses sustained in the disposal of assets included in the purchase price of the property which are not useful for the built-up property. Advances may be made for carry on expenses, plant, livestock and property development in respect of the additional land where finance is not available from other sources. The interest rate for farm build-up advances on Commonwealth money is <inline font-style="italic">6i</inline> per cent per annum. </para>
          <para> In considering interest rates it is as well to keep in mind that the aim of. the scheme is. to assist people who have prospects of becoming commercially viable. There must be an expectation that the farmer will in due course be able to service credit provided to him. on normal commercial terms. It is not realistic to admit to the scheme cases which require the bridging of too large a gap between the terms provided under the scheme and normal commercial terms. In order to ensure that the scheme has the widest possible effect in encouraging sound permanent restructuring of the industry, the general objective is that half of the funds will be applied to farm build-up. This will supplement funds available for farm build-up from other sources. In this connection I am pleased that the Government has arranged with the Development Bank to extend its operations to include lending for property purchase for build-up purposes and advances will be made by the Government to the Bank for this purpose. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Acting Deputy President,</inline>such is the condition of the rural industries at present that there are many cases where producers are in financial difficulty and will not be able to satisfy the requirement that they have prospects of commercial viability. It is the natural wish of many people to continue in a way of life which they know and like and may have followed for many years. But while recognising the contribution these producers make in earning export income the Government must attempt to balance the real cost of resources used in gaining those earnings in devising measures of assistance to export industries. Carry on finance may alleviate immediate financial pressure for a limited period but if the result is a lot of additional hard work and worry and a still larger debt around the producer's neck, it may not be worthwhile.. This is not a policy of 'get big or get out'; It is not a policy Of forcing people off the land. It is a policy of concentrating the assistance that is available on those cases which have the best hope of weathering, the present adverse, circumstances and recovering to a sound financial position in the longer term. </para>
          <para>In the application of the funds that are available the aim is to help producers. The aim is not to displace private credit and it is not- to relieve creditors of the consequences of commercial judgments which they have made. The Government is conscious that the present times are difficult, not only for producers but also for institutional and other lenders. It asks that creditors will be fore bearing and co-operate with the reconstruction, authorities and the producers in a combined effort to retain in the industry as many producers as can possibly be placed on a sound basis and to avoid precipitate or disruptive action in the difficult times which the rural industries are facing. For those who are obliged to leave the land because they do not qualify for rural reconstruction and who need retraining, this will be available under the scheme to which I have referred. For those who are obliged to leave and who face financial hardship, modest assistance for rehabilitation in the form of an advance of up to $1,000 may be provided by the reconstruction authority. </para>
          <para>The course of wool prices in the future is of course uncertain. There are, however, grounds for believing that present price levels are unduly low and that there will be some recovery in the coming months. There is the case of the producer falling in between on the one hand those who on the present market outlook for wool do not need assistance or would be eligible to receive assistance under the debt reconstruction or farm build-up provisions of the scheme, and on the other hand those who, even with a significant improvement in wool prices, are beyond prospects of recovery because their costs are too high or their debts too large. These are people who, if their cases are judged on the present market outlook, would have to leave the industry. If wool prices, subsequently recover they may have left unnecessarily - they may have been able to return to profitability, if they had. been assisted to remain. With this in mind, the States have suggested that perhaps this . proposed reconstruction scheme needs to be supplemented in some way, or even radically, reviewed to accommodate- these cases. However, the States have accepted that at least this scheme should be implemented in its present form in order . that . this new. financial assistance may be provided immediately and without delay. Future needs can then be assessed in the light of experience and the further knowledge gained. </para>
          <para>As I have said, this rural reconstruction scheme - has bees formulated in consultation with the State Governments. The' problems with which it seeks to deal are regarded as the joint responsibility of the Commonwealth and the States. The Commonwealth will provide funds to the States to carry out the scheme. The States have agreed to administer the scheme and bear their own administration costs. The Commonwealth offered the States the sum of $l00m over 4 years for the scheme as a loan at an interest rate of 3 per cent per annum. At the request of the States an alternative offer was made and this was that $75m should be provided as a loan bearing interest at 6 per cent per annum with the remaining $25m being a non repayable grant. </para>
          <para>There is a margin between the amounts the States would receive if they lent half of the money for debt reconstruction assistance at 4 per cent per annum and the other half for farm build-up at 6£ per cent per annum and the amount the States will be obliged to repay the Commonwealth. The margin is intended to cover normal losses in lending under the scheme and write-offs under the farm build-up provisions. If the States incur losses from circumstances beyond their control the agreement provides that the Commonwealth will review the position with a view to adjusting the States' repayment obligations to the extent of such losses. Importantly the agreement provides for the operation of the scheme to be reviewed from time to time and for the review to include the funds to be provided for the scheme, the allocation of the funds between the States, the provisions for losses and write offs, the interest rates to be charged to borrowers,' and the proportion of financial assistance', applied to farm build-up. </para>
          <para>There will be regular exchanges of information between the States and the Commonwealth on the operation and effectiveness of the scheme. Perhaps there are. sortie who will criticise the provision of special assistance to the rural industries oil the grounds that comparable assistance is not provided to other industries outside the primary sector. If so, let me say that it' is an undeniable fact that wool growers have provided over many decades benefits to the country as the mainstay of export income without any form of price support or stabilisation plan. There will no doubt be a majority who will feel that wool growers should now, when costs and prices have turned against them, be assisted purpose-, fully to meet the difficulties which face them. </para>
          <para>The Government has had to make its own judgment, after consultation with the States, on what is feasible having regard to the many other demands made upon its resources and having regard to the unavoidable necessity for adjustments in the industry to meet the changes in its circumstances that have occurred. I believe that the measures provided for in this Bill are sound in their conception and practical in their application. I trust that the Senate will take note of the very difficult financial problems which face rural industry and in particular the wool industry at the present time and will support assistance to these industries as provided for in the Bill. </para>

          <para>- When the debate on this clause was adjourned last night I had practically completed the submissions that I wished to make on what we on this side of the chamber regard as the objectionable features of this clause. I had drawn attention to our objections to the subjective test of 'reasonable apprehension'. Also I had referred to the dangers inherent in allowing a person to act as a law enforcement officer, with all the risks that we believe exist in this formulation, which in our submission amounts in some circumstances to an invitation to riot. I instanced the case of competing groups of people at an assembly at which tempers became inflamed, in which case one group might take it upon itself, in the light of this provision, to act as a law enforcement agency, and a riot could result. </para>

        <para>The only other point to which I wish to advert in relation to clause 8 is in connection with sub-section (3.) in which the penalty for an offence under this clause is spelt out. The relevant words are: each of those persons who has, without reasonable excuse, failed to comply with the direction - </para>
        <para class="block">That is a direction given by a sergeant of police, when certain other circumstances have been satisfied - is guilty of an offence, punishable on conviction by a fine not exceeding Five hundred dollars or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or both. </para>
        <para class="block">We regard this provision as such a serious curtailment of the liberty of the subject that we believe that if there is to be such an offence it should be an indictable offence because, in our view, the safeguard of a jury trial is required in these circumstances.

          <para>-  Two substantial points were raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland. The first point related to the expression which is used in sub-clauses (3.) and (4.) of clause 8 of the Bill. Apparently he takes objection to the fact that it would be lawful for a person to use such force as he believes, on reasonable grounds, to be necessary and is reasonably proportioned to the danger which he believes, on reasonable grounds, is to be apprehended from the continuance of the assembly in respect of which a dispersal order has been given in accordance with the earlier provisions of the clause. The Government believes that this provision is a desirable one in the light of what has always been the common law provision and the fact that, under clause 25 of the Bill in effect the Common law provision is abolished. In short, the clause does not introduce anything which is new. It has always been the responsibility of the citizen to assist in dispersing a riot or an unlawful assembly and it is desirable that that position should be as always it has been. In fact, it is an offence for a person to refuse to assist to suppress a riot. This point was emphasised last night by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae.</inline></para>

Nevertheless, there is the precaution, as I would see it, that, if the action taken by this person is subsequently challenged, he knows that he can only justify whatever action he takes only if he can establish that what he did was not only done on reasonable grounds but also that it was a fact reasonably proportioned to the danger which he believed, again on reasonable grounds, to be apprehended from the continuance of the asembly. </para>

            <para>-  I know the impact of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> has said and the way in which the argument can be developed, but I think we must recognise the sort of situation in which the need may arise. If there is an assembly which appears, on reasonable grounds, to be likely to engage in violence and damage to property - to go on the rampage - and a senior policeman says that this assembly should be dispersed and acts in accordance with the clause, I believe that it ought to be the obligation of those citizens who are willing and able to do so to render assistance to preserve the order which is so important. To deny to the individual, for fear that he might suffer some consequences, the right to assist the police when the police want assistance is not the sort of situation which we should consciously put into our law. </para>

            <para>- If I may, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Temporary Chairman,</inline> I will revert to the issue which is before the Senate, which is the question of whether the provisions contained in sub-clauses (4.) and (5.) of clause 8 are de sir a be. The Queensland and Western Australian criminal codes that superseded the common law in those States have similar provisions to those contained here. Sub-clause (4.) has been inserted because clause 25 abolishes the common law and it is believed to be necessary to preserve a provision comparable to the common law provision. But we have circumscribed it. I think that it is reasonably necessary to retain this provision in the circumscribed form in which we have cast <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> for use in the extreme case where the assistance of citizens is needed. Society must have the means to protect itself from the damage and the violence of rioters. I know that much of this discussion is centred upon the fact that these assemblies will be assemblies of demonstrators for some political purposes. I accept that that is one area which this legislation covers. But it should not be forgotten that this is the basic type of legislation which enables police to restrain riots. If, arising out of an assembly that has no political function or purposes whatever, a situation dangerous to the public peace occurs, I think it is incumbent upon people who have the protection which his law gives them to come to the assistance of the police, to take action to quell the disturbance and not be subject to accusations and allegations simply for taking action designed to preserve order and peace. The provision authorises action to be taken only when the action is reasonable conduct. That, of course, may be tested against the standards of the ordinary man and that, as I have said already, is the standard which the court applies. I hope that answers the first point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland. That is my reaction to what he said. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>The second point which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland raised was in the form of an amendment to sub-clause (3.) of clause 8 to allow to be regarded as an indictable offence an offence which, at the present time, is capable of being tried summarily. In short, what is being sought is for anybody charged with this offence to be tried by a judge and jury instead of being charged before a magistrate or in a lower court. There is always a problem as to what is the appropriate court in which offences should be tried. Various considerations determine that issue. One issue is the character of the matter which is in dispute. If the issue is one which is a fairly clear  cut issue as to whether one discernible fact was or was not committed one might suppose that there is no need to put that before a jury, which is a body designed to make an assessment on common ground standards of what is or is not the appropriate decision. On the other hand, it has always been accepted that the nature of the penalty to which a person is to be subjected is also a relevant criterion in determining whether a person should have a jury trial. In this particular case the offence is an offence punishable on conviction by a fine not exceeding $500 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or both. In the light of the experience of statutes in this Parliament and in other parliaments of the Commonwealth that is not the type of penalty which normally attracts a jury trial. The Government opposes the amendment. </para>

          <para>- Now that the Committee has taken that vote, it is apparent that clause 8 is going to be administered in the context where the citizen who comes under the scope of the provision will not be able to appeal to the commonsense, the wisdom and reasonable standards of his fellows in a jury trial. If the Committee had agreed that this should be an indictable offence it would have mitigated any possible abuses of this clause because the police sergeant or the authorities would know that the way in which this clause was being used would be subject to the scrutiny of a jury drawn from the citizenry. As has been shown over hundreds of years in England, the jury system has brough about the respect for law which we all want, because the jury has always been there to say: 'If there are bad laws we will not convict'. That is the answer to a lot of the questions that have been raised during the course of this debate and elsewhere in the community. That is how it works. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>We know that juries in England and here have never accepted the proposition that they were bound by the law as stated to them by the judiciary. That they are bound is in the law books but it is not the standard that prevails under the Anglo Saxon system because that is where the people in the community are involved in the administration of justice. Bringing a sample of the citizens into the court room to see whether in the ultimate they will apply the criminal laws has meant that there has been a means whereby bad criminal laws are in fact not executed in this community. That is why many laws on the statute book are a dead letter. That is why laws which provided that it was a capital offence to steal goods to the value of 40s could not be enforced in England. That is why juries over a long period consistently refused to find men guilty of it and eventually, with the approbation of the judiciary and the whole community, they point blank refused to enforce the law because it was a bad law. </para>
        <para>If there was a jury trial in relation to this clause it would mean that there could not be abuse of this provision. Neither the authorities at the top nor the members of the police force who would be administering this provision could let their heads go and start to prevent reasonable assemblies, peaceable assemblies and proper protests in expressions of dissent in this community. But now that that safeguard does not exist, look what we have. We have a right of peaceable assembly subjected to a provision where not a magistrate, as is the case under the ancient Riot Act, but a member of the police force is able to make a statement that he reasonably apprehends that there is going to be some kind of violence or damage, and then the right of assembly is gone. There was sense in having a magistrate because the magistrate was one who was supposed to be somewhere between the authorities and the citizens. He may not always have been but he was not under the direct control of the authorities as is the police sergeant. So the balance has again been shifted there. The right .of peaceable assembly is put at the discretion </para>

            <para>- Or, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland says, almost at the whim of a person who is under the direct control of the Government. A member of a disciplined force, the police sergeant, does not. have an independent right. He is a member of a disciplined force and must do what he is told. The rights of the. citizen which have been taken away and put in the hands of a magistrate under the Riot Act now depend on the discretion of a member of the police force. We do not think that that is a proper balance in this community. We do not think it is proper that once the dispersal order has been given any person can use force. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood,</inline> the Minister representing the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr N. H. Bowen),</inline> has conceded that any person can do it with-: out any request, even by the police. The Nazis who like to go along to demonstrations and oppose them and try to provoke some kind of a disturbance will immediately be able to go in under clause 4 - honourable senators can imagine some of the thugs who go along to break up peaceful assemblies - and start to use such force as they believe, on reasonable grounds, to be necessary for the purpose of breaking up the assembly in reasonable proportion to the danger which they believe, on reasonable grounds, to be apprehended from the continuance of the assembly. Should the rights of citizens be dependent upon the belief of such persons? There is no provision even that there must be a request from the police either to that person or a general request at the time that the direction is given by the police sergeant about the dispersal of the assembly. One would think that if one was try ing to draw up a reasonable provision, at least one would put in it something about the police sergeant calling upon anybody to assist. Notwithstanding that there may be plenty of police there to handle any situation they think might develop, those thugs will be entitled under clause 4 of this Bill to move in. I do not think that was a wise provision to include even with the philosophy that the Government has adopted in approaching these matters. I think it is a most unwise provision. It is an open invitation to thugs to go along and start interfering with assemblies. There are peaceful assemblies. We know, and the Government concedes, that there is a right of people to assembly peaceably in the community and to use public places for the purposes of dissent and protest. This is a right. What is the Government doing to that right by this clause? It is. making nothing of that right. This is one of the worst clauses in the Bill and the Opposition will vote against it. </para>

          <para>-  Once again we have heard from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> a catalogue of inaccuracies and misrepresentations which an examination pf the record does not sustain. Before one embarks on that, however, . I . think one should take note of the way in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy,</inline> has developed his attack on this clause. As I understand, apart from indicating that we should vote on the amendment which has just been decided, he had not previously spoken to this clause, and when he rose on this occasion he instanced as one of the dreadful things to be said against this clause that the citizen will not have a right to go to a jury. One would suppose that if he felt that strongly there would have been something said in support of the amendment which his Party moved, because all that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland said when he moved the amendment was that the word 'indictable' should be put in before the word 'offence'. There was no elaboration of the merits of jury trial by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland. There was no elaboration of the merits of jury trial by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy.</inline> There was no elaboration by any member of the Opposition of any argument in favour of what is now said to be such a desirable thing in this area. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I know why there was no elaboration of the need for a jury trial in this area. The reason lies in the fact that the penalty, being $300 or 6 months imprisonment, is one which does not attract jury trial. The records of the Senate are replete with references made - by senators on the other side of the House to that fact. I think it is incumbent upon them, therefore, if they are to urge the need for a jury trial or to take advantage of the fact that this is not an offence where a jury is required to elaborate why there should be a. jury trial for this type of offence when they have previously indicated that for an offence with this type of penalty no jury trial is customary or required. </para>

            <para>- All I say is that if members of the Opposition were concerned to assert the need for a jury trial in these matters one would have expected that on the amendment which they moved they would have adduced at least one argument in favour of it. But they chose not to and at the request of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy,</inline> as soon as the motion had been moved and I had spoken against it, the question was put. If he now comes along and laments the absence of a jury trial it is only because he wants to use it in a particular way when, on the occasion when the actual amendment was before the Senate, he chose not to address any argument to try to persuade the Senate on that very fact. Now we come to the other point which was raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy.</inline> It is a plain misrepresentation to suggest that in any way there is a denial of the right of peaceable assembly by this provision. </para>

        <para>Clause 8 provides that an order may be given by a sergeant of police or a person of higher rank in the police force requiring an assembly to disperse, but if one looks at clause 8 (1.) one finds the circumstances in which that order can be given. In the first place, there must be an assembly of not less than 12 persons, and secondly, the persons taking part in the assembly must have conducted themselves in a way that has caused this senior member of the police force reasonably to apprehend that the assembly will be carried on in a manner involving unlawful physical violence to persons or unlawful damage to property or, in fact, if the assembly is being carried on in a manner involving such unlawful violence or damage. Do we understand the Opposition to say that if a riot is taking place or if there is a crowd of 12 persons or more who are bent on damaging property and are, in fact, damaging property and are, in fact, violently assaulting citizens, they should not be required to disperse? </para>

        <para class="block">I appreciate the point made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon.</inline> However, if one examines the clause in full it gives a power to a person to take such force as is reasonably necessary to prevent a riot from damaging property. As I understand it, though the circumstances in which a person other than a policeman would take this action would be such that he would have to be very careful as to what he did, he could do it in the circumstances I mentioned and he should be prepared to do it in those circumstances. As I see it, this provision derives from the Riot Act. In fact it is a repeal of the Riot Act which currently is the law in the Australian Capital Territory. If one looks at the Riot Act which is the existing law - I imagine it is the law which the Opposition would be seeking to retain in force if it repealed this provision - one finds these words in section 1 of 1 George I, chapter 5, 1714: </para>

I thought we were trying to get through this Bill reasonably expeditiously. That was the request made to us and we have been trying to do that in a convenient manner. It seemed to me to be convenient to dispose of that amendment so that we would know one way or the other - we had a pretty fair idea of what would happen to it - what the final shape of the clause would be. Then we could discuss the clause in its context. Once the amendment was disposed of we were able to do that and discuss the clause  on  the basis that the word 'indictable' was not. to be included. That is the basis upon which I put the matter. It does not become the Minister to complain of the way  is  which the arguments were being put, especially if they were put briefly, by the Opposition. ; </para>

            <para>- The Minister is not dealing with the clause in the way in which it should be considered. The Minister keeps saying that if a riot and a tumult were going on this clause could be used to prevent them. I have no doubt that it could. We on this side have not said that there ought not to be laws against great tumults and riots, or that if there were a danger of persons being killed or injured, or serious damage being done to property, there should not be provisions to deal with that situation. We are not suggesting that. lt is idle for (he Minister to say that this clause could be used against such great occasions of civil commotion and riot. What we are concerned about is the fact that it can be used on occasions other than that and it can be used unduly to circumscribe the right of peaceful assembly and freedom of speech. It has been drawn deliberately in such a way that it can be used to prevent peaceful occasions. There is no suggestion in the Bill that this clause is to be used on occasions of tumult and riot. Those words do not appear in the clause. If they did there would be more to be said for the Government's point of view. It is to be used where a member of the police force reasonably apprehends, in relation to a gathering of 12 people, that the assembly will be carried on, not that it is being carried on. But in what way does he apprehend that it will be carried on? Not in a tumultuous and riotous fashion, but in a manner involving -unlawful physical violence to persons or unlawful damage to property. That can mean in the minimum degree. Because of the way in which these matters are interpreted - 'persons' can; mean the singular. It could be any kind of. unlawful physical violence to one person or some minimal damage to property. The Committee will recall the words the Minister read from the Riot Act about tumult and riot, and the other expressions used by him which are redolent of some great civil commotion. They are deliberately out of; this. The words used in clause 8(l.)(b) are: </para>

        <para class="block">Under paragraph (b) let alone paragraph (a) it will be easy to stop any demon: str at ton. It might be a demonstration in which 50,000 people want to go peaceably through the streets of Sydney. It only wants some agent provocateur to put a brick through a window and the police sergeant can say: 'Not only do I apprehend that the assembly will be carried on in a manner involving unlawful damage but, under paragraph (b) it actually has been carried on.' One brick through a window satisfies this part of the section. From then on the whole assembly can be dispersed. No attempt will be made to say that this is a situation of tumult, riot or some really serious matter. The expressions used are the minimal ones. When the Minister for Health was speaking, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon</inline> interjected that the Minister did not understand the operation of clause 8 (4). It does not depend upon a direction being given. Even without a direction being given - I think the Minister will now concede this point - a person, meaning or including one of those thugs about whom we spoke earlier, could use such force as he believes on reasonable ground to be necessary to disperse or suppress an assembly and is reasonably proportioned to the danger which he believes, on reasonable grounds, is to be apprehended from the continuance of the assembly. </para>

            <para>- That is correct, but we know the situation does not have to be one of tumult or riot. As I have said it can be a situation where somebody puts a brick through a window. At a large and peaceful assembly if a brick is put through a window by some agent provocateur those thugs can move in and say: 'We are satisfied that this assembly is being carried on in a manner involving unlawful violence and damage,' and they will move in under subclause (4). One knows what will occur then. It is an open invitation for thugs to move in on the peaceful assemblies which we have seen in the capital cities on recent occasions. I do not think this is a fair clause. It is not a reasonable clause. I do not think it has been written in such a way that it will do what the Government has said it intended to do. If the Government wants to stop real damage occurring during some great civil commotion, tumult or riot and stop the development of something which we would say was dangerous to the community - there need to be laws to prevent occasions of great riot or tumult - why does it not write a clause saying that where this kind of thing happens action could be taken? But the Government has written this clause in this subtle and clever way to enable the authorities to prevent peaceful assemblies and to encourage thugs to break them up. </para>

          <para>It is difficult to believe that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> is serious in what he says. If there were any complaint that a clause was unnecessary in the Australian Labor Party's opposition to this Bill, it might be argued that a case could be made out for this subclause. I concede that a case could possibly be made which applies to sub-clause (4) because it. is probable that existing laws would enable any person to take such action as this clause is legally emboldening him to take. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> was serious last night I went along with him but I cannot follow this sort of argument at all. He rather gives the impression that the community is composed entirely of agents provocateur who go around heaving bricks through windows. That is so far fetched and unreal as to be difficult to understand. But the Opposition wilfully - I draw attention to the word wilfully' - refuses to observe the distinction between sub-clause (4) (a) and sub-clause (4) (b). In one case we are dealing with a reasonable apprehension. Something has not yet happened. A direction must be given before those powers in the rest of the clause are. conferred. In the case of sub-clause (4) (b) we are dealing with the situation where violence has actually broken out. If I can become as imaginative as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy-maybe</inline> heads are being broken, people hurled into the streets and enormous damage being done to property. Presumably <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> wants us to stand idly by, wait and until the catastrophe is over and bring civil proceedings. </para>

          <para>- So far, I have deliberately refrained from entering this debate either on the motion for the second reading or during the Committee stage. At this stage I enter into the debate because of the remarks which were made earlier by the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Greenwood)</inline> who in this chamber represents the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr N. H. Bowen)</inline> when replying to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> after a vote had been taken on an amendment which had been moved by my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland. I gather from the remarks of the Minister that he was reprimanding the Labor movement for not having spoken up at an earlier age. He was adopting the attitude: Speak up or shut up. Because I gained this impression from the Minister's remarks I come into the debate at this stage. Having read clause 8 of the Bill I am concerned at the effect it will have on decent citizens of this community, who make a personal decision - it is a personal decision - to take part in a demonstration, be it against some government policy or for the purpose of trying to get the Government to adopt a certain policy. Last night my friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> spoke a lot about the Georges River byelection. I can tell the Minister and. honourable senators on the Government side something about that by-election because I played quite a prominent part in helping <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Walker</inline> the new member for Georges River in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly secure a victory in a seat which had been held by the Liberal Party for some 15 years. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>On the day before the Georges River by-election was held there was a Moratorium demonstration in Sydney. It was designed to be a peaceful demonstration. Many thousands of young people who object to this Government's policy on Vietnam took part in the demonstration. They made a personal decision to take part in the demonstration because they objected to this Government's policy. Then something happened. The balloon went up. There was quite unnecessary and violent behaviour, probably on both sides. But because of the manner in which that disturbance took place hundreds of young people who, apart from their interest in Vietnam had never been interested in politics before, came into the Georges River by-election. They were concerned at the manner in which their civil liberties were being impinged upon. I can see great difficulties involved for the future civil liberties of young people who make personal decisions to try to influence the Government's policy by peaceful demonstrations. Sub-clause (2) of clause 8 provides </para>
        <para>A direction under this section shall be given orally- </para>
        <para class="block">That is by a policeman of the rank of sergeant or above -  - and in such a manner as to be likely to be audible to the persons constituting the assembly, or to as many of them as practicable . . . </para>
        <para class="block">If the Minister has seen any of these demonstrations he will know that they are as long as a mile or 2 miles. Violence or fear of violence can occur at the head of the column. Two miles further back - 4 blocks away - are people who for the purposes of this sub-clause could be assumed to have been informed that they are taking part in an unlawful assembly. When they get around the corner and. see that there has been violence, and they do not disperse, all the thuggery to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> has alluded can take place. </para>

It is alarmed at the fact that police signalled a deliberate intent towards violence by removing the numbers from their tunics. It is angered by the deliberate assaults on newsmen and the deliberate damage done to radio and television equipment by police, and the attempts by police to suppress coverage of the clash. </para>

        <para class="block">Will any honourable senator tell me that newsmen attend demonstrations for the purpose of demonstrating against the Establishment. They are there to report details of a demonstration through the mass media for the benefit of the public. On the occasion I have mentioned they were caught up in the row. If the Government proceeds with this sort of legislation I dare say that it will be the responsibility of a journalist to attend a demonstration at his own risk or not to attend at all. When journalists complained to the management of John Fairfax and Sons Ltd, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lou</inline> Leek agreed that the police were over the fence in their behaviour. He said when he received a report from one of the journalists on the staff of the 'Sydney Morning Herald' who had been belted around and put into hospital, that through the Chief of Staff he would let the Aka know what action, if any, would be taken. </para>
        <para>Members of the police force had removed their numbers. By this legislation the Government is encouraging that sort of attitude and is encouraging other members of the community to get in and use force and bash. This measure is against the interests of ordinary decent members of the community, of young children and students who decide for a personal and private reason, because they are opposed to this Government's policy and want to influence a change of that policy, to take part in demonstrations. In the interests of the Australian community and civil liberties this clause should be rejected by the Senate. </para>

          <para>- I wish to direct a question to the Minister. He indicated earlier that if reasonable propositions were put to him he would be prepared to consider them. At this stage I am prepared to concede that the Government has the numbers to pass this Bill, but I did detect on the part of the Minister a certain puzzlement when he read the Riot Act and discovered the extent to which clause 8 (4.)(b) differs from that Act. I do not ask him to confirm or to deny that impression. I appreciate that the Minister is not personally responsible for the drafting of the Bill. It was drafted for him by somebody else and given to him. From a reply that the Minister gave to my interjections I understood that he was under the impression that a person would have the right to take forceful action in the dispersal of a demonstration or assembly only if a direction had already been given by a police officer. I think he would have to concede on reading clause 8 (4.)(b) that without being extravagant and saying that all sorts of alarming things will take place, there is the possibility that people will think, if they are aware of the provisions of this Bill, that they will be able to engage in acts of violence with some impunity when taking part in an assembly. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>One can imagine an assembly being conducted in the terms of clause 8(l.)(b), 'in a manner involving such unlawful violence or damage'. It may occur while the assembly is being carried on and may be in no way the responsibility of persons who have organised the assembly - the persons who, in the ordinary sense of the words, are conducting the assembly. Nonetheless, during the course of the assembly unlawful violence or damage may take place. It could then follow that another person or group of persons who oppose the purpose for which the assembly was called, without any direction having been given either by a magistrate or a police officer, believing that there was a danger of further violence taking place, use force to disperse the assembly. In any event, they need only to have seen that unlawful damage or violence was taking place and they might use force to disperse the assembly. I put it to the Minister that this is a distinct possibility and is not extravagant. Without specifying political ideologies, people who wish to disperse an assembly could take advantage of this clause. If a group during the conduct of the assembly say that unlawful violence or damage was taking place within the framework of clause 8 (4.)(b), that group would be able to use force to disperse the assembly without a police officer ever having given a direction that they should do so. </para>
        <para>I appreciate that remedies could be available to people who felt a grieved by the actions of those persons who had used force to disperse the assembly, but in proceedings taken against the persons who had used force it would be necessary to show that there had not been unlawful violence or damage to property in order to succeed in the proceedings. I would imagine that it would be virtually impossible to succeed if any unlawful violence or damage had taken place and that the persons who forcefully dispersed the assembly would have a perfect defence to any subsequent proceedings taken against them with regard to the use of force. 1 hope I have put the proposition reasonably to the Minister and have not been extravagant. I think, as he himself observed when he read the Riot Act, that the force could be used only after a direction had been given. I will not labour the point about whether it is a magistrate or a police officer, but under the Riot Act a direction had to be given by somebody in authority. Under clause 8 (4.) <inline font-style="italic">(b)-</inline> I think the Minister himself was surprised to realise this - this action to forcibly disperse the assembly may be taken by some private person, whatever his motives may be, who is not acting under the direction of any police officer. In fact, it is even conceivable that he may be acting contrary to the wishes of a police officer or a lawful authority. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> whether he has considered this point. </para>

          <para>-  It is a pleasure to respond to reasonable responses. I must say that the way in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon</inline> put his case does raise the possibility of a situation occurring in which a person who was bent on causing trouble could endeavour to misuse these provisions. I think it is the same as what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> said, namely, that if there is a demonstration and one person - whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> called an agent provocateur - throws a brick through a window and that window is damaged unlawful damage is occurring, and in the circumstances of clause 8 (4.) it would be permissible for a person, even though an order had not been given for that demonstration to disperse, to believe that he was justified in taking action of a violent character to disperse that demonstration. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The fact that that person would not be entitled, on an examination of this provision, to do that may appear to him to be a factor of no consequence because, as I have said, the proposition one must predicate is that a person is determined to cause trouble. I do not think that any criticism of that situation is reason for regarding this provision in clause 8 as unnecessary. It is a situation which exists under the present law, just as it would exist under the law as proposed here. But the point is that after this Bill has come into force what will become quite clear is what a person is entitled to do and what he is not entitled to do. I believe that that is more advantageous than for a person to proceed on an assumption that there are some things he can do and some things he cannot do but he can never find out what they are because he has not recourse to an old and ancient Riot Act. </para>
        <para>This provision was designed to codify the common law, to extract the law which applies at the present time, to put it into language which is clear and to say: 'This is what the position is'. It is not new, and it is not something which brings in concepts hitherto unknown to the law. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon</inline> referred to the Rio* Act and provisions under that Act. I quoted section 1 of the Riot Act 1714. It is clear from that section that if a person persists in riotous behaviour - in the context of this Bill, in being a member of an assembly where the assembly is causing unlawful physical violence or unlawful damage to property - there is an obligation upon the citizen where a felony is occurring to take action to prevent that felony occurring. That is the obligation of every citizen. </para>

            <para>- Section 1 of the Riot Act surely places this obligation on the citizen after a direction has been given. The provision in this clause does not codify the existing statutory or common law. but creates a new right; and that is of the citizen to disperse the assembly without any direction having been given. </para>

            <para>- I agree that in its express terms that is what the Riot Act does, but the way the Riot Act does it is to say that anybody who does not disperse in those circumstances is to be adjudged guilty of a felony. It is the fact that a person is adjudged guilty of a felony which calls in aid the assistance of the citizen. If there is a felony, whether it be committed as part of riotous behaviour in an assembly or whether a person is committing the felony quite apart from being part of an assembly, there is an obligation on the citizen to take action to prevent that felony from occurring. Let me illustrate the point by referring to what is said in Kenny's Outlines of Criminal Law', which  is a  basic textbook that all students read. It states: </para>

          <para>The alarm with which the common law viewed unlawful assemblies naturally led to the establishment of the rule that they may be dispersed forcibly; the particular degree of force which persons will be lawfully justified in using must be determined by the necessities of each individual case. Unlawful assembly and riot are only misdemeanours at common law, and although blows with fists or with sticks may be struck when necessary to suppress the persons involved it will be unlawful to kill any of the rioters or to employ deadly weapons. However, if the rioters go beyond their misdemeanour and proceed to the length of some felonious violence, then even the infliction of death will be permissible in resisting such violence or in dispersing or arresting the rioters. However, it is an indictable misdemeanour at common law to refuse to aid or .assist a constable in the exercise of his duty in order to preserve the peace. </para>

        <para>Looking at the provisions in Australia, section 261 of the Queensland Criminal Code provides that it is lawful for any person to use such force as is necessary to suppress a riot and is reasonably proportioned to the danger to be apprehended from its continuance. One sees in that the derivation of part of what appears in clause 8 of this Bill. Section 262 of the Queensland Criminal Code provides that it is lawful for a police officer to use such force as he believes on reasonable grounds to be necessary in order to suppress a riot and as is reasonably proportioned to the danger which he believes on reasonable grounds is to be apprehended from its continuance. </para>

There has to be a reasonable apprehension in the mind of a police sergeant or someone of higher rank that there will be, having regard to the conduct which is taking place, unlawful physical violence or damage to property, or actual damage to property has to be occurring. In those circumstances, an order may be made by a police officer of the rank of sergeant or above that that assembly is to disperse; and, if that assembly does not disperse, then persons using reasonable force may assist in its dispersal. There is a provision which says that even if no order has been given by a police officer requiring the assembly to disperse but physical violence or damage to property is actually occurring, then it will be lawful for any person, provided that he conducts himself reasonably and does not use force which is greater than that which is reasonably proportioned to the circumstances in which he finds himself, to take action to disperse that riot. </para><para>I believe that the requirements of public order are such that there should be provisions of that character to ensure that the peace is preserved.

If one goes to origins there can be no other justification for government.

          <para>-  I am rather disappointed that the Minister had to add his peroration to his reply to my question which, 1 thought, had tended to avoid raising that type of issue. I wish to put a proposition to the Minister. I feel that, having put this proposition, there is not much more that 1 at any rate could say on the matter. Would he not concede that there could be a situation where an assembly is taking place, where there has been unlawful violence or damage caused by some persons present at the assembly, where there are police officers present and the police officers believe that it is unreasonable in all the circumstances to call upon the assembly to disperse, but despite the fact that the responsible police officers present have decided that in all the circumstances they would not be warranted in calling on the assembly to disperse, because there has been violence or unlawful damage to property, a private citizen would be acting lawfully in using force to disperse that assembly although a police inspector, a police superintendent or a police commissioner present on this occasion may have felt that in all the circumstances it would have been unreasonable to disperse the assembly? Despite the opinion of the police, in those circumstances would it not be permissible for these private people, whoever they are, to use force to disperse the assembly? Would it not be lawful for them so to do? </para>

To take the point that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon</inline> raised, if there is a riotous group, and if the police sergeant does not believe that that group should be dispersed because of the situation which has been reached and if an individual, in the presence of that police officer, uses violence, I would be very surprised if the police officer did not haul that person away immediately.

            <para>The Opposition does not oppose this Bill which is a fairly simple measure. Its purpose is to ratify the pro to cal which was agreed to in New York on 12th March at the assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organisation. It simply provides for an increase in the number of seats on the council of the organisation, which is the governing body of ICAO. This having been brought about by an increase in the number of members of the organisation. I propose to comment very briefly on the Australian delegation's support for the increase as outlined by the Minister for Civil Aviation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cotton)</inline> in his second reading speech. I hope that these increases will not be accepted automatically. The Minister mentioned three reasons for our support of the increase in membership. He said: </para>

I hope that the Australian delegation will give this matter serious consideration because there are many complaints about United Nations agencies increasing their numbers without proper consideration being given to the need for an increase. </para>
          <para>I need to make only one other point concerning the Bill. I refer to Article 44 of the International Civil Aviation Agreement and particularly to sub-sections (d) and (e). The article states: </para>

          <para class="block">As most of us are aware, the great bulk of international civil aviation is under the control of the International Air Transport Association. There has been much criticism in the last year or two concerning the price structures agreed to by IATA. As the article from which 1 have just read relates directly to more efficient and economic air transport throughout the world, there is a direct relationship between the work of these 2 organisations. I should like to read very quickly an extract from a statement on the international air transportation policy of the United States which was approved by the  President  on 22nd June 1970. It states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The United States should continue to accept . Data as the machinery for pricing scheduled services, subject to continuing safeguards, but supplemented by increased direct informal exchanges between governments. Continued support should also be given to the establishment of Data and non-Data charter rates on a free competitive basis. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The important message there concerns the direct informal exchanges between governments. I consider that ICAO is just the organisation to do this. I suggest to the Minister that he might discuss this with his Department and our Australian representatives who will attend these meetings because we cannot accept a situation in which some international organisation such as Data has complete and absolute control over what is done with policy. Governments are directly involved. Australia is especially involved because our overseas airline is Government owned. We should ensure that through ICAO we can express the policies of this Government and ensure that notice is taken of trends of thinking in world international aviation. The Opposition supports the legislation. </para>

            <para>- in reply - I thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> and the Opposition for their support, but also 1 thank the honourable senator for his comments about the International Civil Aviation Organisation and particularly about Article 44 of the International Civil Aviation Agreement which refers to the objectives of ICAO. Whilst it nowhere mentions the International Air Transport Association, nonetheless 1 take his point. Data is recognised by ICAO as a body formed by international airline operators who tried to get some regularity in the business. Undoubtedly it is completely independent of ICAO, but at the same time it works in the same area of general aviation interest. I shall take the honourable senator's comments to the Department of Civil Aviation with the suggestion that they be borne in mind. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I do not think there is any point in my incorporating in Hansard Article 44; 1 merely mention that it deals with the safe and orderly growth of international civil aviation; the encouragement of the arts of aircraft design and operation for peaceful purposes', the encouragement of the development of airways and airports; meeting the needs of people for safe air transport; preventing economic waste; ensuring that the rights of contracting States are respected; avoiding discrimination; promoting air safety; and promoting generally the development of all aspects of international civil aviation. The honourable senator commented on IATA's ability and general pattern of setting world fare structures and world flying conditions for domestic and international carriers. In that respect I make the point that the comment made by the United States  President  is more valid for a country like the United States, which has a huge aircraft manufacturing industry - I think an over capacity - and an airline industry which is in substantial over capacity. We would have to approach this problem from a slightly different angle. I am sure that the honourable senator would appreciate that. </para>
          <para>However. I take his comments which were intended to be of serious impact and they will be communicated to the people who will go to ICAO. The honourable senator mentioned the cost of international agencies. I have asked the Department previously to inform me of the general costs of our membership of ICAO because I think this is something that the Senate is entitled to know. The expenditure of ICAO. which is authorised by the ICAO assembly, is provided for by misc elle nous income and cash surpluses from earlier years, but it is financed mainly by annual assessment of contracting States in accordance with their scale of assessment for each year as agreed by the assembly. Over the past 10 years the total amount contributed by the States towards the expenses of the Organisation has been of the order of $US4m to $US7m. During this period Australia's assessed annual share of the expenditure has ranged from 2.46 per cent in 1961 to 2.02 per cent in 1971. Australia's contribution for the calendar year 1971 will be SUS141.825. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> said that because the number of members of the Council is being increased from 27 to 30 it might add to our costs. My information is that the Department of Civil Aviation believes that there will be practically no addition to the cost of running ICAO when the membership of the Council is increased from 27 to 30. I again thank honourable senators for the speedy passage of this legislation through the Senate. </para>

          </motion>
          <para class="block">This Bill is inter-related with the Stevedoring Industry Charge Assessment Bill which will shortly be before the Senate and it may meet the convenience of honourable senators if the measures are dealt with together. In these second reading speeches I will explain the background and reason for each of the Bills. </para>
          <para>The Stevedoring Industry Charge Assessment Act 1947-1967 provides for the assessment and collection of the stevedoring industry charge at rates prescribed by regulation under the Stevedoring Industry Charge Act. Different rates are payable in respect of the classes of waterside workers. Class 'A' waterside workers are registered regular waterside workers employed on weekly hiring at permanent or continuous ports who are eligible to join the Stevedoring Industry Employees Retirement Fund. Class 'B' waterside workers are employed at continuous non-permanent ports and are eligible to participate in the retirement fund. Class 'C waterside workers are those employed at non-continuous ports and include irregular waterside workers on Part B of the register at all ports. </para>
          <para>The Stevedoring Industry Charge Act 1947-1967 limits the rate of the charge payable in respect of employment of these three classes of waterside workers as defined in the Stevedoring Industry Charge Assessment Act. The maximum permitted rates of charge under the charge Act are $17.55 per man-week, 80c per man-hour, and 55c per man-hour for 'A*, 'B' and 'C classes respectively and regulations under that Act at present prescribe for the charge to be levied at these maximum rates. Up until 1967 the Australian stevedoring industry had been organised almost entirely on a casual employment basis The Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority administered the labour force of waterside workers engaged in stevedoring operations through the registration system under the provisions of the Stevedoring Industry Act 1956-1966. The role of the Authority included such important functions as labour allocation, payment of annual leave, tick leave, long service leave and holiday pay as well as attendance money, transfer costs and subsidy of amenities such as waterfront cafeteria services. These commitments were met from revenue raised through the stevedoring industry charge. </para>
          <para>In 1967 the National Stevedoring Industry Conference which was set up by the Government in 1965, recommended major changes in the industry including inter alia: A scheme for permanent employment of waterside workers in major ports; a pension scheme to apply to regular waterside workers in all permanent and continuous ports; and arrangements to cope with anticipated redundancy in the industry. In particular the conference report called for major changes in the role of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority. The Authority's labour allocation functions were to disappear in permanent employment ports but it was to retain all its then existing functions in non-permanent ports. When the parties to the National Conference - the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Waterside Workers Federation, the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour and the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority - endorsed the report, the Government agreed to provide legislative authority to cover these and other matters. The enabling legislation was the Stevedoring Industry (Temporary Provisions) Act 1967, which was subsequently extended in operation upon its expiry in June 1970 until 30th June 1972. </para>
          <para>Immediately before the introduction of the permanent employment scheme there was a uniform charge of 48c levied on each man-hour worked by waterside workers in the industry. It was not practical to continue with a uniform charge when the new scheme came into operation as, for example, employers of weekly hire employees now had to carry at their own expense costs such as annual leave, sick leave and public holidays as well as administer their own labour allocation. In addition it was decided that the employers contributions to the new pension scheme and the redundancy fund should be financed through the charge. Before the implementation of the national conference scheme waterside workers who were available for work but not required to work received attendance money paid by the Authority from the proceeds of the charge. On the introduction of permanent employment it was recognised that waterside workers on weekly hiring under the conference arrangements would be in a similar situation insofar as being available for work but on occasions not required to work. The men concerned do not lose by this because they are on a weekly wage. Insofar as the employer was concerned it was decided, where in previous circumstances attendance money would have been paid, the employer should be reimbursed from the charge for full shifts paid for when there is no work for the men. Attendance money payments continued as before for waterside workers who are not engaged on weekly hire and who are defined as classes B and C waterside workers. </para>
          <para>Prior to the changes in 1967 the basis for financing the stevedoring industry long service leave scheme through the charge was to provide funds only to meet payments on account of leave taken on a year to year cash basis. In 1967 when the components of the new charges were calculated it was decided to convert the previous financing arrangements from a cash outgoing basis to one where a fund would be built up to enable sufficient money to be available to pay all long service leave as and when it became due. The Authority continued to administer the long service leave scheme. The conclusion reached in 1967 was that the major permanent employment ports should continue as in the past to contribute something to the costs in the remaining ports. The maximum rate set for class A waterside workers was therefore fixed at $17.55 per man-week under the 1967 legislation and regulations made under the Charge Act at that time fixed the actual rate at $16.85 per man-week. The notional hourly rate was calculated at 48c being the same as the pre-existing charge in the industry. </para>
          <para>The maximum charge in respect of class C waterside workers was fixed at 55c per man-hour, only 7c higher than the are- 1967 level and this amount was determined on the basis of the additional amount needed to finance the long service leave fund. At the continuous ports for class B waterside workers the maximum rate of 80c was 32c higher - 22c of this rearesenting the pension, redundancy and long service leave items. The balance of 10c over and above the are- 1967 charge rearesents a further contribution towards the cost in those ports. The regulations made in 1967 set the charges for both B and C class waterside workers at the maximum provided under the legislation. However, since the introduction of permanent employment in 1967 - when the original charges were determined and expected to cover the situation until June 1971 - costs have increased as follows: </para>
          <list type="loweralpha">
            <item label="(a)">
              <para>The weekly wage rate for class A waterside workers has risen from $50.50 per week to $67.40 as at 1st January 1971 because of flow-on of the metal trades margins decision, national wage case including the last 6 per cent increase and consent award increases granted by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. This represents an increase of 33.5 per cent in the ordinary award weekly rates for waterside workers since 1967. Over the same period the rates for a metal trades fitter has increased by 33.0 per cent. </para>

              <para>In May 1970, under the Chairmanship of a  Deputy President  of the Commission, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Moore, the employers, the ACTU and the Waterside Workers' Federation reached agreement on a number of matters which were awarded by consent. These included a weekly wage increase of $6.50, an extra week of annual leave (now 4 weeks) plus a 17i per cent loading, sick leave increased from 5 to 7 days per annum with no limit on accumulation (previously 2 year limit), 3 days compassionate leave on the death of a close relative, increased meal money $1.25 (previously $1.00), and provision of personal issue of two pairs of overalls per year. </para>

              <para>By previous agreement the rate of payment for annual leave had become the rate for long service leave entitlement and this commitment increased by 17 <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> per cent following the Moore award. Since the introduction of permanent employment in 1967 the weekly rate of pay for long service leave has risen by 46.2 per cent. </para>

            </item>
            <item label="(e)">
              <para>The cost of reimbursing employers of Class A waterside workers for full shifts when their employees were available for work but not required to work has risen partly because of a 33.5 per cent increase in the minimum weekly rate of pay since 1967 and partly because of the increasing incidence of these shifts this financial year. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>I should point out that whilst the total waterside worker labour force has decreased from 20,140 in 1967 to 17,178 at the end of February 1971, the demand for labour over the past year or so has fluctuated quite markedly. The result has been that on occasions there have been large surpluses of labour available but not required to work. There are two basic reasons for this. One is the need to retain a labour force which is adequate to cope with the peak demands created by trade factors and shipping movements. The second is that the change from conventional to container and unit load vessels has not proceeded at a uniformly consistent rate. Accordingly the incidence of paid but unworked shifts has become the major item of expenditure from the charge revenue and as such is under close scrutiny by the Government. Every effort is being made to keep this factor within reasonable bounds but of course the fluctuations in trade and shipping movements have and always will be a determining influence on the actual level of the labour force required to service the industry. </para>
          <para>Because of the progressively increasing costs the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority has found itself unable to meet its financial commitments from the charge revenue. As an interim measure in mid 1969 the Authority reduced the amount paid to the long service leave fund by 2c per man-hour from that portion of the charge relating to the long term funding of the Long Service Leave Reserve in order to meet day to day expenditure. In October 1970, the Authority was forced into the position of suspending payments to the Long Service Leave Reserve Fund altogether and in addition some interest bearing deposits falling due from that fund reserve have not been reinvested but utilised to meet current expenditure. The cash reserves of the Authority were entirely exhausted in November 1970 and since the 16th October 1970 the Treasury has had to make advance payments of S800.000 each month to overcome the current deficits. </para>
          <para>As a further interim measure pending consideration of legislative changes the charge for class A waterside workers was increased by regulation to the maximum provided by the legislation of SI 7.55 per man-week, a notional equivalent of 50c per man-hour, as from the 15th February 1971. It is regretted that further increases in the charge are necessary particularly at a time when the Commonwealth is concerned to contain price increases throughout industry. They are needed to restore the financial position of the Authority in order to meet its commitments from the charge revenue and recoup the short-fall in the Long Service Leave Fund which has been eroded since mid-1969 in the ways in which I have just outlined. However, it needs to borne in mind that the charge rates fixed in 1967 have been held at those levels for 3 years during a period of rapidly rising costs in the industry. The increases now needed have come about because of the accumulation of arbitrated decisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, other changes in wage rates and conditions of employment awarded with the consent of the stevedoring industry employers and the increased incidence of occasions when there is no work for the men. </para>
          <para>In fact an increase in charge rates has been specifically requested by the employers and they have indicated that it would be intolerable in their view to continue to allow the Authority to engage in the deficit financing of the financial commitments of the industry. In this respect it needs to be pointed out that the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority is primarily acting as an agent for the industry's employers in channelling the funds from the charge back to them for pensions, redundancy and paid but unworked shifts. It might also be said that the Authority plays an agency role for the employers in its administration of the industry long service leave scheme. The employers, as they did in 1967, have again accepted that the financial arrangements for classes B and C waterside workers should be subject to some minor subsidy from the charge levied on the work performed by class A waterside workers. The increases in the charges proposed reflect approximately the same degree of subsidy as that fixed in 1967. To have done otherwise would have placed a disproportionate cost burden on employers in the non-permanent employment ports. </para>
          <para>The main purpose of the Stevedoring Industry Charge Assessment Bill 1971 is to amend the Stevedoring Charge Assessment Act 1947-1967 to provide for a conversion of the charge for class A waterside workers from a man-week basis to a man hour basis. When the 1967 legislation was introduced the employers specifically requested that the stevedoring industry charge for class A waterside worker should be expressed as a weekly amount as all their records were being kept on this basis in respect of weekly hire employees. The then weekly rate of $16.85 was calculated on an assumed average working week, over a full year, of 37.4 hours. After allowance was made for authorised award absences in a year for annual leave, sick leave and public holidays, the notional hourly rate determined was 48c. At the present weekly rate of SI 7.55 the notional hourly rate would be 50c. Experience has demonstrated that the effective hourly rate of charge paid by individual employers varies according to the degree of labour utilisation and the weekly rate, therefore, has operated unfairly against those employers unable to obtain maximum utilisation of labour. </para>
          <para>Put another way, if an employer because of stevedoring contract commitments worked his men on average in excess of 37.4 hours per week the effective hourly rate of charge from the weekly levy of $17.55 would be less than 50c per man hour. Therefore the busier larger employer would be able to get all hours worked at a cheaper hourly rate and enter into contracts to the disadvantage of other employers. The proposed change in the class A charge from a man-week to a man-hour basis has been recommended by the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour. </para>
          <para class="block">Because of the proposed conversion of the class A charge to a man-hour basis the Stevedoring Industry Charge Assessment Bill also provides for consequential amendments to the principal Act to exclude the levying of the charge on specified man hours paid for by the employer but not actually worked by his waterside workers. These paid hours are almost entirely in respect of awarded annual and sick leave entitlements and shifts where waterside workers were available for work but not required to work. </para>
          <para>The purpose of the Stevedoring Industry Charge Bill 1971 is to amend the Stevedoring Industry Charge Act 1947-1967 to permit the charge to be imposed at rates up to $1 per man-hour for class A waterside workers, $1.75 per man-hour for class B waterside workers and $1.20 per man-hour in respect of class C waterside workers. In 1967, the principal Act was amended to permit the respective charge rates to be fixed by regulation at a level not exceeding the maximum rates authorised by the Act. It is the Government's intention to declare as soon as possible by regulation that the new rates of charge be 65c, $1.20 and 82c per man-hour for classes A, B and C waterside workers respectively. </para>
          <para>These rates in the proposed regulation should be adequate to meet costs to the 30th June 1972 and recoup the deficit in this financial year. Leaving aside the prospect of further increases in wage rates it can be expected there will be scope for some significant reduction when the past services benefits section of the pensions fund and the long service leave reserve have been fully funded and the labour force has been stabilised at an appropriate level following completion of the transition to containerisation and other forms of unit loading. </para>
          <para>In summary, since November 1967 the 33.5 per cent increase in the award rate of pay for waterside workers and other progressively increasing costs which I detailed earlier in my speech make it necessary for changes to be made in the charge rates. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

              <para>- Please do not tempt me to be otherwise. I believe that the second reading speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> in effect pays tribute to those within the industry. There has been a tremendous transformation in this industry. It has passed from what may be regarded as a casual basis industry to one of permanency. Not so long ago the members of the Waterside Workers Federation were regarded always as the bad boys of industry. I personally have never subscribed to that view knowing of the work they have had to do, but I wonder now on reflection whether people were justified in saying the unkind things they said about the members of the Waterside Workers Federation in view of the fewer industrial disturbances that have taken place since the industry was organised on a permanent basis. I question whether on reflection people may not feel a little guilty in their conscience about so many barbs having been thrust at the waterside workers in the past. I repeat that I believe it is a fine tribute to those within the industry that they have been able to accommodate to the extent that they have such a transformation within the industry in working conditions, wages and industrial regulations. The partners to this legislation have accepted the proposition. I believe it would be wrong, therefore, for us to do anything but accept it because it was done in the complete spirit of conciliation. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>There are one or two observations I wish to make about the Minister's second reading speech. Quite rightly, he pointed out that the work force in the Waterside Workers Federation has been decreasing. The work force has decreased, over a 4- year period, from 20,140 in 1967 to 17,000 at the end of February 1971. Membership of the Federation has been reduced by about 3,000. That is a substantial reduction in any work force and it would indicate to everybody the influence of mechanisation or changed circumstances within an industry. These things substantially reduce a work force and we should bear this in mind when industries are affected by changed circumstances. </para>

              <para>- That is right. I hope that the Minister will enlarge on his statement in the second paragraph on folio 6 of his second reading speech. He said: </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">I am, perhaps, a suspicious character by nature when it comes to industrial matters. I hope that the Government does not have it in mind to do anything that will affect the wage envelopes of those within this industry. Perhaps the Minister can give an explanation of those words. </para>
          <para>I think the Minister's second reading speech indicates another very important thing in industry. I refer to the fact that the Waterside Workers Federation has been able to negotiate successfully, or by means of arbitration, and to hold its position in line with the Metal Trades Federation. We must consider that waterside workers usually are regarded as semi skilled, certainly when compared with metal trades workers. I believe it speaks volumes for the work of the officials of the Waterside Workers Federation that they have been able to adjust the wages of members of their union in line with those of a skilled industry. If this has been done substantially by conciliation it again reflects credit on the industry for having been able to get together around the table and adjust wages in a manner that can be regarded as satisfactory to all concerned. </para>
          <para>I want to finish this speech by paying tribute to those within the industry for having been able to adjust so readily to the changed circumstances. I pay tribute to them for having adopted progressively and consistently the spirit of conciliation. I believe it is a tribute to all concerned that they have progressed so smoothly in this transformation period and that they have been able to work harmoniously. I hope that in future their working conditions will be safer. Some 3 weeks ago - I speak from memory - I asked the Minister a question about safety measures in the waterfront industry. I am not criticising the Minister for not replying as yet to my question. The fact that I asked it would indicate to him and to others, if any indication were necessary, that I have an admiration for people who work within the Waterside Workers Federation and that I am keenly interested in the safety measures employed within the industry. At times I believe safety conditions are not up to the standard that should be observed in an industry of this nature or, in fact, in any industry. I conclude by stating that the Opposition offers no objection to this Bill. </para>

            <para>-  in reply - I listened to the observations made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulliner</inline> to my second reading speech. As far as safety precautions on the waterfront are concerned, we all share his endeavour in this field to see that they are improved to the maximum possible extent. There has been a great improvement but there is room for greater improvement still. Safety in industrial work is an exigency of industry on the waterfront no less than in other fields of industry. The other aspect he referred to refers to what appears on folio 6 of my speech. I laid emphasis, when reading the speech, on this sentence: </para>

          <para class="block">If honourable senators would be good enough to look at the annual report of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority - I do not have it at hand but have sent for it and may receive it before the conclusion of the debate on the next Bill relating to this matter - it will be seen that the idle time paid for in respect of waterside labour is by far the major item of expense. If we do not establish a rhythm in the container system of shipping that enables the loading and unloading requirements of ships to synchronise with the availability of labour, that is a charge which is, at the present time, of a wasteful degree. That is why the Government is going to give it close scrutiny in the interests of efficiency. Only with efficiency and economy can we have a satisfactory performance on the waterfront. My recollection is that the figure involved is $1.6m. If I am in error on that point I will take the opportunity later this day to correct it. I have no doubt the Senate would permit Hansard to incorporate the real figure. In order to indicate my concern in this matter, I want honourable senators to know the dimension of the figure. I thank the Senate. </para>

            <para>That the Bill be now  read a  second time. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>Basically this is a machinery Bill that stems from the changes in the Stevedoring Industry Charge Bill. I have already referred, in my earlier speech, to the principal changes made by this Bill. Having outlined the reasons for these measures relating to the stevedoring industry charge it is appropriate for me to touch briefly on some aspects of the stevedoring industry. </para>
          <para>In the course of these second reading speeches I have given details of the considerable increases in wages and conditions which have been awarded to waterside workers. The most recent major concessions were made in May 1970 when the parties were before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Moore. As part of that consent 2-year award both the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Waterside Workers Federation gave a written undertaking there would be no stoppages of work in respect of those matters which were the subject of that agreement. In relation to other conditions of employment not covered by the agreement reached before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Moore the </para>
          <para class="block">Waterside Workers Federation gave an undertaking that it would progress all claims with the employers through established procedures and take all reasonable steps to ensure that work continued normally while these negotiations were in progress. </para>
          <para>It is common knowledge that since then some members and branches of the Federation have embarked on stoppages ranging from 1 hour to a full day on issues covered by these undertakings. Whilst the ACTU and the federal officers of the Federation have done their utmost to ensure that the undertakings which they gave in the proceedings before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Moore were honoured, I want to make 2 points perfectly clear. Firstly, the Government expects the undertakings to be honoured. Secondly, the Government will be giving close attention to the performance of the Federation, its branches and its membership, recognising they are one of the principal parties to the agreement. The paries to the National Conference Agreement can scarcely be expected to endorse a new agreement in 1972 without attempts being made by branches of the Federation and the members to prove their bona fides in respect of the unexpired term of the current agreement. </para>
          <para>It is to be regretted that the Federation in some branches has also become the vehicle, along with certain other maritime unions, whereby minority elements within the trade union movement have sought to convert industrial power into political action. In many instances strike action has been taken on a unilateral basis without the sanction of the ACTU or the Trades and Labour Councils. The performance of employers in the industry is not above criticism. In many instances unilateral concessions by individual employers have led to industrial stoppages when the Federation has sought to extend the gains made. In addition many employers have found it difficult to make the transition from the are- 1967 casual system to permanent employment. In the Government's view the employers have now had sufficient opportunity to be able to take fully on themselves all the responsibility of the weekly hire system to which they are parties. The </para>
          <para class="block">Government will be giving careful attention to the manner in which the employers at all levels administer these responsibilities. </para>
          <para>On the credit side it is fair to say that the technological changes which have occurred in the stevedoring and shipping industries since  1967  have been achieved with the co-operation of the Waterside Workers Federation. This is in clear contrast to the experience of certain overseas countries where the stevedoring employees resisted strongly the introduction of new techniques. In Australia most of the disputation which has occurred has resulted from action by ancillary labour other than the waterside workers in these new areas. The Government views with serious concern the degree of industrial dislocation on the waterfront. The extent of this dislocation is clearly evident in the number of man-hours lost through strikes, which in  1969-70  were  1,072,592  representing  3.8  per cent of the total man-hours worked. This was the highest number of man-hours lost since  1964-65. </para>
          <para>The National Conference Agreement and enabling legislation both come up for review before the end of June  1972.  The Government will be carrying out an intensive review of the per manet employment arrangements and the matters to which I have drawn attention. Its judgement on how the scheme has operated and what action should be taken for the future will be influenced by the performance of the parties. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

The message is described as a message from the House of Representatives. In reality it is a message from the Government because the Government is introducing measures into the other House and dealing with them in such a way as might appropriately be described as 'rubber stamping'. The Government is using and abusing the House of Representatives to turn it into a vehicle for the oppression and destruction of the parliamentary institution. I think the attention of the nation ought to be drawn to this situation. </para>

I submit that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Acting Deputy President,</inline> we were asked to deal with a point of order and you did not give a ruling on it. Then we had a most remarkable speech from my friend and colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack. In the very nice terminology that he uses, he stated that you had not given a ruling but had allowed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> to continue with his remarks. Saying that you did not carry out your duties, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, was</inline> a reflection on the Chair. Although perhaps he did not mean it that way, that to my mind was what happened. </para>

It is an unusual action, because we have been allowing these things to go through. We allowed the Minister for Air <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Drake-Brockman)</inline> to put through 3 Bills dealing with pigs. In those cases a motion similar to the one now before the Chair was moved without any objection from this side. However, now we say that because of what is happening in the parliamentary institution of this nation we should at least say that enough is enough; we should carry on our work with the decorum that the people of Australia desire of us. </para>

They are sorry days in which we live when the Government, at the same time as putting through measures it claims to be necessary to protect law and order, is breaking down the institution of Parliament. When laws can be made in the way in which these laws are being made, how can the Government except that there will be respect among the younger generation or anyone else for the laws in this community? Everybody knows that the laws are being rubber-stamped by this Government. </para>

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> rose to suggest that if during the course of my speech 1 wish to refer to the decorum of the House I should do so by raising a point of order. 1 think 1 am entitled to draw to your attention the question of whether it is appropriate for the Minister to misconduct himself in the chamber. If you consider that I should do this by way of a point of order, in future I shall do so, but I think the matter could be much more easily remedied by the Minister himself. We are discussing a motion to suspend so much of the Standing Orders as would prevent the Bill passing through all stages without delay. I think that the motion deserves to be opposed on this day because of the circumstances in which the Parliament is operating. If proper consideration had been given to this matter we might have agreed as in the usual course to such a motion. It is notorious that matters are not being given the consideration by this Parliament which they are entitled to have. The people are entitled to have proper consideration of the matters coming before both chambers. That consideration has not been given. </para>

            <para>-  I rise to a point of order. While you were engaged, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, the</inline> honourable senator emphasised that the Parliament is entitled to consider matters coming before both chambers. That is a deliberate disregard of your ruling that the honourable senator should confine himself to the motion before this chamber, which is that standing orders should be suspended so that the Bill can pass through all stages without delay. If the honourable senator can adduce any argument to that point, I submit that you <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, should</inline> permit us to listen to it; but you should prevent us having to listen to argument of another sort. </para>

            <para>-  I wish to speak to the point of order. I do not understand why I am being persistently interrupted because in the first instance you ruled on the point of order raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack that I was in order in alluding to the debates in the other House. That ruling was given by you and is binding on everyone. I had alluded to the debates. Since that time I have passed from dealing directly with the proceedings in the other place. It seems to me that, rather than dealing with the larger area which you had ruled previously was in order, I have been speaking on a much narrower confinement and I have been merely making a passing reference to the matter. I am certainly completely within the scope of the original ruling which you gave. 1 think it would be extraordinary to suggest that my statement that legislation is entitled to be given consideration by both chambers was not directed in a relevant kind of way to the motion. It was directed precisely to the subject matter of the motion. I believe that the matter is entitled to have that consideration. It has not had it in the other place. Therefore there is every reason why the Senate should not proceed to suspend the Standing Orders to allow the Bill to be passed through all its stages without delay. If these interruptions were to cease, I think I could finish my speech fairly quickly. </para>

            <para>- That interjection is, of course, disorderly. The Minister for Works <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wright)</inline> has no leave to withdraw anything. There is a motion before the Senate. We say that the Parliament is entitled to give proper consideration to its affairs. The Senate should respect the other place. I think that that respect would be shown best by the Senate refusing to rush through this chamber this Bill. The Senate should not entertain this motion to suspend so much of the Standing Orders as would prevent this Bill passing through all its stages without delay. The Senate should reject that motion because it is not proper that the Senate should rush through this Bill when the other place has not had the opportunity to have proper consideration of it. The Parliament depends not only on the Government but also on the Opposition. It is the view of my colleagues, not only here but in the other place that members of the other place have not been able to put their views as they would wish and that in this Parliament, if matters are to be considered properly and if there is to be respect for the law, the Senate should show to the Government its views on this attempt to have rushed through this Parliament, including the Senate, measures which are not given the consideration which they deserve. I end on this note. I repeat the words of someone who spoke a long time ago in a place near a Senate. He said: </para>

          <para>(3.40)  -  I was not present at the beginning of this discussion. As I understand the position, the Opposition is dissenting from a formal motion moved by the Minister for Works <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wright)</inline> in relation to the suspension of so much of the Standing Orders. This is a contingency motion. Since the Standing Orders were written it has always been a contingency motion. In fact, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> has in his name on the notice paper a contingency motion for the very purpose of having a contingency motion. I do not want to have engendered here the heat that has allegedly been engendered in another place. I want to get on with the job. I assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> that this is a contingency motion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> in his speech and by interjection, said that the Government has no intention of proceeding with the motion, in view of the points made. What the Government wants to do and what I am sure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> and other honourable senators want to do is to get on with the job and to do our work. There is no significance in the motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> There has never been any significance in such motions in the 18 years that I have been a senator. We will withdraw the motion. It is true that the motion is in the hands of the Chair. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> will seek leave to withdraw the motion and the Senate will get on with its business. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> is not happy about that arrangement or if he wants more reassurances, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> can use the forms of the Senate in another way so as to enable him to say the things that he wants to say. With great respect and with a great deal of patience, we should react to what I am saying. Let us proceed now to the next business. </para>

It makes it very difficult for an honourable senator who wants to enter the discussion on some of these matters. I do not know what can be done about this, but perhaps we will have to get better seating arrangements. Perhaps the honourable senator might be permitted to speak from my place during the course of this debate.

          <para>-  Some of the provisions of this clause seem to be fairly reasonable. I think we would all agree that a person who, without lawful excuse, whether in an assembly or otherwise, discharges or uses a weapon or throws a missile should be guilty of an offence. There are a number of such provisions in this clause. Sub-clause (1.) states, in part: </para>

        <para class="block">Perhaps the Minister will give some thought to this while I continue to discuss this clause. Paragraph (d) refers to a person who deposits or deals with an object in a manner likely to cause injury to persons. I think it is certain that an element of intent would be involved there and that wilfully' would necessarily be involved. Otherwise this would be a very dangerous provision. Probably the word 'wilfully' ought to be inserted for greater precaution. The Minister may answer that it is intended to be there and impliedly it is there, but it is a bit dangerous in the context of this Bill not to include the word in the clause. I think everyone would concede that this would not be a good law if a person who innocently did something was to be guilty of an offence of this nature. I suggest that the commonsense thing would be to carry through what was thought to be proper in the other clause and insert the word 'wilfully'. </para>
        <para>Someone has asked about the words 'repulsive object'. There have been suggestions that this could be something which was repulsive in the sense of being annoying. Perhaps this was mentioned half jokingly, but I should appreciate the Minister's saying something to clarify the matter. I suppose that in this sense 'repulsive' is to be given its technical meaning and a repulsive object would be something in the nature of, say, tear gas. Is that what is intended? </para>

            <para>- Yes, but the Minister's earlier comment rather disturbs me. If the word can be taken to mean something like a dead cat, something that would tend to be annoying, we could be getting into an area of great danger. Where do we draw the line? It could be even a drawing of some kind. This is quite disturbing if it goes further than the kind of things that I had in mind - tear gas or a repulsive kind of thing like that. Any kind of chemical substance which would be covered by the other 2 expressions, destructive and noxious, could probably regarded as repulsive. I was under the impression that the term meant something of that kind, rather than what the Minister has suggested. I should be grateful if the Minister would give some assistance by telling the Committee how this word has been construed in other legislation. Otherwise what has been said might affect our approach to the matter. If it is of the nature that I indicated the provision would be sensible and a wise provision to have, but if it extends into the area suggested by the Minister- </para>

            <para>- If that is so it gives the clause a quite different character from what I had in mind as I approached the matter. I thought that many of the expressions in the clause were rather sensible and that much of the provision was wise, but if it is intended to deal with substances which, in their physical nature, are not repulsive but rather are things to which somebody takes objection, it is a different matter altogether. In this case it would be a clause capable of being construed as referring to an obscenity or indecency, or something else of an offensive nature. That is quite different. Frankly, my approach to it would be to think that that was not meant, but what the Minister has said disturbed me and I would like some explanation. </para>

          <para>- I sensed when agreeing yesterday to the insertion of the word 'wilfully' in clause 6 that it had such a correspondence to a similar provision in clause 7 that the case which was put for having comparable language with regard to comparable offences was quite fair. But when one comes to examine this clause, I do not think the same case for the insertion of the word 'wilfully' exists. I think I said yesterday that over the years the word 'wilfully' has come to mean doing an act and that there is very little of the common colloquial rendering of the word 'wilfully' in the way in which it has been interpreted by the courts. When one talks colloquially about a person doing a wilful act or acting wilfully one implies a degree of exaggerated determination. One implies that a person quite deliberately and, in a sense, with some malice in his determination does an act. I think it is quite clear that that is not the way in which the word is interpreted in the courts these days. It really adds nothing to the provision. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>It might be asked: 'What is the reason for not putting it in if it adds nothing to the provision?' It appears to me that one might equally ask why, if it is not in, it should be put in, particularly when it might be found - looking especially at clause 10 (1.) (d), which provides that a person who throws, releases, deposits or deals with an object or substance in a manner likely to cause injury to persons or damage to property - that it might have as an intention that a person must deliberately do an act before he is guilty of an offence, whereas I should have thought that the purpose of this provision would have been that, if a person goes into an assembly with one of these objects and, for example, is just throwing it around indiscriminately and carelessly, he ought to be equally subject to an offence in those circumstances. </para>
        <para>The second point which was raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> related to the meaning of the word 'repulsive', lt is a. question for the courts to determine - if the matter comes before them - as to what is or is not a repulsive object. I think the point can be well sustained here that the word 'offensive' has been deliberately not chosen. The word 'offensive' might have given rise to the fear that, if persons carried things which some people objected to them carrying but which on reasonable standards were not capable - or should not be regarded as being capable - of being objected to, this action might be regarded as offensive. The word 'offensive' therefore has been avoided. I should have thought that the word 'repulsive' probably would cover the tear gas element to which </para>
        <para class="block">
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline>referred. I should have thought that it would also cover those things which people regard with such a degree of abhorrence that in normal language one would call them repulsive. I notice that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> referred to tear gas or some like thing. It would be very difficult for him readily to pick on something which would come within that category, just as it would be difficult for me to give the complete range. But we do know that there is a tendency, which seems to have been derived in the United States of America, for people to go into these demonstrations carrying obviously repulsive objects, such as a dead animal. </para>
        <para>One might ask why a person who is part of an assembly should be allowed to carry a dead animal and why a person should be allowed to throw, release or deposit a destructive, noxious or repulsive object or substance. We know that people carry sacks or bags of blood - whether it be human blood or animal blood - and that they carry bags or collections of human excreta. These things are, in the eyes of some people, legitimate things for use in dissent and demonstration. I should have thought that the matters which I have mentioned would fall within the category of repulsive objects. I think anybody who takes part in one of these demonstrations ought to be aware that if he takes with him something which can be on a reasonable basis classified as a repulsive object he does so at his own peril. I think that the law should indicate that a person should not carry a repulsive object in one of these assemblies. 1 do not think that the law should permit him to use it as he pleases. </para>
        <para>I sense that the courts will always have the ability to determine whether, in particular circumstances, conduct is offensive. We know that in this day and age the interpretation which the courts give to the word 'offensive' is a far more liberal and broadminded interpretation than was given a few years ago. A few years ago it was an offensive act, in the sense that the word is used, for a person to clamber over King George's statue in the front of Parliament House, but only within the last 3 or 4 years, in a decision which went on appeal, a judge said that we must have regard to the changing standards of the times and that, whilst it might offend some people's susceptibility, overall it is not within the meaning of the word 'offensive' as it concerns us. </para>

            <para>- It was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Kerr. The point is that the courts will apply similar canons of interpretation to the word 'repulsive'. I think that, because we all have a sense of what is involved in the word 'repulsive', one can in that sense believe that the tribunals which may have to pass judgment upon these words would be able to give as good an interpretation as anybody else. The difficulties that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> and I have in determining precisely what it means would be difficulties that would apply to any other word which we could use. Accordingly, I believe that when we have that difficulty it is a fair thing to leave it to the courts to determine. </para>

            <para>- No. I think it is fair to say that one's perusal of the language of the various provisions in the States does not indicate that this word has been used. For example, the New South Wales provision is that a person shall not throw or discharge any stone or any other missile in or into a public place or school; that he shall not make or light any fire or let off any firework in a public place; and that he shall not discharge a firearm or air gun in or near a street or public place. Those provisions come from either the Summary Offences Act or the Police Offences Act. The Victorian provision refers to the carrying of an offensive weapon or instrument without having first obtained the permission of the local authority; being found armed with an offensive weapon or setting off fireworks in a public place; or throwing or discharging a stone, arrow or other missile to the injury or danger of any person or damage to property. South Australia has a provision making it an offence to discharge any firearm or throw any stone or other missile, without reasonable cause, so as to injure, annoy or frighten or be likely to injure, annoy or frighten any person, or so as to damage or be likely to damage any property. Western Australia has a similar provision. One might say in those circumstances that those provisions are much wider because so many things could be apprehended within them whereas the provision which is contained in Clause 10 is a provision which endeavours, as far as possible, to specify what is involved. I should have thought that the words 'destructive, noxious or repulsive objects or substances' would be as specific as one could get. Those words have a ready meaning, differing according to one's point of view but upon which a court could easily pass judgment at the appropriate time. </para>

        <para class="block">Having listened to the explanation of the Minister on this matter I indicate that the Opposition, while it is not altogether happy about the use of the word 'repulsive', would be content to let the clause go through. However, the Opposition thinks that the word 'wilfully' ought to go in. It went in before. There is a double reason now for having it in because the lawyers are going to say that it was deliberately left out here. I admit that a strong argument could be put for saying that there could be circumstances where the element of wilfulness would not be involved. A person may put something on the ground - certainly that would be without lawful excuse - that is likely to cause injury to other persons. Where an action was likely to cause injury to a person, even though that action was innocent in the sense of not intending to do any harm, the person might be guilty of an offence. The Minister says that he does not think that the insertion of that word makes any difference to the clause; we think it does. Since his mind is the same as ours that it would be a proper provision if 'wilfully' were inserted, I suggest to him with respect that it should be inserted. As far as we are concerned, if it is inserted, the clause can then pass. </para>

          <para>- I think I have indicated my attitude, which I reiterate. The earlier provision was concerned with an indictable offence - an offence in which a person wilfully and without lawful excuse caused actual bodily harm to another person or damage to property to an extent exceeding $200. It was thought that as there was a similar provision where a person in an assembly does an act or thing by way of physical violence or damage to property he is guilty of an offence - the penalty in that case was either <inline font-style="italic">$1,000 or 12</inline> months gaol - there was a reasonable case to put in the word wilfully' because it had applied in the earlier case. I do not see the same comparisons applying in this case. I indicate particularly that when it is an offence which involves throwing, releasing, depositing or dealing with an object it appears that the word 'wilfully' might be thought to involve some element which is not intended to be conveyed in that clause. </para>

It used to be said in the old books that the sign that people put up stating that trespassers would be prosecuted, was a living lie, that that was not the law of the land at all. That used to be said of England as well as here. Certain exceptions were introduced of which we are aware. We know that the squatters in Australia had so much power that they had laws introduced covering trespass. In New South Wales, anyway, the Act was entitled the Trespass to Enclosed Lands Act. </para>

            <para>- That is right. The purpose of this was to stop people stealing sheep and, as I say, the passing of this Act was a tribute to the power of the squatters which has not altogether disappeared. This has not been an offence - again I would ask for enlightenment by the Minister - because it has been construed to be complete even without intent on the part of the person. If one wanders on to somebody's property one is trespassing even though one might not be aware of doing it. The Minister might be able to assist me and to correct me if I am wrong on that point, but my recollection of the matters is that an unintentional trespass, shall we say, is still a trespass. Of course, it would be without reasonable excuse. Why, if we have gone through so many trials and tribulations and very serious occasions in the history of the Anglo-Saxon people to obtain justice, should we make this an offence even where it has nothing to do with country properties? Why should we start to extend this right throughout the territory? We know that the Trespass to Enclosed Lands Act has been applied in the city although there was legal disputation about whether it was capable of being applied in the cities if it was intended really to deal with country areas and the problems there. We know that it has been applied not always with success, as the former Attorney-General found when he discovered that his fine home was not really on enclosed land, he having a large and unrated driveway. </para>

            <para>- 'Premises' as definedmeansanyland,buildingorpart of a building. This, may I suggest with respect to the Senate, is an extremely important part of this measure. It is a clause which deserves to be a Bill on its own because it is not directed to dealing with public order in certain territories of the Commonwealth; it is a simple proposition of trespass not by an assembly, not by a group of people, not in the course of a demonstration and not in relation to public buildings or protected persons. We are talking about a simple trespass even by one person unassociated with any kind of violence or property damage. This is a provision directed towards dealing with simple trespass, and it is made an offence. The territories referred to include not only the Australian Capital Territory but also the Northern Territory. What is to be the position of those Aboriginals who are on the land which was their land but is now Vestey's land? What is to happen to them? Are they to be subject to the provisions of this Bill or can the Minister give us an assurance that the provisions of clause 11 (1.) could not be applied so that some Aboriginal on the land which has been taken from him will not only be subject to eviction by the civil courts but can be taken in and repeatedly prosecuted; hailed before a magistrate? </para>

            <para>- The answer to it is simple. I can assure the honourable senator that the Aboriginals were never having their meals where my dining room is located because it is situated on the 16th Floor of a building some 160 feet above the ground which is well above I think, where the Aboriginals would eat. Not only may this provision be applied to the Aboriginals, it is also applicable in this Territory. What is the situation of people - the Minister may assist me on this - who are served with a notice to quit which is in order? If it is an effective notice and their tenancy is terminated are they then to be committing an offence if they stay on the premises? Can the Minister assure us that this is incapable of being applied to persons who stay on in premises after a notice to quit has been given so that they are no longer entitled to be there and have been told so? </para>

        <para>I see this as a very serious matter on which we ought to get the greatest degree of enlightenment from the Minister. 1 ask him to indicate to us the ways in which this can be used and to give us an assurance, if he can, that it is incapable of being used against Aboriginals in the circumstances I have suggested. I would also like to know in what ways this clause might be used against the ordinary citizen in the territories. Will he tell us the necessity for it in the light of all the provisions which exist in regard to assemblies and offensive conduct. The law is cluttered up. There is a morass of legislation to prevent persons indulging in physical violence or damage to property. The Senate has passed a clause relating to the dispersal of assemblies - of which we did not approve - but one would think that the Government had ample provisions in the law to deal with public order. What is the purpose of this provision which is not associated with any suggestion of disorder? There is nothing here about its being related to protection of persons to prevent damage. This is dealing with simple trespass. How does that happen to get into this Bill? What is the purpose of it and what are the limits on which it might be applied? </para>

          <para>- Clause 11 (1.) creates the offence, in essence, of being on premises without reasonable excuse. A trespasser is a person who goes upon land which does not belong to him, without any claim of right to do so, without any invitation, express or implied. Quite frequently we see signs bearing the words reading Trespassers will be prosecuted'. We know that they are merely an added warning to people that if they go onto that land they are liable to be taken before the courts. We accept, I think, as one of the rights which attends the privacy of the occupation of our own homes, that people cannot come into our homes unless we invite them in. As far as the territories of the Commonwealth are concerned, to which this Bill applies, it states quite explicitly that a person who trespasses upon another person's premises shall be guilty of an offence punishable by a fine not exceeding $100 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding one month, or both. There are similar offences to this to be found in the laws of the Australian Capital Territory and South Australia. The penalty for the offence currently in the Australian Capital Territory is $20 or 3 months imprisonment. The penalty for the offence in South Australia is 6 months imprisonment. </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline>raised a question about the position of aboriginals who trespass on other people's land. I do not believe there should be any exceptions made for any people in this community. If they break the law they will be dealt with as all people in Australia are dealt with, on a basis of equality, because there are no special groups of people who have special provisions or privileges under the law. I do not believe that the Senate would want the position to be otherwise. I think it should be borne in mind that when there are exceptional circumstances of the character raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy,</inline> such as in relation to Aboriginals in the Northern Territory who believe they have rights from time immemorial to land which is in the occupation of someone else, they may go upon that land and say that they have a right to stay there. In essence they have not a right to stay there in terms of the judgment recently handed down and which currently is the law which applies. But if they do go onto that land, it is always a question for the tribunal which has to determine whether or not they are guilty of an offence, whether in fact they have offended. </para>
        <para>I draw the honourable senator's attention to the expression 'without reasonable excuse'. A person who without reasonable excuse trespasses on premises in a Territory is guilty of an offence, but not a person who can claim a reasonable excuse. I cannot determine what a court in the Northern Territory might do but at least it leaves open to the court which tries the issue whether or not the excuse or justification put up by the person who would otherwise be a trespasser is a good and valid excuse. I would have thought that one could address an argument of the character of that which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> was addressing to this Committee quite suitably to a court on behalf of Aboriginals. I believe that the significant thing to notice is that the expression of exemption is not 'without lawful excuse' but 'without reasonable excuse' and it has been designedly so drawn to enable people who feel that they have some right and can justify it in some way which has to it a reasonableness, to be able to do so. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> also inquired about the history of some of these provisions and said what has been said in other places - something which I think is quite wrong in the Australian context - that trespass never has been a criminal offence. </para>

            <para>- I think there is a fairly general pattern in Australia, although probably the honourable senator could justify his position more readily in the United Kingdom. But certainly in Australia it has been a criminal offence for a long time. I do not want to suggest that trespass has not been a criminal offence in Great Britain but there are statutory provisions in Australia which have been the vogue for quite some time. There are 2 classes of offences relating to trespass in Australia. There is the offence which, in the case of the South Australian Police Act, goes back to 1870, of 'being on land or premises without lawful excuse'. There is also the offence to be found in the Victorian Police Offences Act, at least as far back as 1915, of 'refusing to leave premises upon being requested to do so by the owner or occupier'. </para>

            <para>- It is a question of what constitutes the trespass. Until the end of last year Victoria was the only State to have a provision of the character I have just mentioned - refusing to leave premises upon being requested to do. so by the owner or occupier. New South Wales now has a similar offence. In Victoria for a long time the provision had simply been that it was an offence not to leave the place after being warned to do so by the owner or a person authorised by or on behalf of the owner. Problems arose, of course, because the person in occupation may not have been the owner and as trespassers really are wrong to a person's possession the amendment was made to entitle the occupier as well as the owner to require a person to leave and to make it an offence if a person after being so warned did not leave. That provision has been found useful in Victoria in dealing with sit-in demonstrations. Of course the position in New South Wales now is that there is a provision comparable with the Victorian provision. Section 50 of the New South Wales Summary Offences Act 1970 provides that a person who enters or remains in or upon any part of a building or structure or any land occupied or used in connection therewith and has no reasonable cause for doing so is guilty of an offence. Subsection (3.) of the same section provides that without limiting the generality of the expression 'reasonable cause' it is not a reasonable cause for a person to remain in a public building if the person is requested to leave. </para>

            <para>- I think it is fair for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> to be concerned about these aspects because it is in a debate like this that the points which occur to particular senators can be aired for consideration. I cannot answer the question specifically because it does depend on matters to which I have referred. But I think the intention of the draftsman, as conveyed to me, is that for these areas the use of the expression 'without reasonable excuse' as distinct from what you might normally find - the expression 'without lawful excuse' - is meant to be a covering which does give protection. I believe it would give substantial protection. I would have thought that if a tenant had overstayed a notice to quit he would be in a position, if he did not have other accommodation, to address an argument to the court, if he ever were taken before a court, that that was a reasonable excuse. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> would not be prepared to say offhand that that could never be a reasonable excuse. It is in that context that I feel that when the matter is left to the courts to determine they have the ability to say in accordance with standards they have always applied what is or is not a reasonable excuse. </para>

        <para>Of course there are other provisions in relation to trespass of a different type from that which is contained in the Victorian law. Unless <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> desires me to give him details of the position in each State I shall not deal with them. The situation is covered by that type of provision which was contained in the South Australian Police Act 1869-70. The justification for this clause is that the public interest requires that lawful occupants of land and premises should be protected from intrusions upon their peaceful occupation. There is reason to believe that the sanction of the civil law is inadequate to control sit in demonstrations and that some moderate criminal sanction is justified. I think it is wrong to think of a modern phenomenon in terms of situations of many years ago. As this clause demonstrates, the important thing is to be able to protect persons in the peaceable occupation of their premises. </para>

            <para>- What is worrying us about this clause is that it does not apply to an assembly of a number of people, lt does not apply to any of the public order situations with which these other clauses deal. This is a simple trespass. It could be by a single person with no element of demonstration, procession or anything like that. That is what is really troubling about this. I can see that the Minister is giving this situation some consideration. Is it not worth thinking about? This is quite a serious step to take. </para>

            <para>- It is a serious step and, as I said, it is not without precedent in other parts of Australia. I think it is a serious consequence for the individual in his premises to be subjected to the invasion of his occupation by anybody. It is true that this provision applies only to Commonwealth Territories because it represents the ability of the Commonwealth law to apply in that area. It does not apply to Commonwealth premises. People in Commonwealth Territories - the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory - have an assurance that there will be a criminal sanction against anybody who breaks into their property or disturbs their property in the form of trespass. If there is a breaking and entering in the traditional criminal sense that is dealt with under the general provisions of the criminal law. But it seems to me whether it be as a result of a demonstration, whether it be in pursuit of some real or alleged political purpose or whether it be a person who is just plain disrespectful and unconcerned about the rights of others and who trespasses on a person's property, this action constitutes a penal offence. It is not a substantial offence. The maximum fine is $100 or an imprisonment for a term not exceeding one month. In the general range of penalties which are prescribed these days that is not a heavy penalty. In conclusion I refer to what the Leader of the Opposition in another place <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> said earlier this year. I think this indicates in the language he used the type of objective which this provision has in mind. He said: </para>

Bowen)</inline> in answering <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> and in travers ing the various statutory provisions dealing with trespass throughout the country should have missed a provision which is here in his own backyard. I refer to the Police Offences Ordinance of the Australian Capital Territory. Section 24b states: </para>

          <para>Any person who is found without lawful excuse (proof of which excuse shall be upon that person) in any building, structure or erection, upon any lands, in or under a vehicle or boat or in any enclosed yard, garden or area, shall be guilty of an offence. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">The penalty for that offence is $20 or imprisonment for 3 months. One of the principal counts in the Opposition's indictment of this Bill has been that it is unnecessary. Surely it would be hard to find any clause in this Bill which is more unnecessary than clause 1 1 (1.) in the light of the existence of this quite wide power - as far as the Australian Capital Territory is concerned - which is contained in section 24b of the Police Offences Ordinance. The only material difference between clause 11 (1.) and the Ordinance which I have cited is that in the clause we are considering the words 'without reasonable excuse' but in the Ordinance the words 'without lawful excuse' appear. With all respect to the Minister, it is hard to see how the existence of the trespass provision in section 24b of the Police Offences Ordinance does not provide sufficient cover for the acts which presumably this present Bill was designed to deal with. I can anticipate that I will meet with this objection: 'Well, why do you object to a clause which is more moderate and which provides a smaller penalty than the one in section 24b?' I do not suppose we need to worry about that very much but the fact remains that section 24b of the Police Offences Ordinance will be available even when (his Bill becomes law. </para>
        <para>One of the objections which occur to us is the multiplicity of legal sanctions which are introduced into the law when one has this provision alongside section 24b of the Police Offences Ordinance. For example, who will decide in the case of some youths who have been arrested after a demonstration whether they are to be charged on the basis of clause 11 of the Public Order (Protection of Persons and Property) Bill or section 24b of the Police Offences Ordinance? One could imagine that if some student leader were involved about whom some strong feelings were held by the authorities, it might be felt desirable to give him a sterner lesson than some lesser fry. Resort might be had to section 24b of the Police Offences Ordinance which would enable this offender to be thrown into gaol for 3 months whereas under clause 11 of the present Bill he would be liable to a penalty not exceeding 1 month's imprisonment. But why do we need both provisions? Why is it necessary to introduce this clause when we already have the section to which I have referred? Perhaps the Minister might be able to throw some light on this question. As I said, I was rather surprised that he did not mention the Police Offences Ordinance after going through the statutes of Australia. I hesitate to think that he did not know of its existence but I would like him to enlighten us, in the light of the existence of this Ordinance, why he needs this clause in the present Bill. </para>

          <para>-  I would like to add to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland has mentioned. When the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Greenwood),</inline> who in this chamber represents the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr N. H. Bowen),</inline> is replying will he consider the law as I think it operates in the Australian Capital Territory? In clause 11 is he not replacing one law with another? 1 thought the law in Canberra operated by regulations which were issued under the Seat of Government (Administration) Act. ls there not an early judgment of the High Court which provides that when a regulation which operates in a Territory is subsequently incorporated in an Act by Parliament then that regulation becomes null and void? If that is the true position, will this clause supersede the law which is in existence in the Australian Capital Territory under the Police Offences Ordinance? 1 would like the Minister to give some consideration to this question. We can understand the protection of premises. This Bill has expressed the meaning of 'premises'. On this occasion, 'premises' means any land, building, or part of a building, and the provision refers to a person who, without reasonable excuse, trespasses on any land. One can imagine the extent of the operation of this provision in country areas where much land is unfenced. While much of the land in many areas may be privately owned, it is accepted as land in common inasmuch as there is no fence and it is used by the community. Are we now to prosecute people who have normally used that land and who continue to use it? </para>

          <para>-  I think the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland fairly requires an answer. I do recognise - and I said this earlier in response to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> - that there was a similar offence in the laws of the Australian Capital Territory to what is proposed by this clause. In the first place, there is a lesser penalty in the sense of a reduced term of imprisonment under the proposal which is now envisaged. Secondly - and I would have thought this was a very substantial change and decidedly one of greater value - in the proposed clause there is an exception for a person who can show that he is on another person's premises with reasonable excuse, whereas under the law of the Australian Capita] Territory there is no such exempting provision and a person must show that he is there with a lawful excuse. It is far more difficult to establish a lawful excuse than it is to establish a reasonable excuse. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The point is that the Bill we are considering is a comprehensive Bill related to public order, the protection of persons and property. It would be unreasonable to have a Bill that is as comprehensive as this one which does not have a provision of the character contained in clause 11 (1.). It would stand out as a glaring exception. When we consider the balance of the subclauses of clause 11, we find that it is really a comprehensive clause. Sub-clause (2.), for example, creates further offences occurring on premises in a Territory. Paragraph (a) creates an offence of unreasonable obstruction in relation to the passage of persons or vehicles into, out of, or on premises in a Territory. I think it would be unreasonable not to have some penalty for a person who adopts the relatively recent concept, which I understand is part of Indian industrial tactics called gherao, of encircling premises or a property so that access to or egress from those premises is completely denied. I would have thought that a person who engages in that form of unreasonable obstruction in relation to the passage of persons or vehicles into, out of, or on premises should do so recognising that there is a criminal sanction if he engages in that activity. Paragraph (b) of clause 1 1 (2.) creates an offence of disorderly behaviour while trespassing on premises in a Territory, and paragraph (c) creates an offence of refusing to leave premises on being requested to do so. Again, there is the exception for a person who can show that he has a reasonable excuse. </para>

            <para>-  Well, that argument is different from that raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland. He said that there was a quite adequate law existing in the Australian Capital Territory at the moment so why was it necessary to have clause 11 (1.). The argument now being put to me by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy,</inline> as I understand it, is that what is contained in the other parts of clause 11 does not necessitate clause 11 (1.). I think it does. I think there ought to be an a b into offence that if a person trespasses on property it is an offence which invites a criminal sanction, and unless a person has a reasonable excuse for being on someone else's land I think it ought to be envisaged as something inviting penalty. That is part of the mores of our time. If people felt that there ought to be a general freedom to move in and out of people's property without let or hindrance, I dare say we would not have laws like this. But I believe that the people of Australia believe they ought to have privacy in the area which is their own, and I fail to see why the people of the Australian Capital Territory should not have the same right attaching to them. </para>

If he feels that he has a reasonable excuse for going on to it, he can plead that reasonable excuse. I think the general proposition is one that is unimpeachable - that a person's property is as much his own in Australia as an Englishman's home has reputedly over the years been regarded as his castle. I do not believe that a person, particularly in these times when people are prone to regard that which belongs to others as theirs and when demonstrators will move through into another person's property, ought not to be subject to some criminal penalty. </para>

          <para>- Apart from satisfactorily answering <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland, there is one thing that the Minister did not do and that was to answer my question about intent. Does the word 'trespass' in this Bill import the notion of intentionally going on someone else's property, or is it possible to commit this offence without intent? Leaving aside the question of what might come under reasonable excuse', does 'trespass' carry with it the element of intent? My recollection was - and I said I was subject to correction by the Minister - that in the civil law the trespass may be committed without intention, and that a person was liable for at least nominal damages if he went on the premises of another person and there was no element of intent involved in the civil aspect of the matter. I ask the Minister's guidance as to whether this involves an element of intent. </para>

          <para>- One is going deeply into some of the intricacies of the law in the type of question and answer we are now engaging in. However, as I understand the position, the offence of trespassing does not involve as one of its preconditions that there be a specific intent. In short, it does not involve an intent, as I understand the law. As I understand the position, if I were to find myself on another person's land I would be guilty of a technical trespass. It would not matter that I had not intended to go on the land, and my statement of that would not amount to an exculpation. On the other hand, if I were on another person's land and held a belief in a state of facts on reasonable grounds, the state of facts proving to be true, that would always be a defence in common law. In short, it is as if you have a genuine belief that you are entitled to be there and you hold that genuine belief on reasonable grounds. In that case you are not guilty of an offence. I say that on the basis that it is a common legal principle that that is the position. Nevertheless, whatever may be the strict legal position, if a person accused of trespassing on another person's land is able to say that he has a reasonable excuse, that is a complete answer to any allegation. It is not an onerous provision.It simply asserts that a person's property is his own and he is not to be disturbed there. If any person trespasses on that property without reasonable excuse, it is an offence. </para>

          <para>-  The Minister has failed to answer a question I asked him previously. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland raised the point that an ordinance of the Australian Capital Territory makes trespassing an offence. I submit that the ordinance has its validity under the Seat of Government (Administration) Act. If the Minister obtains a copy of that Act he will find listed a reference to a High Court case. It was decided that where a regulation or ordinance is superseded by a law of the Parliament, or both are operating, the regulation or ordinance no longer has effect. Therefore the law of the Parliament takes effect. If that is a correct interpretation of the position, not only are we dealing with a question of trespassing in relation to a demonstration but we are also completely replacing a law that exists in the A.C.T. A different penalty is imposed. I do not know whether it is lesser or greater. I do not think anyone has considered the fact that this goes far beyond dealing with assemblies. </para>

            <para>- Two laws dealing with very much the same subject. That is true. I assure the honourable senator that this matter will be looked at with a view to repealing the provision in the ACT ordinance. There is a difference. I would have thought that the existing law is more onerous in its impact, and that there is more opportunity for exculpation in the clause contained in the Bill. However, at present there are <inline font-style="italic">2</inline> laws. I do not believe that that would mean that a person could be tried for one offence under 2 separate laws. There is a long-standing provision that a man cannot be placed, as it were, in double jeopardy. I assure the honourable senator that this will be looked at with a view to considering whether the ordinance should be repealed. </para>

          <para>- Having heard the explanation of the Minister I think the Committee should examine this clause carefully. We of the Opposition are in a minority and I respectfully ask that those honourable senators who are not of our Party have a careful look at the clause in the light of all that has been said. This clause is different from the other clauses. It is not concerned with assemblies, processions, protests or anything of that kind. Sub-clause 1 deals simply with trespass. The Minister has agreed that this is not like most of the other offences against the law. The golden thread that runs through the law does not have the element of intent in it. In this clause the word 'wilfully' has not been included. It may be an innocent trespass. Unless reasonable excuse is shown it will be an offence. It even covers an innocent trespass by one person. </para>

        <para class="block">I think it is slightly different because the words in that provision as the honourable senator read it deal with a person who is found on premises, perhaps under a boat, in a house, on land, or in a building or erection, as I recall it. In that context the provision would properly be applicable to deal with a person who is on land but has no business to be there. He may be intending to commit an offence. It is a person who is found, and that is an important part of it, in such areas. In this instance there is no such element. </para>

He cannot assure us that the provision in clause 11 (1.) will not be used even in the case of a tenant who has had notice to quit served on him, and the notice to quit has expired. Is he then a trespasser under this provision? Is he committing an offence so that it can be held not merely that he has trespassed but that he has become a criminal, and in a Territory where the landlord is the Commonwealth? </para>

            <para>- I do not think it is enough to say that it will be left to a tribunal to decide that in some cases there might be a reasonable excuse. Why should we deal with this kind of question with a Bill that was brought in to deal with public disorder, commotions, riots, tumults and that kind of thing? Why has this been slipped into clause  1 1  (I.)? I suggest, with respect, that honourable senators who are not members of our Party should have a look at Clause  11 (1.).  It is of a different character to the rest of the Bill. The Minister has been unable to give an answer whether the law will break down if clause  11 (1.)  is taken out of the Bill. He cannot answer the propositions I have put about tenants. I accept that honourable senators who are not members of our Party have said that they will support the Bill. I suggest, with great respect, that once it is passed they will not be able to stop the implementation of any of its clauses. I suggest that they have a good look at the Bill to see whether they should be agreeing to clause  11 (1.)  being included in a Bill with which it is really not concerned. The clause deals with matters which may be far removed from what was envisaged and heralded as the purposes of the Bill. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>Several courses are open to the Government. It could agree to the deletion of clause  11 (1.).  It could add a qualification to this clause to the effect that the clause is not to be used except in relation to matters referred to in other parts of the Bill in relation to assemblies. If that is included my objection is met. The inclusion of the words 'without reasonable excuse in the course of an assembly' - which refer to trespass - would meet my objection. Probably that would be the best course open to the Government. It could include some words which say that the Bill has nothing to do with tenants who remain on premises. I think it would be more in conformity with the area which this Bill is intended to cover if a clause stating that this clause was concerned with an assembly, a matter of public order or trespass by numbers of persons or something of this kind, were inserted. That would take it right out of the category of which I am speaking and which I suggested was not covered by the intentions of the Bill. The clause goes far beyond those intentions. I think it is unsafe and dangerous. I suggest that those who may have agreed to support the Bill in principle should consider the deletion of clause 11 (1.)- Unless some satisfactory reason is given why these other clauses cannot cope with any public disorder, it is not a fair proposition to say that, because of the lack of answers from the Minister, it is too dangerous to leave that in the Bill? We will not finish our deliberations of this Bill immediately. Therefore I move: </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator RAE</inline>(Tasmania)5.9) - As both the Leader of the Opposition and the Minister know, it was my intention, when we came to sub-clause (3.). to move a motion to amend that sub-clause. I had proposed to seek that the consideration of that be deferred until after the consideration of clause 23 because the amendment is of a consequential nature. The real discussion will be on clause 23 and not on clause 11. Therefore I do not wish the deferment of clause 11 to inhibit in any way the moving of my motion. Unless I have misunderstood the Standing Orders. I think it could. </para>

          <para>--Clause 11 is designed to cope with sit-ins. That is the purpose of the clause. It is proper that the clause should have a comprehensive provision as to trespass. I think there is a lot of paradox in what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> said. It is true that an existing provision in the Australian Capital Territory Ordinance makes it an offence for a person to trespass on another person's property without lawful excuse. Clause 11 deals more comprehensively with the law in relation to trespass. It says that it shall be an offence for a person to trespass on another person's property without reasonable excuse. There is no quibble that what is involved in this clause is a more reasonable proposition. The proposition is not as severe as the present provision. I have said that consideration will be given as to whether the existing provision contained in the Ordinance should be repealed. It does seem strange, in the light of the argument which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> raised to justify his proposition, that he should be arguing for the retention of a severe proposition in preference to one which mitigates. </para>

            <para>- I cannot say whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> is right or wrong. From reading the clause in the Australian Capital Territory Ordinance, my impression is that he is wrong. If his interpretation is correct, and if it has that limited meaning, that is an added reason why a more comprehensive provision should be enacted. 1 understood that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy's</inline> main plea in his final comments related to the position of the person who, having been a tenant, is given notice to quit and who remains on the premises after the notice to quit has expired. I would have thought that that person, under the new clause, if he is a trespasser, would be able to raise the argument that he had a reasonable excuse for remaining there because he had nowhere else to go. Under the existing provision in the Ordinance, he must have a lawful excuse for being on the premises. No matter how much one might say that the law should be humane, having nowhere to go has never been a lawful excuse. </para>

            <para>- We lost. In platinum (a) of sub-clause (1.) we find an additional offence against clauses 18 or 20 of the Bill. There is some problem about that because the clause provides that the assembly can be dispersed if the police sergeant, or police officer of higher rank, has a reasonable apprehension that the assembly will be carried on in a manner involving an offence against clauses 18 or 20. Those clauses not only cover assaults, obstructions and so forth, but extend also to insulting behaviour. The limits on these provisions are so elastic that it is a very dangerous proposition. An assembly can be dispersed and the persons subjected to arrests and indeed to thuggery, as we mentioned before, by other persons there who may wish to deal with the assembly, because there ls a reasonable apprehension by the police sergeant that it might involve someone insulting a protected person. That seems to us to be going a very long way. It is not required that the assembly should assault the protected person; it is enough that the police sergeant thinks it might insult a protected person. </para>

            <para>- Not only especially but also most effectively. I thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> for prompting me. One sees from sub-clause (4.) that although a direction has not been given, persons can interrupt an assembly and use physical, violence - the thugs can come along - if they say that the assembly is being carried on in a manner involving such unlawful violence or damage, or such offences. These are offences against clauses 18 or 20. Because it is not always easy to interpret these things and because the Minister has his advisers present, I ask him whether we interpret this by starting with sub-clause (1.) and saying that under platinum (b) the assembly is being carried on in a manner involving such unlawful violence or damage, or such offences, and then we turn over to clause 18 to find that such offences include behaving in an insulting manner. Is that right? </para>

            <para>- When we come down to sub-clause (4.) of clause 17 we find that for the purpose of dispersing an assembly or suppressing an assembly - this is the assembly referred to earlier as being carried on in a manner involving merely an insult to some protected person - it becomes lawful, whether or not a direction has been given under this provision, for any person to use force to disperse that assembly.

            <para>-  I thought I had clarified this already. The words 'or such offences' in that platinum surely must relate back to offences against clauses 18 or 20. I should like the Minister to state whether that is right. One would think that there could be no other construction. If this interpretation is right it means that an assembly at which there is no violence, no damage to property but merely the carrying of placards saying that the persons concerned are against whoever the protected person is - perhaps telling the protected person or some consul to go home - would come within the provision. The assembly may be perfectly peaceful and all that those involved want to do is to carry these placards - not to do any violence or damage. In that event it would be lawful for a thug or any person - not necessarily a police constable, or even a person acting at the request of a police constable - to use such force as he believes on reasonable grounds to be necessary for the purpose of dispersing the assembly, and is reasonably proportioned to the danger which he believes, on reasonable grounds, is to be apprehended from the continuance of the assembly. </para>

Is this not an open invitation for these people to move in? The only hope open to persons in the assembly would be that somebody was able to say that the thugs should not have apprehended the danger from the continuance of the assembly. After the thugs have whale in and started to push people, to disperse them and prevent them from doing things, there will be civil commotion and riots - the very things that we should not have. Could clause 4 be invoked in the case of persons in an assembly who, in the absence of violence, are merely carrying a placard or something which can be construed to be insulting, and violence is used against the assembly? </para>

          <para>-  I am fully aligned to the points ' that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> has raised. I think that he is possibly stressing unnecessarily the rights of a person to come in and assist in the dispersal of an assembly because the ability of that person to move in is conditioned, by what he can do. He can only take such action as is reasonably proportioned to the danger which he believes is to be apprehended from the continuance of the assembly. I should think that the only thing which would happen in the example which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> has given is that a few insults would be cast upon a diplomat, which is very much to be deplored from an international viewpoint, but is unlikely to give rise to danger. I intend to move that the consideration of this clause be postponed until after consideration of the other clauses which have been- postponed in order to enable me to give consideration to the points which have been raised. . </para>

          <para>-  I should like briefly to speak on this clause before further consideration of it is adjourned. I am still somewhat vague about it. Perhaps the Minister could clarify for me what happened during the drafting of this clause. Sub-section (1.) (b) refers to the assembly being carried on in a manner involving unlawful violence or damage. It goes on to refer to 'or such offences'. Could the Minister inform me whether the expression 'or such offences' applies to the unlawful violence or damage or whether it refers to the offences specified in sub-section (1.) (a). This provision seems to me to be an ambiguous piece of drafting. </para>

          <para>-  If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon</inline> looks back at clause 8 I think he will find the answer to his question. Clause 8 refers only to unlawful damage or violence. There is no reference in it to 'or such offences'. The reference in clause 17 to offences against sections 18 or 20 of the principal Act includes, at the end of sub-clause (1.) (b), 'or such offences', which I think makes it crystal clear that such offences were the offences against sections 18 and 20 of the principal Act. </para>

          <para>-  Clause 18 of the Bill seems to create some problems because <inline font-style="italic">k</inline> relates back. I do not know whether at the resolution of what is endeavoured to be done the Minister will prefer to deal m some way with clause 18 or whether it oUght to be allowed to go through. Frankly, I am disturbed about clause 18 because the expression 'insulting manner in it ls se elastic that it is dangerous. The Opposition does not think that diplomats should be subjected to harassment and it certainly does not think that they should be assaulted and knocked about or inter fer red with. These people come here as officers of their own country. They have a duty to be here. They ought not to be subjected to any kind of violence or damage to their property and so forth. At the same time, as representatives of their own countries they have been - not just in modern times but, I think, at all times - the focus of objections which people want to raise against, for example, the conduct of their countries. </para>
        </talk.start></continue><para>I think it will be found in all countries that people who want to protest against the actions of a particular country will seek to do so at the official residence of that country. It is only natural that those people who want to protest against the actions of a country will go to its embassy or consulate. According to my own observations of protests these protesters generally do not do anything personal against the representatives; it is against their country. The reason why demonstrators go to these official residences is that it is the address of the country against which they wish to protest. The Opposition is concerned about the fact that the expression 'insulting manner' is an elastic and dangerous expression. </para><interjection>

            <para>- That is a difficult question. It could be used in a proper case - one that we would all agree with - and it could be used in a case with which we do not all agree. For example, it could be used to prevent the exercising of free speech. This is a difficulty with that word. The word 'offensive' has a reasonable enough meaning in law. We have been given the assistance of the judgment to which the Minister referred of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Kerr on the word 'offensive*. We know what the word 'threatening' means, but the word 'insulting' is a very elastic one. The Opposition is most unhappy about it being included in the legislation in this form. I suppose it is useless for me to ask for any kind of an assurance in regard to this provision. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue><para>May I say that by allowing such an elastic provision to be introduced into the law I think the Government will get itself into the difficulty where it will not be able to prosecute or it is going to have people putting it in a difficult position, such as the 5 women who went to Fair lea prison. I think the whole community objected to their going to prison, but it was an example of the kind of things that can be lawfully done to people. The trouble is the Government is introducing laws which it thinks will work because it says that no magistrate will be silly enough to convict people and no police officers will be foolish enough to prosecute people and no Attorney-General will be stupid enough as to allow prosecutions where there will be convictions recorded that ought not to be recorded. The Government is making laws under which people can be convicted under circumstances in which none of us would want them to be convicted. The law is going to be mitigated by the refusal of the people to be pushed around. I suppose that is the best that can be said about it. The Government has chosen a bad expression. I do not think the word 'insulting' is necessary. Surely the words 'offensive' and threatening' are enough to meet the Government's wishes. I ask the Minister to tell us what will be achieved by inclusion in this provision of the elastic word 'insulting'. Why does the Government need it in this provision? How does it go further than the words 'offensive' and 'threatening'. The provision already provides for harassing and behaving in an offensive and threatening manner. Why is it necessary to include this word 'insulting' too? </para>

          <para>- A number of things might be said in response to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> had to say. It should be recognised that this clause does introduce certain aspects that are not to be found in the present law. It makes it an offence for a person to harass a diplomatic person or unreasonably to interfere with the safe discharge of his duties. It is also an offence to threaten or to insult a protected person or unreasonably to obstruct such a person. Protected persons, of course, are defined as being the group of diplomatic officials set out in the definitions clause. The penalty for conviction of such an offence is $250 or 3 months imprisonment or both. Instances have occurred in recent years in which diplomats have been insulted and harassed. It is thought that a criminal sanction is justified for this sort of behaviour. It is necessary in order to comply with Australia's international obligations. That is generally what the clause does. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I think the main concern of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> has been directed towards the use of the expression 'insulting'. It must not be thought that 'insulting' is an expression which has not been used in many statutes in the past or that it is not to be found in a number of statutes at the present time. For example, the words 'an offensive insulting manner' appear in the Summary Offences Act of New South Wales, the Summary Offences Act of Victoria, the Vagrants, Gaming and Other Offences Act of Queensland and in the Police Offences Ordinance of the Australian Capital Territory. 'Insulting words' is an expression which is found in the Police Offences Act of Tasmania, and those words are also to be found in enactments in Victoria, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory. For example, to give just one of the sections in which it appears, section 7 of the Summary Offences Act of New South Wales makes it an offence for a person to behave in a riotous, indecent, offensive, threatening or insulting manner in or within view from a public place. Section 17 of the Summary Offences Act of Victoria makes it an offence for a person to use profane, indecent or obscene language or threatening, abusive or insulting words, or behave in a riotous, indecent, or offensive or insulting manner in a public place. </para>
        <para>I would have thought that the use of the expressions 'in an insulting manner' and insulting words' are indications that this is an offence which has long been part of our law. .1 would have thought that the general pattern these days is that those words are not often the occasion of offences which are tried in the courts, but one does come across them from time to time. It is an offence - I think we have all seen example of it - to use insulting words to a member of the police force. I think it is not unreasonable that the police should be protected from the repetition publicly made of insulting words. Such is the role that the police force plays that it should be a criminal offence to use insulting words to a policeman. That is one example of a situation in which it is reasonable to retain that offence. </para>
        <para>When dealing with diplomatic personnel we have 2 obligations. One is the strict international obligation and the other is the sense of what is fair to those people who come to Australia as the representatives of another country. The Committee will be aware of the Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities Act which was passed in 1967 whereby the provisions of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations were applied and made law in Australia. Article 29 of that Convention contains this provision: </para>
        <quote>
          <para class="block">The person of a diplomatic agent shall be inviolable. He shall not be liable to any form of arrest or detention. The receiving State shall treat him with due respect and shall take all appropriate steps to prevent any attack on his person, freedom or dignity. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">What is an appropriate step to prevent any such attack is a moot point. I would have thought that it is a reasonable thing to say, as this clause does say, that a person who behaves in an offensive, threatening or insulting manner towards a diplomat shall be guilty of an offence. I would have thought that the use of those expressions is consistent with the obligation under the international convention which we have assumed. But quite apart from what might be the strict obligation under the international convention, I think it is at least reasonable for us to say that people shall observe the proprieties in regard to international persons who come to Australia. I do not think that it is an unreasonable provision to put into this Bill that anyone who behaves in an offensive, threatening or insulting manner towards a diplomat shall be guilty of an offence. </para>
        <para>I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> should reflect upon what he has said in the light of the international obligations. Quite apart from substantial arguments I think it would be unreasonable, the expression having been used in the Bill and it being only a matter of mild judgment whether or not it should not be used, that the Opposition should now seek to have it withdrawn. I do not think it would want to, and I think the clause as it stands is, in all the circumstances, a reasonable clause. </para>

          <para>-  I am afraid I am not satisfied by what the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Greenwood)</inline> has said insofar as I can see no explanation for the inclusion of the word 'insulting' in addition to the words 'offensive' or 'threatening'. I cannot see what is added in the terms of our international obligations or our obligations to protect the -persons of the representatives of foreign powers or international agencies by using the word 'insulting' in addition to the word 'offensive'. The Minister would be well aware that what is or is not defamatory or insulting can depend upon the circumstances. There was one quite notable defamation action in Britain in which a prominent trade union official obtained damages from a newspaper which had accused him of being anti-socialist. He regarded this as insulting and defamatory, and the court held that it was insulting and defamatory in view of the position which he occupied within the British Labour Party and the trade union movement. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>It would seem to me to be a perfectly reasonable judgment that if somebody sets himself up to be something, to subscribe to a particular doctrine, and then somebody else says that he does not, that he holds another doctrine, he would regard this as being an insulting thing to say about him. I can well imagine that the persons to whom these remarks were directed would regard them as being insulting. If, for example, someone were to say that the Soviet Ambassador were a revisionist I think that he would regard this as an insulting statement to make about him. I think that the South African Ambassador may regard it as an insulting statement to make about him if it were said that he was the representative of a racist oppressive regime. He may well find that to be an insulting statement because it may well be that he does not believe that he is a racist or a supporter of an oppressive regime. It seems to me that this is one of the problems which is quite serious here and which inhibits not freedom of assembly, as has been inhibited by so many other clauses in this Bill, but freedom of speech. </para>

          <para>- The terms 'insulting behaviour' and 'insulting words' are expressions which have received some definition over the years. 'Insulting behaviour', which is fairly close to 'insulting manner', has been denned in the. High Court as meaning:  to assail with offensively dishonouring or contemptuous speech or action; to treat with scornful abuse, or offensive disrespect; to offer indignity to; to  affront;  to outrage. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">It is a very fine distinction, I suppose, between 'offensive' and 'insulting'. But offensive' does envisage, dr may envisage in certain cases, the idea of what are public standards; whereas a person can behave in an insulting manner which, is relatively private and does not bring in any sense of public offence. But as I suggested earlier, the fact that the language is there and we have an international obligation is probably as prudent a reason as one can advance for maintaining those 3 words. I regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon</inline> felt affronted. I assure him that I was listening to what he said even though I was taking in what was being sought by me from my advisers. </para>

          <para>-  We repeat our earlier remarks on a clause similar to clause 19. I should express the view that I think the community is reaching the stage where it will be considered that no 1 person should be deciding the guilt of another, which guilt may result in the person being sent to gaol. I think the view is being expressed that if we are to have persons tried by magistrates for offences which might involve a term of imprisonment then it should be done by more than 1 magistrate. There should be a bench of magistrates. In many parts of Great Britain - certainly in the local areas - there is a group of justices which hears cases. We in our own community, should be able to provide a bench of justices or magistrates in cases where persons are liable to be sent to gaol. </para>

            <para>- Yes. We will not be moving an amendment to this clause, but I think this idea may go somewhat towards meeting the proposition which has been put forward by the' Minister about offences involving a few months imprisonment in that if these people are not tried by a jury, then there should be at least a trial by a multiple bench and not by a single person because we cannot always rely on the good sense of persons on the bench. I think a feeling against this practice is arising. </para>

            <para>- You will find there is a welling feeling within this place. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> is suggesting, is that there are appeal provisions. That remark, if I may say with respect, is a typical remark coming from a lawyer; and I am one. I do not say this in any disrespect to the profession but there is a tendency to' think of these matters as if they do not involve economic consequences. It is not easy for people to appeal. If it is to be done effectively it involves a lot of money. The suggestion is that the State should provide initially that there be a hearing at which a number of persons will decide on a question which might result in another person being sent to gaol. At least this would help to mitigate some of the consequences of laws such as the one we are discussing and others. I think concern is being felt by a growing number of persons in this place about the state of the law which permits one person to decide these questions. </para>

            <para>- Of course I do, and I did not mean the remark disrespectfully when I mentioned lawyers because I believe we think automatically of the legal prev is ions without thinking of the economic consequences of those provisions. If we have legal aid that may transform the position, but at present it is not enough to say that some kind of appeal is available. I do not want to repeat the matters that we referred to before. We have made our points when speaking on the other clauses. Clause 20 also deals with trespass. The other points that have been made still stand although mitigated in regard to trespass because it is trespass on protected premises such as the premises of diplomats and so on. We as understand that that is not the same kind of ase as that which was dealt with at large. </para>

          <para>-  Clause  21  had some sort of an airing yesterday because  1  suggested that it shonld be considered in association with clause  5.  In the debate yesterday the Government spokesman denied that there is a threat in this Bill to innocent people who happen to get caught up innocently in an assembly. I was objecting to the effect which these sections taken together have of making a person's mere presence, even if it is fortuitous, at a certain place something which puts him in jeopardy. It was pointed out to me correctly - in fact, I conceded it in my remarks - that these are purely evidentiary sections; that a charge of taking part in an illegal assembly can be rebutted by evidence by the person charged that he was not in fact taking part in the assembly. I pointed out that this is not how it happens in real life, and that in practice a citizen finding himself in this position finds himself carrying a very difficult onus. That view is supported by what happened over the past few days in Washington in the great demonstrations which occurred there. If honourable senators will bear with me I would like to refer briefly to a report which appears in this morning's 'Canberra Times'. It was written by a correspondent of the Washington 'Star'. I will read only small sections of it to make my point. The article is as follows:  1 spent 20 hours Monday as a guest of the </para>

        </quote>
        <para class="block">The article continues in that vein. That happened in the United States, of course, but surely it would not be suggested that the same thing could not happen here. In fact, I suggest that it has happened here. I know of cases of it having happened here. It will be claimed, and this was said it i response to what I said yesterday that the citizen finding himself in that situation merely has to give evidence that he was not taking part in the unlawful assembly. But surely it is not a matter of no concern at all that that citizen, even if acquitted, has been put to the inconvenience of being taken away, fingerprinted, charged and detained. That is a gross interference with his daily life even if in the event he finally manages to get acquitted. I suggest that the onus which is cast on a man who may be quite innocently and fortuitously caught up in a demonstration, as provided by clause 21, is an unreasonable imposition on citizens. </para>

        <para class="block">I am grateful to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey</inline> for the interjection. This clause makes an evidentiary provision. Its effect is that evidence that an assembly was at a place in the vicinity of the protected premises or of a protected person is evidence that the assembly was there because of that fact. So if there happens to be a demonstration occurring within, say, 100 yards of the South African Embassy, a statement may be made that the demonstration was being held just because it was close to the South African Embassy. It is important to note that that evidence is not conclusive of the fact; it is simply evidence. I will use the example I used yesterday. If a person says that that was not the reason why the demonstration was being held at all, that person can state the real reason. That is the whole purpose of this provision. Why a demonstration is being held and why a person happens to be present in that demonstration is something peculiarly within that person's knowledge. If you have the objective fact that obviously there must be some connection between the physical proximity of the demonstration and the embassy or the diplomat's home, it is up to that person to say why. I do not know what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey</inline> is objecting to. If an innocent person is able to say: I was not at the demonstration for any reason connected with harassment or any reason at all concerned with the embassy', why cannot he say so? </para>

            <para>- I might deal firstly with the proposition I was putting and come back to the proposition put by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey.</inline> I was putting a proposition relating to clause 21 of this Bill. In the present context of what we are considering it would not be difficult for those organising an assembly in the vicinity of protected premises, or of a protected person, to give evidence of the fact - if it is a fact - that the proximity was a mere accident. If it was shown that the nature of the matters with which the assembly was concerned had no connection with the policies or the activities of the foreign government concerned, this in itself, 1 think, would conclude the matter. If the nature of the matter with which the assembly was concerned did have such a connection, evidence could be given of some reason for choosing the location or that those organising the assembly were ignorant of the proximity of the protected premises or person. But whatever be the fact the clause is merely designed to establish this relationship between the assembly and the premises, if anyone is to be convicted arising out of any incident at all the prosecution must still prove that the person was a member of that assembly and was there with a part of the common purpose. So many people are in the position that they can say what they like and no-one can dispute it. </para>

          <para>-  Clause 21 is an evidentiary clause. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland has addressed himself to these evidentiary provisions. The Opposition does not agree with sub-clause (1.). That sub-clause provides: (1.) In proceedings arising out of this Parliament, evidence that persons taking part in an assembly were at a place in the vicinity of protected premises, or were at a place at which, or in the vicinity of which, a protected person was present, is evidence that those persons were at that place by reason of the fact that it was in the vicinity of the protected premises, or by reason of the fact that the protected person was present at or in the vicinity of that place, as the case may be. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">This is a criminal Bill. The provisions deal with the rights of persons who might be subjected to imprisonment. We do not think that this kind of provision should be in the Bill because 'vicinity' is a difficult enough concept in itself. To have this evidentiary provision displacing the necessity for strict proof is something which does not commend itself to us. Therefore we oppose the first part of this clause. May we have this dealt with separately, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman?</inline></para>

          <para>- Before this clause is put to a vote I shall make a brief comment on it. It will be recalled that before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I interjected to the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Greenwood)</inline> who in this chamber represents the Attorney- General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr N. H. Bowen)</inline> and who was then in charge of the Bill. I asked about the position of an innocent person who was caught up in an assembly in respect of this clause. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> did not give what I consider was a satisfactory explanation as to what would be the case in such circumstances. It is my contention that it would be quite possible for a person who had no connection whatever with the assembly to be caught up with it in some way or other quite innocently because he happened to be in the vicinity at the time. If that happens he is caught in the net of the circumstances which are set out in clause 21 (1.). For that reason I think that sub-clause ought to be opposed and not only by honourable senators on the Opposition side of the chamber. It ought to be opposed by honourable senators generally. It is my belief that this sub-clause does not fully protect a person who could quite innocently get caught up in these cir cum happen because there have been such stances. Do not let us say that it could not instances galore hire and overseas. </para>

Quite recently there have been instances galore in Australia and overseas where people who had no connection whatever with the assembly and who did not want to take any part in it quite easily became caught in the net because they happened to be, in an unfortunate sense, in the vicinity of the assembly at the time. This situation is provided for in clause 21 (1.). I shall take an extreme example. Perhaps a person could be under the influence of liquor and as a result of this could inadvertently wander into such a situation. Without doubt such a person would find himself in a position from which it would be very difficult to extricate himself. I think it is a matter of simple logic that we should have another look at this proposition and ask whether some provision should be made for people who find themselves in circumstances which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland has mentioned. I support his remarks. </para>

          <para>- At the moment I cannot understand the basis of concern. I have listened throughout the whole of this debate to the propositions which have been put by honourable senators opposite. I have attempted to understand them but at the moment I am not entirely clear and I would like either <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey</inline> to make the situation as to the objection to clause 21 (1.) clearer. The objection, as I understand it, is that this in some way presents circumstances which are dangerous to the interests of a person who inadvertently is caught in a situation. I do not understand why that should be so on a proper interpretation of clause 21 (1.). I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland's statement that one could be walking down such and such a street in Double Bay on one's way to the shop to buy whatever it was that one was thinking of buying. The Yugoslav Embassy is somewhere near. One could find oneself in the vicinity of the Yugoslav Embassy and because of that one could come within this evidentiary provision. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Earlier this evening the Minister in charge of the Bill, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood,</inline> referred to this clause as an evidentiary clause. It is not a section constituting an offence but it is simply one which assists in some way in proving, prima facie only, certain of the facts which it would be necessary to prove. It assists in the question of proof and does not in any way govern the question of proof. I simply ask whether either <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey</inline> would elaborate their argument again. What is their objection to clause 21 (1.)? Why do they believe that this clause constitutes the danger which they say it does? I can well appreciate that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland or anybody else would be concerned that an innocent person could be caught up in a situation from which he could not extricate himself. Even when it came to court proceedings he could not prove himself not to have been in any way concerned with the demonstration or the unlawful assembly but, rather, that he was on his way shopping. It is just that nexus which, so far as I am concerned, in the speeches I have heard so far is entirely missing, and I would appreciate it if this point could be made clear. </para>

          <para>-  I will do my best to answer the question that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has asked. You may have a person who has got caught up in an assembly. He may have been unwittingly swept up into the assembly. Then there might be another person who says: 'Here is an assembly that is protesting about apartheid, or something of that nature, and he may say: 'Well, I agree with that, and I will go along with it, too.' He may not have realised for a start that it is in the vicinity of some protected premises. Those people might be just there protesting about what is happening in South Africa, and they might invite that person to join them, so he does so. He is joining that assembly because he objects to apartheid. He does not realise that because of clause 21 the Government will say to that person: 'Because you were taking part in an assembly which was at a place in the vicinity of protected premises or at a place .at which or in the vicinity of which a protected person was present it is evidence that you were there and at that place by reason of the fact that it was in the vicinity of a protected person.' That person may not have realised that the embassy was nearby or that the protected person' was there. He may just have seen the banners in the streets and the people in the assembly, like . the Salvation Army, may have said: 'Come and join us': And he might have thought: That is right, I agree with them'. Then the authorities could come along and say: 'Ah, clause 21! Although you were there, only to say that you were against apartheid, because you were in the vicinity of the protected premises or protected persons, that is evidence that that is the reason you were there.' The man may be perfectly innocent of this, but we see evidentiary provisions being brought in constructively to do to him something different from what was the actuality. He then became subject, of course, in all of this to the provisions under clause 17, so that he becomes subject to the thugs attacking him because he is in an assembly which presumably then is involved in one of these offences. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>That is the way the matter may be related. The Government has a tough enough law here, so why does it start to introduce these evidentiary provisions to substitute for the actualities some notional situation that not only is he in it but he is in it for a certain reason and because of a certain thing? Does the Government not think it has gone far enough to tie down the citizen without putting in these constructions and notional situations? I would have thought that the Government had a tough enough measure already without starting to construct laws of evidence and saying: 'Because he is there he is deemed to have been there for some reason'. If the Government wants to prove that he has committed the offence, why does it not prove it without introducing special evidentiary provisions? </para>

          <para>-  My leader has actually fortified my motive for seeking further information from the Minister. I want to go a little further. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> and I, knows the eastern suburbs of Sydney very well. I want to use the Yugoslav Embassy in Knox Street, Double Bay, to illustrate another situation that can arise. There are quite a number of coffee shops around there. I could be sitting there with friends of mine who would not agree with the ultra-Croatian right wing . movement. We might be having coffee there and a great surge of people might come down to demonstrate outside the embassy. When they see me and some of my friends they are sure to shout insults and I will shout them back. They will call me names and I will call them Fascist so-and-sos. What I want to know is whether under this Bill I have to keep my mouth shut and turn the other cheek, which is' foreign to me, or can I be lumbered with everyone else for calling them names in response to what they call me. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>It is as simple as that. I have got away with things. When people insult me they get it back with double interest. I want to know whether I can still do the same if I am down at Double Bay and people such as those I have mentioned come along and sing out to me. I want to be able to dish it out to them with even more invective. </para>

          <para>- Much as I can imagine, knowing <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> as I do. that he would be most interested and concerned with that particular situation. I shall certainly be happy to leave that for the Minister to reply to. I am quite happy to comment only about the situation raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy.</inline> It did seem to me that in his explanation, which was an answer to the question which I had raised, rather than explaining it he had somewhat obscured it because what he said was that the objection to clause 21 (1.) was really that it got down to subjecting a person to being open to the sort of abuse which he has said a person could be open to as a result of the provisions of clause 17. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline>talked about the thugs who could be able to operate against this person where situations such as he envisaged earlier in the debate in relation to clause 17 should prevail. Why the provisions of clause 21 should make any difference at all as to whether that person could be subjected to the thuggery of the thugs which he envisages is something that escapes me entirely, because it could not possibly make any difference. Clause 21 could not possibly make any difference as to whether the imagined thugs under clause 17 (4.) are able to carry out their thuggery. </para>
        <para>If a person is physically present, whether clause 21 is there or not, if the arguments in relation to clause 17 (4.) are valid they are valid irrespective of clause 21. This is the part that I still do not understand as to what is the nature of the objection to clause 21. I am just trying to understand what is the particular objection that is taken. </para>

          </talker>
          <para>-  I consider that there is a tremendous amount of weight in what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has said. After all, we have a number of proceedings which may be taken as a result of actions which contravene Part III of this legislation, and it is only with regard to proceedings which arise under this Part of the legislation that clause 21 comes into operation at all. For example, it is said in clause 19 that a person who, while taking part in an assembly that is in relation to protected premises - that is an embassy or the residence of a diplomat - throws, releases, deposits or deals with a repulsive object or substance in a manner likely to cause injury to per sons or damage to property is guilty of an offence. If the matter goes to court, one of the points necessary to be established by the prosecution is that the assembly or demonstration was in relation to an embassy or the residence of a diplomat. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>What is meant by the expression 'in relation to protected premises'? It is necessary to show that there was a clear connection between the assembly or de most ration taking place and an embassy or premises of a diplomat. That may be difficult to establish. All that clause 21 does is to say that in any such proceedings in which the prosecution has to prove that the demonstration was in relation to those premises, evidence that the place where the assembly was taking place was in the vicinity of the embassy or the residence of the diplomat is of such a circumstance, and because of the proximity the people were there. To a non-lawyer it may seem rather unnecessary to have to establish that fact, but to a lawyer who is versed in the way in which people defend these matters - and counsel for a defendant always takes advantage of every point which the prosecution has to prove - it becomes a highly relevant matter. </para>
        <para>It is therefore merely an evidentiary proposition. If a person says that the people were in that place because of its proximity to an embassy or diplomat's residence and it is not contradicted, that is evidence; but there is ample opportunity for anyone to challenge the proposition. Once the defence produces evidence to rebut the evidence permitted by clause 21, the onus is on the prosecution then to produce evidence to contradict the evidence which has been given by the defendant, or to try to destroy its force by cross-examination. </para>
        <para>The real value of sub-clause 1 of clause 21 lies in exposing to cross-examination specious attempts to establish that the holding of an assembly somewhere near an embassy or diplomat's residence was a mere coincidence. I consider that no injustice is involved in permitting such evidence to be given. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has not spelled it out as I have done. He has limited his concern to asking what the objection is to the provision. We have not heard any objection yet to the precise provision in the clause we are considering. Before the suspension of the sitting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey,</inline> and in a sense <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> later, were each concerned to establish if they could that they as innocent persons not in any way tied up with a demonstration could not be linked with that demonstration and regarded as subject to the same penalties as people engaging in the demonstration. I do not think that this clause has anything to do with that question. A person is either a member of a demonstration or he is not. If he is not a member of a demonstration he has only to say that he is not. </para>

There are laws of the land which we must all observe, even though we are not part of a demonstration, but I cannot see from this provision or any other provision of the law that in the example <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> gave he would be put in any difficult position if he behaved reasonably, even if vocally, to express his point of view. </para>

          <para>-  I inform the Minister that the thugs to whom I was referring, are the thugs who .already exist in the community and who have demonstrated their, desire to break- up peaceful assemblies. They have attended peaceful assemblies for that purpose. They have been shown on our television screens. They are given encouragement by this Bill to use force to disperse assemblies even though not. called upon to do so by the police force. It may be that the police do not want them to disperse the assemblies. Nevertheless, this Bill would make it lawful for them to do so. Those are the thugs to whom 1 referred and I regret that the Minister has not yet seen fit to deal with the problem. We have made clear what we think of the sub-clause. </para>

        </list><para class="block">Our complaint against clause 22 is a very simple but  a  very important one. For a very long time - perhaps the Minister might tell us  for how  long this has been the law - the Crimes Act has provided that a constable may  not  arrest without a warrant unless  he  believes that proceedings against the person by summons would not be effective. AH over the Commonwealth that provision  of the  Crimes Act has been effective. It has been a good provision. There have been  no  complaints about it.  I  have never heard the police say that they did not want this provision and that it has caused great difficulty. It would have to cause great difficulty - not a little difficulty - before anyone would want to take away this protection of the citizen. Yet slipped into this Bill is the attempt to whittle clown the right of a citizen not to be arrested. </para><para>Take the case  I  gave yesterday of the 17-year-old girl who was on television the night before the George's River by-election campaign. She was standing quietly in Hyde Park handing out a few pamphlets. The camera was on her some time before the policeman moved in to arrest her. She was not knocked about by the policeman. There was no suggestion of that. He tried to stop her from giving out pamphlets. The girl was committing no offence. There was no observable reason why she should have been dealt with in this way. To see this girl bundled into the wagon and taken off to the police station was a shocking thing. I am not saying that the policeman knocked her about. That is not the suggestion I am making. I thought it was a shocking thing for anyone to see. I thought it had a profound effect on the people of this country. </para><para>This could have been avoided if the New South Wales law had a provision such as the section in the Commonwealth Crimes Act by which the policeman could have asked and got the girl's name and address, satisfied himself of that by some means of identification and then proceeded against her by summons. Why should that girl have been bundled into that wagon, taken off to the cells, treated like a common criminal, fingerprinted and put through all the usual processes? Why should other persons who might be involved in similar incidents - some of whom might be guilty and some of whom might be innocent - be confronted with the prospect of imprisonment if the only reason for arrest is to ensure that they, come before the court to be tried? They should not be penalised before trial. If a summons would be effective, why should that not be the procedure to be followed? How does the Minister justify the clause? Under the Crimes Act, if " a summons would be effective, it is left to the discretion of the constable whether he will arrest the suspected offender. All the constable has to say is that he has a reasonable ground to believe that a person has committed an offence and that proceedings against the person by summons would not be effective. Then he can make the arrest. Is not the law as it stands, under section 8a of the Crimes Act, sufficient. </para><interjection>

That section of the Crimes Act has stood while various parties have been in and out of office. This has been the law. This is a good law and it should be retained. I ask the Minister to confirm whether, if this clause is defeated, section 8a of the Crimes Act will remain. That seems to be the position. The Minister seems to concur with that. If clause 22 were defeated section 8a of the Crimes Act would cover the position to enable the powers of arrest to be as they have always been. I respectfully suggest to the Committee that this clause should not be allowed to stand in the Bill but that section 8a of the Crimes Act should continue to prevail throughout the Commonwealth and its Territories. </para></speech>

        <para class="block">From that provision in the Crimes Act it is clear that if a law of the Commonwealth is breached or if a constable believes on reasonable grounds that it has been breached, he may, without warrant, simply take that person into custody and hold him in accordance with process of law. He has to be satisfied of 2 things. First he must be satisfied that there has been a breach of the law of the Commonwealth. He must have reasonable grounds for believing that. Of course, that is the basis upon which , a police constable acts. Secondly, he must be satisfied of a further requirement, that is, that the proceedings against -the person by summons would not be. effective. In other words, it is not sufficient for the policeman just to take the name, of the alleged offender so that in due course, he. can be served wilh a summons requiring him to attend before the court. That is fair enough, as far as it goes. He has to be satisfied that such a summons would not be effective. One can suppose that a summons would not be effective if there were some reason for believing that the name and address given by the offender were not his true name and address or that, if it were his true name and address, he was not likely to be there in order to receive service of the summons, or that in some other way he would evade service. It is a very limited consideration which the constable has to bear in mind. This is the provision of the Crimes Act and there are inhibitions in taking action under it. </para>
        <para>What does the Bill propose? It simply says that a constable may, without warrant, arrest a person if the constable has reasonable ground to believe that the person has committed an offence against this Act. It gives a constable power to arrest a person without warrant where he believes that the person has committed an offence against the Act and, of course, it is in wider terms than the provision in the Crimes Act. The circumstances which I have in mind is that a person taking part in a demonstration sits down along with a host of others and impedes traffic, whether it be vehicular traffic or the passage of people going home from their shopping or home from their work, and the policeman has to remove them. What can he do? He can believe on reasonable grounds than an offence has been committed under this Act, for if an unreasonable obstruction has been caused it would be an offence. What does he do? He can, I suppose, ask the sitting demonstrator to remove himself. 1 do not suppose that anyone in this chamber would believe that on mere request a sit-in demonstrator, would remove himself. So the policeman would then have to lift him, or a few policemen would have to lift that person, and remove him. If he had no power to arrest him he would have no power to prevent him from going back. </para>

            <para>- It is the purpose of the clause. The purpose is to enable a police constable to arrest without warrant where he has reasonable grounds for believing that an offence has been committed. One obvious situation where that would occur is where the sit-in demonstrator has been removed and he is arrested simply in order to prevent him from going back and sitting down in the place whence he was removed.

          <para>- In response to what has been said by the Minister I would say that it is extremely disturbing to me to think that in this chamber, on behalf of the Government, we would bear advanced the proposition that the power of arrest is to be used, in effect, to penalise persons or to provide for some preventive detention. If the purpose were as. the Minister indicated - to deal with people who might be engaging in a further contravention of the Act or in some breach of the peace- let that be put into the clause. But it is not in the provision. The purpose of arrest or of summons is to bring people before the court for trial. The purpose of arrest is not as indicated by the Minister. We find that in this community arrest is being degraded and is being used for purposes which have never been the aim of the law. One hears constantly over the radio that persons have been arrested for questioning. Of course any lawyer knows that an arrest for this purpose is an illegal arrest. That is not the reason for arrest. Here the Minister is suggesting that the purpose of the arrest is not to bring the person before the court but for some other reason. It is not for the constable to adjudge the guilt of the person. The arrest is a procedural step only where one cannot issue a summons to bring a person before the court. That is the purpose of arrest. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I will concede to the Government that there are occasions when it has been said that the authorities may intervene in order to prevent a continuing breach of the peace. If that is the intention of this clause, let it be written into the clause. This arrest provision applies to the whole of the Bill, even to those cases that we dealt with where there was trespass by one person and there was no connection with any demonstration, tumult, or riot. The ordinary law has been broken down. I suggest to the Minister representing the Attorney-General that here we have a long-standing provision in the Crimes Act - one of the best provisions in Commonwealth law. Speaking for myself - I ask the Minister to consider this - when looking through the area of civil liberty one of the few provisions in the Commonwealth law which has appealed to me over the years has been section 8a of the </para>
        <para class="block">Crimes Act. I thought it was a wise provision. I know that sometimes it is difficult for a constable. 1 do not evade the issue that sometimes there are problems for the constable and the authorities, and that probably the Minister has not dealt with all the problems. I am aware of that. </para>
        <para>In the balance the Government is trying to draw between the citizen and authority, section 8a of the Crimes Act has been a very good provision. It is better than any of the State measures. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> did not ask me about State legislation, although I think he was close to it, but the provisions in State law are like the provisions in this Bill. It has been a good feature of Commonwealth law that section 8a has existed and there has been this curb. It is beneficial and I think it has worked well. I think also that it should be left as it is. If it is thought that we should have a special provision to deal with the situation that the Minister has outlined, that there may be people who would engage in a continuing contravention of the Act, let that be written into the Bill. In the situation where a person is stopped by a constable who says to him: T intend to take proceedings against you,' and there is no suggestion that the person will continue in contravention of the Act, surely he should not be arrested. I would like to see remaining in Commonwealth law the provision that he is not to be arrested if proceedings by summons would be effective. Too many incidents of this nature are occurring. The little girl I mentioned earlier in the debate probably would not have been arrested if a provision like section 8a of the Crimes Act had been written into the New South Wales legislation. </para>
        <para>If the Government feels that it needs a provision to deal with tumult or with those persons whom it feels will engage in a breach of the peace unless they are arrested it should write such a provision into the legislation, but it should not put in a general provision which will break down the terms of a fine provision which has been in the Crimes Act for a long time. I think that this may be one of the most important parts of the Bill. I believe that the Government would do great credit to itself if it had another look at this matter and either left the clause out or, if it felt that it was absolutely vital to put something in the legislation to meet its concern about such a breach of the peace, added such a provision. Frankly I think the law would be a lot better if the Crimes Act provision were left as it is. I would appeal to the Government to do that. </para>

He has been talking about section 8a of the Crimes Act but he has not referred to section 8. To me the 2 necessarily go together. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> said that the law should be left as it stands at the moment. If we were to leave the law as it is we would have the provisions of arrest without warrant in respect of breaches of the peace and we would have the other provision about which he has been speaking, namely, section 8a of the Crimes Act. I draw his attention to that matter because to me it is an important part of the consideration of what he has been saying. </para>

          <para>-  I am indebted to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> for his comments. I think he has answered the proposition that I was putting. He is quite right in saying that I did not advert to this matter while - 1 was speaking. Section 8 of the Crimes Act would give the right, if there was an apprehended breach, of the peace, for the constable to arrest the person anyway. In those circumstances, why do we not leave the law as it is? Section 8a is quite reasonable in its present form and section 8 deals with the very situation the Minister has spoken about of a person who will persist in sitting down in the street or something like that in breach of the peace. The Government is breaking down a set of provisions that deal with exactly what the Minister wants to cover. I ask the Minister whether it is correct, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has pointed out, that in the situation he referred to a constable would have the power to arrest - in effect, to exercise the power of the court, to penalise or to have injunctive powers, if I might call them that - to prevent a breach of the peace. Is this not covered by section 8 of the Crimes Act? Would the law not be best left as it is? </para>

        <para class="block">Murphy has raised. I do not think it is correct to say that I did not answer the original proposition that he put up. I did give the example of a situation where the mere removal from his position of a person is engaged in a sit-in is not going to prevent him going back and sitting in the same area or in the vicinity and continuing the breach that his removal was originally designed to prevent. That is one of the practical problems that the police are concerned with in this phenomenon of a sit-in demonstration. Therefore, the policemen have to be given some powers to remove the wrongdoer when that person is engaged in or is likely to engage in a repetition of the offence as soon as he is removed from his particular position. I think I did answer the original proposition. I am prepared to accommodate the arguments which have been put forward by the Opposition.

The only other point I would make is in regard to the point which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> made in respect to the Crimes Act. The power of civil arrest, which, in the Crimes Act, is linked with the power of police arrest, is limited in the expression in the Crimes Act to offences against the Crimes Act.

          <para>-  I agree with the Minister that his proposition does go a long way towards meeting what I have put. I do not think it goes far enough, but it is a great improvement. I would prefer the law to have been left in the state that it was in because I think it is better not to tamper with a law that has been working well and that preserves a proper balance between the citizens and the authorities. I am grateful to the Minister for the proposal that he has made because it is certainly a considerable improvement upon the provision in this Bill. In those circumstances the Opposition will not oppose the amendment. I can hardly see how the Opposition could because it is an improvement upon the previous position. We are not likely to do any. better than we have done. I think the Opposition will content itself with accepting the proposition that has been put forward by the Minister. The Opposition is grateful to him for having put it forward. The Opposition is not satisfied that this is how the law should stand, but it thinks that it has done as well as it could expect. </para>

Every government wants to suppress criticism, to disperse assemblies or to suppress them, as in the terms of this enactment.

          <para>- The Government opposes this amendment. It seems to me that what the Opposition is contending for is a quite unreasonable position which, if it were to be accepted and applied in other areas, would make nonsense of the whole system of administration of justice. As long as there has been a sensible system of administration of justice, not only in Australia but also in England, there have been some offences of a relatively summary or trivial character which have been tried by justices of the peace or in latter days by magistrates, some who are qualified in terms of legal equipment and others who are not, but who in either case have had common sense every day experience of the courts. In addition to those types Qf offences there are more serious types of offences in respect of which a defendant, if he pleads not guilty, has always had the right to trial by jury. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>There must inevitably be a question of where you draw the line. It would be an absurd proposition to suppose that everybody who is charge with being drunk and disorderly, every person who is charged with offensive behaviour or insulting words, every person who is charged with driving a motor car in excess of 35 miles an hour or with failing to give way to the vehicle on his right could, if he chose, have a trial by jury. I do not believe that our system of justice would be enhanced by demoting and degrading the status of a jury trial to cover all those offences. There must be a limit. I believe that the limit which has been generally accepted over the years has been based on 2 principles. One is the type of issue which the jury, as the determinant of the facts, has to determine. Where the issue is one which does involve a matter of judgment, it is a fair thing for a jury to have that say. But the second criterion  -  I suppose it is the more important criterion overall - is: What is the punishment to which a person exposes himself? We have heard in the Senate over the years countless examples given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> that 12 months or 6 months represent a period of punishment in regard to which a jury trial might be appropriate. </para>
        <para>The maximum term of punishment in the cases to which this Bill applies is no more than 3 months, and it would appear to me that that is consonant with the types of punishment which are open to be imposed upon a person who is tried by a magistrate under so many of the ordinary laws which are passed by the States. In this case, why should there be a jury trial insisted upon by the Opposition. I visualise one example in which some people would delight in the fact that there was a jury trial. There are those people who engage in demonstrations of one sort and another and who are prepared to make a farce of the whole system to which they express themselves as being opposed. We have seen the misuse of the courts by people who have prosecuted other people, and these other people who have been prosecuted have pleaded guilty even though they knew they were innocent. This is the sort of farce to which a number of these people are subjecting our processes. If they were to be able to claim a jury trial in this type of situation I believe we would have a position where we might have hundreds of demonstrators arrested quite deliberately for an offence which, if it were tried before the courts, might bring them a fine of $4 or a bond to be of good behaviour for <inline font-style="italic">6</inline> months, and every one of them would insist on a jury trial. </para>
        <para>A jury trial in these circumstances is paid for by the people, of this country, and I do not believe that the system should be so exposed to such farcical behaviour on the part of some people whose sole objective is to bring the system down that we should open it up. in that way. I think that one should refer <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> to the speeches he made' on the Narcotic Drugs Bill and the Wireless Telegraphy Bill in which, while stressing the value of trial by jury, he applied it to offences where the punishment, was 10 years. 1 refer him to his remarks where he thought offences with a punishment of less than 6 months were fair enough to be tried by a magistrate. This is a case where the offences involved attract punishments of less than 6 months - as I said, 3 months - and I fail to see why the arguments which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> used on that occasion, and which appeared then to have some weight to him, should not have the same weight to him on this occasion. </para>

          <para>- The Australian Democratic Labor Party would not support the contention that has been put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> on this question. 1 do not wish to deal with the points <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> has dealt with. I am no lawyer, thank goodness. After what I have heard for the last couple of days it would appear to me that if somebody is arrested, under the terms of this Bill, for sitting in the middle of the street neither the court nor the jury would be concerned with their criticism of the Government or anyone else. They would be charged with the crime of sitting in the street, and that is all the evidence that would be submitted to the jury to prove they were guilty of the offence. The purpose that they had in mind in sitting in the street and breaking the law has nothing more to do with the jury than it has to do with me or anybody else who might happen to be present. They may be laying in the street because they are drunk, and they then would be submitted to the same sort of charge. Again the jury would not be concerned so much with the fact that they were laying there drunk but that they were obstructing the traffic by laying in the middle of the roadway. The police would have to remove them and charge them with the offence of being drunk and disorderly. If they were tried by a jury the offence would still be to the fact that they were laying in the middle of the street obstructing the traffic - if those were the circumstances. </para>

        <para>I do not see that the high sounding arguments that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> puts up because people are opposed to a government, either here or in some other remote part of the world, and they chose to lay down in the middle of the street and obstruct the traffic to exhibit their objection to a particular government those facts would interest either a judge or a jury if they were charged with obstructing the traffic by sitting in the street. The only relevant questions would be: Were they sitting in the street? Were they guilty of that? I do not see how the jury could either accept or dismiss a charge because it thought that the law under which the charge was laid was a good or a bad law, or that any jury would go to the extent to which I am certain <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> would go. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> told him that there were such things as good laws and bad laws whether he had a part in making them or not. </para>

            <para>- I certainly do not. I believe there is the law and the law is there to be obeyed by all. If we disagree with the law there are procedures in a democratic society by which we should change the law. But we should not go out and defy the law because in the estimation of a person such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> some minor law is unnecessary and therefore a bad law. </para>

        <para>During my speech on the second reading of this Bill I cited to the honourable senator only the other day the case of 2 young men in Melbourne who wanted to kill a girl. They thought the law that prevented them was a bad one so they went out and broke it. The honourable senator says: 'But that is different'. It is just a matter of degree in that their minds operate perhaps in a different fashion than does the honourable senator's. Once we break down the capacity of the law and respect for the law there is no limitation to which that disrespect for the law can be carried. I suggest that the proposition that for minor offences, such as sitting in the street and obstructing traffic, there has to be a trial by jury because it can be said that some people do this for the purpose of criticising a government, either here or abroad, is a ridiculous proposition from anybody, and it is most certainly a ridiculous proposition from a lawyer. </para>

            <para>- I do not think it is a waste of the time of the Senate. I think it is extremely desirable that the members of political parties put forward their philosophy on these matters and I would encourage the members of the Democratic Labor Party as often as possible and in such forceful and succinct fashion and with such clarity to explain their views on matters of civil liberties as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Little</inline> did on this occasion. He has expressed very well the philosophy of those who have framed this Bill and we are indebted to him for explaining his Party's stand on this Bill and why it has sided with the Government on every matter which has been raised in relation to the Bill. All I ask is that what he said be spread far and wide throughout the community. I hope that it is given attention by every person interested in political affairs. We are extremely indebted to him for telling us why he supports the Government and for telling us his stand on these great issues of peaceable assembly and the issue of freedom of speech. </para>

It is right that we i are attempting to extend trial by jury, which this Bill does not do. We spoke also of trifling offences. I do not regard as trifling any matter which concerns the liberty of the people, the right to peaceable assembly and the right to freedom of speech. These have always been regarded as the area, whether in civil or criminal matters, where the people should be able to participate in the judicial process. </para>

          <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman,</inline> the Opposition voted against the last sub-clause after endeavouring to amend it. I want our opposition to these matters to be on the record but we do not want to divide theCommittee unnecessarily. However, we want our. objection to be made clear. We have a serious objection to this clause. Our objection is that the proceedings for commitment for summary prosecution other than under clauses 7 or 16 shall be instituted only with the consent in writing of the Attorney-General. The ground of our objection is this: We are disturbed at the insertion into this Bill of a provision that departs from the rule of law in that the law is not made applicable to everyone. The law can be initiated only against persons with the consent of the Attorney-General. </para>

        <para>I have looked through the old documents relating to the revolution in the 17th century. One of the great complaints in Great Britain against the government of the day was the dispensation with the laws and the suspension of the laws. We are finding this practice creeping in again, as it has been today, because governments throughout the ages get up to their old tricks under new guises. One of the new guises is that again and again and again the Government brings in legislation which includes such a provision as this. It does not matter that people say:' That is a bad law. It can be abused.' The Government says: 'No; it can be invoked only with the consent of the Attorney-General.' That, in substance, is the same kind of dispensation with the law as happened in the 17th century and it was one of the reasons for the overthrow of the monarchy at that time. </para>
        <para>We are now dealing with a proposed law which we of the Opposition think is bad. Proceedings cannot be instituted by any citizen. For those who are about to get out their Halsburys, let it he said that notwithstanding the provision that in indictable matters the Crown can take over the case, even indictable matters can be started off by the citizen and the Crown may come in later. But in this case proceedings for the commitment of a person on indictment or summary prosecution shall be instituted only with the consent of the Attorney-General. If we are to have the rule of law, let the law apply to ail citizens. Let the law be as it is. Enable the law to be invoked by any citizen. Let summary offences be followed through by any citizen against any other citizen.- In -the case of indictable matters, because of their seriousness the Crown has the right to move in at some stage and take over the conduct of the proceedings. But essentially the law can be invoked by anyone. </para>

I would like to put it into the context, as I see it, of consideration of the question raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> about which I have been concerned since I first saw this Bill. First, for general principles, I want to quote something which I think is generally accepted. It is a statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Hartley</inline> Shawcross in the House of Commons in 19S1 as reported in </para>
        <para class="block">Hansard, volume 483, columns 681-8. It states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The existence of this discretion and the utility of this discretion in the Attorney-General whether or not to prosecute in particular cases has been so well recognised- - </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I emphasise those words - that there has been an increasing tendency in recent years to provide that there shall be no proceedings as to particular classes of offences created by Statute without the consent of the Attorney-General or- and again I emphasise - the Director of Public Prosecutions. That kind of provision has been made to ensure that there wm be no automatic prosecutions and that there will be no frivolous and unnecessary prosecutions in such cases. That is a Parliamentary recognition, if any such recognition were required, that it is the duty of the Attorney-General and the Director- that is the Director of Public Prese cut ions - to exercise their discretion in every case whether or not to invoke the machinery of the criminal law. </para>
        <para class="block">That is a statement which I think has been accepted and which, as I shall develop in a moment, is in my view representative of the attitudes which have been adopted by parliaments over a considerable period of years. The Bill with which we are concerned is a public order Bill. The discussion of the Bill in this chamber has been very interesting and it has tended to be related to the current matters which may or may not be regarded by some people to be matters which are likely to create public disorder. National service, war, or peace - I am not suggesting they are not important matters - are not matters which are necessarily going to be at all times the most important matters and the matters about which there may be situations which cause problems so far as the keeping of public order is concerned. An existing example is the problem of religion which is creating disorder in parts of Ireland and other parts of the world. We have the problem of the conservationists who have become extremely distressed in recent times. As a member of the Senate Select Committee on Water Pollution I add that there is some considerable reason for becoming concerned. Conservationists concern themselves with questions like the Little Desert plan and the Lake Ped der flooding in Tasmania. People have become concerned with various other things. So this concerns not just one sector of the community. It may be any sector of the community which may be dealt with in one way or another by the provisions of this Bill. </para>

            <para>- I am trying to put this situation into context. I think the discussion has tended to proceed on the basis that we were looking at it as being related to one thing only. I am simply saying that there is a breadth right throughout the community of potential situations in which we may have people who may be subjected to this Bill. Let us not think about this Bill from the point of view of the Yugoslavian embassy and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> or particular demonstrators about a particular matter. That is the point I am making. </para>

        <para>It is a centuries old basis of law that it is in the public interest to have the ability to control assemblies and to prevent persons inflaming feelings so that persons are incited to violence. It is something which has been known in the law of Australia, the law of the United Kingdom and the law of most of the other Commonwealth countries. There are 2 basic considerations which are well known and well established in relation to this. The first is that there should be a filter system to determine whether prosecutions should be proceeded with. This is something which I suggest is well known and well established. An example is where there is a reasonable prima facie case for the prosecution to proceed and where there is some likelihood or reasonably apparent possibility of prosecutions being launched which are mala fide - that is prosecutions which are not brought bona fide. Those prosecutions should be subjected to some independent scrutiny otherwise one can have a tendency to inflame the situation which the law which was originally passed was intended to control. It is important from the point of view of the protection of the individual against a malicious or vexatious prosecution that there should be some system whereby, for instance, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Citizen</inline> Smith cannot be charged with murder or with an offence - perhaps a serious offence - under the Public Order Bill without there being a prima facie case established before the Press are able to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Smith</inline> appeared in court charged with such and such. </para>
        <para>It may be that that prosecution had been brought entirely without any bona fides on the part of the prosecutor simply to achieve a purpose which is unrelated to the question of obtaining a conviction and whether the law was broken. These are considerations. The Minister also mentioned considerations. He said that we must prevent the system of justice from being clogged completely by vexatious litigants bringing mala fide prosecutions and clogging up the courts. So that nobody will argue that this is something novel which is being suggested in relation to there being a filter system I shall make a further reference. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> will be delighted, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon</inline> if he were here would be delighted, to know that I refer again to my good friend Halsbury, the third edition, volume 10, at pages 338 and 339 where a vast number of Acts are set out in which this type of system is operated. I shall pick a few examples to show that it is not over a short period of time that this system has been used. The consent of the Attorney-General is required in the United Kingdom, for instance, in the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829; the Public Health Act 1875; the Geneva Convention Act 1911; the Agricultural Credits Act 1928; the Public Order Act 1936  -  I emphasise that Act because it has some relevance to this debate; the Public Utilities Street Works Act 1950; and the Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) Act 1951. For over 120 years this type of provision - that is a provision requiring the Attorney-General's consent - has been known to the English law and used in the English law. </para>
        <para>In relation to the Director of Public Prosecutions the consent which is required should be that of an official, a public servant, a senior Crown law officer, as opposed to a member of the Parliament. There are numerous examples of this. As some of them I instance the Lunacy Act 1890; the Punishment of Incest Act 1908; the Local Government Act 1933; and the Incitement to Disaffection Act 1934. An Act which would interest <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> is the Civil Aviation Act 1949. Another Act is the Dangerous Drugs Act 1951. Again I simply cite those Acts as an example of where the Director of Public Prosecutions in the United Kingdom is the person who has the role of deciding whether a prosecution should proceed. Other examples are the customs prosecutions where a senior customs officer must decide. In the Income Tax Act in the United Kingdom the consent of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is required before a prosecution is instituted. Again, they are senior public servants whose consent is required, not a member of the Parliament. There is no absolute right to bring a prosecution. My point is that this is a situation well known to the law for a very long time - certainly well over a century - that there should be a filter system. Under this system one has an alternative between the Attorney-General who is a member of the Parliament answerable on the floor of the Parliament or a senior Crown law officer or a senior officer of the department concerned whose Minister is answerable on the floor of the chamber in respect of what that particular person does. </para>
        <para>We also have the situation well known in the law where, in relation to indictable offences as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> mentioned, these are taken in the final situation to the Supreme Court only with the approval of the Solicitor-General. I suggest that there is ample precedent for a provision such as that which exists in the Bill at the moment or which I have suggested should exist. </para>
        <para>I pass then to look at what sort of filter is preferable. Should it be the Attorney-General or should it be an officer of the public service such as the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Solicitor-General or some other senior Crown law officer? The considerations I mention include the direct responsibility of an Attorney-General being answerable to Parliament. That is an argument in favour of the Attorney-General being the person who should have to exercise the discretion. That is one of the considerations. But if that Attorney-General is the person to be responsible he may have a situation where the rest of his responsibility is brought to a halt because he has so many mala fide prosecutions to consider. He is bound to give proper consideration to them and he has no time to do anything else. We may have the situation where prosecutions which are authorised and directed by him may be regarded - and, of course, they would be wrongly so regarded - by some of those who are being prosecuted as being politically motivated prosecutions, particularly in circumstances, which one could imagine would be a common circumstance whoever was in power and whatever the circumstances in which these sorts of provisions were being used, where the offender is violently politically opposed to the Attorney-General whose direction is to be sought by the provisions which exist at the moment. So it would be a case where it would appear that there was not an impartial prosecution being brought. </para>
        <para>We all know the old saying about not only must justice be done but it must manifestly appear to be done. I suggest that the persons who are to be prosecuted under a law such as this should not, either genuinely or for the purposes of whatever campaign they are wishing to be able to conduct, be able to say that there is a political prosecution. This would be wrong. It is not in the interests of public order. In fact, it is directly contrary to the interests of public order because it is inflammatory of disorder. After all, the whole purpose for which the Bill is conceived is that there should be an ability on the part of the community or on the part of the Government to carry out its responsibility to the community to keep order within the community. </para>
        <para>In anything that I have said about the Attorney-General I am not to be taken as saying that Attorneys-General of all political persuasions are not always faithful to the proper principles as expounded, for instance, by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Hartley</inline> Shawcross, but the situation is that their position can be misunderstood. The Attorney-General, if he was to make up his mind, would make up his mind as a lawyer, having regard to the public interest and not just whether there was a prima facie case. He would take into account all the aspects of the public interest and then decide whether it was proper to proceed with the prosecution. He would have regard to what his fellow Cabinet Ministers in particular instances may say, but I emphasise that he would not be subject to the direction of Cabinet That is a well established and well known principle. So we would have a situation in the normal course of events where the Attorney-General would be making up his mind on the same principles as would a senior Crown law officer if that senior Crown law officer was given the responsibility of making the decision. </para>
        <para>We have  the  examples which are well known  of the  Solicitor-General, for instance, having to decide whether a person should  be  charged with manslaughter or murder; whether, for instance, in the case  of a  person who is dying of cancer, it is in  the  public interest to go through the performance  of a  trial to get a conviction before  the  person dies in circumstances which would  be  abhorrent to most people to imagine. There are all sorts of situations that one  tan  easily imagine in which a Solicitor-General would, in the normal course  of the  administration of the criminal law,  say that  . that particular prosecution should sot,  in.  the public interest, proceed.  This is  a discretion which has to be exercised  hi every  case, whether it be by a senior Crown  law  officer or whether it be  by an  Attorney-General, and on balance I consider  that the  requirements of the first consideration which I mentioned are best served  by- - </para>

          <para>- I thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> for his courtesy. On balance, I consider that the requirements of the first consideration are best served by the filter discretion being exercised by a senior Crown Law departmental officer rather than  by  the Attorney-General. There is in that event no incitement to further disorder by either the intentional or unintentional but in either event misguided view that prosecutions are political prosecutions. There is then the maintenance in the best possible way of the view in the community that an impartial system of justice is being administered. I think this is something which, so far as the rule of law is concerned, is important. We must in a community maintain a respect for the law, and something which can denigrate the law is something which we must consider very carefully. </para>
        </talk.start></continue><para>I believe that in these sorts of circumstances the discretion being vested in the Attorney-General is something which can in the ultimate bring about a denigration of the law and a disrespect for the legal system which is not in the interests of the community. I think that, having regard to the fact that the same considerations are to be applied either by the Attorney-General or a senior departmental officer, where we have the advantage of no denigration of the law and where we have no disadvantage in the same principles being applied, we have only the other question to consider, and that is the question of whether there is someone answerable on the floor of the House of Parliament in relation to the particular matter. We have to make up our minds which it should be. I simply point out that a senior departmental officer of the Attorney-General's Department is obviously someone for whom the Attorney-General is answerable on the floor of the chamber, so there is no disadvantage there. </para><interjection>

I simply submit that, when taken overall, the interests of the community are best served if this discretion, which has been known to the law for more than 150 years in this type of circumstance, is vested in a senior Crown Law officer as opposed to the member of Parliament, the Attorney-General. For that reason, I have moved an amendment which makes the discretion to be that of the Crown Solicitor or his  deputy.  The Crown Solicitor for the Commonwealth is a person recognised by section 50 of the Judiciary Act, and he has a  deputy  in each State. This is a situation which does not in any way introduce anything which is novel to the law or novel to Australia, so far as the position of the person who has to exercise the discretion is concerned. I simply ask that honourable senators give consideration to whether the public interest is not best served by accepting this amendment. </para>

          <para>-  I must confess that I am somewhat puzzled as to the purpose of this amendment. It seems to me that in any case as far as practice is concerned the Crown Solicitor or  Deputy  Crown Solicitor for a State would be instituting any proceedings, and that clearly the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth is not sitting in his office 24 hours of the day looking through every prosecution of every person who is believed to have offended against some Commonwealth statute. .But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has said that in any event we have not taken the authority or the responsibility for any prosecutions out of the hands of the Attorney-General because the Attorney-General is still answerable for any action which is taken by the Crown Solicitor or a  Deputy  Crown Solicitor. That is the case at present. If we leave the Bill as it is, that is what will happen. The Crown Solicitor,  Deputy  Crown Solicitor, First Assistant  Deputy  Crown Solicitor, or whatever may be his title will institute a prosecution. If somebody in the Parliament is critical, naturally the Attorney-General will be responsible. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline>has raised the matter of an inspector of customs for whom he said the Minister for Customs and Excise is responsible. Of course he is responsible, because the authority is not given under statute to the inspector. The responsibility is given to the Minister for Customs and Excise himself. I can imagine an appalling situation developing as far as this Parliament is concerned if this amendment is carried. For example, the  Deputy  Crown Colic it or in Perth could authorise a prosecution to be undertaken. The matter could then be raised in the Parliament, with the Attorney-General being asked why it had taken place. The Attorney-General could then say: 'I had nothing to do with it. The  Deputy  Crown Solicitor in Perth has been given authority under the legislation and it is not my responsibility, it is his. I have nothing to do with it whatsoever. The statutory authority is vested in the  Deputy  Crown Solicitor under the Act.. I am merely Attorney-General.' The  Deputy  Crown Solicitor would be floating in the air like Mohammed's coffin, without any visible means of support. Proceedings could be instituted without any authority from either the Attorney-General or the Solicitor-General. We could ask nobody in this Parliament about what had happened. We could not properly criticise anybody in this Parliament, and we could not congratulate anybody in the Parliament if we wished to applaud the measures taken by the  Deputy  Crown Solicitor. </para>
        <para>On this side of the chamber we are very free with our congratulations when we feel they are warranted; We could. not congratulate the Attorney-General ' for the measures taken. In this instance we could congratulate the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Greenwood)</inline> who represents the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr N. H. Bowen)</inline> for having the audacity to submit such a Bill to the Senate. I believe that there is no advantage whatsoever in accepting the proposed amendment, lt make no substantive alteration to the Bill. In fact it takes, authority away from the Attorney-General and gives it to his employees in a manner which, so far as I am aware, is not found in any other legislation. </para>

          <para>- I think that the case put up by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> in support of his proposed amendment indicates research and also shows very forcefully the variety of considerations which would apply. I am a little surprised at the attitude of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon</inline> in the light of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> said earlier. I think the point made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> illustrates the generally everlasting and unsolvable problem which confronts people who have the task of determining whether prosecutions should be instituted. As I understood <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy,</inline> he felt that there should not be a power of dispensation which could be exercised in political hands. In the sense that an Attorney-General is still responsible, or more accurately is accountable for the officers of his Department in the decisions they take, it may be that the genera] position has not been altered; but at least it appears to the Government that the proposition put by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> goes some way towards meeting the general concern, and the fear that prosecutions are politically motivated can be overcome. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The Crown Solicitor and his deputies in the Attorney-General's Department are above politics because they exercise their functions in accordance with the time honoured precepts which attach to their offices. I do not want to suggest that the Attorney-General does not likewise exercise his authority in the same way. The statements of Lord Shawcross cited by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> represent a pattern which is followed by Attorneys-General in this country and,  1  am sure, by most Attorneys-General in countries which accept the common law tradition. The Government is prepared to: accept the proposed amendment because it is persuaded not only that it is a desirable step to take but also because in these circumstances, to use the expression which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has used, on balance it appears a reasonable compromise to meet the various concerns which people have. </para>

          <para>- A very interesting proposition has been put forward. The Opposition has opposed this Bill because it has some undesirable features. The Government was not game to put forward the proposition which is now advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae.</inline> The Bill passed through the House of Representatives and came to the Senate. Now a backbench senator has put up a proposition which if accepted win mean that any programme which might have been properly directed against the Government and the Attorney-General of the day for taking proceedings under this legislation will be shelved onto a public servant. The Attorney-General will not have to be answerable in Parliament because it will not be his responsibility. When questions are asked about the proceedings he will say: 'I wash my hands of it. It is not my discretion. It is the discretion of the Crown Solicitor.' </para>

            <para>- I am not suggesting that. With all respect to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> I do not think he would be capable of engaging in such a frame-up. Out of the blue has come something which the Government would not have been game to put up. When it has occurred to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> the Government has said: 'Here is something.' I am not suggesting that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> is in a conspiracy with the Government. Far from it. I am suggesting that the Government has taken advantage of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae's</inline> proposition to accept something it would not have been prepared to put up itself, because it is not right. I hope the Senate will reject it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> has been Premier of a State. Other senators have been in public life. They know that this is not the right course to take. We have arguing all night about highly contentious matters. Incidents related to this Bill will be right in the centre of politics. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae's</inline> proposition is to shelve decisions onto a public servant and to make him the butt because he is to decide whether the law is to be invoked. Unless the public servant gives his approval and affixes his signature to a document, nothing can be done. One can imagine the pressures that will be exerted. Why should any public servant be faced with that responsibility? This should be the responsibility of the Attorney-General. </para>

        </continue>
        <para>I am shocked that the representative of the Attorney-General in this chamber would countenance a proposition such as that which has been put here tonight. There is one protection where the Attorney-General is concerned because he has surrounding him some great conventions. These were adverted to by the former Attorney-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hughes,</inline> when he said that in deciding whether the law should be invoked the Attorney-General has to exercise his discretion and he will not be influenced even by the Cabinet of the day. To allow himself to be told, even by the Cabinet, whether to commence a prosecution would be a disgrace. That is one protection that the citizen has. If the Attorney-General carries out his office as he should he will exercise his discretion rightly. He will say: T am here to exercise this independent discretion. I am one of the great law officers of the Crown. I will decide whether it is in the public interest that the prosecution should be launched'. </para>
        <para>This petty amendment in these great matters of public concern and public controversy will shift that onus onto a public servant so that he will come under these pressures, without being surrounded by the conventions which the Attorney-General has, without having the independence which the Attorney-General has and without having the right in Parliament to explain and to defend himself as the Attorney-General has. The amendment will put this onus on a public servant - the Crown Solicitor. He will be pushed into the arena of public criticism where be cannot defend himself and where he does not have the protections which are there not only for him but also for the public. I think the amendment is a disgraceful one, and we will oppose it. </para>

          <para>- After that extraordinary outburst by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> I feel that I should reply. I found it quite incredible that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> should have become quite so emotional when replying. If he had listened to me he might have understood. I did notice that he was not listening to the first portion of my speech. But I am grateful to him for arranging for me to be able to complete what I had to say originally. I would like to point out certain things. Notwithstanding the rather extreme language that was used, my amendment does not alter the position in respect of all the indictable offences under this Act. The Solicitor General or the senior Crown Law officer - in other words, someone other than the Attorney-General - would, if there were no provision such as that contained in clause 23 (2.) have to decide whether a prosecution on an indictable offence under this Act were to proceed. That is the situation that exists in any event. My amendment extends that provision to include summary offences. It extends that provision also in relation to the committal for trial on indictable offences. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I cannot see that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy's</inline> extravagant language is justified, when one bears in mind that the situation which I have suggested should apply will apply if the position which he wants to achieve is achieved - that is, that no provision such as that contained in clause 23 (2.) will apply in respect of the more serious offences. The filter will be a filter through a senior Crown Law Officer. The rest of his extravagant statements, which have no legal validity, about palming political responsibility onto public officers to avoid political decisions showed a rather </para>
        <para class="block">Surprising and complete distraction from the way in which our law operates. I do  not  comment further about the personal abuse which was heaped on me.

This sub-clause purports to give a right to an accused person, but it seems to us to limit it. It says that he is entitled to further particulars of the conduct, the subject of the charge, but there may be other things in the charge besides the conduct. In a charge of this kind where a direction is involved, supposing the charge is that a person did not disperse after a direction had been given. He might want to dispute that a direction had been given. He might be saying: I heard no direction. I deny that a direction was given. I ask you to substantiate that it was given. Who was the policeman? Where did he give the direction?' There may be things other than his conduct coming into question. At common law he would be entitled to these particulars. </para><para>Although this provision purports to give him a right, actually it is cutting down on his rights.

The warranty states that if the person does not sign it. and send it back within 7 days he will not receive the benefit of the warranty. If I may give a little free legal advice to honourable senators: Whatever you do, do hot ever sign one of those documents because you are much better off under the common law than you are under these warranties. In England legislation is now being introduced to outlaw warranties of this kind because they cut down a person's rights. The same can be said of sub-clause (1.). If one looks at the sub-clause one might say that this is quite decent, that the Bill is giving some benefit to an accused person. A person might say that he has looked through the Bill trying to find something in its provisions that will help an accused, and at last finds something. The Crown said that there would be a balance. There have been 23 clauses in which the citizen has been knocked down, and it might be said that in the 24th clause he is being given something. We do not think he is being given anything. He would be better off under the common law and certainly he would be better off with a provision such as we have at common law, under which he would be entitled to proper particulars of the charge. If that is the law, why should we limit the provision here so that it relates only to conduct? We think that what we have proposed is a reasonable proposition. Perhaps the Government will not agree, but the Opposition considers it to be reasonable. I think the law is as I have stated it and I ask that the Government agree to the amendment that I have suggested: </para></speech>

There is no obligation upon a defendant to ask for particulars. He may be satisfied with what he believes is the case that he has to meet on the basis of the detailed information upon which he is summoned. If he is satisfied he will proceed to court and meet the charge. If, on the other hand, he wants further information he can ask for further particulars of the conduct the subject of the charge. If he does that he will be supplied with the particulars and unless he is given reasonable particulars the court is bound to say that the case against him cannot proceed.

            <para>- The only question for the court is whether the particulars supplied are reasonable. I think that is an eminently satisfactory and fair position. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy's</inline> amendment provides that, if the defendant requests full particulars of the charge, the charge will not proceed until reasonable particulars are given. If, on the other hand, the defendant asks for further particulars of the charge he must get reasonable particulars. It seems to me that this is playing with words. The character of the defendants request is for the defendant himself to determine. If he wants full particulars he will ask for them and if he wants further particulars he will ask for them. All he has to do is ask for further particulars and, until he gets reasonable particulars, the case cannot go on. I think that the point made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> proceeds upon a misconception of words. It is the character of the defendant's request with which we are concerned. It seems to me that a defendant should be able to make up his own mind whether he wants full particulars or further particulars and, because one is comprehended in the other, all he has to do is take the step of actually asking for particulars. When he asks for something he is entitled to get it. I think there is really no point of substance in the amendment proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy.</inline> The Government will oppose the amendment. </para>

          <para>-  It is regrettable to me that I have to stand up once again and put my case. The Minister has dealt with only one portion of what I put to the Committee and the portion with which he dealt was the least important part of my case. The Minister referred to the fact that my amendment seeks to substitute the word 'full' for. the word 'further'. I will go as far as to say that I think there is merit in substituting the word 'full' for the word 'further', but that was not the point of my moving this amendment. The Minister himself knows the point to which the amendment was directed. The main argument I put was in regard to the limitation as to the conduct the subject of the charge and not full particulars or further particulars of the charge. The Minister endeavoured to obscure this point. I am disturbed that at this stage of the matter he should try to misdirect my argument to a small aspect of the matter and completely ignore the important part of it. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I am prepared to take out the aspect about 'full* or 'further' particulars. What I am concerned about is why a person should not be entitled to not only particulars of the conduct charged but also particulars of the charge. The person concerned may have been charged under clause 17 of the Bill, which provides that a direction can be given to an assembly to disperse. He may say: 1 dispute that the direction was given. Who gave the direction and when was it given?' He might want to know these things. He might want to call witnesses and pursue the line that one of the ingredients of the charge against him, namely, that a direction was given and 15 minutes elapsed and he had not dispersed was not true. Why should he not be entitled to the particulars? </para>
        <para>Will the Minister address himself to the main part of the matter and not pick upon trifling aspects of it? I think it is only fan that the amendment should be dealt with on the merits of its substance and not on some less important aspect of it. </para>

        <para class="block">Murphy's response to me does raise an issue that is different from the one that I had earlier debated in response to his earlier statement, but I do not think it is a point of great distinction because, whether one puts at the heading of the charge 'full particulars of the charge' or 'further particulars of the conduct the subject of the charge', one has in any event to get reasonable particulars. If the court is put in the position of determining whether the particulars that are supplied are reasonable particulars, I for one believe that the court will do justice to the defendant by ensuring that he is not prejudiced in regard to what is relevant to the case which is before him. I know that there is a difference, slight thought it is, between the words 'conduct the subject of the charge' and the words the charge itself. It is really a lawyer's difference. However, I do not think it is a distinction of any real meaning. If there is any distinction, I think one goes to matters of law because the charge does involve matters of law which the expression 'the subject of the charge' may not involve. It appears to me that that may or may not be the valid distinction, but the important point that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> is concerned about is the language in which a request is couched. The important thing is: What would a court do if a person had not been furnished with reasonable particulars? The court would say that the charge could not proceed any further unless reasonable particulars are given.  1  think that is the safeguard which any defendant who found himself in this position would have. This is the matter which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> is concerned about. </para>

He is in effect saying that even though the rights of citizens under this provision are limited the magistrate will go beyond the provisions of this legislation and actually do what 1 am proposing should be done in the amendment. If there is nothing wrong with what I have proposed why does the Government not accept it? Why should we be putting a clause in this legislation which, on the face of it, limits the rights of defendants? The Minister said that it does not matter what is contained in the provision because the court would not be constrained by what is in it, but that it would go further. I do not think that the court would go further. I think the court would say: The Parliament of the Commonwealth has gone out of its way to limit the right of a defendant in such a matter. It has cut down his common law rights. We are going to treat that as a breaking down of the common law rights of the defendant'. If what I have proposed is proper; if it cannot be criticised in any way; if it will maintain the rights of a defendant at common law why has it not been accepted? Honourable senators opposite claim that they exercise independence and a freedom of mind. Are they going to vote against an amendment at which no criticism can be levelled and which is necessary to preserve the rights of a defendant? The Minister said that any reasonable court will go further than is provided in the legislation to maintain the rights of a citizen. I think that any reasonable legislature would also go further than that to maintain the rights of a citizen. I ask the Minister to accept what I have put forward. There is nothing wrong with it. He has not said there is anything wrong with it. Why does he not accept what I put forward? I ask him to do so. </para>

        <para class="block">Why does that provision appear in the Bill? Would not the court be entitled to do other things under the common law? Would not the court, for instance, be entitled to dismiss the charge? There is a stipulation that particulars of the conduct with which the defendant is charged must be furnished to the defendant before the court can proceed. We are concerned with the liberty of the subject. Some important procedural matters are involved here which, as far as I know, are unprecedented - certainly unusual - and which may be carried on into other legislation, as we have seen. This is a serious matter and I am concerned about it. We are not trying to do other than raise the points which we think are serious. It seems to us that if particulars are requested of the conduct charged then those particulars are supplied to the person. This is a proceeding which is commenced only with the consent of the Crown Solicitor or some such official who is designated in the Bill as amended, so it is a matter which has engaged the attention of the authorities. A request is made by the accused person who says: 'I want particulars of the conduct which is charged against me. Those particulars are supplied to the accused person by the Crown acting, honourable senators will recall, not through some minor official but only with the consent of the Crown Solicitor or the  Deputy  Crown Solicitor - those persons named in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae's</inline> amendment to the Bill. </para>
        <para>The particulars are supplied to the accused person. He is told: 'That is the conduct with which you are charged*. One would think in all reason that if they then go to the court and do not prove that charge, then the court should be entitled to dismiss the charge. Is that an unreasonable proposition? But we find in this sub-clause a proposition for that power to be taken away from the court Instead the Bill provides that if the situation occurs where, at the hearing of a charge evidence is given for the prosecution of conduct that would constitute such an offence but that conduct is different from the conduct of which particulars have been given to the person charged upon a. request the court may, on the application of the person charged and if it is of opinion that that person was misled by those particulars, adjourn the hearing upon such terms as it thinks fit, Why should not the court be able to dismiss the case, as I think it would be under the common law? Firstly we have proceedings instituted only with the consent of the  Deputy  Crown Solicitor. The accused person has asked the Crown: 'What have I done that you have charged me with?' He is told what he has done and then that is not proved at the hearing but, instead, something altogether different is proved. Why should not the court be entitled to dismiss the case? Why should the citizen be put into the situation that the only thing he can do is apply for an adjournment? The Crown pushes it on to him to apply, and if the court is satisfied that he was misled then it can adjourn the case. </para>
        <para>I would think this is like what I suggested to honourable senators about the warranty. Honourable senators opposite may think it is amusing but I do not. There are these encroachments into what I conceive to be the rights of the person before the courts of the land, especially here where we have the limitation that the proceedings can only be commenced with the consent of a high official of the Crown. We have the limitation upon the rights of the accused person. He has to ask for particulars of the charge. When they are supplied why should not the court be left in the position where it might be under the ordinary law? When a person is brought there with the consent of that high official he asks what he is charged with, he is told, and then when they come to court that is not proved against him, why should he not be entitled to ask not for an adjournment of the case but that the case be dismissed. Why should he not be left to it? I think the person would be much better off if he was left to his rights under the common law. Again I ask: Why should this Bill be used as a vehicle for this kind of whittling down of his rights? Why is it necessary? Instead, why should the court not be entitled to dismiss the charge? i spoke to Government supporters today about what the old Roman said and I think some Government supporters should give some attention to his words. It is all very nice here for the Government because the numbers are against us. There are provisions passing into the law that I for one do not think should be in the law. I have conceded that attempts to suppress dissent have not been confined to one government or any political party but that all political parties have indulged in this. I ask Government supporters what they are gaining by agreeing to provisions in clause after clause to which reasonable objection is taken and, as to the last one, to which no answer could be given, when no criticism could be made of the amendment put. Do they really think they are serving the interests of the people whom they represent? Is this really carrying out- </para>

Just because this Bill, this piece of paper, is put before them are they going to agree with it, clause after clause, even when reasonable propositions are put to them that are intended to protect the citizens? </para>

          <para>- I think that there is no whittling away of the rights of persons charged. Much of what the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> has said proceeds upon a misconception. In the first place this provision has counterparts in many other Australian statutes. I know there is a comparable provision in the Justices Act of the State of Victoria and I can refer, because I have it here, to the Summary Offences Act of the State of New South Wales. Section 21 (2) of that Act states: </para>

            <para>- I note what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has said. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> is suggesting that this is a provision which has started to appear only recently in the statutes of Australia, I say to him that he is mistaken. It certainly has been in the statutes of Victoria for many years. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> seeks to give strength to his argument by suggesting that this is novel or brings in some prescription which previously has not existed, I say that his foundation is quite inaccurate. The second point is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> has proceeded upon an erroneous basis. A defendant is not required to answer the particulars given in the charge. He is required to answer the information laid against him. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>To establish the point I am making I will give an example. If a person is charged that on the 7th May, for instance, he was guilty of an offence in that contrary to section 9 of the Public Order (Protection of Persons and Property) Bill he engaged in unreasonable obstruction, in that he blocked the passageway of a certain person, then that would be the information which he has to answer. If he is given information which suggests that be did it with a brown coloured car which had a registration number, in as so cation with a number of other people, whose car numbers also were given, and that amounted to particulars, then if the evidence disclosed that the registration number of the car was different from that which was given in the particulars, I can imagine, because I have lived with this thing over many years, that counsel for the defendant would get up and say that therefore there was a discrepancy between the particulars given in the charge and the evidence which was disclosed. </para>
        <para>I believe that in those circumstances if a person is misled it is proper for the case to be adjourned because the evidence still will disclose an offence under the information originally laid. That is the criterion which ought to apply. I think that in what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> has . said there is a casuistry which ignores the fundamentals of the proposition and I cannot see that he makes any case out of what he is arguing. </para>

            <para>- The conduct is different from the conduct of which particulars have been given. Have honourable senators ever heard anything so removed from that which the Minister stated? The provision is exactly as I indicated to the Committee. All the person charged is entitled to under this clause is the particulars of the conduct charged, not these other matters. They have nothing to do with it. The clause refers to the conduct charged against him. What the Minister has said is a mere mockery of the provision. The court ought to be entitled to dismiss the charge against the person when, after these procedures have been invoked, proceedings have been started with the consent of the Crown Solicitor, the accused has been told of the conduct for which he is charged, and the case brought to be proved against him is of different conduct not a different registration number or a different coloured car but different conduct. I ask the Committee to reject this clause because I am of the opinion that a person is better off under the common law of this land than he would be if his rights were chopped down by this provision. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MURPHY</inline>(New South WalesLeader of the Opposition) - by leave - If there is going to be a difference of opinion on the matter perhaps a few words should be said. This has been an important Bill. We have had a long day on it. My Party thinks that that is fair enough. We have not endeavoured to delay this Bill. Earlier today or yesterday we were accused by the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Greenwood)</inline> of not speaking enough on the Bill. This morning he complained bitterly that we had not spoken enough on one of the clauses. I think honourable senators will recall that during the early part of the day I was taking the initiative in suggesting that questions be put on the matter. There has been no undue delay at all. At one stage I thought we would have got through all stages of this Bill much earlier this evening. I think that the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson)</inline> and perhaps at one stage the Minister for Health both anticipated that we might have got the Bill through and attended to more Bills. But there was debate from both sides of the chamber. There were amendments from the Government side. </para>
        <para>It is now 11o'clock. This is the normal finishing time. This evening we agreed with the Government to give up the general business time after the few minutes were taken at 8 o'clock so that this Bill could be dealt with. 1 think that that was a reasonable proposition. We did not try to delay the Bill. We have agreed every time the Government wanted to bring it on. I think we have debated it intensively. But I think we have done that in a reasonable way. We have refrained from calling quite a number of divisions, sometimes not without a little criticism from some of my colleagues. But we have refrained from calling some divisions and I have taken the course of putting our opposition on the record so that nobody would be in any doubt that we had opposed the clauses and voted against them. In those circumstances I think it is fair enough that we go home. We have co-operated and we have expected co-operation. </para>

          <para>- The honourable senator says that I managed to string it out until 11 o'clock. That is not true. 1 agreed to have this matter start at 8 o'clock. If, shortly after 8 o'clock, I had said: 'Look, it is general business. We will go on with our general business', that is what would have happened. Instead, I made a proposition to the Leader of the Government in tht Senate which enabled us to have this 3-hour duration. I do not appreciate that kind of remark made by an honourable senator on the Government side. The reason why we have had this discussion has been largely due to our co-operation. I do not think that we should be forced to continue after 11 o'clock when we have had a heavy day after a succession of heavy days and we are going to have some more heavy days. My colleagues and I think it is time we stopped. </para>

          <para>- All I want to do on this clause is observe that some of the parts of the clause are valuable parts. I think it is a pity that under sub-clause (l.)(b) the Commonwealth Places (Application of laws) Act has not been dealt with in a way which would make uniform Commonwealth law in those Commonwealth places rather than having a differing application of law according to the laws of the State. However, I think that is really a subject for another day. This is a machinery provision intended to clean up some of the older features of the law. While there may be some minor objections and perhaps also some major objections to it, I think that we have dealt with those in the course of dealing with the rest of the Bill, and I do not propose to speak further on the subject. The Opposition will not oppose the clause. </para>

          <para>- In dealing with the other clause on behalf of the Opposition, I think I expressed forceful dissent against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae's</inline> amendment. Some of my colleagues thought that I may not have conveyed sufficiently by interjection that I was not accusing <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> of being involved in a conspiracy with the Government. I thought I had made it clear by interjection to him and also when the Minister was speaking that I was making no such accusation of a conspiracy. What I was suggesting rather was that the Government, not being game to put such a provision in the Bill itself, had taken advantage of the situation created by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> to do something which it had not dared to itself. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I thought I was quite explicit in saying that I thought <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> was in no way part of a frame-up but rather that his motion was being taken advantage of by a government which would not itself have dared to put the proposal forward in the Bill and in fact did not dare to do that. I hope that clarifies the matter. I think the proposition which is being introduced into the measure is a bad proposition and one which is unworthy of the Government. I am amazed that the Senate would support such a proposition - a proposition of the greatest consequence to the administration of the law - being brought in at the last moment by a back bench member. Why I say that in relation to this measure is that this is a Government measure concerned with one of its most important programmes - a campaign on law and order which it launched - yet after the long time it took to give birth to this unwelcome infant it did not dare to have an appendage in it of this nature. The Bill having passed the House of Representatives and come here, and a private member having made the proposal, it has been seized on by the Government in order to shift from its shoulders the obloquy which will naturally and properly attach to those who are in any way connected with the furtherance of prosecutions under this enactment. </para>
        <para>Consistently with what we did before and to show that we will in no way accept that the Government ought to be able to push on to the public servant the exercise of discretion in these matters - we say that the Government ought to accept the responsibility itself and that the traditional role of the Attorney-General ought to be maintained - we will vote against this clause. </para>
        <para>I am surprised that political parties and governments which talk about law and order and maintaining the best traditions of the past are constantly throwing away what is best in the past and engaging upon a process of discarding the protections of the citizens. Those who are doing it will have cause to rue the day that they commenced upon this curtailment of the rights of the citizens. Those of the extreme right, of course, welcome any measure which will do that. I think that this will be an extremely bad amendment to the Bill. The Bill was bad enough beforehand, but it will be worse. It will not be an improvement to the Bill. We have been concerned with trying to better the Bill, with trying to help the citizens. Now an amendment is proposed which is in its nature vicious. It is to take away not only the ordinary right of the citizen to invoke the rule of law and equal protection of the law, equal right to initiate the law, but also it has the effect that the limitation is not placed in the Attorney-General, a political figure who would be able to defend himself and to explain his actions. It is put into back rooms and in the hands of public servants. They are not able to come and defend their actions. They are hidden away from the public at large and can be leaned upon by the Government. I think it is a bad amendment. I regret that an attempt was made to put it in the Bill and I regret even more that the attempt has been successful. </para>

          <para>- To answer <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> I refer to what I said earlier. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy's</inline> intemperance does not make the validity of his argument any stronger. I have already indicated that were his suggestion to be accepted - that is complete deletion of any such provision - the situation would still be the same. The same officer or an officer holding a similar position would still have to make a decision in relation to the majority of offences created under this Act; that is, those which would go on indictment. The situation postulated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> is unreal and I do not intend to answer it any further. Anyone who reads this section of the Hansard report can easily refer to the earlier sections in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> made the same remarks and I replied to them in more detail. </para>

          <para>-  Clause 12 was postponed, as was clause 11, in order that the questions raised as to the tenancy rights and the other difficulties in the clause, which had not been explained by the Minister representing the Attorney-General, could be considered. We feel compelled to vote against the clause because no satisfactory explanation has been given. No endeavour has been made to amend this clause. I think it is reasonable that the amendment should have been made to protect the situations which were not concerned with public order and which could invade these other traditional rights of tenants or of other persons.

        <para class="block">It will be remembered that when this clause was before the Committee earlier today concern was stressed that, having regard to the language as it stood, the right might rest in an individual to assist in dispersing an assembly if in that assembly he saw an harassment or heard the use of insulting words to a diplomat or embassy official. I think the point was made with some cogency. As a result an amendment has been drafted. I think it brings clause 17 into line with clause 8 so that there is an equation of the circumstances in which a citizen may, on his initiative, take action to assist in the dispersal of a demonstration which is causing violence or damage to property. Those who recall the debate earlier today and the way in which the arguments were adduced will appreciate the point of this amendment and will appreciate that it does prevent any misconception arising or any basis being conceived of by a person who wants, for some purpose extraneous to the true purpose of this Bill, to take advantage of it. </para>

          <para>- We support the amendment. It is a welcome amendment. It improves the clause slightly by diminishing the opportunity for violence to be used against those who are engaging in a peaceful assembly - that is, violence by persons other than the police; persons who might be wanting to break up an assembly and who might use any excuse to do so. If the Minister had been as helpful in regard to other clauses as he has been in regard to this, we might have had a Bill which would have been generally acceptable. However, this is an improvement. The Opposition accepts the amendment. Nevertheless, we object in principle to the clause as we did to clause 8. Notwithstanding that we agree to this amendment, we would oppose the clause as it stands. </para>

            <para>-  The Opposition opposes the third reading of the Bill. We have endeavoured to make clear our objections to the Bill at some length, but not at undue length, during the course of the proceedings before the Senate and before the Committee of the Whole Senate. We simply wish to express our objection to the principle of the Bill. We say that it is an unnecessary and a bad Bill and that it takes into its scope provisions which have nothing to do with public order but which cut down the rights of the citizen in situations not associated with public order. In dealing with matters of public order, the Bill is bad because it is entirely negative in striking down the rights of the citizen and in saying what should not be done. It provides for means whereby the authorities can disperse and suppress assemblies by eroding the right to peaceful assembly. Above all, the Bill provides no protection at all that might maintain the right of freedom of speech and of peaceful assembly. Therefore, we will oppose the Bill, and we intend to divide the Senate. </para>

            <para>-  The Government does not regard the Bill as having any of the qualities which have been ascribed to it by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy.</inline> As has been stated repeatedly, this is a Bill to preserve the rights of all citizens. It is designed to preserve that basic order upon which the liberties of all citizens must depend. It is not a Bill which is an assault upon freedom of speech. It is not a Bill which denies the liberties of the subject. It is a Bill which sets down in clear language applicable to this day and age the limits to which people can go when they demonstrate. To that extent, it is a Bill which is in accordance with the times. I am sure that the Bill will facilitate what all thinking Australians want, and that is a curb on those who would make their liberties an excuse for mere licence. The Government feels that this is a Bill from which the Australian people will derive much benefit. </para>
