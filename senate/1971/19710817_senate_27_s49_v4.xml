I am deeply conscious of the honour you do me, but I am more conscious of the burden that I must bear on your behalf. Any  President  will be successful only if be obtains the respect of the Senate as did my predecessor, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alister</inline> McMullin, in his record term of office in the Senate. No  President  may have such respect unless it is earned. Such respect once obtained may be dissipated unless the laws of the Senate are impartially administered. I shall endeavour to ensure that they are. I thank you for the honour you have conferred on me. </para>

You have had a long and distinguished career as a parliamentarian. You have served the nation in the Senate as a back bench senator, as a Temporary  Chairman  of Committees, as  chairman  of Senate committees and in many ways associated with the management of this House. Throughout your parliamentary career it has been apparent to all that you have always had an overwhelming conviction that our democratic processes require dignity, devotion and application to the welfare of the nation. Firstly on behalf of the Senate, and more particularly on behalf of the coalition that I lead here, I offer you our congratulations and an absolute assurance that at all times we will give to the Chair the respect to which it is entitled and obey your commands. </para>

Our expectation is that you will be fair and impartial, that you will uphold the rights of senators and that you will use your office to promote the interests of all the people we represent. Based on our experience of you we are confident that our expectations will be realised. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> we hope that you will enjoy your tenure of this high office. We, in our way, would hope to displace you from that office as soon as we are able to re-arrange the seating in this chamber, -but while you are there  we hope that you enjoy the position. Once again, we congratulate you on your attainment of this great office. </para>

          <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> on behalf of my colleagues of the Australian Democratic Labor Party and on my own behalf I tender to you sincere congratulations on your elevation to the most exalted position of  President  of this Senate. We have no doubt about your sense of justice and fair play, or your capacity and ability, to discharge your duties with the utmost satisfaction to honourable senators and with credit to yourself. The task of presiding over any parliament is not easy, but it could be made much easier if members of parliament were more ready to recognise their obligations and duties. I do not suggest that a parliament should be altogether a hallelujah chorus. Nevertheless I believe that on too many occasions in this Parliament, and in other parliaments throughout the Commonwealth, we contribute to our own destruction so far as public prestige and respect are concerned. In our own interests and, more so, in the interests of the Parliament of which we are privileged to be members, we have a very important obligation to discharge our duties in a dignified, commonsense, adult manner and to give earnest and conscientious consideration to the matters that come before us. It is our wish, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, that</inline> you shall be long spared to occupy the position to which you have been elected today and that the Senate of this national Parliament will benefit considerably as a result of your elevation. </para>

          <para>- I should like to speak on behalf of the group sitting on the back bench in this corner. I cannot say that I am the leader of the group because we are an egalitarian group. Nevertheless, I am quite aware of what the others think about the choice of a President. We all welcome your election to that position. At the same time may I stress, now that the number in this part of the Senate has increased by 200 per cent, that the time has come when we should have more opportunity to speak in this place. I know that all occupants of the chair are impartial, but the custom has arisen that the Whips decide who shall speak next. While I was alone in this part of the chamber, I had to fight for time to speak. I always knew that on a Wednesday the Liberal Party Whip would come to me and say. &#39;Would you like to speak?&#39; I would say: &#39;Yes, I would love to speak as we are on the air.&#39; He would say: &#39;You can speak at 1 1 p.m.&#39; I think the time has come for that situation to change. </para>

            <para>- There were other times when I was offered a chance to speak, but on those occasions the Whip knew that he had no other speakers and was prepared to allow anyone to speak. Now that there are 3 of us sitting here the time has come when the Whips must realise that we constitute quite a portion of the Senate, that we cannot do our duty without an opportunity to speak, and that we have just as many rights as has anyone else in this chamber. I know that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, will</inline> uphold our right to speak and that you will call on us to speak far more frequently than the Party Whips would wish. We think that the Liberal Party nominated, a very good person for the office of  President.  We are glad to see you there. We hope that you stay there and enjoy the fruits of office. We know that you will be a very good  president. </para>

          <para>-  On behalf of my colleagues and myself I desire to extend to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Prowse</inline> our sincere congratulations on his elevation to a most important position in the Senate, that is, the position of Chair: &#34;man of Committees. The  Chairman  of Committees in any parliament carries a great responsibility for the reason that all amendments to any Bill are dealt with in the Committee stages when the  Chairman  of Committees is in charge of the proceedings. With all due respect to those who occupy the positions of  Chairman  of Committees and Temporary  Chairman  1 would . suggest that when consideration is being given or a vote is to be taken on amendments- to Bills all members of the Senate be taken into the confidence of the  Chairman  or Temporary  Chairman  and informed of what is going on. Too frequently there is a mumbled transmission- of some decision and this is not good enough. Honourable senators cannot hear what is being mumbled in the conversations and dialogue between the  Clerk  of the Parliament and the  Chairman  or vice versa. We would like to hear just what is being submitted and what amendment is being proposed to a clause of a Bill. I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Prowse</inline> that he can improve the position greatly. It is not because I suffer from any defect in my hearing. As a matter of fact I am too bright for a lot of people on my right and hear a great deal more than they would desire me to hear. Often it concerns one or other of their party and it is not always laudatory. </para>

          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">To the  President  of the Senate and members of the Parliament assembled. </para>
          <para class="block">We, the undersigned Councillors of the Shire of Shoalhaven in New South Wales, wish to bring the following matter to your attention. </para>
          <para>The Council of the Shire of Shoalhaven recently called tenders for the supply of commercial propane, and despite advertisements in the Sydney Morning Herald and the forwarding of specifications for supply to all companies who had submitted tenders in 1968, two tenders only were received, one for $59.75 per ton (for periods of either one or two years) and the other for $57.50 per lon (for one year) and $56.50 per ton (for two years). The propane is to be delivered to the plant al Nowra. </para>
          <para>The lowest tender of $56.50 per ton wa: accepted, and represents an increase of $9.28  De.  ton above the previous price. This large increase seriously affects the economics of the Gas Trading Undertaking. </para>
          <para>We are aware of the increases in wages and other associated costs with the supply and delivery of propane, and acknowledge that these factors have some bearing on the increase in cost. However, it is understood that the main cause for the high cost is the artificial shortage of liquefied Petroleum Gas created by Esso-B.H.P. exporting large tonnages of liquefied gas to Japan on long term contract, at prices in the order of $16 to $17 per ton, and more recently to South America at a similar price. Meanwhile, the current price of this type of gas from Australian Refineries is in excess of $30 per ton. </para>
          <para>When Council converted its coal gas carbon i sing plant to tempered liquefied petroleum, it was given an assurance by the Gas Department of the Local Government Department and other authorities conversant with the industry, that this byproduct from oil discovered in Australia would be plentiful and that its &#39;price should decrease, certainly not increase to the extent of over $9.00 per ton. Local Government Councils, their ratepayers and consumers have invested millions of dollars in the Gas Industry </para>
          <para>We. the Councillors of the Shire of Shoalhaven are of the strong opinion that Councils, which are dependent upon supply of liquefied Petroleum Gas, should be entitled to supplies of gas at prices similar to those applicable at present in the export of this gas to Japan and South America The home market should be granted preference over the sale of liquefied petroleum gas to overseas countries. </para>
          <para class="block"> We respectively request that this petition be referred to the Standing Committee for Primary and Secondary Industry and Trade for investigation </para>
          <para>We, your humble servants, will ever pray. </para>

Were they allowed to take photographs in the precincts of the Senate? Is not permission to take photographs in these precincts refused to other visitors, including Australian citizens?

            <para>- I address a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Industry. In the event of Britain joining the European Economic Community under the terms agreed upon at Brussels recently, resulting probably in a drastic reduction of exports of primary products from Australia to that country, is it proposed that Australia should continue to import considerable quantities of goods from the United Kingdom, or is it contemplated that these imports, as far as possible, will be placed with countries which will trade with us on a reciprocal basis? Is the Minister in a position to outline the policy to be followed in these circumstances? </para>

            <para>- I do not think that at the moment I can really offer much to the honourable senator in the way of a view that will aid him. He is canvassing areas of policy which properly belong to the Minister who administers this portfolio. I have written down the honourable senator&#39;s question. I have some views of my own, but 1 do not think they would help him a great deal. I believe that we in Australia ought to have a policy whereby we import from those countries to which we export. We should consistently follow this line. I think the honourable senator will find that we do so. In a multi-lateral trading world such as the world in which we live there will always be certain trade imbalances between one country and another. All the world&#39;s trade tends to come into balance, but there will always be adjustments. I am quite sure that the Minister and the Government will have very much, in mind the various points raised by the honourable senator, as they will affect us when the British people join the European Economic Community. </para>

          <para class="block">It is perhaps traditional that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy,</inline> as Leader of the Opposition, should commence this series of sittings with a highly loaded political question. We are accustomed to it. I suppose we have to live with it. We in Australia have our democratic processes. I do not think it would be a bad idea if we took stock of the situation and had regard to what happens in other parts of the world when it is contemplated that there should be some change of strength or some variation in the parliamentary and Cabinet system.One does not have to go very far back in history to know what has happened, or too many thousands of miles away to know what happens in other parts of the world. Some people do not seem to appreciate the system that we have. It is a Cabinet and Executive system. It makes provision for changes. I would say to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy:</inline> Let him who is without sin cast the first stone. Some of the behaviour that we have seen from the Opposition means that we who have been in government since 1949 will be in government for many years to come - a couple of decades, no doubt. </para>

            <para>- Yes, I am aware of the fact that in some countries, not all, taxation deductions arc given for the promotion of the tourist industry and for the encouragement of building programmes to accommodate tourists. The general assistance levels vary widely. Some countries do a lot: some do nothing at all. The general method of doing this is by no means uniform. I would have to refer the honourable senator&#39;s question to the responsible Minister for an answer because it is his function, not mine, to give such an answer in the finality. </para>

            <para>- I do not think I can recommend it to the Minister 1 represent but I can transmit the suggestion to him and put it to him as something that might overcome a problem with which most South Australians have been concerned. The honourable senator, when he was living in that part of South Australia, and many other senators have referred to this matter from time to time. I have given many answers about this but I think that this is a proposal which introduces a new element. I shall certainly be very pleased to communicate it to the responsible Minister. </para>

Is the house being kept vacant of Air Force personnel because of the continuing presence of the Aboriginal family? Has the Air Force been informed bv the State Housing Commission that the Commission has a civilian tenant anxious to occupy the house if the Air Force refuses to make use of it? </para>

            <para>- The house to which the honourable senator draws my attention belongs to the State Housing Commission and is made available for rental to the Royal Australian Air Force. It is true that for some time now it has been empty. I could not agree with the honourable senator that the reason given by him was the reason for the last tenant moving out. The Air Force has informed the Department of Housing, so that it can inform the State Housing Commission, that it no longer has a requirement for that house. </para>

          <para class="block">That is a valid request. I feel bound to point out that consequent upon the statement made by President Nixon the  matter  of the present international economic situation is of some concern.  I  am not aware of the decision of the Reserve Bank but I do know that the Treasurer and the Minister for Trade and Industry have issued statements which  I  commend to honourable senators. I would not like to read them now because it would take too much time but I suggest that they be read. I think that at an appropriate time the Treasurer may make a statement on this subject and it may well be that we can have a debate here. One paragraph of the Treasurer&#39;s statement issued in the last 24 hours would seem to point up the situation. He said: </para>

Albeit, the figures of unemployment across Australia are very low and, having regard to the nature of our economy and the fact that ours is a primary producing country, apart from isolated areas, they represent a state of full employment. As all honourable senators will know, matters such as this are dealt with at a Premier and Prime Minister level. If the Premier of Tasmania feels there is a special case for meeting circumstances that are peculiar to Tasmania he has the responsibility in the first instance of making representations to the Prime Minister.

        <type>miscellaneous</type>
      </debateinfo>
      <para>Even more than usually the Government has this year found it necessary to shape its Budget to serve an overriding economic purpose. Australia is in the grip of inflationary pressures&#39;. The rate of increase in costs and prices is already fast and has tended to become faster. This is a serious condition. If allowed to develop unchecked it will cause increasing economic and social hardship to many people, acid to the burdens of rural industries already depressed, disrupt developmental plans of great promise and undermine the rich possibilities of growth which our future unquestionably holds. So far as lies in out power as a government we are determined to combat this pernicious trend, slow it down and hobble it. </para>
      <para>Until last financial year, inflation had not, for almost a decade, been a matter for serious concern with us. Through a long, unbroken phase of expansion it had usually been present in some degree but it had never gained much ground. </para>
      <para>Thus, in this country, we can have strong, sustained economic growth and continuous full employment of resources with only a moderate degree of cost and price inflation. This is a vita! fact, a reassuring fact. It demonstrates that, in undertaking to bring the current more serious form of inflation under control, the Government has not embarked upon any futile task. We accept that the Government must take the lead - this we are doing - but we must have the co-operation of the community. We would be lacking in duty to ignore our responsibility or fail to take that action which lies within our hands as a government. </para>
      <para>In some respects, the last two financial years have gone along much as did the preceding years. If anything, 1969-70 was somewhat above the trend - employment rose by 4 per cent and last year employment rose by 3.7 per cent - again above the trend. In both years there was a notable further strengthening of our external payments and reserves position. This performance was achieved despite the further decline in th&#39;e overall position of the rural industries, amounting to a severe slump in the case of <inline font-style="italic">wool.</inline> This tended to offset and mask the growth of the other sectors of the economy. </para>
      <para>That having been said, it is in these two years that cost and price inflation has gathered pace. Undoubtedly, a significant part of the impetus has come from wage increases in various forms. These increases have reflected the level of demand and a willingness on the part of employers, under pressure, to pay more for labour. Apparently it has been possible to pass on increased costs, wholly or partly, in higher prices. It is probably more helpful to think of an inter-acting set of conditions than to look for a single dominating cause. But it is important to appreciate that a cost-price sequence can become a self-activating force so that cost increases lead to price increases and these to further cost increases. </para>
      <para>In general, as we see the problem, there has been and still is a powerful up thrust of costs, stemming largely though not wholly from large wage claims relentlessly pursued. </para>
      <para>There has also been and still is an over strong pressure of demand in some sectors, the effects of which spill over into other areas. Over the past couple of years, expenditure has been running very high in non-residential construction and, to a lesser extent, on the purchase and installation of capital equipment. It has also been running very high in the public sector, both Commonwealth and State. </para>
      <para>In the very big area of consumer spending there appears to have been a growing rate of increase in recent months. This is a critical area because of the massive additional call on resources there would be if consumer spending did rise more rapidly. This could be made possible by the big increase in personal disposable incomes that has occurred and by the large buildup in savings bank deposits over recent months. That it might happen is evidenced by a sharp growth in retail sales, at an annual rate of 12 per cent, between the recent March and June quarters. It is a development which we must have very much in mind in assessing the economic outlook, lt would be calamitous for a general demand-type inflationary pressure to be superimposed upon and exacerbate present cost pressures. </para>
      <para>Therefore it is essential to achieve the right rate of increase in demand through the year. It must be high enough to make possible full employment of the labour available - new labour as well as existing labour. At the same time it must not be so high as to facilitate and encourage further cost and price increases. Since, as I have said, demand has been running too high in some sectors, this indicates the need for a degree of restraint on demand. One obvious direction in which restraint should be applied is that of public authority spending in its various forms. </para>

        <title>THE EXPENDITURE PROBLEM</title>

        <type>miscellaneous</type>
      </debateinfo>
      <para>While the Budget provides for substantial increases in expenditures to meet present and high priority needs in social welfare, the rural sector and defence, the Government has nevertheless been ruthless in pruning expenditure proposals. </para>
      <para>There are, of course, large segments ot the Budget where there is relatively little scope for pruning. Moreover, a substantial increase in expenditure on many government services and activities was unavoidable because of sharply increased wages and salaries and other costs - including an extra pay-day this year. </para>
      <para>The overall increase in our expenditures would, however, have been much larger but for a determined pruning of expenditure proposals. It may be fairly said that this year has seen the most rigorous restraints on proposals for expenditure for many years. We propose to continue to exercise this restraint and we have decided to limit the growth in the numbers employed full-time under the Public Service Act to 3.1 per cent in 1971-72. To assist in controlling the growth of expenditures, we have arranged that, in future, all Commonwealth Departments will prepare for the Government&#39;s consideration expenditure estimates for a further 2 years beyond each budget year. This will clarify the longer-term implications of individual proposals in the context of the emerging overall expenditure situation and will enable the Government to act earlier in relation to developing trends. </para>
      <para>In terms of the conventional Budget presentation, total expenditure this year is estimated at $8, 833m, an increase of $728m or 9.0 per cent. This figure does not allow for the effect on inter-year comparisons of the transfer of pay-roll tax to the States. After adjusting for that factor, the increase in expenditure would be S987m or 12.2 per cent compared with the actual increase of 13.8 per cent in expenditures last year. The success of our restraints is seen in the more meaningful figures of the Commonwealth&#39;s outlays in Australia. After adjustment to remove the estimated effects of the transfer of pay-roll tax to the States, our outlays in Australia are estimated to increase by 11.7 per cent compared with the actual increase of 14.9 per cent last year. </para>

        <para class="block">Payments to the States </para>
        <para>Recent developments have led to a significant improvement in CommonwealthState financial arrangements. The new grants formula settled in June 1970 is increasing State revenues considerably. More recently the agreement to transfer pay-roll tax to the States has improved their capacity to raise their own revenues. We count that agreement as a major co-operative achievement between the two branches of Government. The present aim is that the transfer of this tax should take effect as from 1st September 1971. On that basis, the offsetting reductions in the States&#39; financial assistance grants will result in total allocations to the States from the Commonwealth Budget .increasing by only an estimated S8Sm to $2,93 l.m. </para>
        <para>In addition, . the States will receive an estimated S259m from payroll tax at the existing rate and a further estimated $90m if the rate is increased by 1. per cent as they have indicated. Thus, after allowance both for Commonwealth allocations and revenue from their new tax, the States are estimated to receive S3, 280m. an increase of $437m or 15 per cent on the comparable figure for last year. </para>
        <para>The Commonwealth will continue to impose pay-roll tax at the rate of <inline font-style="italic">2i</inline> per cent in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. .Details of the arrangements will be given when legislation lo amend the States Grants Act 1970-1971 and the Commonwealth&#39;s pay-roll tax legislation is introduced into Parliament. There are 2 aspects of particular importance. </para>
        <para>First, local government authorities will benefit by an estimated S6m this year and S8m in a full year through the Commonwealth meeting the cost of exempting the non-business  activities of such authorities from pay-roll tax as from the date of transfer.. This decision by the Commonwealth has been warmly welcomed by all local authorities. </para>
        <para>Secondly, while accepting that pay-roll tax would be a useful. &#39;addition to their revenue resources, the States emphasised that the full-year costs of the abnormally . high wage arid salary awards granted by various wage-fixing bodies to State Government employees last year would still make it very difficult for them to cope with their prospective 1971-72 budgetary situations. Accordingly, the Commonwealth agreed to pay the States special non-recurring revenue assistance of $40m this year as well as ari amount of about S22.4m associated with the transfer of the pay-roll tax. </para>
        <para>The allocations to the States include an amount of $860m for the State works and housing programme approved by the Loan Council. This amount, which includes an interest-free capital grant of nearly $210m, involves an increase of $37m or. 4.5 per cent on last year&#39;s programme. In addition, the Commonwealth makes available to the States a wide range of capital payments for specific purposes, such as roads, education and the development of resources. These payments are estimated to increase by around 1 1 per cent to S406m. </para>

        <para>Export incentive payments are expected to total S53m, industrial research and development grants $13m, net expenditure by way of subsidy to ship-building $10m and payments of petroleum search subsidy $8. 6m. </para>
        <para>In considering the amount of assistance to be provided from the Budget this year for rural industries, the Government noted that farm income in 1970-71 is estimated at about $8 10m, about $265m less than the year before. This has had an impact not merely on the producers but on rural communities generally. </para>
        <para>The Government has given high priority to measures aimed at giving support to farmers whose enterprises are basically viable, but who are burdened with an excessive amount of short-term debt or whose properties could with advantage be built up to a larger size. To finance schemes of debt reconstruction and farm build-up, an amount of $4m was paid to New South Wales last year and a further $40m is provided this year for payment to the States. </para>
        <para>Provision is also made for payment to the States of $11.5m under the marginal dairy farms reconstruction scheme. Payments last year were S3.1m. </para>

        <para>For those farmers not in a position to achieve commercial viability the&#39; Commonwealth will introduce a retraining scheme. The rural reconstruction scheme also provides for rehabilitation assistance - where this is necessary to alleviate personal hardship - to those farmers obliged to leave rural industry. </para>
        <para>The Government has given particular consideration to the position of those farmers substantially dependent on their income from wool. The collapse in wool prices during 1970 brought them to a figure as low as that ruling in 1948 when, of course, costs were much lower. </para>
        <para>The Australian Wool Commission&#39;s operations have had a stabilising effect on wool prices. As already announced by the Minister for Primary Industry, the Government will continue to support the Commission in its reserve price operations on the same basis as in the past season, subject to regular reports and review by the Commission on its purchases and buying limits. Last year the Commonwealth made available to the Commission $12m for working capital to finance purchases of wool and an arrangement was negotiated with the trading banks to provide up to $34m to the Commission for this same purpose. This latter amount is not yet fully drawn. Advances for capital purposes include a further $10m to be advanced to the Commission as working capital should this be needed. </para>
        <para>The Budget provides, in addition, $4m against a possible loss by the Commission and $3.7m towards the costs involved in handling wool included in the Price Averaging Plan. </para>
        <para>The Government has decided that producers of woo&#93; should be given additional assistance this year, and will introduce a year scheme of deficiency payments in respect of the 1971-72 wool clip. Deficiency payments will be a percentage of market realisations, calculated from time to time so as to ensure that, on average, growers receive for shorn wool - other than specified inferior types accounting for about 10 per cent of shorn wool - a return corresponding to a price for the whole clip of 36 cents a pound greasy. Under this method individual growers will retain an incentive to obtain the best possible price for their wool. The necessary legislation will be introduced as soon as practicable. </para>
        <para>Provision is made in the Budget for expenditure of $60m under this scheme in 1971-72. Some expenditure will also be involved next year in respect of wool sold towards the end of the season. </para>

The full year cost of wage and salary increases awarded in 1970-71 is estimated at $77m. Were charges to be left at their existing levels, a loss of more than $30m would be incurred this year. This would require either a substantial reduction in the Post Office capital programme, and consequently in the level of services, or a provision from the Budget much larger than our overall financial position would justify. To avoid such a loss, and to help in financing the capital programme, it is proposed to raise charges to increase Post Office receipts by about $50m in 1971-72. Details will be given by the Postmaster-General. </para>

      <para>Departmental running costs are estimated, at current levels of salaries and costs, to increase by $84m, or 15 per cent. This large increase is in part explained by the additional public service pay-day in 1971-72 which takes $16m and in part by the full-year effect of salary increases awarded last year. The Government is concerned about the rate of growth of departmental expenditure and has taken action to curtail it. It is proposed to initiate within the Government a review of the existing functions and activities of departments. It is not expected that this review, which will of necessity be spread over some months, will lead to substantial additional economies in the current financial year. In the longer term, however, the Government aims to achieve further economies which should ensure that the rate of increase in departmental expenditure is restricted to the absolute minimum consistent with the execution of Commonwealth functions of vital importance to the national welfare. </para>

      </debateinfo>
      <para>We see it as a critically important objective of our&#39; policy to combat the inflationary forces now running in our economy, and it is against this objective that I now come to explain the strategy of this Budget and our decision to raise additional revenues. </para>
      <para>Although cost increases and the price increases which follow them may be due, in the first instance, to increases in wages and other cost elements, they are without doubt stimulated and made possible by conditions of strong demand for resources. Hence, if resistance to such cost increases is to be stiffened, as it must be, there has to be a sufficient degree of restraint on potential demand for resources, particularly in those sectors where it is obviously running too high. </para>
      <para>The chief instruments available to the Government and its related authorities are the annual Budget, the effects of which are spread over the ensuing year, and monetary measures taken by the Reserve Bank in collaboration with the Government. </para>
      <para>One of the most expansive sectors of demand has been public sector expenditure, of which Commonwealth expenditure comprises a large share. Obviously, therefore, this had to be our first target, and I have described the steps we have taken to slow down the rate of increase in this source of demand. </para>
      <para>Since there will still be, within Australia, a considerable increase in Commonwealth spending, it must at least be offset by an increase in Commonwealth domestic receipts from taxation and other sources of revenue. But if, as we believe, there is need to apply a wider restraint than this and exert a steadying influence on the upward course of demand in the economy, the rise in these receipts should more than cover the increase in expenditures. In other words, there has to be a larger surplus of domestic receipts over domestic expenditures. The practical. question is how much larger this surplus ought to bc. </para>
      <para>After considering this question in depth the Government reached the view that it should seek a somewhat larger domestic surplus than the $550m envisaged . in the 1970-71 Budget. Because subsequent events added heavily to our expenditures the domestic surplus last year proved to be $460m. This was however, an adventitious result, hardly to be taken as a guide for what should be sought in 1971-72.   </para>
      <para>For some time there has been a prospect that monetary liquidity would rise excessively. From what we see now, the influences tending to produce excess liquidity could continue strongly in 1971-72. This provides a further reason for seeking to achieve a large domestic surplus. The figure we have decided upon is $630m, which is $80m more than the amount for which we budgeted last year. The relationship between the Budget and monetary conditions is discussed in some detail in Statement No. 3 attached to the Treasurer&#39;s Budget Speech. </para>

      <para>Before allowing for revenue measures which 1 will discuss later, it is estimated that total receipts this year would be $8,654m, an increase of $624m, or 7.8 per cent. However, if adjusted to allow for the transfer of pay-roll tax to the States, the figure comparable with actual receipts last year would be $8,913m, an increase of 1 1 ,0 per cent. The basis of these revenue estimates is discussed in Statement No. 5 attached to the Budget Speech. </para>
      <para>Because of cost increases, we are proposing to increase some charges. Governments are not immune to cost increases and users of government services - rather than the general taxpayer - should be required to meet these costs. However, to achieve a domestic surplus of $63 Omit is necessary for us to seek additional tax revenue in this financial year of $157m. </para>

        <para>In the present context the object of any tax increase is to moderate development of demand and that can be done either by taxes on incomes or by taxes on spending - that is, taxes levied on commodities The latter form of taxation has the drawback that it adds to prices. Taxes on incomes are more likely to be free from this consequence although it is sometimes argued that company tax increases eventually find their way into prices. On balance, the Government has decided to seek the major part of the additional revenue it needs in 1971-72 from taxes on certain company income and on personal incomes and the lesser part from increases in customs and excise duties on petroleum products and tobacco products </para>

We have concluded that the present concessional rates are no longer warranted. We propose that the rates applied to the first $10,000 of taxable income, including shading-in and special rates, be increased by 5 cents in the dollar. Friendly Society Dispensaries - which have a uniform rate of 37$ per cent - will not be affected The general public company rate of 471 per cent will therefore apply to the whole of the income of public companies other than income taxed at special rates. For private companies the rate on the first $10,000 of taxable income will be 37i per cent and the rate on the balance will remain at 42i per cent. These charges, which will apply to incomes of companies for the income year 1970-71, are estimated to yield $24m this year. </para>
        <para>A consequential change will be made to the rate on the first $10,000 of 1971-72 investment income of a superannuation fund that does not invest a sufficient proportion of its assets in public securities, as these funds are taxed at the same rates as mutual income on a life insurance company. </para>

The new scale of tax instalment deductions from wages and salaries will operate from 1st October 1971. </para>
        <para>The levy will not apply to tax calculated under the age allowance. Consequently the upper limits of the shading-in ranges of the age allowance will increase. Apart from that, it is not proposed to change the age allowance. </para>
        <para>It is proposed to liberalise certain deductions allowed to personal income taxpayers. The deductions in question relate to education, a matter to which we attach great importance, and to child adoption expenses. We propose that the maximum deduction allowable for education expenses of a dependent full-time student child be increased from $300 to $400 per annum. We also propose that education expenses will be allowable deductions in respect of such students under 25 years instead of under 21 as at present. Consistently with that, we shall increase to 25 years the age at which a student ceases to qualify as a dependant for purposes of the -dependant&#39;s allowance. Finally, it is proposed that a deduction be allowed for legal expenses and court costs of the kind normally incurred by a taxpayer in adopting a child. It is estimated that the cost to revenue of these concessions will be $405,000 this year and $6,350,000 in a full year. </para>

It has also been decided to remove the current excise exemption for condensate produced from natural casing head gas when it is used in admixture with <inline font-style="italic">motor</inline> spirit in internal combustion engines. These changes are estimated to save the revenue $1.3m in 1971-72. </para>

A charge of 50 cents, appropriate 1 1 years ago, cannot be regarded as appropriate today. Accordingly, the Government proposes to introduce legislation to increase the charge to one dollar. As a result of this change it is estimated that Commonwealth expenditure this year under the Pharmaceutical Benefits arrangements will be reduced by about $I6m. Pensioners and their dependants enrolled in the Pensioner Medical Service, who are entitled to free pharmaceutical benefits, will continue to be exempt from any charge. Special arrangements will be made for those persons enrolled in the Subsidised Health Insurance Scheme to continue to receive pharmaceutical benefits for the present contribution of 50 cents for each prescription. </para>

      </debateinfo>
      <para>Fiscal action can exercise a pervasive effect, but the Government&#39;s capacity to deal directly with inflationary pressures arising primarily from cost pressures is more limited. We have already taken some action in areas where we have power to do so and the Government has under active study various other aspects of the problem of excessive cost increases. 1 might mention, in this budget context, that the Government is considering what might be done by way of strengthening the arbitration system and, in particular, bringing more to the forefront the economic consequences of decisions which are taken within that system. When these studies have been completed, we will consider whether further measures should be taken to cope with the problem of excessive cost and price increases. </para>
      <para>Reference needs to be made to the escalating level of industrial unrest. Working days lost through industrial disputes in the first 5 months of 1971 topped the high rate of last year by nearly 25 per cent, In the past 3 years the annual loss of working days has been 1.1m, 2.0m and 2.4m. But it is not the direct losses of production and wages from this rising tide of militancy which are so disturbing as the fact that confrontations in industry are often resolved only at the cost of grossly inflationary wage settlements. The real costs to the community of such settlements dwarf the direct losses from prolonged stoppages. If the inflationary trend is to be contained, a halt will have to be called to this process. </para>
      <para>The Government will do all it can, by persuasion and example, to encourage those in the private sector who make decisions directly affecting wages and other costs, profits, and ultimately prices, to have at ali times in the forefront of their consideration the broad national interest. Let me say too that we are very conscious of the problems posed for manufacturers and other businesses by inflationary tendencies and <inline font-style="italic">of-.er</inline> economic trends. </para>
      <para>In striving to restrain the forces of inti at ion, the Government has been concerned to ensure that this Budget does not contribute to a situation where demand pressures might be superimposed upon cost pressures. There may be some who believe that we should have taken that risk and allowed demand to have its head. At least in the short term, this would have been the easier and perhaps the more popular course. But in our view it would not have been the right way nor the responsible way. We will be keeping the whole situation under very close review throughout the year so as to make any adjustments in policy which might prove to be necessary. </para>
      <para>On its own, the Budget cannot, of course, ensure that the nation&#39;s objectives are achieved. But this Budget, concerned as it is with the high national objectives of social welfare, economic strength and national security, provides (he essential framework for the attainment of these national goals. </para>

The Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson)</inline> has beaten me to it by proposing the motion for the adjournment, so I shall present the paper during the debate on the adjournment.

          <para>To be more serious, in this debate I propose to raise the disclosure of information gathered by select committees. In March 1969 <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> attempted to move the adjournment of the Senate for the purpose of discussing a matter of urgency. There was considerable resistance to the moving of the motion. It was claimed by several honourable senators that in debating as a matter of urgency the preservation and protection of the Great Barrier Reef, the honourable senator would be disclosing information thai he had received as a member of the Senate Select Committee on Off-Shore Petroleum Resources. The first reference that I want to make to the debate on whether the matter should proceed appears at volume S.40 of the Senate Hansard at page 299 where the now Minister for Civil Aviation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cotton)</inline> set out his case in opposition to the debate going on. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I pui it to the Senate that the function of select committees, in which we are engaged much more now than we have been hitherto, is a very important extension of the work of the Senate. The success of select committees is very much (he province of the whole of the Senate, not of .my one pan of it. I believe that anything which in the end tended to diminish the status of select committees or to denigrate their work would do harm to the institution which we respect and which wc hope will reach a higher status and <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> greater responsibility. </para>

            <para>A second point is that the Senate ought to recognise the difficulty into which it puts its members. Furthermore, having appointed a select committee, the Senate ought to consider whether in those circumstances the honourable senator should embark upon a discussion when it has already given to the Select Committee the obligation of making a major consideration of these matters. 1 have entered this discussion because I sense that there is here a very real problem. 1 do not know whether this matter is expressly covered by the Standing Orders, but 1 certainly ask for your ruling upon it, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President.</inline> It appears from the Standing Orders that the Committee may report at any stage, or it may report when it has completed its deliberations. If it reports when it has finished its deliberations then, according to standing order 317 the consideration of that report must be by specific motion, of which notice must be given in the usual manner. That would suggest, I submit, that if the report of the Committee were before the Senate it could not be discussed in this way. Therefore 1 ask whether it is proper for the Senate to discuss matters which are within the terms of reference. . . . </para>

            <para class="block">Obviously that refers to the Senate notice paper. I direct my attention to these two standing orders, which I suggest must be read in conjunction with standing order 64, because the Senate already has this matter under its survey, and surveillance. A Senate select committee has-been charged by the Senate with the examination of this problem. The matter appears on the notice paper. 1 suggest, that under the two standing orders I have referred to  -  I consider they must be read in conjunction with standing order 64 under which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> and his supporters have moved this motion - honourable senators opposite are out of order. I suggest that they are canvassing a matter which is before a select committee of the Senate; therefore it should not be debated on the grounds that it is anticipating a matter which at present appears on the notice paper. </para>

          <para class="block">That was the substance of the argument that was used in this place to try to prevent an honourable senator from speaking on a matter of urgency which he considered affected Queensland. These were  the  statements of responsible senators opposite. The very least that can be said for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> is that he had the courage to bring into the Senate the subject matter that he wanted to debate if the Senate would allow him to debate it, unlike other people who do not come to the Senate but who make their statements outside this place - statements based on evidence that they have received during the course of a committee inquiry. In my opinion it is a matter of privilege, but f know that I would not be upheld on a matter of privilege. To say the very least, it is a great discourtesy to the Senate for a senator to act in (his way, particularly when that senator is a  chairman  of a select committee and more particularly in view of what that senator had to say when he was attempting to stop the moving of an urgency motion by an honourable senator.

            <para>I rise to pursue a matter which has interested me since 1 had the honour, by the direction of the Senate to join a Senate select committee. That committee did me the personal honour of asking me to accept its chairmanship. Honourable senators will recollect that there was a stage where I fell into some sort of bother with one of my colleagues. A matter arose in a debate and evidence that had been given in a meeting of thai select committee was quoted in the Senate. The argument turned upon whether the evidence quoted was evidence thai <inline font-style="italic">was</inline> in the executive committee if I may use the American expression, or whether it was given in open forum. The reason why I mention this is that this was  the  stimulus that caused me to jump to my feel earlier today to take a point of order in respect of the matter raised for urgent  discussion  by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> and which has been canvassed in the Senate for the last 2J hours or 3 hours. </para>

Maybe it would be unfair to leave the  matter  there because the next day, perhaps it was. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack made a  further  statement which appeared in the West Australian&#39; of Tuesday, 20th July 1971. The heading on that article is: <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Magnus:</inline> I have been misunderstood. </para>

          <para>The  Chairman  of the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack, said yesterday thai comments he had made on the regulation of the securities industry had been misunderstood. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Magnus</inline>was referring lo reports of a Sydney speech he made last week, in which he said lii a government body to supervise securities markets would be the &#39;worst of all worlds.&#39; </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Magnus</inline>said yesterday that he was not suggesting the Federal Government had no role to p&#39;:i\ in regulation of the industry- </para>
          <para>I had in mind a situation where a Commonwealth regulator!&#39; body was superimposed on six  State  stock exchanges, a national stock exchange supervisory body, the various other self-regulatory groups and <inline font-style="italic">six</inline> fully fledged State securities and exchange commissions,&#39; he said. </para>
          <para>My  personal view, not necessarily shared by other members of my committee, is that the disadvantages inherent in such a  tangle  of regulations would out weight the advantages.   &#39;However  I was not expressing the view that the Commonwealth had no role to play in regulation.

            <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Magnus</inline>said that Governments had direct responsibilities for supervising the stock exchanges but in fact relied heavily on self-regulatory bodies. </para>
          <para>I submit to the Senate that the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack arose out of evidence gathered by the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange, lt is not sufficient for a senator, having made a statement arising out of evidence received or of which he has knowledge, to then say: &#34;But this is my personal opinion and not the opinion of the Committee&#39;. What would happen if there were 8 members of a committee who each made a statement based on evidence received and then said: &#39;This is my opinion; it is not necessarily the opinion of the other 7 members of the committee.&#39;? Where ate we heading if the Senate is disregarded and people are allowed to go out and make all sorts of statements without hindrance being placed on them? What will happen to the system of committees? As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> have said here, they will be just a waste of time. The proposition 1 put to&#34; the Senate is that at the very least <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack should clarify the position and if it is thought by the Senate that he has offended the Senate, he should be called upon to apologise to the Senate. </para>
          <para>I regret the circumstances in which I have brought this matter forward. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack was elected only today to the position of  President  of the Senate, lt was not my intention to attack him as  President  of the Senate. 1 have mentioned the dates of the statements made by him. I had made up my mind to bring this matter before the Senate long before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack was elected  President.  I know thai members of the committee on which I served were not allowed to make any statements. Advice was given to us by the  Clerk  of the Senate and the committee ruled that we would not make statements. We expected that that would be the general rule for other select committees. </para>

              <para>- You might be that dumb that you are unable to make a statement. I cannot vouch for what you have the capability of doing. I have here statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges, Senator Rae</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon.</inline> An article in the &#39;Australian&#39; comments upon the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack. That certainly was a statement designed to tell the stock exchanges to get their own body working otherwise the Commonwealth would step in and take over the supervisory side. What happened? The next day <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Cecil</inline> Looker made a statement that a national body would be formed to control the stock exchanges. They were warned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack that they should do this otherwise they might find themselves controlled by a Commonwealth committee. This is the effect of statements made outside the Committee before reports are brought down. People who will be affected by reports that are likely to be brought down are warned to put their house in order before the committee presents its report. Not only the  chairman  but also members of the committee are first in this position. If that is the way in which select committees are to carry on we will find that very few honourable senators on this side of the chamber will be willing to serve on select committees. </para>

            <para>- In relation to the matter which has been raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cant</inline> I make these observations: The Senate system of standing committees and select committees has been of fairly recent and unprecedented growth. It is true that we have had committees in the past but they have not been in such profusion and have not entered into areas which are perhaps so much a matter of public controversy as they are now. Many of the considerations to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cant</inline> has adverted were academic considerations earlier but they have become very real considerations now, as we are aware. I do not know whether the considerations and the statements of supposed principle made at various times by various honourable senators as to the proper role of members or  chairman  of committees are right but &#91; think it is fair to remind the Senate that on 19th May this year it decided to refer to the Standing Committee on Privileges the whole question of the rights and responsibilities of honourable senators and of members of the public in relation to the Senate and the proceedings of its committees. This followed, I think, a proposition which 1 had put forward some time earlier to the Senate that these matters should be clarified so one would know just what one&#39;s rights and responsibilities were. That proposal was first referred to the Senate Standing Orders Committee on 29th April. On 19th May the Senate decided to clarify these matters by having a full investigation and report by the Privileges Committee. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As far as the Opposition is concerned these matters need to be determined by that Committee. They are the subject of investigation by the Committee and we hope that as speedily as possible a report will be brought down so that everyone will be aware of the rights and responsibilities. These need not be a matter of contention; it will be simply a case of whether they have been observed. Unfortunately, at the moment it is in an area where one cannot be certain of just what are the various responsibilities. 1 think the Senate is taking the right course to nave these determined and defined. The Opposition trusts that the report which will be made will bc a definitive report on these matters, and at the end of the investigations it hopes that there will be no room for the feeling that perhaps what has been said on some earlier occasion about what was right has not been observed on some other occasion. The only way out of that situation is to clean up the matters and get a clear determination so that ever}&#39; honourable senator will know where he stands and so that noone can say: &#39;I was told on one occasion that 1 was not to do this but on some other occasion that was done.&#39; I think we all want clarification as soon as is possible. </para>

            <para>-  I want to intrude on the time of the Senate this evening to make a plea direct to the Minister for Civil Aviation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cotton)</inline> at the behest of several groups in Sydney in regard to certain plans, which to a degree have the acquiescence or the support of the Department of Civil Aviation, to create what is known as the Duffy&#39;s Forest airport. In looking at the picture in the broad sense, nobody envies the role of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> in having to make a decision on a new major airport to cater for Sydney&#39;s growing demands. Whatever decision he makes he will certainly have considerable problems in regard to conservation and the environment generally. I make this plea tonight in relation to this subsidiary airport because 1 feel that no matter how big this primary problem is, if he does not handle this secondary problem he will compound the genera) problem and some of the criticism that he realises he will face in any case. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>My story is similar to that of other New South Wales senators who are in receipt of correspondence from 2 groups. One is the Committee to Stop Duffy&#39;s Forest Airport, and the other is the Northern Beaches and Bushland Committee. For the information of interstate senators, outside the major airports most of the light aircraft traffic in Sydney operates largely from Bankstown airport. I was intrigued to be asked to say something on this subject. The Minister is aware that last year there was some agitation from people in the Blaxland and Banks electorates, of which the Bankstown airport is a feature, over certain expansion of the airport. In conversation <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> justified the expansion of the Bankstown airport by the existence of various factors, and I considered that if he had his way in that regard there was no need to proceed with the Duffy&#39;s Forest airport. </para>
          <para class="block">Those honourable senators who know the Shire of Warringah and the expanse of coastline to Newport and Palm Beach, know that it contains the Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park. It is regrettable that there has not been a full awareness of the situation by the New South Wales Government. lt should have declared that the Department of Civil Aviation was trespassing. </para>
          <para>There are unique features about this matter. I want to be fair to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton.</inline> He took with him <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Doubleday</inline> and other senior officers of the Department to meet representatives of the committees. I have received letters dated 20th July and early August which quote the dialogue that ensued. 1 will not weary the Senate unduly with these matters but it was obvious that the Department was seeking a toehold. The light aircraft expansion will go on, and obviously it will have a tremendous effect on the general recreational facilities in the area. I am not like King Canute who thought he could hold back the ocean. There is nothing to stop people with light aircraft using them from Bankstown or Camden airports. 1 do not see why we should devastate certain bushland in this other area to meet their immediate demands. 1 do not think there is any reason why they cannot drive lo the airports I have mentioned. 1 take it a little further. I know that in addition to the major decision that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> has to make, it is mooted - 1 am quoting here from what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Doubleday</inline> said to the meeting - that another 14 airports may have to be considered. I do not quarrel with that. The crux of my argument is that with orderly planning in many cases we can have our cake and eat it as well. This is the theme 1 am advancing. My eleventh hour plea to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> is illustrated by a pretty high class precedent. He would be aware that in the State of Florida in the United States of America there was massive agitation by conservationists about what a particular airport would bring about. One could probably argue about transportation to the State of Florida from other major regions in the United States of America, but the fact of the matter is that the  President  of the United States of America,  President  Nixon, vetoed the whole project. I would respectfully say to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> that, regardless of what he may have to do in regard to the major decision he has to make on the subject of the numerous deputations that have been made to him, he should ensure that the people who reside near this area of natural bushland are not subject to unnecessary disturbances from all types of aircraft. It may be that because of the position in the other corridors into Sydney it will be necessary a! times to use the corridor over this area, but we should not compound the situation.  President  Nixon&#39;s veto of one section of aviation expansion was not the death knell of the aircraft industry in the United States of America. I do not think it would be the death knell of private flying in Australia if the Minister for Civil Aviation were to put the shutters up as far as the Warringah Shire is concerned. The Minister will know that opposition to this proposal has continued to crystal i se. The Warringah Shire Council, which was a bit dazzled by the argument of the light aircraft operators, has now closed its ranks and it is strongly opposed to the proposal. </para>
          <para>I would summarise what I have been putting to the Minister in this way: The brief that I am advancing in regard to this matter tonight is, firstly, to campaign for the complete abandonment of the proposal to build an airport at Duffy&#39;s Forest; secondly, to protect the Ku-ring-gai Chase by preventing the building of an airport; and, thirdly, to campaign for the complete dedication of any of the additional land that the State Government may, in a moment of weakness, want to hand over to the light aircraft operators. 1 believe that the whole of the area should be retained for recreational purposes. I am confident that the Minister for Civil Aviation will, in the light of the other problems he has, do the right thing. </para>
          <para>Before resuming my seat, I wish to direct a very brief request to either the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Minister representing the Minister for Labour and National Service. It concerns Greg McQuade, a citizen of Sydney, who registered for national service but was not ballotted into the Army. At the age of 23 years he married a citizen of the United States of America and took up residence 6 months ago at  144  Ridge Road, Watchung, New Jersey. His brother, who happens to be a senior </para>
          <para>16261/7 <inline font-style="italic">1-S-&#91;2</inline></para>
          <para class="block">official of the theatrical employees union, was in a very agitated state when he telephoned me tonight and asked how this boy, who is an alien in the United States, could be subject to call up by the United States Army. I throw this matter into the ring for the consideration of the responsible Minister. Honourable senators are no doubt aware that problems have arisen with regard to Greek citizens returning to Greece from Australia and being confronted with a call up; but the point I want to make is that in this age of mobility in our work force there would be numerous 25-year olds who have complied with the law and registered for national service but who have not drawn a marble. It is evident that they have met their national obligations. I ask: How would such an error occur in the United States of America? I leave it at that. </para>
          <para>I am confident that the Senate will give full consideration to the first matter I have raised. In regard to the second matter. I am sure that the Government could get in touch with its diplomats in Washington and find out how the foul-up occurred in regard to this person being called up. </para>

            <para>-  J wish to reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill,</inline> who has made an eleventh hour plea at approximately 9.30 in the evening. It is not necessary for the honourable senator to make an eleventh hour plea to me about this matter nor is it necessary for him to conduct a campaign about it. I acknowledge the honourable senator&#39;s interest in this matter. He would no doubt appreciate that I have shown some interest in it, too. The Duffy&#39;s Forest position can be quite simply expressed. I think the honourable senator is entitled to know this because he has shown interest in the matter. First of all the County of Cumberland plain - the Sydney plain - is geographically a very difficult plain for airport location and development. On that plain there will be between Wollongong and Newcastle in due course <inline font-style="italic">5i</inline> million people. Some of these people will want to fly in both light and heavy aircraft. The need for airports on that plain has to be acknowledged. All that the honourable senator has said about the need for rational thinking and good coordination has actuated my reasoning since I have been involved in this matter. It is, as the honourable senator has said, a difficult matter, but it has to be approached in the fullest sense of what the community requires in total. Duffy&#39;s Forest is an area that has been thought of and proposed for light aircraft use for an expanding city aggregation - Newcastle through Sydney to Wollongong - in the years that lie ahead. It is one of the most suitable sites for that purpose. There could be others. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The proposal was first put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr John</inline> Morris in 1957. The Department of Civil Aviation was then asked to undertake a survey and it did do so. At that time the Terry Hills Progress Association supported the proposal very firmly, as did the Warringah Shire Council and quite a number of members of Parliament. The Terry Hills Progress Association is now against the move and at a series of meetings the Warringah Shire Council has itself also come out against it. lt has been said, amongst other things, that the area presents an interesting ecology and should be preserved as parkland for the expanding city of Sydney, lt is perfectly true that there is a great public claim for this. It has been said that it is a natural paradise for certain birds and animals and that if it were to be intruded upon in any way the natural fauna would either disappear or diminish. That is possibly true. It has been said that it is the last area of wiannamatta shale in the County of Cumberland plain. I have a geological map of the area, which I will show to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> because of his interest. It appears to me from the map that it is certainly not the last area of wiannamatta shale. </para>
          <para>I turn now to what I have done in regard to this matter. I have twice been out and looked at the area. I did this something like 6 or 7 months ago. I have flown over it once in a light aircraft in order to see what it is like from the air. It appears to me to have certain advantages and certain disadvantages from an aviation point of view. However, the area has to be considered in the full community sense. We have to decide what should be done, not only in the interests of the community in the area but also in the interests of Sydney as a whole because it provides parkland area for a population much greater than that now living alongside it. I have received two deputations, one from a large number of people. I have also talked to all the responsible people who are against the airport proposal. I have seen the Honourable W. C. Wentworth and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harry</inline> Turner and I propose to see the members of the New South Wales Parliament who indicate that they want to discuss the matter with me. In fairness to everybody concerned - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> would be the first to concede this point - I think I should also see, and I will see, the people who want an airport in the area. Included in those people will be <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Morris,</inline> Captain Young, who is the  President  of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Apperly,</inline> the Federal Secretary of the Association of Commercial Flying Organisations at Bankstown Airport and the  President  of the Royal Aero Club. I am in honour bound to see all of those people. However, what I would like to say at this stage - it is probably as much as I can say - is that the people involved have my sympathy and understanding and I will do everything possible I can. </para>
          <para>Having looked at the area and seen the people who are against the proposal, I made the clear decision that the whole matter should be thoroughly investigated and that any action to proceed further should be suspended until the facts are known. That is precisely the course I am pursuing and I think it will be agreed that that is as much as I can do at the present time. But I want to express the following reservation: If we are to prevent flying because this area should be retained as a natural parkland for the people of Sydney then that is what it must be. I would not want later on to see some scheme put forward for the sub-division of this land for development purposes. I am just being careful, that is all. </para>

            <para>- What 1 have to say is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson)</inline> who, unfortunately, does not appear to be present at the moment. I hope that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> will direct my remarks to his attention tomorrow morning, I object to the Senate having insufficient business before it to deal with early in the session and, when there is business before it to deal with, clamouring to rise at all sorts of odd hours. This afternoon we had the swearing in of new honourable senators. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">This was followed by a number of routine matters, including the election of yourself, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> and a meeting with the Governor-General. I appreciate that these ceremonials have to be carried out. The Senate resumed after the meeting with the Governor-General and for approximately 45 minutes it transacted formal business. The rest of the time until the dinner break was then given over to questions without notice. When the Senate resumed tonight to hear the Budget Speech question time was disposed of without the opinion of the Senate being sought. </para>
          <para>At the beginning of every session there seems to be a tendency - I am referring now to members of the Government parties - to adopt a lacks ada is i cal attitude to legislation. The claim is that Bills are not brought into this chamber in time and they cannot be dealt with. For the first 6 weeks of any session we have a tendency to have a picnic. We like to rise early in the evening on Thursday and to start as late as pas sib le on Tuesday. Probably for 3 weeks of every session we find that we have a fairly even pattern of work with fairly full days and then in the last week or 10 days of the session we are expected to work extremely long hours to the point of physical exhaustion. </para>
          <para>T do not say that this situation occurred during the last session because the only time the Government attempted to do that a Government supporter crossed the floor to vote with the Opposition and another Government supporter threatened to cross the floor if the Government tried to do this again. This appears to be an attempt at evasion of responsibility by the Government, lt probably occurs in another place, too, but I refer to it specifically in this chamber. We find that questions are not answered or they are answered only after a lengthy lapse of time. In a few moments I propose to make further reference to this situation. </para>
          <para>Let us look at the sitting times since 1968. In 1968 we met for the autumn session on 12th March and rose on 13th June. We had a 2-month recess. We resumed again for the Budget session on 13th August and rose on 28th November, giving us approximately - I am using round figures - a 3-month recess. In 1969 we commenced the autumn session on 25th </para>
          <para class="block">February and rose on 4th June. That is one of the longest sessions we have ever had. Then we had a 24-month recess before resuming for the Budget session on 12th August 1969. On 26th September- a little over a month later - Parliament adjourned. But we did have that famous pilgrimage to Canberra on 25th November to comply with certain sections of the Constitution. Then we had 5 months away from the bush capital. </para>
          <para>In 1970 we resumed on 3rd March and rose on 18th June. On 18th August we met for the Budget session and we rose on 4th November. We had approximately a 3- month break before coming back on 1 6th February to sit until 20th May. Today we have resumed the session after an absence from this city of 24 months. During this period of time Ministers ought to be able to supervise their departments and make sure that questions which are left unanswered at the end of the session receive proper attention and that answers to all questions are available as soon as we resume sitting. Not only can we not receive the answers but the Government is not allowing us the time to ask questions. </para>
          <para>Some of the questions are of great importance. I want to quote a few of them because I think that they are relevant to the matter to which I am addressing myself. On 1st October 1970 - almost a year ago - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> asked the then Attorney-General - that is about 3 Attorneys-General ?go: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>What has been the total amount of legal fees paid to lawyers in private practice for work done on behalf of the Attorney-General&#39;s Department . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The honourable senator then nominated a period of several years. To date he has not received a reply to that question. </para>
          <para>To the half dozen examples which I am going to cite, some answers may have been given privately. They should not be given privately unless they are given publicly on the first day of the session. I have received private answers to questions but I have elected to ask them publicly. I think this is the way that the matter ought to be done. There should not be any hole-in-the-corner attitude in the hope that the matter will not receive a public airing. The 3rd November 1970 is a long time ago too. lt is 2 Prime Ministers back anyway. On that date <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> asked the Minister for Civil Aviation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cotton):</inline></para>

          <para>Two of the 3 questions which 1 proposed to ask without notice today would be very embarrassing for Ministers to answer, and certainly it is embarrassing for me to have to ask them. But tomorrow the proceedings of the Senate will be broadcast, and those 3 questions - and most probably another 3 - will be asked. Also I have 9 replies to questions on notice to be given. I was denied the right to ask those questions today; so tomorrow while we are on the air I propose to ask each of the 9 questions. Some of the replies that have been received can only be embarrassing to the Government. Those replies will be given while the proceedings are on the air and not, as they would have been today, only recorded in Hansard for the Press to report if it so wished or for people who read Hansard to be made aware of what is happening. I am seriously suggesting that if the Government continues with this attitude through this Budget session then it ought to call it off and have an election so that some form of democracy can be returned to Australia. </para>

            <para>-  I think it is desirable that I speak before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson, who also rose to get the call, because I wish to speak on the same subject as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe.</inline> I notified our Whip earlier in the night, and other members of my Caucus earlier  in  the week, of my intention to speak on the adjournment debate tonight because I knew that as soon as the Budget Speech was read the adjournment of the Senate would be proposed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> has said most of what I desire to say. I am opposed  to  the fact that on every occasion on which  the  adjournment of the Senate is moved we carry the motion unanimously and  go  home. This is all very  well when  we have  no  business  to  deal with, but  it  is not well when we have business to transact. lt would not be correct to g&#60;&#62;in  at  impression from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe&#39;s</inline> remarks that we have insufficient business before us at the beginning of the session. That is not so. We have so much business before us that we could never get through it. There are 10 items under General Business, which is the only heading under which anyone other than the Government itself can bring matters before the Senate. We represent our various States, and we have a right to bring proposals before the Senate. We have 10 items on the notice paper under General Business which we could discuss and possibly resolve tonight if there was not the desire to adjourn the Senate. </para>

          <para>This has concerned me. Honourable senators who have been in the Senate as long as I have will know that my concern during the 9 years that I have been here has been to protect individual senators against attempts to encroach upon the rights they have always held. This campaign has gone on continuously until today, when the Leader of the Government in the Senate has placed items under General Business on the notice paper to do the very thing that I have been warning honourable senators about for some time. Item No. 4 under General Business is in the name of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson. He proposes to move: </para>

          <para>That is an attempt to cut down on the rights of honourable senators when they need time to explain a question. This matter will come up for debate. I do not want to anticipate the debate: so I will leave the matter there. I only wish to say that the argument will be advanced - I have learnt this from other sources - that this move is necessary to deal with more business because we are dealing with insufficient business in this Senate. Of course we are getting through insufficient business, because we are running home all the time. The present proposal is to adjourn at 4 p.m. on Thursday. </para>

              <para>- Our inability to deal fully with items on the notice paper is used as an excuse to restrict the rights of honourable senators. I can visualise this subject being discussed when we are considering the report of the Standing Orders Committee, and I shall raise this point on that occasion. We have the mistaken idea that the Senate sits only for the purpose of considering Government Business except on 1 night of the week. This is an entirely erroneous idea. The Senate sits for the purpose of discussing all business on the notice paper, no matter where it originates. All we do is agree that General Business shall take precedence over Government Business on 1 night of the week. The business that we propose has precedence on that 1 night. If the Government has no business to deal with on the first day of the session and wants to move the adjournment at 9.30 p.m., it is proper that we should bring on for discussion one of the items of General Business. But this is never proposed. If it suits the Government to adjourn, all those items under General Business are neglected. It seems to be a sacred practice that these matters should not be brought on other than on a Thursday night. </para>

          <para>My whole complaint is that while it may be desirable for the Government and while it may suit a number of people to go home early on more frequent occasions, the effect is to encroach upon the rights of honourable senators. That should never be entertained. We have seen the destruction of the scope of debate in the other chamber by alteration of its Standing Orders. Let us not leave this chamber with honourable senators at a greater disadvantage than they were when we first arrived in this place and with the privileges we have enjoyed during our term of office reduced. </para>

            <para>- I desire to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> on the matters they have brought before the Senate tonight. On examining the unanswered questions on the notice paper I find that on 7th April this year I asked, questions in relation to actions which, it was implied, could be taken against the trade union movement of this country because certain trade unions, as of right, held a ballot among their own members for the purpose of deciding whether they would amalgamate. On that date <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kane</inline> asked a question in some detail. It seemed to indicate that there was something radically wrong with trade unions wanting to amalgamate because they had common interests. The amalgamation referred to was based on a ballot of members of the unions concerned. lt was implied in the question that some great monolithic organisation was to be created in this country, under the control of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, by virtue of the proposed amalgamation. So I immediately asked questions in relation to the amalgamation of certain commercial interests in this country, including banking institutions. I asked where they stood in relation to this matter and if, as was implied in the question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kane,</inline> the Commonwealth Government could interfere in the decisions of unions made democratically by the rank and file, why did it not or could it not equally interfere in the amalgamations of these great monolithic organisations, such as the banks and other companies that have amalgamated not only with organisations in this country but also with overseas organisations. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>None of these questions has been answered by the Government, lt has had a very long time to get to the kernel of the questions that were asked on that day. 1 suggest that, had I not asked those questions following the question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kane</inline> on that day, we would have had an answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kane&#39;s</inline> question telling the people of Australia how terrible the trade union movement was because it carried out a democratic ballot among its members in order to amalgamate certain organisations and how terrible it was that finances would be amalgamated to fight the cause of the workers in this country. No doubt that was a leading question which would have been answered in kind. But, because I was able to follow that question with similar questions in relation to amalgamations by big business, neither <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kane</inline> nor 1 have received an answer. </para>
          <para>If that is the kind of thing that is to occur in this chamber, we will have a situation in which it will be useless for members of the Opposition to ask any question of any Minister unless it relates to a portfolio that is held by a Minister in this chamber. We become dizzy in trying to find out who holds which portfolio. We become dizzy in trying to find out which Minister in the Senate represents which Minister in another place. The situation is that if questions are not answered more expeditiously by the Ministers concerned in another place it will be completely useless for us to ask questions of importance. </para>
          <para>There is a matter that concerns me greatly. 1 desired to ask the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs about it today, but I was denied that right because question time was curtailed. I understand that now I will have to wait until tomorrow to find out whether 1 can receive an answer to the question I wish to ask. I will bet my bottom dollar that I will not receive an answer to it for at least 3 months. What I want to know is: What is Australia prepared to do to help the Pitcairn Islanders who are virtually isolated on a small island in the Pacific Ocean and ships will not go there and supply them with food and other requirements because the French Government is carrying out nuclear weapons trials in that area? The situation is that a group of people who have a great heritage - their ancestors were in the mutiny on the &#39;Bounty&#39; and they are proud of the fact that on that occasion their ancestors were able to fight and get some kind of freedom - is now in an isolated corner of the Pacific without any prospects of receiving supplies because the Australian Government has not taken strong enough action at an international level to ensure that the nuclear tests which the French have carried out over a period of time are discontinued. Because of the nuclear tests ships will no longer visit the area to supply the essential goods of life to these people. 1 know that the population of this small Pacific island has dwindled to only 85. I wanted to ask a question about this earlier today because 1 believe this is tremendously important. This population of only 85 people- the very old and the very young - has no possible future of being able to continue living on the island. Australia has a vested interest in this matter because I understand that the Norfolk Island Council has offered these people a life on Norfolk Island where they will be able to join their sisters, brothers, cousins and uncles. However some assistance will be required of the Australian Government. Norfolk Island is a mandated Territory of Australia and these people are not only physically incapable of transferring themselves to Norfolk Island but they are also financially incapable of doing so. The Australian Government should give a lead to ensure that these people do not starve because some international power wants to exercise its rights to carry out nuclear tests which are designed to destroy and not to enable human beings to survive. </para>
          <para>I believe that the processes of this House should be utilised, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> and Cavanagh indicated, to permit senators to express their views when they want and not when the Government decides to let them do so. It is a denial of democracy when the Government cuts across our Standing Orders and the principles that have been established and shortens the period allowed for question time. Probing questions would have been asked today on other political matters which certainly would have embarrassed the Government. I believe this is one of the major reasons why senators were denied the right to continue asking questions earlier today. I hope that the procedure which was adopted today will not be pursued in the future because there are many people in Australia who want democracy to operate as it should operate and not as the Government believes is best for this country. </para>

            <para>(10.8)  -  In reply - I want to expose a piece of complete nonsense, and I refer to comments made in relation to the sittings of the Senate. It is provided that the Senate shall sit on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays and, unless otherwise ordered, the time for rising on Thursday nights shall be 10.30, allowing for adjournment debates which can go on ad infinitum after that time. Anyone who says that there is some machiavellian plot for the Senate to adjourn at 4 p.m. on Thursday has either a fertile imagination or has been listening at the wrong keyholes. When it is suggested that persons in the Army are listening at wrong keyholes, I know the keyholes at which they usually listen. Having said that, it is my intention that the Senate will continue sitting until 10.30 on Thursday night. I have already indicated this to the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy).</inline> The next matter was one which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> started. </para>

          <para class="block">I have not finished yet. The honourable senator likes to have a go, but when the weight is applied to him he hops around. The fact of the matter is that for the last 20 years we have not had question time on the days of swearing in ceremonies. The draft procedures were circulated accordingly on my instructions, based on what has happened even before I came here, and I have been here for 18 years. Only this morning the Leader of the Opposition said to me: &#39;Look, we would like to have questions today.&#39; I said to him: &#39;If there is a feeling that you would like to have question time today, we can have it when we return here after the ceremony, and that could continue until the dinner adjournment.&#39; I had in mind that the Budget would come on at 8 o&#39;clock, as it has done for the last 57 years. These are the facts of life and any suggestion that there was a deep scheme to bury questions that we did not want to be asked or answered today is sheer nonsense. </para>
          <para>As Leader of the Government in the Senate I have given up trying to meet the wishes of the majority in this chamber.

              <para>- I am making my speech now. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> has had his go. I am not impressed by his threats. Through you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> that in the majority of cases he has sought to have his questions asked and answered in full, as is his right. I do not deny that. If questions take a long time tomorrow, well, that is tomorrow. It was unfortunate today that despite the accommodation 1 gave at the instigation of the Leader of the Opposition, question time ran for only about 17 minutes, give or take half a minute. That was not in my thinking. I envisaged that question time would last for about three quarters of an hour, which is the average length of question time. A series of petitions was presented, which took a little longer than usual, and there were a few other minor matters to be disposed of. I emphasise that the practice adopted today is contrary to the usual procedure. It was adopted in the spirit in which the Leader of the Opposition and I usually operate in an attempt to accommodate the requirements of the Senate. It comes a little hard at 10 o&#39;clock at night, when this issue started, to have hurled at mc that I am a great plotter who is seeking to destroy the rights of honourable senators opposite. Goodness me. I could have stood on my dignity today and forced a vote on the issue and I would have had the numbers to support my viewpoint. </para>

          <para class="block">Very well. Having disposed of the matter about question time today and having disposed of the prospect of the Senate rising at 4 o&#39;clock on Thursday, I now want to come to the next proposition which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> raised, which was that we had been in recess for so long between the last sessional period and the current one, and that we should be ready to go now. We are ready to go, and let us face it, we will be going until December. This statement that nothing has been done between the time when we rose in May and 17th August denies the fact that during the recess <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> and many other honourable senators have worked tremendously hard in many ways. </para>
          <para>I have called for and received information concerning the silting of committees. I will select four or five committees at random from the list which the  Clerk  of the Senate has given me. In the week commencing 26th July the Senate Standing Orders Committee sat on 1 day and the Senate Regulations and Ordinances Committee sat on 1 day. In the week commencing 2nd August the Senate Select Committee on Off-shore Petroleum Resources met on 2 days and the Senate </para>
          <para class="block">Select Committee on Securities and Exchange met on 3 days. In the week commencing 19th July the Securities and Exchange Committee met on 2 days. In the week commencing 16th August the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Science and the Arts and the Senate Privileges Committee have met. Other committees also are meeting this week, but that does not affect the argument I am submitting. In the week commencing 9th August the Securities and Exchange Committee met on 10th. 11th and 12th August. Work is going on. </para>
          <para>If we are to have this committee system - and honourable senators opposite are as keen to have it as are honourable senators on my side of the chamber, and we have reached agreement on it - we will have many committees meeting. I do not want to canvass other matters which are contained in the report of the Standing Orders Committee, but the simple facts of life are that we will be confronted with a situation where we will have to exercise some self discipline in our plenary sessions of the Senate in order to be able to do the work involved in these committees which we ourselves have set up. I am not a gambling man, I am a very strict Presbyterian, but I will bet 20c, at any rate, that what I predict will come true, and it will come true during this session. Honourable senators opposite, as well as honourable senators on my side of the chamber, will experience great difficulty in finding time to carry out the tremendous amount of work which is unquestionably being done by the Senate committees. </para>
          <para>I come to the next matter raised which referred to the response to questions. I look at the Senate notice paper today and see the questions on notice, which would have been disposed of if we had had time. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> had a point of grievance today. I see that his name appears on 9 occasions. I have explained the circumstances in which these questions on notice were not disposed of today. I say to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> that it is not really fair for him to be directing his criticism in the way that he has. I provided the opportunity for question time today to accommodate a request from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe&#39;s</inline> Leader, and I did so against the background of what has happened in the last 20 years. To criticise me for that is, I think, out of kilter and I regret that such criticism has been made. In regard to the matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> concerning replies to questions on notice, I will certainly raise with the Ministers in the Senate and with the Ministers in the other place any instances in which my attention is directed to questions in respect of which there has been inordinate delay in providing answers. I will use my good offices to see that answers are given as quickly as possible. </para>
