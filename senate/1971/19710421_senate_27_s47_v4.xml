            <para>-  I preface my question, which is addressed to the Minister for Health, by referring to a report of an interview wilh the Minister published today in the &#39;Age&#39; newspaper. This report stated that the Minister refused to give an undertaking that the present gap between the most common fee for normal general practitioner services and the rebate received by contributors to medical insurance funds would not be increased. J ask: In view of the fact that the then Prime Minister gave an election undertaking in 1969 that, this gap would be maintained &#34;at 80c for a surgery visit and $1.20 for a home visit, will the Minister now give an assurance that this promise will be honoured and the gap will not be widened during the term of this Government? </para>

            <para>- The Government will make a determination in relation to the national health&#39; scheme after a decision has been made by the medical profession as to what will be the fees charged to patients, and therefore what will be the common or adjusted fees in the national health scheme. The. Government will have before it in effect 3 alternatives: Firstly, there could be an increase in the Commonwealth&#39;s benefit in support of the benefits which the funds subscribe; secondly, there could be an increase in contributors&#39; rates to the funds so that the funds could increase their benefit; or, thirdly, there could be an increase in the gap which is called the patient gap. 1 am not in a position at this moment to say which of those alternatives will be adopted but the matter will be considered in the light of what the increase is when it is finally determined. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Industry or to the Acting Minister for Primary Industry. In view of the abysmally low prices now being paid for mutton in Australian stock markets, has the Australian Meat Board or have the Commissioners of the Department of Trade and Industry reported any recent success in promoting sales of mutton in India or Pakistan? Considering that Australian mutton is the cheapest available source of protein, will the aforementioned agencies increase their efforts to dispose of Australian surplus mutton in these nearby markets? </para>

            <para>- I completely agree with the honourable senator when he says that India and Pakistan offer opportunities for the disposal of surplus Australian mutton. I know from my own experience that for some time quite conscious efforts have been made to build a market in Pakistan and equally that very solid efforts have been made, particularly out of Western Australia, to build a market in the Middle East for surplus mutton. I cannot go beyond that at the present time. I would take . great interest in finding out for the honourable senator the latest developments and - also the latest steps that axe being taken. I am sure that the Trade Commissioners in those 2 countries are alive tq the opportunities. This is one of the things I would expect them to be doing. I will find out for the honourable senator and let him know as soon as I can. </para>

            <para>- I ask the Minister, representing the Minister for the Interior to inform the Senate, and me in particular; whether the Minister for the Interior was stating the Government&#39;s policy when, as reported in today&#39;s edition of the &#39;Canberra Times&#39;, he said that he was unsympathetic to poker machines&#34;, known in the past as one armed bandits-, being introduced into the Australian Capital Territory. If he was not enunciating the Government&#39;s policy, I ask the Minister to tell the Senate when we can expect to hear the attitude of the Government on this question. As one who is vitally opposed to the operations of these machines in the Australian Capital Territory I am most anxious to know the Government&#39;s views on this matter. </para>

            <para>- For a moment I was extremely concerned at the word beginning with &#39;b&#39; following &#39;one armed&#39; in the honourable senator&#39;s question. I was not sure what he was going to come out with, but in the end it was clear that his concern was well demonstrated. I come from a State where the one armed bandits are running high, wide and strong. I do not know the personal view of the Minister for the Interior on this question and I have not had the advantage of reading in the Canberra Times&#39; the report which purports to state his view. I shall certainly find out the position. I take the honourable senator&#39;s point that he is personally opposed to the introduction of these machines - &#39;nefarious&#39; in brackets - in the Australian Capital Territory. </para>

            <para>-  I address my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Labour and National Service. Has consideration been given to varying the composition of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to include jurists, economists and businessmen to ensure that more detailed attention is given to the vital relationship of wage levels to productivity? Is it not a fact that the present emphasis on capacity to pay, as one of the major criteria in wage determinations, leads to undue increases in the prices of essential commodities with resultant continuation and aggravation of the cost spiral? </para>

            <para>- I remind the honourable senator that in the judgment in the national wage case given in December last the Arbitration Commission emphasised that it has regard to the effect of its decisions in resolving disputes involving the public interest; that is to say, the national economy. Opinions will vary as to the judgment that was made in that respect, despite the inclusion of the words to which 1 have referred. There will be an ever continuing debate as to the appropriate conclusion to be drawn, whether from the point of view of the national economy or of productivity. As to the first part of the honourable senator&#39;s question, he can be assured that on several occasions, and almost as a continuing matter, consideration is being given to any improvement that can be made in the arbitral system in Australia, including the matters to which the honourable senator specifically referred. </para>

            <para>-  I accept what the honourable senator says, but I say quite clearly that I need no urging from him to evoke sympathy for the situation of single ex-service women with regard to repatriation benefits of which war service homes assistance is one. The honourable senator&#39;s question refers to the provision in the War Service Homes Act which entitles an ex-service woman to the benefit of the Act only for her own housing accommodation or that of dependants. That is a criterion that has been in the Act, I think, since its origin. Having regard to the demands made under the Act, it has not been considered possible up to date to extend the benefit for ex-service women. But I am grateful to the honourable senator for the reminder. It will ensure that the matter will have specific consideration, as he suggests. </para>

            <para>- My  question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. In view of the evidence of continuing inflation provided by the consumer price index figures for the March quarter and of the Prime Minister&#39;s failure to enunciate any policies to cope with the problem, does the Minister agree that we are entitled to assume either that the Prime Minister intends to inflate his way through an early election or that his reputation as a Treasurer was grossly inflated? </para>

              <para>- I will never be that. Coming now to the matter of substance, shall we say, in relation to the consumer price index, the first point to make is that the  1.1  per cent increase in the index for the March quarter, as compared with the  1.9  per cent increase for the December quarter, very properly should not be interpreted as indicating any genuine falling off in the rate of price increases. Allowance has to be made for certain special factors affecting the comparison between the 2 quarters in particular. In short, the percentage increase in prices could be regarded as much the same as for both quarters. I think this is a factual observation. The latest figures, therefore, provide no grounds for complacency especially when we bear in mind that the full effect on prices of the national wage decision has not yet been completely felt. In terms of policy implications 2 broad observations can be made. On the one hand the Government decision to avoid panic measures but to put in hand a broadly based programme of action against inflation can be seen to be fully justified. On the other hand these latest figures underline the need for a firm anti-inflationary policy to be maintained in the period ahead. I think that is the best reply T can give to the politically loaded question that I was asked. </para>

            <para>- The honourable senator has asked me a question in 3 parts: What effect has the stewards&#39; strike on the Australian National Line&#39;s operations in the profitability sense? What effect will it have on Tasmanian freights? What effect will it have on overseas shipping freights? I am sure it will be bound to have an adverse effect on the whole scene, but to what extent I cannot say. There was a comment in this morning&#39;s paper which I read and which stated that the ANL could be endangered if the strike continued. I think that I should address the honourable senator&#39;s question to the Minister responsible and obtain details for him of the precise amounts which the Minister can give me. </para>

Does the Minister agree with this view? If he does not, will he take the earliest means to correct the ignorance of this gentleman and those who support his view by making it clear that it is both the duty and .the responsibility of a parliament worthy of the name to take all possible steps to ensure the maintenance and promotion of international trade especially when the so-called leaders of a particular industry so clearly demonstrate that they are ; apparently not competent to do so.  &#62; </para>

            <para>- I think the question of wheat trade with China is a matter which has interested many sections of the community, and many people have had a lot to say &#39; on the subject. I think also that the Senate should be aware of the fact that at no time has an official Chinese source stated that it was not going to take any more Australian wheat. Furthermore. I think it should be made clear that at no time has any official Chinese source said that the recognition of China is a prerequisite for trade with that country. At all times there has been no dearth of mischievous people who have endeavoured to make political capital out of the question of recognition of Red China. If their purpose has been to disrupt trade with that country and intensify difficulties for primary industries then it does appear as though some of them have been successful. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Price,</inline> because of this background, has made this statement. I have not seen the full text. </para>

As a matter of customs control live fish and the spawn of fish are prohibited imports in terms of Item 23, Second Schedule, Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations and may not be <inline font-style="italic">im-.</inline> ported without the. written permission of the Minister for Customs and Excise. Permission to import is given only when the advisory committee  on the importation of live aquarium .fish recommends approval. The committee consists of- State fisheries and Department of Primary Industry representatives. On the advice of the committee 4 species of piranhas are prohibited and permission for their importation is not given. The Department has investigated earlier claims that these fish are in Australia, but these claims have not been substantiated.&#39; Information regarding possible attempts to smuggle prohibited species of fish into Australia has also been circulated to Collectors of Customs. There is no known record of any person receiving approval to import a piranha. </para>

            <para>- My question is addressed to the Minister for Health. Are some patients currently being charged a standard fee based on costs submitted in July 1970 to his departmental advisers who compile the common fee schedules? Is it not true that the schedules list a fee which is described as the common fee but which is far below the actual most common fee for some of these services? Will the Minister make clear, for the benefit of those patients affected, that the common fee schedule does not necessarily list the most common fee and, indeed, in some cases lists only a fictitious figure arrived at by some undisclosed means by advisers who have taken no steps since July 1970 to make themselves conversant with the facts by checking with the specialists concerned other than by the procedure of inadequate departmental correspondence? </para>

            <para>- I think it should be recognised that the common fee, which is the basis of the Government&#39;s medical benefits scheme, is the fee which was commonly charged at the time when the National Health Act was brought into operation in the middle of 1970. It is not to be regarded as an average fee and it is not to be supposed that every doctor charges the common fee. The expression common fee&#39; has been used because it is the fee commonly charged. There will always be instances of specialists or general practitioners who, for a variety of reasons, depart from the common fee. Some charge less than the common fee; others charge more than the common fee. I think it is incumbent upon patients, as far as they can, to ascertain what is the fee which their doctor charges. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>If the doctor charges more than the common fee then the combined Commonwealth benefit and fund benefit under the insurance scheme will mean that the patient gap, which has to be borne by the patient, will be larger than that which is specified in the schedules of the National Health Act. I hope that that explanation will be of assistance to the honourable senator in answer to the question that he asks. If there is any aspect which has not been covered, I ask him to put that aspect of the question on notice. </para>

            <para>-  I bring to mind the question to which the honourable senator refers. The answer lb <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Byrne&#39;s</inline> question was a long answer, very deliberately given, lt showed how of those men who were included in the ballot some were called up, some were rejected after medical examination, and the others were winnowed down to a very small number of recalcitrants and defaulters. By far the greater number of those were persons who had not been identified and had not been traced. Of the very small number who actually were proved to have deliberately resisted their obligations, there were a number of prosecutions  -  I think they were of the order of about 100  -  a number of convictions, and a very small number  -  I think it did not reach double figures - of men who were penalised by imprisonment. It is necessary to have all those categories in mind before any credence whatever is given to the highly specious claim implied in the honourable senator&#39;s question that there is discrimination against the very few in the administration of the law. Those very few have attracted the penalty of the law, and they have got it. </para>

            <para>-] do not believe that there is profit for anybody in industrial stoppages or disputes. In the end both sides suffer and nobody is any better off. I have always believed this. Naturally I have a great concern to see that, if possible, industrial stoppages are not held or, if they are held, that they are reduced to a minimum. Therefore I have a very great concern about industrial stoppages. I think the position in relation to Tasmania is very difficult. Tasmania is very much dependent upon sea communication. The position must be very difficult for Tasmanians. Beyond that, I have no detailed knowledge of the position, but I shall endeavour to ascertain the facts and to do what I can to help in a situation which, I repeat, has no profit in it for anybody. </para>

Tt is true that traditionally, as I said yesterday, all matters of revenue, taxation and the incidence and application of those matters are considered at Budget time. I am aware of some of the angles that the honourable senator mentioned about Commonwealth and State estate duties. I am not aware of that in relation to my impending demise but because, in an honorary capacity, I have acted for people in the handling of estates. I will have the question referred to the Treasurer. 1 can promise no more than that. </para>

I understand that the Soviet Union is supplying arms and personnel to Ceylon in response to a request from the Government of Ceylon to meet an immediate insurgency threat. Other countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States of America, India and Australia, have also been approached for various kinds of assistance. The Soviet Union and India are the only countries so far which have provided personnel. In the case of the Soviet Union it was because it is unlikely that Ceylon could have provided personnel who were trained to use Soviet equipment. </para>

          <para class="block">With your permission, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I shall answer the question. In fairness I think it should be made clear that frequently honourable senators on both sides of the chamber - that includes <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly&#39;s</inline> side - have indicated to a Minister that they will ask a question in a certain direction. Without naming any honourable senator I can look about me and see in the chamber honourable senators who have adopted that procedure. That is the first point. The second point is that I speak in the name of the Prime Minister and for the other Ministers whom I represent in this chamber. In fact, in my capacity as Leader of the Government in the Senate 1 could be asked questions in relation to any one of the 26 portfolios. Of necessity I try - I hope I am doing the right thing - to anticipate something that may be asked of me so that I can give a comprehensive reply.

Is it a tribute to the magnificent work of the Australian Wheat Board that the current year&#39;s sales are of record dimensions without sales to China and reflect a great widening of the market? </para>

            <para>-  I think the short answer is yes. The honourable senator has more or less provided his own answer to the question. The Senate will recall that in the late 1950s and early 1960s all the wheat bins throughout Australia were full and a lot of the wheat was being eaten by weevils. We obtained a market quickly. This year we have been able to make sales all over the world and to sell sufficient wheat to give us an estimated carry-over of well below 200 million bushels without sales to China. </para>

Ltd town on Groote Eylandt, some 450 miles east of Darwin, there are about 800 European workers and 1,200 Aboriginals but no doctor? Has the company said that it will not help in this regard, claiming that it is the Government&#39;s business to supply medical services, with the consequence that workers or their families have to fly to Darwin at a cost of $35 each way to obtain medical treatment? Will the Minister consider this matter in the context that there could be urgent cases which could not be dealt with quickly because the Royal Flying Doctor Service does not cover the area? Will he inquire whether it is a fact that, by contrast, Gove which is run by Alcoa of Australia Ltd has a population of 2,500 people and 2 doctors? Will the Minister see what can be done to remedy the position? </para>

            <para>- I certainly shall inquire, because the Leader of the Opposition has asked me to inquire, into the facts that he has related. I must say, however, that I have had occasion to examine this matter in recent times because others have raised similar questions relating to the adequacy of medical services on Groote Eylandt. It is true that there is no resident doctor on Groote Eylandt but there is a regular visiting doctor who flies in, I think, every 6 weeks and stays for a period of days. A doctor can be brought in and, in fact, is brought in, when emergencies arise. When the doctor is not there a nursing service is available. 1 state these things because they are known to me. They go part of the way towards meeting the problem which exists in many parts of the Northern Territory where there are developing industries and where medical facilities are not keeping pace with them. However, I shall look further into the matter as the Leader of the Opposition has asked me to do, and I shall give him such information as I am able to obtain. </para>

            <para>-  I direct my question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Notwithstanding a very comprehensive reply I received from the Prime Minister outlining the Commonwealth Government&#39;s interpretation of the status of Australian citizens under the new United Kingdom Immigration Bill, will the Minister now say that the recent action of Enoch Powell in having a British parliamentary committee delete the pat rial clause makes much of the Prime Minister&#39;s advice null and void? Can we have a further assurance that the Australian High Commissioner in London will maintain close liaison with the United Kingdom Home Secretary and request retention of the pat rial clause. In the event of refusal, will the Australian Government review its present policy of preference to Britain in regard to trade and other agreements? </para>

I ask: ls it a fact that the Director-General of Civil Aviation has recently asked Qantas, as reported in the Press, to examine a proposal that Qantas should operate a subsidiary charter company? If so, what is the result of that request? What decision, if any, has been made by the Government on the application by Ansett Airlines of Australia to operate international charter flights, and on the application by World Airways inc., a representative of which recently saw the Minister in connection with charter services between the United States and Australia? </para>

            <para>- It is not correct that the Director-General of Civil Aviation ha? asked Qantas to set up some type of subsidiary operation of charter flights, lt is correct that he drew the attention of Qantas to a proposal by British Overseas Airways Corporation to do something along those lines. Qantas has had thai information from the Department for some weeks now. Of course, Qantas would have been aware of the proposal. The report that BOAC intends to take that action is certainly not easy to establish as being fully accurate. I have been waiting to hear more about it. We are receiving rather conflicting reports. There have been newspaper reports that the Ansett group would like to operate charter flights out of Australia. The view of myself and my Department would be that the Ansett organisation is a domestic operator as part of our 2- airline policy and therefore has a fail a mount to do in this country. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> also referred to an application by World Airways lnc. lt is still under consideration by me and my Department and an early answer to the application can be expected. </para>

I am also aware that the reasons why these vaccines and antibiotics failed to pass the tests are set out in the annual report of the Director-General of Health, lt is the Government&#39;s policy not to publish the results of tests of the products of an individual manufacturer. This policy also applies to products manufactured by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories because it produces in competition. Any potency failures have been discussed with the manufacturers concerned and I understand that they have taken steps to remedy the situation. </para>

            <para>- My question, which I direct to the Minister representing the Minister for Labour and National Service, concerns question No. 978 standing in my name on the notice paper. That question, which I asked 5 weeks ago, relates to the judgments of courts in Victoria and Western Australia on cases involving conscientious objection to national service. In view of the length of time since those judgments were given and since I placed my question on the notice paper, and as I have subsequently directed another question on this subject to the Minister, will he now indicate to me the likely date upon which an answer will be given? Would it not be reasonable to assume in view of the circumstances and the length of time which has elapsed that the Government is reluctant to answer my question? </para>

I regret very much that his question has not been answered. It was asked on 16th March. I shall bring the matter to the notice of the Minister for Labour and National Service with the honourable senators specific request, supported by my own. that an early answer be provided. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Labour and National Service. I preface it by asking him whether he is aware that most young men who obtain deferment of national service call-up in order to complete university and other higher education courses are called up immediately they fail an end of year examination - frequently through no fault of their own - and after 2 years national service a high percentage do not resume their studies. Can the Minister advise whether the Government is prepared to examine a scheme whereby such young students can be given greater latitude in their endeavours to complete their studies, or alternatively, in appropriate cases can call-up be deferred indefinitely? </para>

            <para>-  I certainly agree with the honourable senator that the subject to which he refers is worthy of real consideration. I do not affirm the procedure that he ascribes to the Department; neither do I deny it. But I know that there is an area of difficulty: with regard to the continuance of deferment in the case of students who have failed at some stage of their university course. I shall certainly have pleasure in bringing the matter to the notice of the Minister for Labour and National Service. </para>

I draw attention to the problem of ascertaining how much time remains for the giving of notice of motion for disallowance, whether of regulations or of ordinances, and also of ascertaining how much time has run since a notice has been given - the time factor being important in that if it is not dealt with within 15 sitting days the regulation or ordinance is automatically disallowed. I ask you whether you will refer to the Standing Orders Committee the question whether these times should be shown on the notice paper for the convenience of all honourable senators. </para>

            <para>- Will the Minister representing the Treasurer explain to this chamber whether Bourkes Melbourne Pty Ltd, as a company in the retail business in Melbourne, and. the Australian Council of Trade Unions; as a partner entitled to a share of net profits from the company&#39;s business operations, are liable to pay income tax? If the ACTU does not pay tax does this create any aspect of unfair competition as between taxpaying retail companies and a business partially or wholly operated by the ACTU? </para>

            <para>- The honourable senator will be aware that the Prime Minister made an announcement a very short time ago that the Government intended to introduce legislation to amend the Trade Practices Act to take account of the practice known as resale price maintenance. I can assure the honourable senator, as 1 can assure&#39; all honourable senators, that when (he Prime Minister promises that something will be done it shall be done. In support of that promise is the record of this Government over the last 20 years. I am quite confident that this legislation will be introduced in the near future and I trust that the Opposition will lend its support lb an&#39; early passage of the Bill. </para>

            <para>- I shall have to look at that question because 1 am not fully aware of all the details involved. I should like the honourable senator to come and see me and to explain to me what he has in mind. There was a drop in production in Victoria and I know that extra quotas were issued. But that is not the point that the honourable senator is raising at the present time. </para>

          <para>The survey of 10,000 migrants will not cover persons already in Australia. The plan is to select a representative cross-section from all settler arrivals during a coming twelve-month period. In this way, the 10,000 migrants will represent, for example, the pattern of nationalities, the geographical distribution, and the occupational categories included in the actual migrant intake during this period. The survey will follow their economic and social integration during their first 3 years of residence. It is the object of the survey to test basic assumptions about the pattern of immigration and to obtain data by which to improve further immigration procedures. </para>

          <para>Is a person, called up for national service under the National Service Act, upon discharge eligible for repatriation benefits while a person who voluntarily joins the Army for a 3-year period is not entitled to such benefits upon discharge, despite having served in a theatre of war? If so, why? </para>
          <para class="block">Sentaor DRAKE-BROCKMAN- The Minister for Repatriation has provided the following answer to the honourable senator&#39;s question: </para>
          <para>Both discharged national servicemen and members of the Regular Army are eligible for repatriation benefits under the same conditions, provided they served on special service in a special area as defined in the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act I note that on 30th March the honourable senator addressed a question without notice to the Minister representing me in the Senate. That question was related to the allied subject of rehabilitation services and, in this regard, it is advised that certain rehabilitation benefits are provided for discharged national servicemen under the Defence (Re-establishment) Act, including the provision of vocational training and re-establishment loans, which come under my administration. Such benefits are restricted to discharged national servicemen, whether or not they served in a theatre of war. The provision is made because of the involuntary interruption to normal life suffered by national servicemen, in contrast to voluntary enlistees in the defence forces who have chosen the regular forces as a career or an alternative to some civil occupation. In certain circumstances, members of the regular forces may be eligible for training under the services vocational and educational training schemes which are administered by the appropriate Service departments. </para>

            <para>If the honourable senator has in mind the special classes established in the community for the instruction of Greek children in Greek language and Greek culture, I can inform him that no Commonwealth funds are being expended for this purpose. The honourable senator will be of course aware that children of Greek origin are included amongst the migrant children who receive special instruction in the English language under the child migrant education programme. Already this financial year the Commonwealth has committed under this programme payments to State Education Departments and the independent school authorities of some $1.4m dollars for the salaries of special teachers and the provision of equipment for classrooms. Separately the Commonwealth is meeting the cost of training courses for teachers and the provision of teaching and learning materials. </para>

          <para class="block">Because of the circumscription of time, I propose to address myself primarily to that aspect of our motion which deals with child endowment. My colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Little,</inline> who will support this motion at a later stage, will address himself more particularly to the other aspects of the motion dealing with maternity allowances, home savings grants and the other matter that comes within the terms of the motion. This is the third urgency motion which has been moved by the Democratic Labour Party in the last few weeks. These have been a coordinated programme of presentation to the Senate for consideration of aspects of Government policy that we think require urgent and particular attention. The first motion dealt with the urgent need to review the level of so cal service payments in relation to pensioners. The second motion dealt with the position of those in receipt of income from private superannuation schemes and those who receive their sole source of income from fixed investments. Both those motions were supported by the Opposition and were carried. </para>
          <para>This is the third of a trilogy of such motions, on this occasion dealing with child endowment and the other ancillary matters. We move these motions because this is the period in which the Government is considering what propositions will be embodied in the Budget. We feel that it is the appropriate and most effective way for our Party and for the Senate to register concern about these areas which we feel particularly require urgent and adequate Government attention. These areas have included social service payments and the position of people on fixed incomes from superannuation. We now include the position in respect of child endowment. At least it could be said for the first group whom we attempted to assist that following our motion the Government did move and that at least pensioners . are articulate in that they have organisations which can present their case. Pensioner organisations can wait on Ministers and, through their own organs in publicity, can present the case for social service recipients. Certain people are in a position to speak for the participants of private superannuation schemes and those on fixed incomes. Those people are associated with bodies which can speak on their behalf. </para>
          <para>Who speaks on behalf of the parents of large families which are vulnerable to the ebb and flow of the economic circumstances of this nation? Nobody speaks for them. By the nature of things they are not organised. They have no organisation to express their point of view or to present propositions on their behalf. Parents who have to look after large families have no opportunity to join organisations or, in many cases, to try to- present their position to the authorities so that the authorities will do something to rectify the position. These people fall within a totally unrepresented section of the community. Other groups have their representatives. The Returned Services League looks after the interests of returned servicemen; the taxpayer associations look after the interests of taxpayers; the Australian Medical Association looks after the interests of medical practitioners; and the trade unions look after the interests of their members insofar as wages are concerned. All these people are in a position to seek at any time professional help to protect their economic position, but who speaks for the large families in this community? Nobody, unless the parliamentarians speak for them. </para>
          <para>It is most proper that speeches of this nature should be registered in this place at this time. It is not without significance that, because nobody speaks for these people, they are the ones who have received the least consideration of all in the community. While wages have increased repeatedly at the instance of arbitration tribunals as a result of the representations of employee organisations and while there have been reductions in taxation - no doubt as a result of representations by the taxpayer associations and organisations which are looking after the interests of taxpayers, there has been no variation in the level of child endowment payments since 1967. The speech which I am making could well be spelt out by the sheer brutality of statistics, but time does not permit a lengthy recitation of statistics in this field, telling and all as they are. Nevertheless, the figures which are available spell out a most deplorable story. They spell out a story which completely justifies the very strong terms which I have used in the motion which I have moved on behalf of the Australian Democratic Labor Party. A section of the motion refers to the culpable neglect of the Commonwealth Government in allowing child endowment rates to deteriorate. T believe that the use of the expression &#39;culpable neglect&#39; is completely justified. If one takes into consideration the fact that there has been a grave erosion in the value of money; that this erosion has been going on year after year; that steps have been taken in all other sections of the Community to hedge and to buttress against the effects of this erosion; and that there is one group in the community that is completely at the will and mercy of the government of the day and has not had any steps taken on its behalf for 4 years to alleviate its position one will agree that the use of the expression &#39;culpable neglect&#39; is completely and totally justified. </para>
          <para>What is the position of the larger families in our community? It would be easy for me to recite in general terms that their position is bad, but I think it is proper that I should, on an occasion like this, cite authority. 1 cite authority which has been cited in this place in other contexts on many occasions, but it is authority which has brought its work substantially up to date. I refer to the survey which was conducted by the Institute of Applied Economic Research of the University of Melbourne. The results of this survey were reported in a paper presented on 26th January 1969. This document is one of the many reference papers which have been published on the subject of poverty in Australia. I wish to quote a few excerpts from it to show that there is irrefutable evidence, as a result of expert technical investigation, that the large family group is one group which is a victim of the current inflation and that it is a group which is providing one of the gross and grave areas of poverty in our community. The objective of the survey was to discover who were the poorest people and in what ways help could be most efficiently given. A line was drawn arbitrarily at a level equal to $33 a week for a family of a man and his wife and 2 children - this was in 1969 - and anything below that line constituted poverty and anything less than 20 per cent above it constituted marginal poverty. The paper slates: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Of the fairly large group of large families 8.5 per cent were poor and 13.7 per cent only marginally above the poverty line on our index. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That was found to be the position of one of the most worth while groups of citizens in our community, the large families with the little children, in the city of Melbourne. lt is quite obvious that there are pockets of poverty in our community. This survey found that 8.5 per cent of such families were in poverty and 13.7 per cent were only marginally above the level of sheer poverty, being Jess than 20 per cent above the poverty level. The paper continues: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Large Families . . . arc often in lnc marginal category just above our austere poverty line, so that measuring by adjusted income after payment of cost of housing 28.5 per cent were either poor or marginal.  ft is important, therefore, to assess the circumstances of these people. The paper states that many children are growing up in acute poverty. It is a matter of national scandal that this position, which was registered before 1969 by the Institute in its analysis and reiterated as late as 1969, should have been allowed for one second to go on without governmental attention, yet more than 4 years have passed - certainly 2 years have passed since this document was published in 1969 - without any action being taken to rectify the tragic position of this group of citizens. The paper went on to report: </para>
            <para>The obvious remedy for poverty among large families is an increase in rates of. child endowment. Child endowment payments have not been increased as fast as incomes have risen in Australia in recent years. In 1950-51 they constituted 1.28 per cent of gross national expenditure; by 1968-69 they will be about 0.74 per cent of gross national expenditure. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">There has been a tragic deterioration in the relativity of child endowment to gross national expenditure. The figures which are available spell this out in many ways. In an answer which he gave in May 1969 the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth)</inline> related this figure to average weekly earnings. It has shown that in 1949 child endowment represented 2.6 per cent of the average national earnings, but by 1970 it had dropped to 0.7 per cent. In other words, child endowment has become virtually a worthless contribution towards the assistance, succour and welfare of families of this nature, but nothing has been done about the matter. </para>
          <para>The Australian Democratic Labor Party has elevated into the forefront of its social thinking the position of our young people and of the mothers and fathers who have the responsibility of protecting and rearing our young people and making them good citizens. My Party has over a number of years - by resolutions at its federal conferences, by the presentation in this place in 1966 of a Bill designed to increase the child endowment rates and by an annual amendment to the motion for the presentation of the Budget papers - constantly waged a campaign to have this matter receive the particular attention of the Government, but my Party has not been successful since 1967 in persuading the Government to&#39; increase child endowment rates. I would say that the position has become totally indefensible. That is why the Democratic Labor Party has raised it as one of the trilogy of matters requiring urgent Government attention at this time. </para>
          <para>My Party is alerting the Government, to the concern that it has in this area. It is alerting the Government at a time when the Government is in a position to survey the whole economic and financial range of its administration and to determine what shall be the sources and amounts of its revenue and what shall be the destination of its expenditure in the coming Budget. This is the time when cases of concern such as this should &#39; be presented to those who have the responsibility of framing the Budget. The Democratic Labor Party expects its propositions, particularly this proposition, to be taken into consideration by the Government when it is considering Australia&#39;s financial future, as expressed in the annual statement of accounts, and it will look forward with keen anticipation to whether the Government will be finally able to discover some solicitude for this area of want and drastic need in the community because, as I have already said, these people have nobody to speak for them. </para>
          <para>Surely the greatest contribution to the building of a nation must be the welfare of its young people. Vast sums have been spent by Australia on immigration. The figures represent something of this character: Taking 1964-65 as a base year, the annual expenditure for immigration was about S38m. By 1970-71 the amount had reached S77m. In that period there has been virtually a 100 per cent increase in the national financial appropriation for immigration but only about a 16 per cent increase in the appropriation for child endowment. Where do we put the accent in this country? However worth while it may be to bring new citizens, including children, from other countries do we give them priority in national concern over the creation of a growing national population from our own physical resources? Surely we should be encouraging large families, not merely because they will provide men and women in this community but also because of the very grave social and economic consequences if we do not do it. </para>
          <para>If families are living in conditions of want, the physical and dietary deprivation of the children concerned is not the only matter involved. There are very serious social consequences. Investigations have established that children from such homes do not have the same social and economic opportunities as do children from other homes. They do not attend technical colleges in the same number. Instead, they tend to provide the unskilled work force of the community. A nation in our position, a nation that today has not a big population, must rely in an increasing degree upon the application of technology, through technicians and tradesmen, to the mechanical aids that a modern society has. We, above all .nations, therefore, should be training and recruiting young technologists and technicians. We are depriving ourselves of this opportunity by keeping in want and need the families from which so many such young technicians can come, and the social and economic consequences of that can be very serious. </para>
          <para>We regard this as a most important matter. We can see no means of assisting these people unless through the goodwill of the Government. We press upon the Government that at this time it should set out to assist in the Budget this growing area of need. We can do no more. We have tried by a private member&#39;s Bill; we have tried by motions and amendments to Bills, and we now are trying by means of this urgency motion to impress upon the Government the seriousness of the position and the seriousness of our concern. We expect to get the support of all sections in the Senate in this matter. We expect as we believe we are entitled to expect, to get the support of the Australian Labor Party. If the Senate supports this motion which we now present as a matter of urgency, it will then go before the Government as the definitive parliamentary opinion of the majority of the citizens of Australia. Even if the Government cannot find it in its heart to support this motion, at least if the Opposition and perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turnbull</inline> support it we would represent the majority of thought of the Australian people, and surely a government must have some regard for that. We know no other way in which we can persuade the Government of the seriousness of the position or the depth of our concern. </para>
          <para>We point out to the Government that a great number of families in Australia comprise the 8.5 per cent, if that is the national average, which is living in poverty. There are 333,000 families which have 3 or more children. If the 8.5 per cent is applied to the 333,000 families it will be seen that probably 30,000 Australian families of 3 or more children are living in poverty or are below the poverty line. This is a matter of national disgrace. It must not be permitted to continue. If the Government in framing its Budget, fails to make some provision for those people it will deserve, and will certainly attract, the condemnation of the whole of the Australian nation. There is nothing more tragic than poverty in the midst of affluence. Where poverty is shared by all, the position is not so bad but where there is property in the midst of affluence there is always a tendency not to notice it, to take for granted that there is no such thing as poverty. That is the position in which so many Australian people find themselves. </para>
          <para>I commend this motion to honourable senators. As I have said, my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Little,</inline> will discuss the other aspects of it relating to maternity allowance, homes savings grants and the consolidation of child endowment. All of these things are important. All of these things are necessary. All of these things will make easier the lives of young married couples in rearing their children and will enhance the future prospects of the progeny of the marriage. A young nation must have regard to its young. The strength of a nation depends ultimately upon the vitality of its people and the coming of little children in sufficient numbers to regenerate the nation. France and other great nations have always found that to be the case. If we cannot arrive at a consciousness of our responsibility in this field then the nation has lost its sense of national perspective. It will be not only a continuing in jus ice to the people concerned; it will be not only a continuing deprivation of the nation of the services of young people; it will be more than that: ft will be an undermining of the whole future, stability and structure of an incipient great Australian nation. That is something we cannot afford to do. That is something to which neither the Government, the Opposition nor anyone else can afford to be a party. That is the challenge which lies before us today. It will be a grievous disappointment if this motion does not receive the enthusiastic and overwhelming support of all honourable senators. 1 commend it to this chamber hoping that it will attract such support. </para>

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline> on behalf of the Australian Democratic Labor Party has moved a mott on to the effect that the Senate at its rising adjourn until tomorrow at 10.55 a.m. for the purpose of debating, as he stated, a matter of urgency. He has alleged a comprehensive matter of urgency. He states that there has been culpable neglect by the Commonwealth Government in allowing child endowment rates to deteriorate in real value. He makes a similar allegation about maternity allowances. He claims that the Commonwealth Government should have introduced a system of capitalisation of child endowment payments similar to that which operates in New Zealand and then, for good measure, he suggests that the Government should have up-dated the amount of assistance given under the homes savings grant scheme. He has delivered himself in a somewhat unusual way of a tirade which suggests that these are the most momentous matters which could ever confront government. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>He said that unless the Government did what he was urging it would be undermining the whole stability and structure of incipient Australian growth. They are fine words but I think they are a little out of perspective. The Democratic Labor Party has claimed at election times to be a Party of responsibility. I have no doubt that in one sense it has been a Party of responsibility. lt has always allocated its preferences to support this Government in office and to prevent the Australian Labor Party ever moving to the Treasury bench. That, I think, is the greatest claim of the Democratic Labor Party to responsibility in the eyes of the Australian nation. A proposition of the kind which has been put forward today can be put forward only by a party which has no responsibility in terms of the allocation of the nation&#39;s financial resources. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline> did not tell us the cost of the various proposals he urged. We did not hear from him any indication of the present expense to the nation&#39;s purse of the provisions which the Government is putting forward. When we consider the various proposals which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline> said, with some pride, the Democratic Labor Party has brought forward as matters of urgency and attempt to assess the cost of all that has been proposed, we find that the Democratic Labor Party would have absolutely no money left to give to another area where it is urging constantly that more money should be spent, namely, the area of defence. </para>
          <para>The Federal Government has the responsibility given to it constantly by the electorate of Australia to determine the priorities among the various demands upon it for expenditure. I suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne,</inline> if he examined the record, could not sustain the allegation that there has been culpable neglect on the part of the Federal Government so far as child endowment rates are concerned. I suggest that he could not sustain the general proposition he was making - that the Government has been lacking in that responsibility to the family, to young people and to those who are in poverty. </para>
          <para>I noted that Sent or Byrne referred to the Henderson report, a publication put out some little time ago by the Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research at the University of Melbourne. But the difficulty in placing reliance upon the Henderson report, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline> sought to do, is the very arbitrariness of the definition of poverty. The Institute, in that report, assumed that a standard family consisting of a man, his wife, a son aged from 6 to 14 years and a daughter aged under 5 years, with an income equal to the basic wage together with child endowment, was likely to be in poverty. This sum, at June 1966  -  of course, the research now is fairly old - was $32.20. For the purpose of the survey it was assumed that an income of $33 a week for such a family would not be an unrealistic figure to use as a poverty line. It must be emphasised that that figure was chosen arbitrarily and that no actual assessment was made as to the needs of individuals and families of different composition or size. I submit that it would not be possible to make a fair and realistic assessment in the light of the subjective nature of what constitutes needs. </para>
          <para>I think that point always is relevant in an assessment of poverty. One can find people in very meagre circumstances as far as emoluments and remuneration coming into the house are concerned who it can be said are not in poverty because they have a richness of life which destroys any idea that they are living poorly. Then you will find those people who have a sum of money coming into the house which, if prudently exercised and spent, would enable them to meet all the exigencies of life, but who because of their way of dealing with funds are really poor people. There is this element of subjective ness, this element of quality of life which must be taken into account together with material circumstances in determining what is poverty. </para>
          <para>The other point I make with respect to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne&#39;s</inline> reference to the Henderson report concerns what Professor Henderson himself recommended with regard to child endowment. In the book People in Poverty&#39; - actually it was his report - he wrote that the obvious remedy for poverty in large families is an increase in child endowment rates. He proposed rates in respect of children under 16 years of age. They were as follows: For the first child,  Si  a week - at the moment it is 50c; for the second child, $1.50 a week, whereas at the moment it is $1; for the third child $3.50 a week, whereas at the present time it is  Si  -SO; for the fourth and subsequent children $4.50 per week for each child, whereas for the fourth child the present rate is $1.75, increasing to $3.25 a week for the tenth child. </para>

              <para>- One cannot say what Professor Henderson would do. Any assumption that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Little</inline> makes must be regarded merely as an assertion because one can go only on what the learned professor writes. The point is - this is why J cited what he said - that on the statistics available to us the additional cost of implementing that proposal would be $185m a year. It was also made on the assumption, as appears in that book, that all the concessional taxation deductions for children should be abolished. All these factors have to be considered. The cost of the child endowment provision which the Government made available in the last financial year was $220m. If you add $185m to $220m you get more than $400m as the amount payable for child endowment alone. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I pose this question rhetorically: Where will the Democratic Labor Party find the $200m which it wanted for its pension increases and the many hundreds of millions of dollars increase which it wants in defence expenditure? These are matters of real moment to a government which has the responsibility. Obviously they are matters of no moment to a party which consists of 5 members in the entire Parliament and which has no responsibility for determining how moneys are to be spent. I feel these considerations must be borne in mind in determining whether there can be this grandiose recognition which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline> is claiming. </para>

              <para>- I put to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline> that over the years the Federal Government has recognised a social responsibility. It has recognised it in a variety of ways and it will continue to exercise that same social responsibility. If one takes child endowment as an example, it was the first government headed by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies which introduced child endowment as a Federal social service. After the government headed by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies assumed office in 1949-50 it made the first change to the rates of child endowment, notwithstanding that the Australian Labor Party said that it could not be done. There have been progressive changes over the years since then. The first change I mention was in June 1950 when endowment at the rate of 50c a week became payable for the first or only child under 16 years of age. The payment of $1 a week continued for the second child and subsequent children. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The second change I mention occurred in 1964 when the rate for the third child and subsequent children in a family was increased by 50c to $1.50 a week. At the same time the rate of endowment for children who were in institutions was increased to $1.50 a week. In 1967 endowment rates were further increased by 25c a week for the fourth child and subsequent children. The rate for the fourth child was increased to $1.75 a week, and so on. I gave the figures a short time ago. Now one finds that a very real benefit is provided for families or for the mother of a large family in terms of the remuneration received. Of course, it increases progressively. Where there are 2 children in the family the amount received is a mere $1.50 a week, but when there are 8 children in the family the amount received is $14.25 a week. If there are 9 in the family it is $17.25 a week, and if there are 10 children it is $20.50. </para>

              <para>
                <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Little</inline>may regard that as miserly assistance. What I am endeavouring to point out is that the Government has been conscious of the need to give consideration to these child endowment rates and it has done so. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para class="block">The important point I make is that the situation in which child endowment originally was introduced is not the situation prevailing today. In 1941 when child endowment was introduced the situation was, as the Government said, that the family unit was the cornerstone of national life and the key to our national progress. It was necessary in the national interest therefore to ensure that some substantial proportion of family income was not affected by seasonal or intermittent unemployment. That social objective was met partly by child endowment. </para>
          <para>Certainly the situation with regard to the family unit being a cornerstone of national life and the key. to our national progress is as true now as it was then. At present we have a full employment economy and we do not have the . vagaries of unemployment which existed when child endowment was introduced. People now have the ability to earn large and real incomes. They can therefore better provide for their families than could parents raising children in the latter part of the 1930s and the early war years. Many other factors have been introduced which change the whole pattern of our social fabric, contrasting the present position with that which prevailed when child endowment was introduced. For example, there is a variety of aids, benefits and concessions which are designed to make an easier task of bringing up a family. Child, endowment is only one of those concessions. </para>
          <para>I  remind honourable senators that income tax deductions for children have been substantially increased since 1949-50 Of course, they bear no relationship to the position which prevailed in 1940. Concessional deductions are allowable for all children under the age of 16 years and for students up to the age of 21 years. I also remind honourable senators of the concessional deductions allowable to a taxpayer in respect of his spouse, a daughter housekeeper, student children, invalid relatives, parents., subscriptions to hospital and medical benefit insurance funds, medical and dental expenses, funeral expenses and education expenses. Each of those deductions represents government assistance in ways other than child endowment. </para>
          <para>I think the approach of the Australian Democratic Labor Party would certainly have been fairer had it referred to the various ways in which assistance is rendered to families by the Government, instead of being based on the assumption that the Government has culpably neglected child endowment. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline> said, the rates of child endowment have not changed since 1967. I invite him to contrast the present national Health scheme with the position in 1941, or even in 1950. A totally different position prevails from that existing at the time of the introduction of c&#39;hild endowment. Through the national health scheme families have a very real ability to insure so that they will be able to offset medical and hospital expenses, a safeguard that was not available when child endowment was introduced. </para>
          <para>The point I make is that in considering child endowment one must have regard to the factual position when child endowment was introduced and must consider what other facilities, benefits - and services were then available. If by contrasting the position in 1971 with the factual position in the way of the provision of benefits, concessions and other services it is found that it is totally different now from that obtaining at the time child endowment was introduced, the relevance and importance of child endowment in the social scheme which the Government is providing becomes less significant. &#39; 1 do not suggest that child endowment is riot a real benefit, but I say that it does not loom as large in the social fabric in 1971 as it did in 1941. Nevertheless, the Government constantly considers child endowment rates. It must bear them in mind in the light of its other obligations, and in particular the other services it pro1vides to assist parents and children. I have stressed that the cost of increasing child endowment in the way that Professor Henderson indicated would be  SI  85m annually. If child endowment was increased by 50c a week in respect of each endowed child according to his place in the family, based upon statistics of the people receiving child endowment at 4th January last the cost annually would bc about  SI  01m. With the concurrence of honourable senators I incorporate in Hansard a table which sets out the cost of increasing child endowment by 50c a week for each child. </para>
          <para>The following table sets out the current cost of paying a 50c per week increase in respect of each endowed child according to his place in the family based on statistics relating to 4 January 1971. </para>
          <para class="block">Honourable senators will appreciate from the amount involved that it is not so easy to increase child endowment by 50c a week. There are many things I could say because of the way in which 1 have approached this subject, but having regard to time limitations I will refrain from doing so. The motion of urgency moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline> involves matters other than child endowment. He limited his remarks to the child endowment issue and I have responded similarly, but 1 am sure that my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield,</inline> when she speaks in due course, will look at other aspects of what the Government has been doing which are under attack. I have in mind particularly the home savings &#34;rant scheme. </para>
          <para>In many areas of social welfare a prudent community with a social conscience can suggest improvements. I do not suggest that the Democratic Labor Party has not a real concern in the area in which it has put forward these proposals, but I do assert that there are many competing claims upon the Government&#39;s welfare funds. The Government has an obligation to make decisions on where limited funds can be most wisely spent. I sense that in the areas in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline> has criticised the Government it has a record of achievement which cannot be brushed aside simply by saying that child endowment rates have not been increased, and taking that factor as a measure for critical purposes. The Government&#39;s record in social welfare is a record of which ti can be justly proud. </para>

            <para>- f enter this debate because of the concern of the Australian Labor Party for people in need. Although the Australian Labor Party has governed this country for less than 17 years since federation 70 years ago, it has pioneered the vast majority of social services and benefits received by Australians. The Australian Labor Party has pioneered practically all forms of social service legislation despite its relatively short period of office. We are aware of the problems confronting parents of large families, and particularly the problems of mothers. I listened with great attention to the speech delivered with some degree of sincerity by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne.</inline> He referred to the culpability of the Federal Government in allowing child endowment rates, particularly those for 3 or more children, and maternity allowances, to deteriorate in real value to such an extent that a family obtains no great assistance from the receipt of such payments. I go along with that view. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Certainly my own Party right throughout its ranks has shown great concern since its formation to fight for concessions in all forms of social service including child endowment. In this so-called affluent society unless both father and mother are earning, the benefits of the ordinary working class are very limited. I appreciate that it is difficult for Government supporters to realise that. They come from wealthy groups. They represent wealthy organisations. So, it is very difficult for them, in view of the affluence in which they live, to understand the situation that confronts the ordinary family, particularly the family with more than 2 or 3 children. Knowing the poverty that exists in our community, we have always thought along these lines. </para>
          <para>The mover of this motion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne,</inline> spoke with some feeling. But unfortunately - I repeat &#39;unfortunately&#39; - the hypocrisy of the whole show is apparent from the fact that if this motion is carried it will mean very little. In fact it will mean only that we will adjourn until tomorrow at 10.55 a.m. or that we will come back 5 minutes earlier tomorrow. That is all this motion means. I repeat that it is hypocrisy. 1 abhor this type of nonsense, although I have respect for the man who moved the motion as 1 served with him in the period prior to 1955 and 1 know of his support for proposals we have put forward in this chamber in recent weeks, particularly the proposal to investigate the problems of physically and mentally handicapped people, especially children, in Australia. I am happy to say that we hope, in the very near future and before the Parliament adjourns, to bring down an interim report on this matter. 1 believe that it will be of value to those people who are in need if the Government is prepared to act upon it. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline>went on to say that this is one of a number of motions which members of his Party have been responsible for introducing over recent weeks. He referred to motions on social service payments, superannuation schemes and now child endowment. When the urgency motion in relation to providing increased rates of social service payments to pensioners and others in necessitous circumstances was carried, I waited for a time, wondering what the Government was doing and what action would be taken by the Parliament. Then I raised the matter with the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson).</inline> I asked, in effect: In view of the fact that the Senate has carried this resolution, what action will be taken?&#39; Much to my surprise he said, in effect: &#39;We have honoured everything that was decided. On Tuesday we decided to sit at 2.55 instead of 3 o&#39;clock on Wednesday afternoon. In the process of deciding that we had a debate on social services; but let me repeat in direct response to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fitzgerald&#39;s</inline> question as to what the Senate resolved to do that in fact the Senate resolved to sit 5 minutes earlier on the next day&#39;. That is what we are doing now. We are deciding whether to sit 5 minutes earlier tomorrow. This is the nonsense that is going on. </para>
          <para>I want to bring the members of this little group back to the real situation. This Government is here today because of their support. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood,</inline> in making his contribution, paid tribute to them and thanked them. They are the people who are responsible for keeping the Labor Party out of government. They are the people who do not want a Labor government. This is the nonsense they are going on wilh. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> said the other day, here is the opportunity for them - the people in the centre group, the people who make possible a Labor government or make possible a Liberal government. They occupy a most important position. No legislation could be passed by this Parliament if it was not supported by them. And they stand up here and make all this hullabaloo. </para>
          <para>On this question of child endowment I have had the opportunity to go through policy speeches and our &#39;Platform, Constitution and Rules&#39;. They are studded with information on what we intend to do when we become the government, as we did when we were the government. Honourable senators opposite have been in government for 22 years without exception or without opposition. For almost 17 years of that period - since 1955  -  the members of the Democratic Labor Party have made it possible for them to be in government. Our Platform, Constitution and Rules&#39; continues. In his policy speeches <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gough</inline> Whitlam has stated what we will do in the fields of social services, child endowment, housing and so on. The same applies to the policy speeches delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Evatt</inline> as Leader of our Party. In 1961 this Government was elected with a majority of one as a result of the support of the DLP and, in the electorate of Moreton, the help of Communist Party preferences. </para>

              <para>- lt was introduced by the Labor Government of New South Wales. It was also a Labor government which, per medium of the social services referendum which was supported by Labor and opposed by the present Government parties one of which called itself by a different name at that time, made possible most of the social services legislation that we have had here over the period since that referendum was carried in 1.946. So, we are very proud of the work we have clone and the position for which we stand at present, lt is no good using the catch cry that no-one is standing for, working for or desirous of doing anything on behalf of those in need. The Australian Labor Party is the party that stands for those people. If the Labor Party had been in government over the last 22 years we would not have the sorry situation that exists at present. </para>

You support the great defence project that is going on in Vietnam. You support the amount of money that is being spent on the Fill. Therefore we cannot be expected to do any more&#39;. We would do something in this field. In doing so we would give assistance to those in need because we are the spokesmen for those who, we recognise, are in want and desire something at the present time. </para>

But the fact is that those honourable senators are quite happy at the present moment because they are keeping out of government the Labor Party which will do what is desired for people who are in need. It was the Labor Party which pioneered all forms of social services from the days of the old age pension in 1910 when Deakin was leader of the government. He worked with Watson who was the leader of the Labor Party. Support was given to the liberals of the time on the basis that they would introduce old age pensions. </para>

              <para>- I am going to tell the Senate why I do not. 1 certainly hope that in time the Government will be able to increase child endowment. We know that the Government has looked at this subject on many occasions. But it has assisted the happy family and the happy, healthy child in many other ways. That is the important point. To pick on a point and say that the Government has been culpably neglectful is most unfair. The Government has an amazing record of assistance for the family. I was surprised to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline> stressing the poverty aspect of this situation. If that is the reason for objecting to the fact that the Government has not increased child endowment why does not the honourable senator suggest a means test so that it will go specifically to those in most urgent need? Why does he not suggest that child endowment bc made taxable in all cases because obviously those in the higher income bracket will not then receive anything. But the honourable senator has not suggested that. He has suggested that child endowment should be raised but he has stressed it is for the people who are in need and in the poverty bracket. That is an unrealistic argument. It seems to me amazing, too, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fitzgerald</inline> has stressed that this urgency motion is hypocritical because all it does is suggest that we resume 5 minutes earlier tomorrow. I am amazed to hear anybody from the Australian Labor Party make that point because we sit here day after day listening to urgency motions moved on behalf of the Opposition when we ought to be getting through the business of the Senate. </para>

          <para>We are nearing the end of a session. Very often we waste time on something which cannot affect legislation. Then at the end of the session we will be told over and over again that we are not allowing enough time to debate matters of legislation. That is an incredible argument to come from the Opposition. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fitzgerald</inline> also said that the Labor Party initiated all the social services legislation for age pensioners. To me it seems appropriate quickly to run through one or two benefits which the Liberal Party and Country Party have introduced such as medical benefits for pensioners, aged persons income tax concessions, pharmaceutical benefits for pensioners, the aged persons home savings grant scheme, television licence concessions for pensioners, additional pension for second and subsequent children, home nursing subsidy, supplementary assistance for pensioners, nursing home benefits, mothers allowance for widow pensioners with children, subsidies for the provision of accommodation for disabled persons, telephone rental concessions for pensioners, guardians allowance for aged and invalid pensioners with children, sheltered employment allowances, hearing aid services, double pension entitlement to widows or widowers for 12 weeks following the death of a spouse, training scheme for widow pensioners, subsidies for dwellings for aged persons, personal care subsidy for aged pensioners, home care and paramedical services, and meals-on-wheels subsidy. This is an incredible record. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fitzgerald</inline> said that the Labor Party initiated all social services for pensioners. </para>
          <para>I said that the Government has an amazing record. I think the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Greenwood)</inline> listed some of the things the Government has done to assist the family. I am not going into detail because of lack of time but I shall repeat the things this Government has done to assist the family, either indirectly or directly, and also to assist children in addition to the child endowment allowance. The Government has introduced and increased the benefits under the health scheme. It has introduced the pharmaceutical benefits which assists the family and the child and introduced income tax concessions in respect of children at a total cost to revenue in the year 1967-68 - the latest figure I could obtain - of $266m. The Government has made free milk available for children. It has made provision for handicapped children and the children of pensioners. It has made available hearing aids, education scholarships, maternity allowances and the home savings grant about which I will have a few more words to say in a moment. This Government has made available a wide range of benefits. I repeat that it is unrealistic to pick on one aspect and say that the Government has been culpably neglectful of children. </para>
          <para>The second item in the matter of urgency was in respect of a New Zealand scheme for capitalisation of child endowment. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline> would find if he went to New Zealand that this scheme has not been a success. What can happen and what has happened on many occasions is that people who are finding it difficult to buy a home capitalise on their endowment and buy a home which is too expensive for them. Perhaps they cannot keep up their payments properly. Then the child suffers very much because there is no regular payment coming in as our system provides when a mother is receiving a payment directly for the benefit of the child. </para>

              <para>- ft is certainly not unanimously agreed that it is a good scheme. I am saying that it can lead to abuse. We have a much better scheme in Australia where the mother knows that while her children are under 16 years of age she will receive a weekly payment for their direct assistance. I believe that the combination of the 2 schemes which we have in Australia - the home savings grant and child endowment - are much more equitable, generous and effective for children than if we adopted a scheme like the New Zealand one. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Finally, I want to say something about the homes savings grant because it is the third item mentioned in the matter of urgency which states that the Government has failed to assist young married couples by up-dating the amount of assistance given under the Homes Savings Grant scheme. I believe the Government has done a great service for young married people who either have or are about to have families by assisting them to buy their homes. We believe in a home owning community. This scheme has assisted enormously. Two hundred thousand such grants have been made available to families to buy their homes. Under this scheme, those people who receive the grant have to buy their homes. As 200,000 people received this grant that is the number who have bought their homes. This is of enormous benefit to families and children who know that they can obtain this assistance. </para>
          <para>The Government has amended the homes savings grants legislation on 3 occasions and has increased the value of a house which can be bought with the aid of this grant. If homes savings grants were increased to $600 at this moment it would cost the Government more than $2m and I do not think it would achieve a great deal. On the matter of costs I should like to cite a few figures to show what would be the cost of implementing the first point contained in the proposal advanced by the Opposition, that is, to raise child endowment If the endowment for each child were raised by 50c per week it would cost about $101m </para>

              <para>- We have to make expenditures in all directions. So much is being done in such a wide range of areas that it is not realistic to spend $101m on one item, thereby possibly sacrificing other benefits which would achieve greater effect. It is interesting to note that there are 1,700,000 first children in respect of whom parents are receiving child endowment, that there are 1,165,000 second children, 569,000 third children, 232,000 fourth children, 85,000 fifth children, 32,000 sixth children, 12,000 seventh children, 4,000 eighth children, 1,500 ninth children and 818 tenth or later children. To increase the endowment in respect of each of those children would cost $!01m. Tt seems to me that we should be praising the Government for what it is doing, for having such a wide range of interests in respect of which improvements are made regularly for the benefit of the family and the children, instead of picking out one item and saying that in this respect the Government has been culpably neglectful. I repeat that T hope that the Government can increase child endowment, but T would not like to see it sacrifice other community interests and community services to achieve an improvement in one area only. </para>

            <para>- I enter this debate to say that I am disappointed that the Standing Orders Committee has not met to amend the Standing Orders in a way which would permit some emphasis to be given to this motion. Had the Standing Orders been amended to provide for the substantive motion to be what we now regard as the subject matter, we would have been able to amend the subject matter in a manner that would have given some teeth to the proposition. For instance, we could have amended it to say that unless the Government did something in the direction indicated in the motion we would reject the Budget in the August session. But an amendment such as that is impossible in present circumstances and so to some extent this matter of urgency becomes merely a matter for debate. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I remind the Senate that this motion is hyp orc i tical because its sponsors have brought about the very conditions which they now deplore. I remind the Senate that it was the Democratic Labor Party which supported the Government in all its action during the last Budget session when it increased indirect taxation and effected other changes which immediately reduced the value to the recipients of social service benefits and child endowment payments. Now members of the Democratic Labor Party complain that the Government has not seen fit to increase child endowment or to do other things which are outlined in the motion. In my view this is sheer political humbug because they, aided and abetted by the Government, were the instruments by which child endowment payments have deteriorated to the point they have now reached. Statistics are not needed to buttress one&#39;s arguments in this regard. If we were to ask any mother what the position is with regard to child endowment payments today, without recourse to statistics she would reply that child endowment has eroded to such an extent that its effect is now almost negligible. </para>
          <para>Members of the Democratic Labor Party are the very ones who have prevented child endowment payments from being increased. On innumerable occasions the Australian Labor Party has put forward proposals to increase child endowment, but the DLP has supported the Liberal Party and the Country Party at election times and has thus denied to the Australian Labor Party an opportunity to give effect to what the DLP now says should be done. I suggest that it is sheer political humbug to come into this place crying that child endowment payments have been eroded when those senators, combined with Government supporters, have been the instrument by which child endowment payments have been eroded. There can be no argument about that. A cold analysis of the situation reveals starkly that child endowment payments have deteriorated to a degree that is a disgrace to the Government of Australia. In defence of the Government the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Greenwood)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> referred to what had been done for the people of Australia and particularly for the parents. Is it being suggested that the Government will never give consideration to the erosion in value of child endowment payments and has no intention of increasing child endowment in the future? From the remarks made by Senators Greenwood and Buttfield one is entitled to infer that that is the Government&#39;s intention, its reason being that it has increased some social service benefits in other directions. </para>
          <para>This attitude reminds me of the story of the employer who provided better amenities for his workers. The employees had been working in almost gutter conditions, but he lifted their conditions to footpath level. It was obvious that he had no intention of living them further from the footpath into a house. That is analogous to the situation we have today. The defence to this motion put forward by Government supporters makes that quite clear. The parents of Australian children should be made aware of the Government&#39;s lack of interest in this direction and should realise that if, unhappily, the Government is returned at the next general election, whether it is in 1971 or 1972, it will be the fate of child endowment payments to remain at their present stagnated level. It is not a very happy thought for the parents of children born in Australia to realise that they are expected to rear their children in the most difficult circumstances and that in future they will be given no relief or assistance by way of increased child endowment payments. </para>
          <para>The Government has neglected this area of social services. It has neglected the parents, the people of Australia who are trying to do so much to raise families in the difficult circumstances that obtain today. 1 repeat that it has been aided by the Democratic Labor Party senators now come before us with this matter of urgency, which in fact is an expression of opinion. They have had the opportunity in the past, and they will have the opportunity in the future, to prove whether they are fair dinkum about these matters by getting rid of the Government which unfortunately occupies the Treasury bench of this national Parliament. It is impossible to escape those conclusions if one looks at the situation as it should be looked at. On each occasion on which the Government has imposed increases in direct taxation the DLP has supported its action. </para>
          <para>Let me refer to this morning&#39;s issue of the Brisbane &#39;Courier-Mail&#39;. The editorial reads in part: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The latest consumer price index again shows Brisbane has recorded the highest cost of living increase among Australian capital cities. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">We know that the standard of government in Queensland today is very poor, but the Queensland Government cannot be held responsible for all the increases. The Federal Government must take the responsibility for a substantial measure of cost increases. Yet it comes before this Parliament and says: &#39;Look, we have done so much for the parents of children. We are not doing anything more for them. We are going to allow child endowment payments to remain as they are.&#39; The Government says this notwithstanding the fact that the statistics are against it. The mothers of Australia say that child endowment payments have been eroded as a result of the maladministration of the Government which has been aided and abetted bv the Democratic Labor Party. </para>
          <para>I repeat that newspapers and church groups throughout Australia, and the people of Australia, say that child endowment payments have been eroded to a dangerous level. Everybody with the exception of the Government acknowledges that. I was astounded today to hear a responsible Minister of the Crown and a back bench supporter of the Government in the Senate defending the Government for its neglect of this area. These people say that the Government has been very generous to the people of Australia in other directions. When we of the Australian Labor Party are discussing a certain issue we deal with that issue only. It is an inescapable fact that child endowment payments have deteriorated. </para>
          <para>With respect, it is a pity that we do not have socialism in Australia today because then we would not have this situation. However, we are living in a capitalist society. Let us try to live in those circumstances but let the Government acknowledge that the parents of Australia are our best migrants. I make no apology whatever for saying that. We spend millions of dollars in trying to attract migrants from overseas. All that is necessary is to provide decent returns for parents in Australia in order to ensure that we have our own fair dinkum migrants, our own Australian children. But the way in which they have been neglected in the past hardly holds out any hope for the future in this direction. </para>
          <para>I repeat that I was disappointed to hear a responsible Minister of the Crown stand in this chamber today and try to defend this indefensible situation. He was supported by another Government senator. Perhaps some of us are getting a bit old and do not know what Ls the responsibility of the parents of today. The parents of children in Australia today are in a perilous position in rearing, educating and doing every ing right by their children. For the Government to say that it has done a remarkable job will not satisfy the people of Australia. I hope that the Government will learn of this dissatisfaction at the next general election. </para>
          <para>The second part of the matter of urgency is in these terms: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The failure of the Federal Government to introduce a system of capitalisation of child endowment payments similar to that scheme which has operated successfully in New Zealand since 1959. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">If honourable senators care to check the records they will find that this was part of the policy of the Australian Labor Party in 1963. We find now that the Democratic Labor Party says that the Government has failed to do these things, yet it had the opportunity in 1963 to support the Party which outlined this policy. We have no criticism of the proposal; we believe that it should be done. </para>

            <para>- In the very brief time available to me I would like to answer one or two important questions. The first was raised by the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Greenwood)</inline> who is frightened at what an increase in child endowment might cost. The Australian Labor Party says that the action of the Australian Democratic Labor Party in proposing this&#39; matter of urgency is useless because its effect will merely be to adjourn the Senate to a different time tomorrow. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Firstly,  I  would remind the Australian &#39; Labor Party that when a similar occasion arose at the beginning of this session it wasted its opportunity to do something about pensions. The members of that Party were sending telegrams to one another around the country seeking to have the Parliament called together. We had placed on the business paper of the Senate an urgency proposal. We had the matter discussed properly by the Parliament. For once the Australian Labor Party was prepared to support the constructive and intelligent action of the Democratic Labor Party, and our proposal was carried by the Senate. In spite of what the Australian Labor Party says about hypocrisy and its being useless to bring on this matter in this manner, and in spite of the fact that the Government says that such an increase, which had not been budgeted for, would cost $10Om or $200m and has tried to use these figures to frighten the public, within a few short weeks it saw the wisdom of the arguments that had been placed before the Senate. The Government acted against the advice that it had received and acted on the opinion that had been conveyed to it by this section of the Parliament. The Government decided to increase pensions, in spite of its stated opinions that it was not possible financially so to do and that if it attempted to increase pensions at that stage it would create ruin throughout the country. That is the answer to the criticisms. </para>
          <para>The Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Greenwood)</inline> talked of taxation concessions to supplement child endowment. The increases in child endowment have not kept pace with the general increases in the inflationary spiral which the Government admits have taken place. The Government has claimed credit for . that portion of the increases resulting from increased interest rates. The Minister said that taxation remissions make a difference. Let me remind him that the man most affected by the increases - the man on the basic wage, whose wife does not .work, and who has 3 or 4 children - does not pay any tax. How can taxation remissions alleviate the financial burdens of such families? That shows how arguments can become confused by sets of figures. Let me say this to him: These frightening amounts of millions, which he suggested, will not disappear if the Government pays increased child endowment. This money will be spent in our community. Most of it will go to people who have an urgent need to spend it immediately, even if it is only on school requisites for their children. The sales tax on those items will return some of that money to the Commonwealth Government. </para>
          <para>The increased child endowment would merely circulate more money in the community. The Government may say that that will increase the inflationary spiral and that it cannot grant the increase. The Government should get to work and reduce the interest rates to what they were before this inflationary spiral started. That would cure the situation not only in relation to child endowment but also in relation to the other matter that we did not have time to mention in the restricted period of this debate - the home savings grants. I must say something about that. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> suggested that the home savings grants were a great advantage to the young people. They were. The scheme was an extension of the marriage loans scheme that we had been advocating for some time. The facts are that today the young person who buys a home and gets the grant is no better off than the young person who bought his home 3 or 4 years ago and did not get the grant because the price increases that the Government has allowed to develop in the economy and the increased interest rates absorb more than the $500 grant The person who receives the grant is worse off. </para>
          <para>The period for this debate is restricted. 1 wish to prove who is being hypocritical. We do not judge measures on who moves them, but on the measures themselves. We might charge the Australian Labor Party with voting with the Liberals as often as we have and with giving their preferences to the Liberals, as they do. In this debate the question is: Who votes where tonight? Unless at this stage of the debate we get some decision so that we can indicate to the Government what it should do, there will be no decision. For that reason, I move: </para>

All I am saying is that I am certain that, if the Democratic Labor Party takes the opportunity of supporting the terms of its present motion at a time when its support will mean something to the parents and children of this country, a majority of the Senate will be only too pleased to cooperate. As I said the other night, it may be good or bad politics to put up such a proposal at this stage - I think those people in this country who know politics will say that it is bad tactics - &#39;but one must be prepared to support one&#39;s contention in August. </para>

After I left the Senate that night I was somewhat embarrassed because I was relying on my memory. I do <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> the justice of saying that he has become the victim of a canard that relates to what  President  Eisenhower was supposed to have said in 1953 in relation to Indo-China. Yesterday&#39;s Hansard verifies the statement that I made in my short reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> last night about the mystery of the 3 little dots. The quotation in the Hansard, which 1 have in front of me, now contains the 3 little dots. Three little dots in a quotation always indicate that something has been omitted. </para>
      <para>Earlier this evening I told <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> that 1 would reply on the basis of warning honourable senators that, when they make references to and use quotations, the Senate can adopt 2 courses.

I think it important that I should read the quotation from the &#39;New York Times&#39;, quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keene</inline> last night. This report was published in the &#39;New York Times&#39; of Wednesday, 5th August 1953. The heading of the &#39;New York Times&#39; states: &#39;Seattle, August 4th, Associated Press&#39;.

      <para class="block">Indo-China is not mentioned. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> has fallen into the trap of quoting a distorted version of what  President  Eisenhower said on that date which I have quoted textually from the New York Times&#39; of 5th August 1953. There is some evidence that this matter originated in one of 3 areas; either in the area of Felix Greene, an author, who has written 2 books - one on China and one called &#39;Vietnam,&#39; Vietnam&#39; - or it originated in the office of Bertrand Russell who was leading a campaign at that time when he was in his senescence. For <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe&#39;s</inline> further information, so that he can verify this, I refer to a letter written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Barry</inline> Jones, a well known publicist in Melbourne, which appeared in the Melbourne Age&#39; on 24th June 1967. I have taken some time to fulfil the obligation I assumed last night in the Senate of putting this so-called declaration of  President  Eisenhower&#39;s in its total context. I have illustrated the fact that the 3 little dots which are mentioned in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe&#39;s</inline> quotation last night eliminate at least 150 words. Those words enable the whole of the textual matter to come into the picture. The speech does not refer to Indo-China. It refers to Indonesia, India, Burma and Pakistan. </para>

          <para>- I am rather amazed at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack&#39;s attitude to this matter. Apparently I am not the only one. He has endeavoured to repudiate the statement that I made last night in this chamber. At the outset I want to tell him that there are not 3 dots, there are 4. If he wants to see the document, I will quote to him the authority which I have. It is an extract from &#39;Vietnam No. 1&#39; in the &#39;Readin&#39; series and it appeared at page 102. The publisher was Eyre and Spottiswoode Ltd of 167 Fleet Street, London, EC4, and the printer was Southwark Offset Ltd, London, SEI. To refresh the memory of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack I again quote from Vietnam No. 1&#39;: </para>

          <para>As early as 1953, long before the present scale of American aid was envisaged. President Eisenhower, speaking at a Governors&#39; Conference, gave a very practical reason for American concern in the fate of Indo-China. </para>
          <para>Now let us assume that we lose Indo-China. If Indo-China goes, several things happen right away. The peninsula, the last bit of land hanging on down there, would be scarcely defensible. The tin and tungsten that we so greatly value from that area would cease coming. </para>

        <para class="block">This quotation was taken from a speech to a Governor&#39;s Conference on 4th August 1953, which was before the Geneva Accords on Indo-China. The other statement I quoted was from the &#39;New York Times&#39; of 12th February 1950. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack said that this statement was made m 1953. He said that there were 3 places from where I could have obtained this quotation. He said that I could have obtained it from Felix Greene, who is a very reputable person, or Bertrand Russell who, as far as I am aware, was not a dangerous character. He did not name the third source. Apparently <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack thought that I could have obtained the quotation from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr William</inline> McMahon because he was not prepared to name the third source. I made this statement in good faith. Therefore, I have no reason to withdraw anything I said. I am sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack feels that the issue is of such great importance that he has felt obliged to come into this chamber and publicly express his views. I am not prepared to say what was said about the matter this evening in private because, as far as I am concerned, that was in club. He said last night that he was going to repudiate everything I had said. I say now that he has failed to repudiate anything I said and he has failed to back up the argument that he placed before the chamber last night. I maintain that the words 1 quoted last night and tonight are true right down to the last full stop. </para>
        <para>The Vietnam war is not for the so-called defeat of Communism in Asia but to ensure that the capitalists of Australia and the United States have uncontrolled access to the riches of Indochina and, as I said in this chamber a week or so ago, to the possible oil fields off the shores of South Vietnam. This is why young Australians are being killed in Vietnam. Australians of 20 years of age, who do not even have the right to vote, are being killed in this horrible, immoral war in Vietnam and people like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack are their murderers. </para>

          <para>- I want to say a few words about these 3 little dots. I would like to say first that General Eisenhower was a great general. He had the equipment and the numbers to clean up in Europe. The main fighting that helped General Eisenhower to become such a great man was done in eastern Europe. The millions of people who laid down their lives in Europe are still not comprehended by the people of Australia and the United States of America. Many of the people of England, which was really involved in the European war, do not know of the sacrifices that were made on the land by human beings to defeat Fascism in Europe. General Eisenhower became great because the United States of America was able to sit back and inherit the greatness of the British Empire. </para>

            <para>- Of course it did the same in the First World War. It did it twice. In doing so the United States inherited all the greatness and power of the British Empire. With the equipment that he had at his disposal and the great power that had been inherited, General Eisenhower went into Europe and mopped up after the main fighting had been done on the ground in eastern Europe and the Fascist Nazi army had been defeated. General Eisenhower then went back to the United States and started to talk about South East Asia, the next part of the world that was in Hitler&#39;s plan of domination, with Italy and Japan, of the world. The great patriots opposite are getting up and speaking because they think that the memories of the people of Australia have faded. </para>

You are Little by name and little by nature, so please do not interject. The great expert on South East Asia, General Eisenhower, went back to the United States a hero and great tributes were paid to him. He was hailed as the great scion of the Establishment, the man who won the war for the West, and he became President of the United States. That was typical of this front man. He then became the writer of scripture and, because someone left out some of his magic words and put in 4 dots the great Magnus had to get up here and put the record straight. </para>

        <para>Eisenhower said that if Indo-China fell that piece of land would be forgotten and the last great populated area would fall to the Kremlin. I notice that there is one survivor of the Australian Democratic Labor Party present. This is the type of thing that the Democratic Labor Party has been living on. It has survived on this myth of the Communists of the Kremlin and China raping women, of red arrows coming down and this type of thing. This type of propaganda has been foisted on the people of Australia because Australia is isolated in Asia. This strip of land in South East Asia and all the people that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack spoke about will be outflanked and will become part of the Soviet empire! What sort of rubbish is this? What sort of propaganda is this? If honourable senators on the Government side are truthful to themselves, do they believe it? There is no hope of this area becoming part of the Soviet empire because the Vietnamese people have had a say in this. The Vietnamese people have said: &#39;We are not going to be a little strip of country which will be outflanked and become part of the Soviet empire.&#39; Even before 1950 they overcame the Japanese. They overcame the French and they have overcome the Australians and the Americans. Their race will survive despite our great overall purpose of subduing them and subverting them. These people will survive as an ethnic race and will guide their own destiny. </para>
        <para>The kerfuffle put forward tonight by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack about General Eisenhower&#39;s grand plan and the 4 dots comes down to this: Whatever we like to say in this Parliament, South East Asia is peopled with human beings who have a pride in their race and a pride in their destiny. They are not going to be subverted and subdued by mercenaries, of whom we are a part, who try to overcome them by the strength of arms. We are not going to be persuaded because there are 4 dots which indicate something is missing from Eisenhower&#39;s speech. Eisenhower was a stooge of the system. He will not live in history. He only helped to bring America into its present state of affairs where it is divided over this very issue of South Vietnam. </para>

He referred to the deletion. We know what Eisenhower meant. Eisenhower had the great plan, the grand strategy, that the United States had the divine right, after the Second World War and after all the sacrifices by the satellites around the world. I refer to our troops from Australia, from New Zealand and all the other countries which contributed towards the destruction of a negative philosophy of Fascism which was the ultimate of capitalism. Eisenhower inherited this and his words of wisdom have to be quoted in this place in full. You could not afford to have dots inserted. Eisenhower&#39;s philosophy was that America had the prerogative and the responsibility of telling all these people in South East Asia how to run their business, and this has been going on ever since. That is why we are involved in the war in. Vietnam. That is why we are not participating in the possibility of exchanging trade with Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaya, Burma, Thailand, India, Ceylon, Nepal and all these other places. We have no claim to friendship with them. We have never done anything to warrant their friendship. This is the Eisenhower philosophy: Dominate these people and stop the Kremlin from taking over.

        <para>That has been a false philosophy and that is what is wrong with Australia&#39;s foreign policy at the moment. We antagonise the people we should be cultivating, the Indonesians and others in South East Asia, by our attitude and our involvement in the Vietnam war. Australia is a wealthy neighbour and should be giving the maximum possible help to Indonesia. The Dutch, the Canadians and others are giving more to that country. They are doing more to help the Indonesians up the social scale while Australia is staying by the silly old shibboleths of the past, saying that Eisenhower&#39;s philosophy continues and is still valid, lt is not valid. His philosophy was negative and destructive. The policy of the United States in the past has led it into chaos, where it has nothing externally and very little internally. </para>

We should not hang on to the old stupid idea that the white man is superior, that the empire and the colonial system have any place in the world. They have had their time in history. We are now on a watershed and have to measure up to the real issues. We are human beings and the brotherhood of man will exercise its power. It is going to exercise its power in Australia. All profit comes from the working men in Australia. Owners of industries have to rely on the working man for their profits.

        <para>The fact is that tonight we are presented with a document to show that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> is wrong. The document is a photostat extract from the New York Times&#39;. We are indebted to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> on this occasion because he has shown conclusively that, even if there be a misquotation of a word, it does not take away the purport of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> was saying. As honourable senators will remember, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe,</inline> in his speech in the debate on the ministerial statement on the withdrawal of Australian troops from Vietnam, put the point of making mountains of gold out of rivers of human blood and that the engagement in this war was for profit. He linked it up with Australia&#39;s commercial interest in the continuation of the war in Indo-China. </para>
        <para>He came into the adjournment debate last night and quoted from a particular publication to show that it was more than a question of the freedom of Indo-China; it was a question of the tungsten, tin and other minerals that America desired. Now we find that, even if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack is right in his quotation from the New York publication, it has not altered the reason why America is in Indo-China. lt is part of its invasion of South East Asia.

We are somewhat indebted to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack tonight for reaffirming what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> said, namely, that American interests are American commercial interests and they ask: What does it matter about people with slant eyes whom you have to kill in the process, as long as you protect the dollar, the tin, the steel and American security? That is the argument that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> put. </para>
        <para>Does it matter whether the word is Indo-China&#39; or &#39;Indonesia&#39;? What do the lives of the people who must be slaughtered in this campaign matter as long as we protect the mighty American dollar? That is the story of the campaign. That is the story <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> endeavoured to present to the Senate in the hope that he would win some support from some humanitarians in the Senate. That is the story which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack, by the production of his publication tonight, verifies and supports in regard to the American campaign in Indo-China. I join with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Byrne</inline> in saying that it is time we ceased to be parties to the filthy, dirty, commercialised campaign in which we are engaged in Indo-China at the present time. </para>

          <para>- Much as I would like to add to the saga of the 3 dots, I wish to speak on another matter. I direct the attention of the Senate to page 901 of Hansard and the speech by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh.</inline> He asked for leave to have a document incorporated in Hansard. He completed his speech by saying: &#39;If leave is not given I shall read it&#39;. It was my intention to hear that document read in the Senate. So, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> said: &#39;If leave is not given I shall read it&#39;, and the  Deputy President  asked: Is leave granted?&#39;, I said: &#34;No.&#39; And there the matter ended for the night. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I find that the material that was supposed to be incorporated in Hansard was not incorporated. Since it is of considerable importance to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> had to say, I propose to read the introduction and then to seek leave to have the remainder incorporated in Hansard. I will give honourable senators an indication of the type of material I propose to seek to have incorporated in Hansard. The letter is addressed to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> and it reads: </para>

        <para>For a notable example of a Christian man who could not practise the use of sword or bayonet or do any violence to his fellow men, we have Ronald Knox. His life has been widely published as written by the English writer Evelyn Waugh. Ronald Knox, was a member of the Church of England and the son of a minister of that Church. He was Captain of Eton School although he never played any games. In the first World War he went as a stretcher-bearer to the Front lines because he could not bear to use an offensive weapon. He translated the Bible and was chaplain to the Roman Catholic students at Oxford University where I met him, a fine figure of a man, a most popular Christian. </para>
        <para>As for myself I also could not be trained to use violence to my fellow men and could not be trained to kill in the Army. When the second World War came, I at once volunteered and joined the Navy which &#39;fights ships not men&#39; and went straight to the protection of convoys in the Battle of the Atlantic as an Anti-Submarine Officer and was the first Australian to be First Lieutenant of a corvette in that Cruel Sea. </para>
        <para>I was top of the Royal Navy Radar School in England and first place &#39;with greatest credit&#39; in the United States Coastguard School of Radio Navigation, and introduced and taught Radio Navigation to the Australian Navy. </para>
        <para>Like St Paul I &#34;glory&#34;, to use his word, in contending with infirmities and dangers and difficulties, as he tells us at length that he did and would have vis do. In witness of this 1 attach hereto a copy of my article &#39;Ski ing through Blizzards for 12 Days&#39;, and a copy of articles from the Sydney Morning Herald of September 8, 1936, and September 1, 1937. Also 1 attach six pages of my article describing how I gave Tasmania its micro-wave radio link with the mainland in spite of tremendous difficulties. </para>
        <para>Yet I would hate to be drawn by a marble in the lottery of death at the age of 20. I would regard it as tyranny and slavery. </para>
        <para>Certainly the Christian and other human people of Vietnam need our support against Communist terror and oppression. But it should be the support of those who volunteer for it. My neighbour has a son in the permanent Army, and as a young Lieutenant that son has been in Vietnam and severely wounded, he says he volunteers to go back there, for he had experience of a village of 100 people who were kept alive and safe from massacre by the Communists only by the Australian Army, and he would again offer himself to save South Vietnamese from terror and certain violent death. </para>
        <para>At a time when Australia was rattling the sabre and was considering going to war with Indonesia over West New Guinea I made a strong bid for peace and friendship with Indonesia as shown by the attached article from the Melbourne Herald of January 9, 1962. </para>
        <para>Just as Indonesia needs our help, South Vietnam needs it far more, and Christian charity demands that we give it. But we should not give it by forcing some only of our immature youths to kill and do violence to their fellow men. </para>
        <para>Let those who counsel meeting violence with violence go themselves to do it. It is wrong and a tyranny and against Christian charity to gaol young men who refuse to join the lottery of death and violence. It is in line with the Governor who sought to imprison St Paul who identified himself not just with Christ, but with &#39;Christ nailed to the Cross&#39;. </para>

            <para>I rise not with the preparatory remark, which is common to the Senate, that at this late hour J will not detain the Senate very long. What 1 intend to say arises from the remarks made by the Minister for Works <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wright)</inline> in the context of the discussion of the speech made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> in which he quoted what were alleged to be the remarks of  President  Eisenhower before the Governors of the United States of America. This, one of the most famously distorted canards, has spread around the world. When the original quotation came out it had 3 or 4 mysterious little dots which indicated that something had been eliminated from the report. We have now reached the stage where the 3 or 4 little dots have been eliminated and the statement reads <inline font-style="italic">v.</inline> though  President  Eisenhower said what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> has ascribed to him.

              <para>- I explained tha? position before I read the document. If I did not make myself perfectly clear to all honourable senators let me repeat that last night <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> in reading from his document said &#39;Indo-China&#39; and tonight <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack from his document said &#39;Indonesian&#39;. That is the only difference between what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack said tonight and what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> said last night. If ever an apology were due in this Senate I submit with respect that it is due to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack. He is not here at this stage of the proceedings so I cannot ask him to apologise. Nor can the Senate request him to do so. But if be is a fair minded Australian and if he is reasonable in his attitude towards the responsibility of this Senate then I say again, with respect, that he should give to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> the apology which is his due. Last night the clear inference was that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> was, to say the least, gilding the lily. I submit that what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> said last night is 99.9 per cent in line with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack said tonight. I repeat that I believe an apology is due to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe.</inline></para>

            <para>- lt appears to me that there has been a considerable amount of what might be described as obfuscation of the original issue. I do not wish to add to that in any way. For that reason I do not answer the matters which have been raised by honourable senators from the other side of the chamber. I simply ask leave to incorporate in Hansard the document which has already been tabled and referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack and other speakers during this adjournment debate so that any person who, at some subsequent time, wishes to determine whether the course of action suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner</inline> or some other course of action should have been taken can work it out for himself by looking at the document and at the statements which have been made. It does not seem to me that the interests of this country or this chamber will be served by having a long debate on this rather minor matter which was perhaps put on one basis or another. The matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> last night was entirely different and 1 should have thought that it was not the subject matter of the present debate. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President,</inline> I simply ask for leave to incorporate in Hansard the document from which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack quoted. </para>

            <para>- I shall answer this interjection, but thereafter I shall not answer any interjection while reading this document. I have stated already that it states at the top that it is the &#39;New York Times&#39; of Wednesday, 5th August 1953. I understand the &#39;New York Times&#39; to be a newspaper, and I thought that honourable senators opposite might also have the same understanding. The document reads: </para>

            <para>SEATTLE, Aug. 4(AP)- Following is the text of  President  Eisenhower&#39;s address at the forty-fifth annual Governors&#39; Conference: </para>
            <para>I am here for a number of purposes, but among them is not that of making a long and so-called important speech for the record. The first thought that strikes me as 1 stand up is that Governors&#39; conferences have changed in type a bit. It used to be something like this, all right, but they didn&#39;t have so much pulchritude in the rear. </para>
            <para>I didn&#39;t know that there was an audience of this kind. Nevertheless, while I had on my mind talking of things which I thought would be of interest to the Governors I hope that the remainder of the audience won&#39;t find these things loo boring. </para>
            <para>Now first of all, I am here for a very simple purpose. Because of my indestructible conviction that unless we preserve in this country (he place of the state government, its traditional place, with the power, the authority, the responsibilities and the revenues necessary to discharge those responsibilities, then we are not going to have America as we have known it; we will have some other form of government. </para>
            <para>And my thought was that if I could come here to pay my tribute of respect to the great responsibilities that you men as the executive heads of your states must carry on behalf of our people, then that alone would justify my trip. </para>
            <para>Now, within this concept, of course, is that of the need for the executive heads of each of these states to perform services for their people, the people for whom they serve as chief executives, that is almost without scope and without limit. </para>
            <para>By this I mean that merely because a chief executive signs the bills that are presented to him, presents to his legislature a program that he believes to be conceived in the best interests of his state, that is not enough. In this modern and complex time the problems that affect each of our lives very intimately, very definitely, are very difficult to understand. </para>
          </quote><para class="block">Duty to Supply Information </para><para>A chief executive, in no matter what echelon, be it city, state or Federal, has many sources of information, accurate information, that are often denied to the people in general or, if they are not denied, they come to the people through certain reports that are difficult to relate, one to the other, and therefore see their significance. 1 believe that a chief executive has, among other things, the responsibility of informing his own commonwealth, his own state, about these major problems all the time, be it Korea, IndoChina, taxes, debt limit, no matter what, he has the chore of using the facilities open to him, including that of making talks.  (Quorum formed.) </para><para>He has the chore of trying to. inform the people in that State so that they will in turn support reasonable programs nationally as well as state-wide. </para><para>And indeed, I think at this point in the national and state plan it is again very, very difficult to establish a clear dividing Une. We know this: Unless the United States is prosperous, unless it is strong, unless it is secure; there is no strength, there is no prosperity, there is no security for any state. </para><para>Consequently we instantly conclude there is no true division in the scope of our concern for the people we are attempting to serve. </para><para>The dividing line, you see, is really how we co-ordinate our several functions so that we are not doing exactly the same things, but so that the efforts of each complement the other. </para><para class="block">Cities Request for Study </para><para>That is the reason that one of the first acts of mine when I went to Washington and was supported by a cabinet, and, indeed, by advisers who are now sitting around this table and who occupy Governors&#39; chairs; I asked for a commission that would study this proper division between state responsibility and Federal responsibility, not for one instant meaning that we divide our concern about these major problems of the world and which we have the responsibility of helping to inform our people. </para><para>I do not mean to do that exclusively. We have the responsibility. But I do mean that unless we find a way of dividing the responsibility we are bound to blur too indefinitely the line that divides our several functions and eventually, as I say again, it will not be the American system as we have known it. </para><para>Now, this goes into every field of activity of which I can think. Long years ago, you know, they attempted to establish security establishments. It was a composition of a regular and professional group supported by what we call national concerns and then the state national guard later, and the Federal. All of that was done in an effort to bring together the best capabilities of the state and of the national Government and to provide security for us at all times and with the least possible cost. </para><para>And, indeed, in spite of the tradition that has been directed at us, I believe this: I believe that if every citizen, every state and the national government would do ils proper job under that concept, it would still be a good one for the United States. The trouble of it is jealousies develop. Inefficiencies, and recriminations start, and we have more fun criticizing than we do working constructively. It is odd. </para><para>Of course, this is no new discovery of the human mind, but it is odd, isn&#39;t it, that we have so much <inline font-style="italic">ian</inline> calling the other fellow a so-and-so than getting out and doing something to correct either the error that he has committed on that we have. It is probably one of the things, though, that any President is never allowed to forget, even for a minute. </para><para>If we go into the field of agriculture, if we go into the field of Federal power and the conservation of all the resources of this United States, we find this same community of purpose with the necessity of division of responsibility obtains. </para><para>As I understand it, this morning you are going to try in a round table conference to sort out in your own minds and possibly sort out in our minds what these divisions should be. Certainly I know of no one in the Federal Government today, no matter what his job, who thinks he knows all of the answers. We cannot fail to benefit, then, from a discussion on those subjects. </para><para class="block">Sharing of Responsibility lit certain instances, I think very obvious truths should prevail. Unless <inline font-style="italic">we</inline> are partners in some of these things, they cannot be done. But if partnership is going to consist only in talking about local rights and central responsibility- responsibility, particularly when it is financial - that is going to be a pattern - there is no hope. </para><para>When we share responsibility, we share responsibility all of the way through, financial as well as for seeing that the thing is effectively operated. </para><para>But if we obey this principle - the closer we leave government and every kind of governmental responsibility to the people, calling in the Federal Government where there is a clear service to be performed, which could not be performed adequately without its cooperation and its partnership, cooperation and partnership in the right direction. </para><para>This principle applies in this great problem - I don&#39;t know whether you have yet talked about it - it is one of the controversial subjects - is civil defense. Civil defense is absolutely impossible without complete and enthusiastic cooperation, not merely of governments, not merely of men, but of every man, woman and child in the United States. This is one thing that can&#39;t be handled except for the people of the states. </para><para>It is perfectly clear that the first thing that is needed if you are going to have effective civil defense against a possible attack against this country is an ordered or disciplined movement and action on the part of the people in the case of emergency. </para><para>Just as you train your children to go on defensive drills in school if there is a fire, that is the way we must be trained and instructed. If they are unwilling to accept that, there is no hope of a solution. </para><para>You can dig all the cellars in the world and have the people try to get in them. They wouldn&#39;t know where they were. </para><interjection>

          <para>You have seen the panic that overtakes people. The indispensable ingredient of any civil defense is some self-control, and that&#39;s all that discipline is. On top of it then is an ordered plan to place people in a position of safety. On top of that you can build a number of artificial and organized defenses, even to include your warning services in the case the Federal Government takes over in the field of active defense. But without this ordered, and orderly, action on the part of the civilian population, all safety defense measures will fall Bat. </para>

          <para>The Federal Government has a very wide, definite, fixed responsibility in this whole program, but we can never do it unless the localities down to the last individual will cooperate. </para>
          <para>I could go on enumerating every kind of problem that comes before the state. Let us take, though, for example, one simple problem in the foreign field. </para>
          <para class="block">I pause for a moment not only to have a drink of water but also to say that perhaps it is unfortunate that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner</inline> are not here to listen to this, but I will go on because this is the important part: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">You have seen war in Indo-China described variously as an outgrowth of French colonialism and the French refusal to treat indigenous populations decently. You find it yet described as a war between the Communists and the other elements in Southeast Asia, but you have a confused idea of where is located Laos and Cambodia or any of the other countries that are involved. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>The Asian Problem </para>
          <para>You don&#39;t know really why we are so concerned with the far-off southeast corner of Asia. Why is it? </para>
          <para>Now, first of all, the last great population remaining in Asia that has not become dominated by the Kremlin, of course, is the subcontinent of India, the Pakistan ian Government. </para>
          <para>Here are 150,000,000 people who are still free. Now let us assume that we lose Indo-China. If Indo-China goes, several things happen right away. The peninsula, the last little bit of land hanging on down there, would be scarcely defensible. The tin and tungsten that we so greatly value from that area would cease coming, but all India would be outflanked. </para>
          <para>Burma would be in no position for defense. </para>
          <para>Now, India is front on that side by the Soviet Empire. I believe you read in the paper this morning that Mossadegh moved toward getting rid of his parliament,andofcourse he was in that move supported by the Communist party of Iran. All of that position around there is very ominous to the United States, because finally if we lost all that, how would the free world hold the rich empire of Indonesia? </para>
          <para>So you see, somewhere along the line, this must be blocked and it must be blocked now, and that&#39;s what we are trying to do. </para>
          <para>So when the United States votes $400,000,000 to help that war, we are not voting a giveaway program. We are voting for the cheapest way that we can prevent the occurrence of something that would be of a most terrible significance to the United States of America, our security, our power and ability to get certain things we need from the riches of the Indonesian territory and from Southeast Asia. </para>
          <para>Now, that is the kind of thing that it isn&#39;t good enough for someone to decide in Washington. All of us understand, because out of that kind of thing grows the need for taxes. The security of the United States is not just the business of the Secretary of Defense and the Congress and the  President  and the Secretaries of the services, it&#39;s the business of every man, woman and child and,  if it is their business, then it is the business of all of us. We need help. </para>
          <para>I don&#39;t care what the problem is. I think  I  can always talk, my friends, just to get back to this one thought: unless the Governors of the state,  I  don&#39;t give a hoot whether a Democrat or Republican is in this kind of a job, we are Americans, in the Federal Government, unless we can cooperate on the basis of understanding of the facts and progress steadily, surely and confidently in carrying out a program that we believe will establish the security of the United States, not only from a bomb, from some kind of destructive action of the enemy, but make sure that its surpluses are carried abroad and in return for those surpluses we get back goods that will allow those people to buy our surpluses; unless we have that kind of economic strength we are going to have to live a very different kind of life than we do. </para>
          <para>This can all be done only through cooperation. This is no partisan proposition. We don&#39;t have a monopoly on truth or on the facts that affect this country. We must work together. </para>
          <para class="block">So far as it goes, that is the document which was tabled. It may be of some interest to those who were keen to debate this subject but not keen to hear the subject matter read to have the opportunity of reading the statement tomorrow, if they so desire, so that they can see whether the context in which they used the statement was a good representation of the context in which it was used originally. I can but emphasise that what was not referred to tonight was the fact that General Eisenhower was talking about trade generally and the beneficial effects it had on the people in both countries who were involved in that trade. I do not debate the subject any further. It is interesting to know that the Opposition is so concerned that a speech of General Eisenhower&#39;s, which may or may not have been taken out of context, should not be available to anybody who reads Hansard that it refused me the leave to incorporate the speech, which caused the Senate to be detained for 15 or 20 minutes while I read the speech. I have now done so and I hope that people will now be able to see this matter in its proper context. </para>

              <para>- I am saying that this is an alleged statement. It is not the actual document from which  President  Eisenhower read. It is not the authorised document that he approved. This is only what appeared in a newspaper. I do not care whether it is the best newspaper in the world. Plenty of articles appear in the Australian Press which report statements made by people, even senators, and are not what was said. There are plenty of instances like that where the subject matter is confused and presented wrongly and the emphasis is put the wrong way. I emphasise that we have 2 statements. I think that the Senate has every reason to accept the one that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> has given. It was the first put forward. I can see no difference in the second, even allowing for the 4 dots because it only refers to Indonesia instead of Indo-China. </para>
