            <para>- My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Will the Minister inform the Senate whether it is true that a request has been made to Australia to leave Australian servicemen in Vietnam as advisers to train Cambodians, presumably for the defence of the Government of Lon Nol, the dictator who has dispensed with parliamentary democracy and is operating under martial law? Will he tell us who made the request to Australia? Will he also inform us whether we are again going to go through the whole business that was gone through with South Vietnam? Is it not a fact that the whole unhappy and tragic affair in Vietnam started with the provision of advisers? </para>

I ask: Firstly, is it a fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam,</inline> the Leader of the Opposition in another place, requisitioned a VIP aircraft to fly him from Albury to Brisbane on Saturday, 16th October, in order to open a swimming pool at Cleveland, near Brisbane? Secondly, is it a fact that the VIP aircraft returned south empty on the following day and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> returned to Sydney by commercial aircraft? Thirdly, is it correct that the approximate cost of this flight, excluding flight crew salaries and wages, was at least $ 1,456? Fourthly, does the Minister believe that a visit to Brisbane to open a school swimming pool warrants the use of a VIP aircraft? Fifthly, is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> required to provide the Minister with information beforehand as to the purpose for which he requires a VIP aircraft? </para>

          <para class="block">Leader of the Australian Democratic Labor Party knows, I am responsible for the approval of applications by Ministers and the Leader of the Opposition and the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition for the use of VIP aircraft. All applications to me must contain the date and the time of departure and arrival, the reason for the flight and why commercial aircraft cannot be used. Details of the passengers carried must also be shown. One other requirement is that the next of kin of each passenger on the aircraft has to be given. On this occasion <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> applied for the use of an aircraft. He had a requirement to be at a function in Albury at a certain time and at a further function in Brisbane later in the day. No commercial aircraft was available that would suit his requirement to be at the 2 places. As his application complied with all the requirements laid down for the use of VIP aircraft, I had no alternative but to give him approval to make the flight. From the time it left Canberra to go to Albury and then to Brisbane before coming back to Canberra the aircraft was away for 7 hours and 5 minutes. The cost of a VIP HS 748 flight works out at about $205.50 an hour. If one multiplies that figure by the time taken to complete the journey, which was just over 7 hours, one gets just over $1,400, which is almost the amount the Leader of the Democratic Labor Party mentioned. </para>

I. am equally  sure that they will establish the proper level of duty, based upon the true article and not what it purports to be.

            <para>- I think the operative words of the honourable senator's question are 'if these reports are correct'. 1 have received from the Department a fairly detailed statement in answer to the article which appeared in the 'Sunday Times' of Western Australia and the 'Sunday Mail' of South Australia. The material from the Department says this: The article does not reflect the real position. The position is that the Commonwealth is committed by the Northern Territory Acceptance Act and the 1949 Railway Agreement (South Australia) Act to the eventual construction of a standard gauge line from Darwin to Port Augusta. The Commonwealth agreed in principle to the construction of new standard gauge lines from Tarcoola to Alice Springs to replace the existing narrow gauge line. The Surveyor-General has surveyors studying detailed routes of this line. This will be a major step in fulfilling these obligations. But there are no plans for constructing the line beyond Alice Springs at this stage. That is as much information as I have. I will direct the honourable senator's question in its entirety to the Department to see whether there is anything it would care to add. </para>

Has the Department renewed its previous practice of regular visits by trained nursing staff to Aborigines located on Northern Territory cattle stations? </para>

          <para class="block">My attention was directed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> to an article that appeared in a magazine, and consequently I can say that I am conversant with the issues that he raises and that were raised in the article concerned. They are indeed problems to which 1 have devoted a great deal of attention, and I have referred to them here in the Senate in the last few weeks. Basically the problems of Aboriginal health in the southern region of the Northern Territory stem from the environmental conditions under which the Aboriginals live. Of course, honourable senators will also be aware that many very important aspects of the overall arrangements for Aboriginal welfare come within the ambit of my colleague, the Minister for the Interior, with whom I am in frequent consultation on this whole matter. </para>
          <para>My Department is attacking the problem on 2 fronts - preventive and curative. In the preventive held I am pleased to be able to inform the Senate that my Department is expanding its rural health programme to increase the number of visits to cattle stations, settlements and missions. Reference in the article to a reduction in the number of health visits to cattle stations does <inline font-style="italic">not</inline> reflect the present position. In the area of curative services, and specifically those applying to Aboriginal infants, I am pleased to be able to report to the Senate that yesterday the final steps were taken to complete the acquisition of a large motel in Alice Springs which is to be converted as a matter of urgency for use as a child care centre. When that centre is in operation - which I expect will be quite early in the new year - it will have accommodation for some 40 children in ward areas and for  16  mothers, plus their infant children, in  separate room accommodation. A nursing establishment of 45 will be specially recruited to staff this new centre. The centre will supplement the intensified rural health programme now being conducted from Alice Springs and should have a considerable impact on the whole picture of Aboriginal child health in that area. </para>

          <para class="block">Earlier, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy,</inline> posed to me a question to which this subsequent question has some relationship. In his statement to Parliament on 18th August on the future of Australian forces in Vietnam the Prime Minister indicated that consideration would be given to the retention of some military training and advisory elements in Vietnam. The size of these elements and their task are under discussion. We are now examining also the possibility of making arrangements to include the training of Cambodians in Vietnam. There are no Australian military advisers or instructors in Cambodia and there is no intention of sending any. Of course, this is a policy matter and one which will necessarily be the subject of consultation with allies. The Prime Minister may be discussing the matter in the United States. Honourable senators will appreciate - and this is as spoken a few moments ago by the Acting Prime Minister in the other place - that I am not in a position to indicate at this stage the outcome of this combined consideration of this matter. </para>

It asked for an expression of opinion and probably also for legal opinion. I suggest that it is not a proper use of question time to start a debate on some matter of the Opposition's policy, let alone the Government's policy, that debate being between a questioner on the Government side of the chamber and a Minister. But, apart altogether from offending against the requirements of the standing order, the question offends against the requirements of fair play and decency when an attempt is made to indulge in a debate of this character in this way. </para>

          <para class="block">It would be impossible for me to give precise information in reply to this question, but I shall seek that information from the Treasury. I feel bound to say also that it would be quite unreal to imagine that any government department or private business could simply press a button and say: 'Hey presto, we have computers'. It is a long and arduous procedure to install computers. If I am any judge of the Public Service Board, its requirements would be that there be a phasing of staff to deal with the introduction of computers over a period, that the phasing of staff have regard to redundancies, if any, and that the intake of new officers into a department be watched to ensure that there was no injury to the employment rights of people in the department. I am sure that that is the answer to the question, but as to the detailed information about the costs of computers I shall have to obtain that from the Minister and make it available to the honourable senator. 2 November 1971 </para>

            <para>- ls the Minister for Civil Aviation aware that 19 pieces of passengers' luggage were off-loaded from Trans-Australiann Airlines flight 437 from Canberra to Melbourne last Friday? Is he also aware that passengers were not advised that that had been done until they reached Melbourne and the last piece of luggage loaded for the flight had been collected? Can the Minister explain why the ticket numbers of the off-loaded luggage were not announced during the flight so that the passengers concerned could have arranged for the forwarding of their luggage to their respective destinations, thereby avoiding a delay of 20 to 30 minutes in Melbourne? By way of explanation 1 wish to advise the Minister that my wife and I missed our train to Geelong because of this unnecessary delay in Melbourne and we were seriously embarrassed in meeting an important engagement in that city on time. </para>

            <para>- I have spoken to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ferrier,</inline> who is the airport manager in Canberra, and he has advised mc that it was necessary to offload the luggage because of weather conditions prevailing at Canberra Airport on Friday afternoon. There were strong northerly winds and a high ground temperature. Because of these factors the take-off weight of the aircraft had to be reduced to 88,000 lb. He has indicated to me that a message was announced over the aircraft public address system informing passengers that some luggage had been left behind, and the Melbourne office was then advised of the tag numbers so that passengers could be advised on arrival. As the information that I have does not allow me to answer the honourable senator's question fully I shall seek further information from the TransAustralia Airlines office in Melbourne. </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister responsible for the Commonwealth Police whom, I believe to be the Attorney-General. With reference to the charge against Trevor Wayne Kotz for receiving part of a film from the Weapons Research Establishment, did <inline font-weight="bold">Dr M.</inline> W. Woods, Director of the Establishment, confiscate 40 feet of the same film from a reporter of the Adelaide 'Advertiser' who claimed that the film was obtained from Kotz? If so, why was this fact not disclosed to the court conducting the trial? Had the Commonwealth Police agreed to pay Kotz $300 for information which would lead to the recovery of the whole of the missing film but were they prevented by an order from higher authority to arrest and charge Kotz? </para>

            <para>- I ask a supplementary question. I asked questions about this matter a month ago and one addressed to the Minister for the Interior is still on notice. I ask the Attorney-General: Did the trial magistrate in the case of the Commonwealth v. Kotz express the opinion that a prima facie case for a more serious charge of attempting to obtain money from the Commonwealth Police by false pretences could be made out? Why was Kotz prosecuted on a trivial charge and not on the more serious one? Was the Commonwealth afraid that evidence in rebuttal of the more serious charge or a charge against any person for stealing secret film would expose to other countries the failure of Australian security to protect secret documents? </para>

            <para>- 1 am unable to say whether or not the magistrate used words such as those alleged by the honourable senator or words to that effect but I shall endeavour to find out what he did say. With regard to the charge being dismissed by the magistrate, I can only say that before the magistrate reserved his decision - this is as it has been reported to me - he indicated to the defendant, who had pleaded guilty, that he would consider giving a bond to him if he revealed to the police further information as to where he obtained the stolen material. However, after reserving his decision, the magistrate on the day he delivered his decision said that although the circumstances surrounding the charge might be serious the charge itself was not and he thought that the offence, divorced from matters which he did not think it proper to take into consideration, was trivial, and therefore he dismissed the charge. </para>

          <para>As to the allegation that certain conduct occurred or certain steps were not taken because of a fear that security might be shown to be imperilled, I can assure the honourable senator, as a result of the inquiries I have been able to undertake, that no such consideration was involved. The Commonwealth police at all times have been concerned to ascertain how <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kotz</inline> came into possession of material of which he should not have had possession, and have been diligently ascertaining, as best they are able, the circumstances surrounding the whole of this matter. </para>

I ask: Why was there such a high level representation to celebrate such an undemocratic result? Does this indicate that the Australian Government approved of the method of the election of President Thieu, which excluded all other candidates? If so, why has there been a change of attitude on the part of the Government which previously did not approve of the election and did not send observers? </para>

            <para>-  I am not aware of an increase recently in the practice of pyramid selling but I am aware that there has been an emergence of this trade practice in Australia in recent times. I am not able to say how widespread it is but I am aware that persons have been enticed into the practice and that not only have some fingers been burnt but also some persons have been exposed to bankruptcy or near bankruptcy as a result of undertaking commitments for which they could not obtain the returns which they believed, as a result of the inducements held out to them, they would be able to obtain. I think it is a practice which essentially could be avoided if only people would realise that they cannot be made rich quickly by adopting the practices suggested by those at the top of the pyramid. </para>

          <para>I attended a meeting of the Commonwealth and State Attorneys-General in Hobart last Thursday and Friday at which this matter was discussed. The difficulties of uniform action are very real, just as it is difficult to define the practice of pyramid selling in a way that will prohibit the practice and at the same time not imperil or prejudice what are quite legitimate trading activities. However, as a result of the discussions which took place at that conference. I said that the matter would be looked at in the course of the review of the existing trade practices legislation to which the Government is committed. </para>

          <para>It is true that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poke</inline> asked me a question last week about the determination of an item number in the medical benefits schedule for the service known as venipuncture. As promised. I have had the matter examined. The following information was supplied to me by my Department: Venipuncture is a medical term to describe the taking of a blood, sample for the purpose of a pathology test. In some cases the venipuncture is performed by a doctor who himself carries out the pathological test. In cases of the kind to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poke</inline> apparently refers, the service of venipuncture and the pathology test are regarded as a single medical service for which the medical benefits appropriate to the pathological test are payable. In those cases a separate benefit is not payable for the venipuncture. In other words, one can only claim when it is done by the one person. In other cases the doctor who performs the venipuncture forwards the blood specimen to another doctor - the pathologist - for testing. When this is done the patient of the doctor who carries out the venipuncture may be paid medical benefits for the venipuncture - item 931 of the schedule - or a consultation but not both. That is because a consultation and a venipuncture are regarded as a single medical service. I might add that the question of the retention of item 931 in the schedule of benefits is currently under review. </para>

            <para>- This matter was being considered, to the best of my knowledge, some while ago. What stage it has reached, I do not know. I can understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe's</inline> concern because in the travel agent area from time to time there are occasions when one would like to see a much higher level of responsibility exercised towards people who pay money to travel and who do not get to travel. So I shall inquire for him. The matter has my interest, as well as his. </para>

              <para>- I have found that in the past. Will the Leader of the Government agree that when the Prime Minister operates within Australia he reflects the policies and attitudes of the Liberal and Country Parties and they alone need suffer the embarrassment of any attack  on  his reputation? Will he also agree that when the Prime Minister is overseas his reputation is the concern of all Australians including the Opposition? Will he therefore take steps to advise the Prime Minister's Press officer that the term 'Battling Billy' is  neither  dignified nor acceptable and that its use in Press reports ought to be discouraged, especially before some enterprising journalist adds to the description and so completes our humilitation? </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> in his capacity as  Chairman  of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. I refer to standing order 36a which provides that all regulations and ordinances laid on the table of the Senate, with some exceptions, shall stand referred to such Committee for consideration and, if necessary, report thereon. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> whether his Committee would take into consideration the question of reporting from time to time on those ordinances - some made many years ago - which are no longer subject to disallowance and which may not meet the standards the Committee presently applies to the ordinances which come before it? I may say that it seems certain that some provisions of the regulations and ordinances already on the book  are unconstitutional and that others almost certainly would not meet present requirements. Will he take into consideration the question of whether reports should be made on those regulations? </para>

            <para>I am unable to agree to the honourable senator's request. The referral system introduced on 1st November 1970 is based on long accepted practice within the medical profession. The system is considered necessary because of the large number of services introduced with the new Health Benefits Plan which attract benefits at the higher specialist rates. The system recognises that general practitioners are the doctors of first contact and, as family, doctors, have an overall responsibility for the medical treatment of their patients. Payment of specialist benefits is dependent upon referral by another practitioner and no general exception can be made in the case of women patients. </para>

              <para>and (2) The question of the introduction of colour television in Australia was, late last year, the subject of a most exhaustive examination by the Government having regard to the wide range of information available to it, including a report from the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. As I announced on 14th December 1970, the outcome of the Government's examination of the matter was that it was decided not to declare any date for the introduction of colour television at that stage. I also said that when the Government subsequently agreed to the introduction of colour television, 3 years notice would be given in order to allow industry to prepare adequately. In the circumstances, I cannot say when colour television will be introduced to Australia, but the question will be kept under review. I should add, however, that on the technical side, the Australian Broadcasting Control Board has determined standards which have been made available to the industry. </para>

            <para>In view of the death in Brisbane last Friday of the Filipino boxer Alberto Jangalay, what action does the Postmaster-Genral intend to take to remove the violence of boxing from our television screens in line with the expressed attitude of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board to violence on television? Does the Board require more boxers to die during a televised boxing match before it takes action? </para>

          <para class="block">The Postmaster-General has now furnished me with the following information in reply: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I have discussed the matter raised with the  Chairman  of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board and understand that the bout in question was not in fact televised. With regard to the televising of boxing contests generally, the Board is of the view that it would not be justified in intervening in the present arrangements between television stations and the boxing organisations governing the conduct of boxing programmes. Boxing, which is a widely accepted form of sport in Australia, is permitted by law and is conducted under accepted rules with the proper supervision of a qualified referee who has regard to the apparent condition of the contestants during the course of the bout. </para>

              <para>The Director-General of Health has drawn my attention to the recommendations of the World Health Organisation on smoking.

These latter recommendations would of course come within the jurisdiction of my colleague, the Treasurer. So far as the other recommendations are concerned,- I should firstly  state  that the action which the Commonwealth  can take in  these areas  is  limited. <inline font-weight="bold">Major areas</inline> of responsibility  lie  within the jurisdiction of the individual State Governments. In  the  mainland Territories,  the  Commonwealth  has  intensified health education programmes  to  discourage smoking, and  is co-operating  with the education authorities  in  developing effective health education programmes  in the  health aspects of smoking. </para>

          <para>Concerning warning labels on cigarette packets  the  Commonwealth Government has undertaken  to  introduce complementary legislation when all  State  Governments  have  implemented measures requiring such labels. </para>
          <para>Action has also been taken by the Commonwealth Government  to  curtail the advertising of cigarettes on television and radio. The voluntary code governing such advertisements was recently revised, in  co-operation  with the cigarette manufacturers, media representatives and broadcasting authorities, to both restrict the times at which cigarette advertisements may be shown and to shift the emphasis of these advertisements away from young people, particularly children. The revised code took effect from 1st October 1971. </para>

              <para>Until 16th August 1971, Ansett Airlines of Australia operated 2 services  a  week from Brisbane to Dirranbandi, and 3 services  a  week from Dirranbandi to Brisbane, using Fokker Friendship and Twin Otter aircraft. On 16th August, the timetable was altered to provide  a  twice-weedly service in each direction, and Cessna 402A aircraft replaced the larger Friendship and Twin Otter types. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>With the alteration to the timetable on 16th August, the only weekend service operated, the Saturday service from Dirranbandi to Brisbane, was discontinued. On 23rd September, however, following discussions with its local agents, the airline again revised its timetable to provide a service in each direction between Brisbane and Dirranbandi on Fridays. This further adjustment to its services was a reflection of its desire to provide the community with the service it required. The question of the adequacy or otherwise of the mail service to Dirranbandi is properly one for my colleague the Postmaster-General, but, for my part, I am not aware that the airline has received complaints in this regard. </para>

              <para>I have discussed with Ansett Airlines the service provided to Dirranbandi. I am informed that, for the year ended 30th June 1971, the average weekly uplift of passengers at Dirranbandi was only 6 or an average of 2 per flight. On the basis of these traffic statistics the airline believes that the present frequency is adequate. I concur with this view. </para>

            <para>The procedures worked out in the recent discussions in Washington on South Pacific air services involve each Government in scrutinising new frequency applications by their respective carriers and in accepting a common basis for measuring the current and future size of the AustraliaUnited States of America traffic market. It is open to either Government to express its concern on capacity increases before new frequencies take effect. After the new schedules have come into effect they can, following a specified but limited period of operating experience, be discussed between the governments. Both governments are fully aware of the difficulties involved in an excess capacity situation. The new procedures should be helpful in enabling them to keep this problem under constant review and to make appropriate adjustments if, and when, the traffic and capacity situation demands it. </para>

              <para>The Royal Australian Air Force establishment at Regents Park is No. 2 Stores Depot, a functional storage facility for bulk stocks of equipment. In accordance with recommendations by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works (3rd Report of 1971), the area owned by the RAAF at Chester Hill, which is in close proximity to Regents Park, is to be developed to provide domestic accommodation for Service personnel employed at No. 2 Stores Depot and at other RAAF units in the Sydney metropolitan area. Work at Chester Hill is planned for construction in the financial year 1972-73. Redevelopment of storage facilities at the Regents Park site has also reached an advanced stage of planning and proposals will in due course be submitted for consideration by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works. </para>

            <para>Some unconfirmed reports concerning likely reductions in Japanese imports of Australian minerals have come to my attention. With the current economic slow-down in Japan and the recent United Slates economic measures affecting Japanese exports to that country it is a logical assumption that there may be some reduction in the level of Japanese mineral imports. However, earlier this month the Japanese Government introduced  a  supplementary budget designed to stimulate the country's economy. Following this action, the Japanese Economic Agency, which advises the Government on economic matters, forecast that the Japanese economy should return to an annual growth rate of 10 per cent by mid-1972. Any fall away in Japan's industrial requirements of raw materials including minerals is therefore expected to be comparatively short-lived, and it might well be that imports of minerals from Australia may not be adversely affected to any significant extent during this period. At the same time, even accepting the possibility of some reduction in our exports to Japan, new markets being developed, such as coal and iron ore for Europe and coal to South America, hold promise of absorbing any surplus of mineral stocks in Australia. In these circumstances, it would appear that the Australian economy is not likely to suffer  a  serious set back from any short term reduced demand in Japan for the range of minerals which we supply  in  quantity to that market. Likewise, mineral development projects in Northern Australia should not be adversely affected by the current Japanese market situation, as the likelihood of new world market outlets can be expected to widen and increase overseas demand for our minerals. </para>

For a call of 3 minutes at the day rate they vary from 19 cents for calls between exchanges in the zones of the respective municipalities closest to each other, to  57  cents for those furthest apart. The charge for calls between any two exchanges is, of course, the same in both directions. </para>

              <para>Japanese investment constitutes only a small proportion of foreign investment in the Australian mining industry. However, with Japanese industry becoming more dependent upon Australian minerals, Japanese investment in this industry is increasing. In line with the Japanese Government's resources policy Japanese investors are interested in securing greater participation in the development of overseas resources, including those of Australia, and they have generally expressed preference for joint venture type operations. New investment is expected to contribute to Australia's overall mining and industrial development, particularly in Northern Australia. It also reflects the growing trade and financial co-operation between Australia and Japan which is the basis of some 27 per cent of our export income. </para>

            <item label="(2)">
              <para>and (3) It is not believed that Japanese companies have stockpiled sufficient minerals, especially iron ore and coal, which could lead to major reductions in overseas orders of minerals to the extent that it would create financial difficulties for An str ali an mining companies. However, the current Japanese economic slowdown, coupled with the effects of the United States economic measures, has naturally led to some build up of stocks of minerals and raw materials in Japan as industrial production has slowed. Although there is a possibility that this will result in some slackening in Japanese mineral import requirements, indications are that if any reductions occur, they will be manageable and temporary. Any reductions should not create ser ions difficulties for Australian mining companies in the short term and new world market prospects particularly for iron ore and coal, are developing satisfactorily. </para>

            <para>The Commonwealth Council for National Fitness did arrange for a survey to be conducted into the fitness of Australian secondary school students between the age of 13 and 17 years. Survey testing was carried out with the assistance of the Slate Education Departments in 1969 and 1970 and a draft report to the Council received preliminary consideration at its meeting in June this year. It will receive further consideration at the next meeting of the Council which is scheduled for early 1972. At this stage I cannot say when its findings will be made available. </para>

            <para>With the introduction of daylight saving in the eastern States imminent would any consideration be given by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board to changing the cut-off times for general viewing - this relates, in particular, to the times of programmes watched by children - on television to adapt to the adjusted social patterns that will inevitably accompany this scheme </para>

          <quote>
            <para>As the honourable senator is probably aware, the Television Programme Standards of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board provide that nothing unsuitable for children's and family viewing shall be televised between 4.00 p.m. and 7.30 p.m. on week-days and before 7.30 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday. </para>
            <para>The Board is aware of the possible implications of the introduction of daylight saving in relation to the televising of evening programmes. The Board does not consider any alterations are necessary at this stage but the honourable senator may be assured that it will be watching the position closely. In this connection the Board is guided partly by the fact that no particular problems have been encountered with television programmes in Tasmania, where daylight saving has operated for some years. </para>
            <para>It would seem to be reasonable to assume that, after a short period of re-adjustment, no real difficulties should arise from the televising of adult programmes at their normal times. It will of course be necessary for parents to accept responsibility, as they are obliged to do now, for what their children view after 7.30 p.m. </para>

          <para class="block">The purpose of the Bill is to amend section 7 of the Stevedoring Industry Act 1956-1966 to give effect to changes which have taken place in the Port of Darwin upon the North Australian Workers'  Union application for de-registration as an organisation under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Since 1920 the North Australian Workers' Union (NAWU) has been the principal employee organisation operating in the Northern Territory and as such it has until recently recruited into its membership the registered waterside workers employed in the Port of Darwin. This position was recognised under the Stevedoring Industry Act by the definition which appears in section 7 (1) in respect of 'union' as follows:   "Union" means the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, the North Australian Workers Union or any organisation of employees specified in a declaration in force under section nine of this Act and "the Union" means - </para>

          </list>
          <para class="block">Subsequently in 1969 the North Australian Workers Union sought affiliation with the Federated Miscellaneous Workers Union of Australia, an organisation also registered under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The necessary procedures under that Act have been complied with and, following hearings by the Industrial Registrar together with certain appeals before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Aird, have resulted in the request being granted. During the course of these proceedings it was agreed that the Waterside Workers Federation should take over the North Australian Workers Union waterfront section' comprising all of the registered waterside workers in the port of Darwin and recruiting them into full membership of the Federation. </para>
          <para>To all intents and purposes, the North Australian Workers Union has now ceased to exist as a registered organisation and until the Waterside Workers Federation is recognised as the appropriate union in the port of Darwin there is an administrative void in respect of that port. The amendment seeks to correct the position by changing the definition of 'union' as it presently appears in section 7 (1.) of the Act by deleting the reference to the North Australian Workers Union in the preamble and elsewhere and according recognition of the Waterside Workers Federation. This is a simple administrative matter which is being introduced with the consent of all parties concerned in the stevedoring industry and I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

            <para>That the Bill be now read a second time. </para>
          </motion>
          <para class="block">There are 2 main purposes of this Bill, which relates to the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory. One is to make provision with respect to the tenure of office of the Judges of the Court. The other is to provide for the appointment of another Judge. Because this latter amendment affects the operation of the appropriation section in the principal Act, it was necessary for the Bill to be introduced first in another place. The present position is that the Supreme Court of the Territory consists of 2 Judges appointed under sub-section (1.) of section 7 and such 'additional Judges' as have been appointed under sub-section (2.) of that section. To be eligible for appointment as an 'additional Judge' a person must already be a Judge of another Commonwealth Court. There are at present 6 such additional Judges and they are all Judges of the Commonwealth Industrial Court. </para>
          <para>The number of Judges that may be appointed under sub-section (1.) of section 7 was increased earlier this year from one to 2 by the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court Act 1971. This was to provide for the appointment of a Judge who would become the first  Chairman  of the Law Reform Commission of the Territory. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Blackburn has since been appointed to this judicial office and also to the position of  Chairman  of the Law Reform Commission. The Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory was established on the basis that it was a Federal court for the purposes of the Commonwealth Constitution and that the tenure of office of the Judges of the Court was accordingly governed by provisions in Chapter III of the Constitution. That is to say, the Act was enacted on the basis that a Judge of the Court would hold office for life, subject to resignation or removal from office on an address of both Houses of Parliament for proved misbehaviour or incapacity. </para>
          <para>In April of this year the High Court of Australia decided, in the case of Capital TV and Appliances Ltd v Falconer, that the Supreme Court of the Territory was not a Federal court, but a court of the Territory. A consequence of that decision is that the provisions in the Constitution with respect to the tenure of office of Federal Judges are not applicable to the Judges of the Supreme Court of the Territory. The High Court's decision has accordingly disclosed a need for the tenure of the Judges of the Territory Court to be provided for by statute and the present Bill makes such provision. </para>
          <para>The Bill amends section  7  to provide that a judge appointed under sub-section  (1.)  is to hold office until he attains the age of  70  years. There is an undoubted trend these days against life appointments and. in relation to judges, this has resulted in retiring ages being fixed in all the States. In each of the States except Victoria, the retirement age is  70;  in Victoria, the retirement age fixed is  72  years. The requirement of the Bill that judges retire at  70  years of age is subject to an exception in the case of a judge who held office on the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory on the date of the High Court's decision in the Capital TV case. Appointments made prior to that decision were made and accepted on the basis that they carried life tenure and that basis should not be varied at this stage. </para>
          <para>The tenure to be provided for the additional judges must take account of the fact that the primary judicial appointments of such judges will generally be to Federal courts and accordingly governed by the Constitution. The Bill provides, therefore, that an additional judge is to hold office as such while he continues as a judge of another court created by the Parliament. It has been necessary also to make provision as to the removal of judges from office. In this regard the Bill introduces a provision which, in its effect, is the same as the provisions that apply to judges of Federal courts. </para>
          <para>The second of the major amendments effected by the Bill is to be found in clause  5.  Experience over the last year has made it clear that another judge without conflicting commitments to a court outside the Territory is needed to enable the Supreme Court of the Territory to deal with the cases coming before it. There is at present a waiting period of approximately  8  to  10  months from the time a civil case is set down for trial to the time when it can be heard. Honourable senators will agree, I am sure, that this is a quite unsatisfactory position. Recently <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Blackburn has been giving a great deal of his time in assisting with the judicial work of the Court, but it is desirable that he should be able to devote most of his time to his duties as  Chairman  of the Law Reform Commission. This will be facilitated by the appointment of the further judge provided for in this Bill. </para>
          <para>I come now to the amendments concerning matters of procedure. Clause  7  of the Bill amends section  8  to enable the jurisdiction of the Court to be exercised in appropriate cases by the Registrar. The classes of matters that the Registrar may deal with will be specified in the Rules of Court, and there will be an appeal to a judge. This amendment will bring the Supreme Court of the Territory into line with the Supreme Courts of the States by making available a procedure long accepted as necessary to the proper working of a superior court. </para>
          <para>The first amendment effected by clause  8  relates to the exercise by the court of disciplinary powers over legal practitioners. Under section  8aa  of the Act, a matter arising under an ordinance and relating to the professional behaviour of a legal practitioner is to be dealt with by a court constituted by  3  judges. However, such matters may arise otherwise than under an ordinance, and these are at present left to be dealt with by a single judge. The Bill removes this inconsistency by making all matters relating to the conduct of legal practitioners cognisable by a court of 3 judges. As the Act stands, the only matters that may be dealt with by 3 judges sitting together are those which relate to the admission and professional behaviour of legal practitioners. However, there may be other matters in which it is desirable that more than one judge be present. For example, a matter may raise a question of lav/ that has been the subject of differing opinions expressed by the judges and for the resolution of which it is desirable that a court of 3 judges be constituted. Clause 9 therefore introduces a new provision to enable the jurisdiction of the Court to be exercised by not fewer than 3 judges whenever it can be shown to the satisfaction of a judge that such a procedure is desirable. </para>
          <para>Section 28 of the Act at present vests the power to make Rules of Court in the judge of the Supreme Court. Consistently with the increase in the number of judges provided for by this Bill, clause 11(a) provides for the rule-making power to be vested in the judges appointed under subsection (1.) of section 7 or any 2 of them. </para>
          <para>Clause 11(d) includes amongst the matters on which Rules of Court may be made the qualifications for admission of legal practitioners in the Territory. This matter is at present governed by an ordinance, but it is usual for the judges of a court to regulate certain aspects of the requirements for admission to their court. The amendment will accordingly bring the Territory into line with the position in the States. The Act at present authorises Rules of Court providing for the service and execution of the process of the Court. Tt goes on, however, to mention specifically service of process outside the jurisdiction as a matter on which Rules may be made but makes no mention of execution of process outside the jurisdiction. This approach has given rise to certain doubts in the minds of practitioners as to the means by which process of the Court may be executed outside the Territory. To enable these doubts to be overcome, clause 11(e) of the Bill provides for the extension of section 28 to authorise Rules dealing with execution - as well as service - of process outside the Territory. The disallowance of a Rule of Court does not, at present, revive a Rule revoked by the disallowed Rule. Clause 11(f) of the Bill reverses this situation, thereby bringing the position regarding Rules into line with that obtaining in respect of Ordinances. </para>
          <para>The only remaining amendment of substance is effected by clause 13. Under sections 38 and 39 of the Act, evidence at the hearing of a cause must, as a general rule, be given orally unless the parties agree to the contrary. Evidence of particular facts may, however, be given by affidavit where good reason can be shown. It seems desirable that greater flexibility in the use of affidavit evidence be allowed and the proposed section 39 accordingly provides that a judge may order that all or part of the evidence be produced on affidavit. The existing provisions for giving evidence by affidavit have not been used in criminal proceedings, and the proposed section 39 is so drawn as to confine the procedure to civil matters. The remaining amendments effected by the Bill are of a minor nature and merely consequential on those I have outlined. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

          <para class="block">The primary purpose of this Bill is to amend the Northern Territory Supreme Court Act to make provision with respect to the tenure of office of judges of the Supreme Court. The Bill also includes several amendments relating to the procedure of the Court. The need for amendment of the Act in relation to the tenure of office of judges was disclosed by the decision of the High Court in the case of Capital TV and Appliances Ltd v. Falconer. The effect of that decision was outlined in my speech on the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court Bill (No. 2) 1971, and I will not detain the Senate by repeating what I then said. It will be sufficient, I think, for me to point out that the same need for legislative provision exists in the Northern Territory as in the Australian Capital Territory, and the amendment effected by this Bill is identical with that of the earlier Bill. The judge appointed under sub-section (1.) of section 7 of the Act - there is provision for only one such judge in the Northern Territory - will hold office until he attains the age of 70 years. An additional judge will hold office whilst he continues to be a member of another court created by the Parliament, and the provisions governing removal from office will be the same as those applying to judges of Federal courts. </para>
          <para>Of the remaining amendments effected by this Bill the following have their counterparts in the Bill already introduced to amend the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court Act: (I) Clause 4 relating to the exercise of jurisdiction by the Master of the Supreme Court; (2) clause 6 regarding the use of affidavits; (3) clause 7 (b) relating to the execution of the process of the Court outside the jurisdiction. </para>
          <para>The one amendment that is peculiar to this Bill is to be found in clause 7 (c). The purpose of the amendment is to bring the Northern Territory provisions regarding disallowance of Rules of Court into line wilh those in the Australian Capital Territory as amended by the recently introduced Bill.

          <para>- Before moving the motion for the adjournment of the Senate I inform honourable senators of the passing of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr William</inline> Heatley who had been a senator in this place. Ex-senator William Clarence Heatley was a man of many parts. In his time he had been a jackeroo, a timber executive, a sheep and cattle station proprietor and a decorated soldier. He was a director of a prawn trawling company and was notable as a senator from Queensland. As a member of the forces he started at the bottom and ended his service as a captain. There was not much that Bill Heatley did not put his hand to during his life, and he was successful in whatever job he undertook. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Bill Heatley was educated at All Souls College at Charters Towers, at Townsville Grammar School and at the Southport School. During his war service he saw action in Tobruk, Syria, El Alamein and New Guinea. He was wounded in action and was mentioned in dispatches. On 14th April 1966, following the death of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sherrington,</inline> he was appointed to the Senate for Queensland by the Governor-General under section 15 of the Constitution. He quickly made his mark in this chamber and became a member of the Senate Select Committee on Offshore Petroleum Resources from 19th December 1967 until his defeat in June 1968.  His  absence from politics was short as he soon became a member of the Parliament of Queensland. After gaining pre-selection he entered and won a three-cornered byelection contest following the death of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Carey,</inline> the member for the electorate of Albert. </para>
        <para>Those of us in this place who were privileged to work alongside the late Bill Heatley are aware that his far-reaching experience enabled him to bring to the chamber a quite distinctive flair and style. I am sure that all honourable senators would wish to join with the Premier of Queensland, his fellow Queensland parliamentarians and indeed the people of Queensland in extending sympathy to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Heatley</inline> and her 4 children. </para>
        <para>I take this opportunity also to say to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> thai we are all sad for him at the loss of his mother. She was an elderly lady. This is a bereavement that we all have to endure at some time or other. The loss of a mother is particularly sad because she is the one to whom we all looked for love and comfort in our earlier years. I am sure  1  speak on behalf of all senators when I say that we extend our sincere sympathy to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill.</inline></para>

        <para>On behalf of the Opposition I should like also to extend to our colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> our sympathy with him in the loss of his mother. She was born in Bankstown, a suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, married a gas worker and lived a hard vigorous life. She lived through the depression, a period when one needed all the qualities that she had if one was to survive and bring up a family. She followed public affairs right up until the day of her death. She was an avid reader of newspapers and political journals, not only those published in Sydney but also those from Canberra. She listened to the debates of Parliament and particularly, of course, to the speeches of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill.</inline> She was a very strong critic of him. She was a quite hard taskmaster and let him know when he was straying from the paths of good advocacy or good politics. It is nice to know that  a  person can lead a life of interest, not only in the affairs of her own family but also in the affairs of the nation. She lived a useful life,  a  good life,  a  satisfying life and a full life. It is pleasing to know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> was able to be with her in her last hours on this earth. We all regret her passing, but it was  a  passing after a full and enjoyable life. </para>

          <para>- It is with sincere regret that I rise to join with the Leader  of  the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson)</inline> and the Leader  of  the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> in their expressions of sympathy to the widow and family of the late Bill Heatley who died very unexpectedly and prematurely last Friday. I had the pleasure of knowing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Heatley</inline> for many years. He was a son of a well known and highly respected Townsville family. Although I did not come in contact with him frequently until he came to the Senate, I knew sufficient of him to know that he was a man of very modest character. He was unostentatious. He was very knowledgeable with regard to the resources of Queensland and he applied himself diligently to his pursuits. In the short time that he was in the Senate he showed by his speeches that he had a very deep knowledge of public affairs and that he was devoting himself assiduously and effectively to the work associated with his parliamentary duties and as a member of a Government party. </para>

        <para>After his retirement from this place, he entered the State parliament when he won a by-election following the death of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Carey.</inline> Whilst I know that he would have been very happy to return to the Senate, he was doing a very good job as a State parliamentarian. Of course, we all are very sorry for his widow and his family. I knew <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Heatley</inline> as a schoolgirl. She is the daughter of a highly respected medico in South Brisbane, the electorate which I represented for 28 years. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Heatley's</inline> death is a great sorrow for her and her family. We hope that the good Lord will comfort her in her sorrow. </para>
        <para>I also join with the Leader of the Government and the Leader of the Opposition in expressing sympathy to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> on the loss of his mother. When people advance to a great age we expect death, but that does not lessen our sorrow when death comes. Our memories go back to our childhood days when we were nurtured, fondled, guided and protected by our mothers. No-one else can give us the consolations and the comforts that a mother can. Irrespective of how old we might get and of how we might grow up, their interest in us never lessens. They feel that they are there to help us with direction, with advice and, as the Leader of the Opposition said, with criticism where they believe that it is deserved and timely. We never repay them for all those things. The death of  a  mother is  a  big loss. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill's</inline> mother had reached a ripe age and death was something that one could expect. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Heatley</inline> was only 51 years of age.  His  death was untimely and premature. On behalf of my colleagues and myself, 1 sympathise with the bereaved in both cases. </para>

          <para>- As one who came into this place following the retirement of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Heatley</inline> after the Senate election in 1967 and as one who knew him, his wife and his family personally, I pay my small tribute of regard and express my sorrow at his unfortunate and premature passing. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Heatley</inline> was, as has been said, a man of quiet disposition and gentle character.  His  private secretary, Miss Hanman, is now my private secretary. Therefore I am able to assess, in a sense, the type of work which interested him most and with which he identified himself most closely. He was interested in people. He was concerned about and solicitous for individual welfare. Many people who were <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Heatley's</inline> concern, whose cases he fostered over the years and for whom he attempted to obtain some amelioration of apparently harsh administrative decisions still come to me today. Those who wrote in still write with affection and regard for the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Heatley.</inline> I convey to the family of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Heatley</inline> - his sons and daughter and his widow - my personal sorrow. I trust, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> said, that they will be comforted in the sadness which has come upon them. </para>

        <para>I join with other senators in expressing, my sorrow at the passing of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill^</inline> mother. One's mother is a most precious and only once given gift. I am sure that particularly those of us who have been through the same sorrow will feel for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> in his tremendous deprivation. </para>
