            <para>- by leave - Leaving politics aside, the Australian Labor Party would like to congratulate the new Ministers who have been appointed to the Ministry; in particular, the new Minister in this chamber, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood,</inline> who is now the Minister for Health. My Party has also noted the announcement which was made elsewhere about the future of the former Minister for Housing, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline> Annabelle Rankin. My colleagues and I are pleased that she is going to do something which apparently she wants to do. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Information has been given about not only what is being done in relation to the Ministry but also what is proposed to be done if certain legislation is passed. All I can say is that it is pleasing to note that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> has indicated that these steps are conditional upon the Parliament agreeing to his proposal for the appointment of an additional Minister. The Prime Minister has extraordinary optimism if the rumours that the 27th position has been offered to about 30 people are true. The Australian Labor Party may be able to relieve him of the difficult task of having to meet that obligation. My Party hopes that the new Minister for Health will do well in his job. All I would say in conclusion is that there is a clear necessity for the Minister for Health to deal with this sick Government. </para>

              <para>-  There is an old saying that the higher one goes up the further one has to fall. I think that has happened to some people. The fact remains, as I was saying when 1 was interrupted, that the position of Minister of the Crown, particularly in the Commonwealth Parliament, is not an easy one; indeed, it is an onerous one. This position calls for great industry and also close application to and knowledge of the problems of the country. </para>

              <para>- I suppose 1 have been lucky in many ways. However, I am in the position of being able to say that I am probably the longest serving parliamentarian in Australia today, having been first elected to a parliament on 11th June 1932. 1 am still going strong, too. 1 am like Johnny Walker in that I am still going strong and will continue to do so. I have a record of which anyone . would have every good reason to be proud. I was pointing out before I was interrupted that the task of a Minister of the Crown is one which calls for application, assiduity and devotion. I have been asked , by members of the Press media and others to comment on the appointments to the new Ministry and my reply has been that. under the system that obtains when a coalition government is in power it is the. province and the responsibility of the leader qf the coalition government to select his team. He has done that. My only hope, and I think the hope of all Australians who believe that this country merits good government, is that the Government and the. Ministry chosen will prove to be in the interests of Australia and the people who are privileged to live here. </para>

We in Queensland have been very proud of her performance and we are sorry that she is leaving Australia, temporarily anyway. I take the opportunity to wish her a very pleasant and successful term of office as Australia&#39;s representative in New Zealand. </para>

            <para>- Very late in September last a draft of the report was shown to me in passing. I did not have a chance to read it. It finally came as a concluded document in about mid-October. It was then given to the Department of Civil Aviation as the Department which would have to carry this work right through <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> completion and do a detailed study. This the Department did. That detailed study took a long rime and was not completed until some time early in January. I then went through it myself and 1 also went out by myself to inspect a number of proposed places where it was thought, the second airport might be located, lt was then very clear - in due course I think honourable senators will understand why - that consultation with the State Government was quite essential. Those honourable senators who have studied this matter - and many people have - will have noted some earlier comments 1 made about the area of cost in relation to the Tullamarine Airport. Sydney&#39;s second airport, which will be essential in due course, will COSt far more than Tullamarine ever did. I. repeat that it was very clear that the State Government had to be consulted. </para>

              <para>- This might take a little while. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fitzgerald</inline> has expressed some interest, and I would like to answer the question fully. The State Government had to be consulted in the fullest possible sense. I was in the process of getting ready to do thai when it announced its State election. I thought that it would be proper for mc to wait until that was concluded. Once that was concluded 1 had my work in train. We had one or two problems of our own here. Therefore, I was not able to consult the Stale Government, in the fullest sense of the word, until last week. At the Premier&#39;s request I had firstly a discussion with his nominated  deputy  for this purpose, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Willis.</inline> I had a very detailed talk with the Premier yesterday. I am now in the process of putting the whole thing together with a view to it being submitted to both governments. </para>

          <para>The tabling of the report in due course is part of a general question as to what one should do about tabling reports in an overall sense. 1 express only my own view in relation to this. In due course one would want to be able to do this if it were possible, but there are some considerations that make the tabling of the report a little more difficult than one might perhaps at first imagine. The problem that one has in relation to this is that there is speculation and that that speculation, if allowed to run unchecked, could have a detrimental effect on people and on land values. Therefore I have been extraordinarily careful in what I have said. But the Senate has my assurance that there will be consultation on the matter, which is very involved. If the scheme is put into operation great expenditure will be involved. As and when I can, I will see that the honourable senator has all the information that 1 can give him. </para>

Will the Minister consider having an investigation made into these allegations and will he have the facts, when ascertained, made available to the Senate? Can the Minister confirm that a strike of workers in one plant has caused an interruption to production and perhaps some shortage in supply? Will the Minister also take into account the fact that during the last few years some manufacturers of margarine in New South Wales intentionally created an artificial shortage of their product so as to influence the deliberations of a meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council? </para>

If this is correct and if we are unable to. market our full wheat production or supply hunger ridden countries would this not be a means of using our surplus production and, at the same time, reducing the cost of housing since the cost of this process is said to be less than one-third the cost of other materials?

            <para>- Many suggestions are put forward from time to time as to what can be done with wheat. Some of them have a lot of substance while others are just catchcrys. One recent suggestion of which I am thinking is that the surplus production of wheat should be turned into grain alcohol. We all know that grain alcohol can be made from wheat but whether it is an economic proposition is another thing. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hannan</inline> has suggested that this matter of making bricks might be looked into. I put the suggestion before the Senate that in all these matters a quantity of wheat must be available for a particular project,- year in and year out, irrespective of the other markets around the world and home consumption. Another matter which I think should be taken into consideration is the price which has to be paid for wheat. The farmer must receive a reasonable cost of production for his grain. Whether this is an economic proposition or not 1 do not know but I shall make inquiries for the honourable senator and Jet him have what information I can obtain. </para>

            <para>- I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for National Development. As the price for Australian indigenous crude oil was set in relation to the 196S import parity price of SI. 89 per barrel for a 5 year period and as today&#39;s import price is $2.31 per barrel, an increase of 42 cents per barrel, and in view of the anticipated increase in import parity prices to $2.65 per barrel by 1975, an increase of some 76 cents per barrel, is it not a fact that Government policy in relation to the setting of the price for indigenous crude oil has saved the Australian motorist and other users of petroleum products many millions of dollars? </para>

            <para>- For some time I have had some information on this matter. I think honourable senators will recall that in 1968 - I am not sure which month - the Government negotiated a price for Australian produced crude oil which was based on import parity. I think it was done in or about September of 1968. Recently, large increases have been announced in the price of overseas crudes. When compared to prices at which indigenous crude oil is available these new prices show increases per barrel of the order mentioned by the honourable senator. In view of these increases Australia is fortunate that it has available to the refiners and marketers of petroleum products a source of crude oil which now supplies 50 per cent and which will shortly supply 70 per cent of our crude oil requirements at a price which is considerably lower than that of most overseas crudes. This is most important because of the very large import savings that have resulted and will continue to result from the supply of crude oil from our own fields. At peak production this import saving would amount to about $325m a year. It is also important to note that, because of Government policy that stabilised the price of indigenous crude oil, the Australian market has been insulated to a marked extent from the effects of the recent steep rises in the cost of overseas crude oil. If the rises in overseas crude oil prices were to be reflected in the price paid for indigenous crude oil, the added cost of crude oil today would be about $50m a year and, at peak production rates, with a price disparity of 76c a barrel, could rise to Si 00m a year. </para>

Has the Commonwealth Government accepted the establishment of an Omega installation on Australian territory and has Tasmania been chosen as the likely site for such an installation? Is not the Omega network associated with the use of nuclear weapons, especially submarine missile carriers, which would draw nuclear retaliation on its sites? Has the New Zealand Government refused to allow an Omega station to be installed on its territory? Would the installation of an Omega station in Tasmania constitute that State as a nuclear target? </para>

            <para>- The Senate will be aware of the statement made by the Prime Minister of this country on 22nd March. It was stated then that this Omega system is a general purpose, worldwide navigation system that can be used by ships and aircraft of any type fitted with the appropriate equipment, but the system is not sufficiently accurate for use either in close coastal waters or by ballistic missile submarines. The statement went on to say that the station proposed for South Pacific waters was one of the 8 stations proposed for the world network and that the control of it would be in the hands of an international body constituted by the countries in which the various stations were located. I am aware that there have been subsequent disputes initiated by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in another place, and I can inform the Senate that I expect that a further statement will be made on behalf of the Government this week. </para>

Is it a fact that Government cutbacks and/or the effects of Government policies have resulted in a substantial decline in passenger travel on the Australian domestic airlines and in some cases have meant a reduction of staff? Does - the Minister expect this decline to continue, with corresponding reductions in flights and/or standards of services? If so, what action can be taken to correct this situation? Also, is the current squeeze likely :,.to affect the announced orders by both airlines for additional Boeing 727-200&#39; jets for delivery between 1972 and 1974? . </para>

            <para>- It is a fact that both the domestic airline business- and the international airline business are affected by market growth. It is also a fact that within Australia there has been a marked slowing down in airline traffic growth in the last 3 months. This is attributed to various causes, one of which is said to be the Government&#39;s setting out to try -to save expenditure as far as it possibly could. This could well be part of the reason. Part of the reason also is likely to.be the fact that the rural economy is hot having a very easy time. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The equipment programme for any airline is based upon the market situation. If the market situation tends to flatten, the airlines are much less in need of new equipment than they would be normally. It is true also that the Australian aviation business has shown marked fluctuations in its growth patterns . through time, but despite all of this the general, line of growth continues steadily upwards. I have no later figures on this but I do know that the domestic situation has slowed down and I am informed that the international situation has slowed down, as well. This has delayed some of the training programmes, as one would &#34;expect it to do. Perhaps this will cause the airlines to be less anxious to get new aircraft very quickly. I do not know that. This is completely in a state of flux at present. There were some indications last weekend that growth was returning in the domestic area. </para>

I am confident that the organisations will bear that in mind when they fix any new benefit tables. As the honourable senator is aware, the National Health Act gives power to the Minister for Health to approve, and thereby to determine, the rates of benefits and contributions. As to the other part of the honourable senator&#39;s question which relates to increased contributions, 1 think that before that question can be answered it is necessary to determine the extent to which hospital charges may be increased. I understand that it is likely that there will be some increase in hospital charges. Therefore it is probable that there will be some increase, though one hopes not a great increase, in the contributions which will have to be made. </para>

            <para>- My question is addressed to the Minister for Civil Aviation. Will the cutting of Trans Australia Airlines schedules give a decided advantage to Ansett Airlines of Australia on certain routes, including the Melbourne to Canberra service? Has TAA Flight 496, which normally leaves Melbourne for Canberra at approximately 7.15 on most evenings, been permanently cancelled? ls Ansett Airlines now the sole company operating a flight at approximately this time to Canberra from Melbourne? ls it also a fact that Ansett Airlines Flight 396 left Melbourne last night with a near capacity load and that more than 50 per cent of the passengers would normally have travelled with TAA? Does this mean that rationalisation of flights on economic grounds will be carried out to the advantage of Ansett Airlines? </para>

            <para>- My understanding is that, in a situation in which the market tends to slow down a little, both the Australian National Airlines Commission, which operates Trans Australia Airlines, and Ansett Airlines of Australia operate in conjunction on a basis which, I imagine, gives to each a fair share of the market and enables the best use to be made of equipment when it is not all being totally used. I imagine that the airline companies would still be doing that and I do not see why they should not do so. As to the other inquiry about flights 496 and 396, I shall have to seek information for the honourable senator from the operators concerned. </para>

At the time I told him that a case was being prepared by the industry to forward to the State Government and that the State Government was preparing a case to forward to the Commonwealth. I think on one occasion I went so far as to say that the Commonwealth had received a case for financial assistance from the State. Other than that I have no information. However, I shall check for the honourable senator and if I can obtain some further information I shall give it to him. </para>

            <para>- I address my question to the Minister for Health. I remind him that on 18th February I asked the then Minister for Health a question concerning the banning of cigarette advertising on television and was given the stock reply of the tobacco industry. In referring to the then Minister for Health perhaps 1 should have referred to the Department of Health, because I addressed my question to the Minister who was then representing the then Minister for Health, f ask: Was the then Minister unaware that British, United States and Canadian reports have all stressed the need to ban cigarette advertising on television? Is the Minister aware that the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council has advocated the cessation of such advertising? Why would the former Minister for Health prefer to accept the twaddle of the tobacco industry rather than advice from his own National Health and Medical Research Council? </para>

            <para>- I am not aware of the detailed nature of the reply which the honourable senator received from my predecessor. However, I am quite sure that my predecessor would have been aware that cigarette advertising on television has been banned in the United States since the beginning of this year, in the United Kingdom for the last 5 years, and is also banned in Canada. I am equally sure that he would have been aware of the opinion expressed by the National Health and Medical Research Council, I think in 1 969. I believe it is unfair of the honourable senator to suggest that my predecessor would merely give the stock reply of the tobacco interests. The honourable senator will be aware that a variety of factors determine whether the banning of cigarette advertising on television achieves the purposes of those who advocate the ban. For example, although cigarette advertising on television has been banned in the United Kingdom for 5 years it is not clear that there has been in that country any decrease in the consumption of cigarettes, because the tobacco industry has been able to exploit alternative methods of advertis ing to offset the ban on television advertising. I mention those matters simply to give an indication of the fact that there is a complex of questions which have to be considered. I assure the honourable senator that, insofar as the question he directed to me is concerned, I will be making an intensive study of it. </para>

Is he also aware that many charter and commuter companies are in the hands of receivers or are in the process of being declared bankrupt as a result of the same economic restrictions? Will the Minister inform the Parliament whether he is prepared to take the necessary steps to abolish the parallel take-off and landing system and replace it with a rationalised system whereby both major airlines will be able to operate to the benefit of passengers the new reduced number of flights? Will he also undertake an investigation of the reasons for the failure of these charter and commuter companies and assist where possible small airway concerns to maintain the services which are relied on very heavily at present by people in country areas? </para>

            <para>- I wrote down fairly quickly what I. thought were the 4 points raised by the honourable senator in his question. The honourable senator said that the major airlines were in financial trouble. That is not my information. 1 have not been told that by them. The fact that their business has decreased has placed upon them the necessity of making some economies in their own operations. However, this does not indicate financial troubles and I think the honourable senator&#39;s conclusion is unwarranted at the moment. It is not true that a lot of the charter companies are in the hands of liquidators or are bankrupt, but it is true that some of them are and for a variety of reasons. </para>

          <para>The question of parallel scheduling was very properly raised by the honourable senator. He and the Senate may like to know that I have begun a round of discussions with both domestic operators over a wide area of their responsibility. I have had discussions with them about the problem of parallel scheduling, which has its worst effect at the end of the system - Tasmania, Cairns, north to New Guinea and into Western Australia - in an attempt to improve the situation. The first of such discussions has taken place and there will be many more of them. I am trying to get some improvement in this direction. The problem of small charter operators maintaining a profitable business is one of which I am very conscious and about which I am very concerned. I have to do the best I can in a situation in which one of the problems has been the fact that there has not been a very large demand for their services for a variety of reasons which are outside my control. </para>

He and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> were good enough to go out with me ohe afternoon to look at these facilities. The present proposal is that domestic operations will move from Essendon to Tullamarine on 20th June this year. The future of Essendon Airport is still under consideration. Details still have to be worked out. In accordance with the undertaking I have already given to the honourable senator, as soon as I have any positive information I will see that he and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> gets it. </para>

Will the Minister give consideration to the composition and functions of the proposed health insurance commission as referred to by the former Minister for Health in a ministerial statement in March 1 970 and in answer to a question on notice in another place last October? What are the prospects of the Government&#39;s marking either anniversary by introducing legislation for the establishment of a national health insurance commission which, as recent events indicate, is more urgently required now than ever before? </para>

            <para>- My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Postmaster-General. Will the Minister ask the Postmaster-General to inquire urgently whether a responsible and experienced Australian Broadcasting Commission journalist in Sydney was dismissed on Monday, 22nd March . of this year, for writing a news story about discrimination against an Aboriginal woman by the Australian Mutual Provident Society in relation to insurance premiums, and whether it is true that neither the AMP Society nor the woman concerned have denied the story despite the fact that the controller of news, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser,</inline> specially sent out another reporter in an attempt to get her to refute the story. Will the Minister also inquire whether it is true that the same journalist&#39;s position had been in jeopardy because of revelations he made in relation to immigration which had greatly embarassed the Government and the Department of Immigration? Without naming the journalist, I ask the Minister whether he will ask the Postmaster-General to inquire into these matters in order to ascertain the truth. 1 also ask whether a statement on these matters could be made in this place. </para>

This would be, I imagine, a matter entirely for its own judgment. I do not know to what extent it is responsible for funds or for producing balance sheets and profit and loss accounts or whether it is in any way under legislation that calls for it to have an auditor. Nonetheless, I shall look into this matter and ask the responsible Minister to let me have information for the honourable senator. </para>

            <para>- In the case of Qantas Airways Ltd and its technical air crews, which is really the matter about which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> has asked a long question, I, as Minister try to be available to both sides to hear anything they have to say about any difference between them. I, with the Department, do what I can to resolve such differences. Accordingly, for some time I have had discussions with the representative of the Qantas board about the financial impact of superannuation and salaries and the escalation of these on the full scope of its business. The board is responsible for the management of that concern. My responsibility is to ensure that some financial limits are set on what is done in this regard because all of us have a responsibility to the people of Australia for the economic viability of that concern. Those are my comments in relation to that area. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The pilots - the technical air crews - in company with various other people have been to see me and the Department.I have put to them that there is a very great responsibility upon them to ensure that the Boeing 747 training programme begins as soon as possible because Qantas is in competition with other operators who are flying Boeing 747 aircraft. Beyond thatI would not want to comment except to say that I will let the honourable senator have details in writing. I know that he, with his industrial experience, will understand that the path of the person trying to achieve harmony in these matters is much easier to tread if he does not have too much to say himself. </para>

            <para>- I think that last week in answer to a question I said that at the invitation of the Royal Australian Air Force the United States Air Force had agreed to be represented at the 50th anniversary celebrations of the RAAF. The United States Air Force asked whether it could send 4 F111 A aircraft to the celebrations. It said that the aircraft would be here for only a short period. The period during which they will be here covers the Richmond air display and the air display at Fairbairn. The F111 aircraft will be at those 2 displays. The West Australian air display was held last Sunday so the aircraft will not go there. The remaining displays will be held after the visit of the aircraft. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>Officers of my Department have been in contact with the various Commonwealth and State authorities concerned with land administration and with the Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics. It was ascertained that no precise statistics of land owned or leased by foreign companies or investors are kept by these authorities, either at the Commonwealth or the State level. Estimates of the extent to which foreign companies lease or own land in Australia would be extremely difficult to make and would probably be misleading, in part at least, because of the difficulty of defining &#39;foreign companies or investors&#39;.

              <para>I have had my Department seek information from the New South Wales Department of Agriculture as a matter of this kind comes primarily within the jurisdiction of the State authorities. I am informed that the outbreak of beetle borers in banana plantations in the Brunswick District on the north coast of New South Wales is believedto be due to the development of a strain of borers resistantto the recommended insecticides, aldrin and dieldrin. In all other districts those materials are giving effective control at the recommended rates of application, which are quite economical. The resistant strain is not controlled by any rate of application of these chemicals. Entomologists of the New South Wales Department of Agriculture recommend that where resistant strains occur, treatment with aldrin and dieldrin should be discontinued, and that control should be maintained through sanitation measures, that is, through the clearing of plantations of all old and fallen plant material capable of harbouring the borer. 1 am informed that research is continuing in an endeavour to find alternative means of chemical control. </para>

          <para>- On behalf of the Public Accounts Committee I present the one hundred and twenty-fifth and one hundred and twentysixth reports of the Committee and with the concurrence of honourable senators I incorporate my remarks on those reports in Hansard. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The One Hundred and Twenty-fifth Report relates to an index of the first to the one hundred and fourteenth reports of the Committee and encompasses the work of your first 7 Committees&#39; up to September 1969. By 1958, the numerous inquiries directed to your Committee from time to time by members of the Parliament, by departments and by other organisations and persons both in Australia and overseas, as well as the requirements of the office of the Committee and the members themselves, had demonstrated the need for ready means of reference to the reports of your Committee and the topics discussed. To meet that situation your third Committee decided in 1957 to have an index prepared and to present it to the Parliament in a form similar to that in which our ordinary reports have been published. The first such report, being the Thirty-eighth Report, was tabled in the &#39; Parliament in May 1958. </para>
        <para>The need for this type of report has continued over the years both in response to growing inquiries regarding our work and as a consequence of the expansion of our work. This need has been recognised by successive Committees and index reports have been presented to the Parliament in 1959, 1962, 1965 and 1967. </para>
        <para>In the case of the One Hundred and Twenty-fifth Report, your eighth Committee has included for the first time, a list of those reports presented since April 1970 but some of which, due .to normal printing delays, are not yet available for inclusion in the report in complete indexed form. </para>
        <para>The One Hundred and Twenty-sixth Report relates to the Treasury Minute on the Committee&#39;s One Hundred and Seventh Report concerning subscriber trunk dialling facilities. </para>
        <para>In examining the Treasury Minute your Committee has given particular attention to the report of an Interdepartmental Committee established to examine the problems associated with the control of STD telephone facilities within the Commonwealth Public Service. A copy of the report of that Committee was tendered to us as an annexure to the Treasury Minute. </para>
        <para>From our examination of the report we are disappointed to find that departments were generally unable to provide adequate reasons for increased expenditure on metered calls. We were further disappointed that the Interdepartmental Committee has concluded that it is impossible for it to reach any firm opinion on the extent to which the increased expenditure represented wasteful or unauthorised use of the facility. </para>
        <para>However, we note in connection with multi-occupancy buildings, the Interdepartmental Committee&#39;s view that a policy of separate metering should be adopted to enable departments to exercise proper financial control, and that the additional cost of separate meters and additional exchange lines would be fully justified. Your Committee agrees with this recommendation and hopes that separate metering facilities will be installed in those buildings with minimum delay. Your Committee also trusts that the added financial control accorded departments following the introduction of such facilities will assist them in the preparation of estimates of expenditure and will also assist in the provision of adequate reasons for future variations in their telephone costs. </para>
        <para>We note that at the request of the Interdepartmental Committee the Public Service Board conducted an investigation in 1969 of the relative cost of obtaining information by means of memoranda, Telex facilities and STD because of the lapse of time since that examination and with consequent rises in costs, a re-examination of the original investigation was made by the Public Service Board in July 1970 for the Interdepartmental Committee. In view of the evident need to reassess the relative costs of these forms of communication within such a short period of time, your Committee believes that, for the guidance of departments, the Public Service Board should make regular .assessments to take account of future variations, in costs. </para>
        <para>In examining the model instructions on the use of telephones -prepared by the Interdepartmental Committee and circulated with its report to all permanent heads we have noted that the circular provides for private telephone calls to be made only with the prior approval of the supervisor. This we support. We are disturbed, however, by the statement included in these model instructions that disciplinary action may be taken against any staff member found making, private calls without approval. Your Committee believes that where a staff member , is found to be making private calls without approval, disciplinary action should be . taken and the model instructions be&#39; amended accordingly. </para>
        <para>We would also observe that from its nature, the report of the Interdepartmental Committee suggests that the Committee has issued a final report and thai no further work on its part is contemplated. In view of the proposals for greater control of telephone facilities put forward by that Committee and the fact that the installation of separate metering facilities in multi-occupancy buildings is expected to enable the departments concerned to exercise proper financial control, your Committee believes that the &#39; Interdepartmental Committee should continue in existence and should undertake periodic follow-up surveys of the matters within its terms of reference. </para>
        <para>Your Public Accounts Committee intends to maintain a close and continuing interest in this important &#39; area of financial administration within the Commonwealth Public Service. </para>
        <para>I commend the reports to honourable senators. </para>

              <para>- The report which I have tabled is the first of its kind though the matter with which it deals is one to which my Committee has given consideration on a number of previous occasions. As honourable senators will be aware, the resolution on the appointment of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory requites it to examine and report on ali proposals for modifications or variations of the plan of the layout of the city of Canberra and its environs published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette on 19th November 1925, as previously modified or varied, which are referred to the Committee by the Minister for the Interior. For a variety of reasons the Committee has not reported to the Parliament before but considers it proper to do so in the case of the current proposals known as the 47th series of variations and on all future occasions. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The proposals for variations are fully explained to the Committee in private session by officers of the National Capital Development Commission and the Department of the Interior, and following examination of those officers and inspection where necessary of the sites of the proposed variations, the Committee satisfies itself on the desirability and practicability of the variations before recommending their adoption. These matters are not considered lightly nor are members of the Committee easily satisfied as to the worth of proposals. Much evidence is taken and the National Capital Development Commission and the Department of the Interior go to considerable trouble to satisfy the penetrating examination of the proposals made by the members of my Committee. In short, this is not a rubber stamp procedure. The Senate is assured that where proposed variations are recommended they have been well considered. </para>
          <para>There is a requirement for the proposed variations to lie on the table in both the Senate and the House of Representatives for a period of 6 sitting days. This procedure follows consideration by members of my Committee. There is therefore, and there always has been, the opportunity for honourable senators to satisfy themselves on the merits of the proposals. The tabling of this report does not affect in any way the procedure referred to, and the proposals will lie on the table in the customary fashion at some point after . this report has been tabled. </para>
          <para>Ordered that the report be printed. </para>

              <para>In the United Kingdom and European markets normal methods of disposal of apples and pears are by forward sale, sale afloat, free consignment, or on consignment against a guaranteed advance from an importer. In Asian markets, only forward sales are made. </para>

For example, in a State where traditionally a high proportion of fruit is sold forward, a common arrangement would be for the exporter to purchase fruit outright from the grower who would then have no further interest in its disposal. Other contracts might be for a seasonal run of varieties for which the exporter might arrange a guaranteed advance from an importer client. </para>

            <para>- by leave - The statement I am about to make was made by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> in the House of Representatives earlier today. When I use the first person personal pronoun it refers to the Prime Minister. </para>

          <para>On 7th April 1970, the Government announced to the House the membership of a joint committee established by the Commonwealth and Queensland to investigate the problem of the crown of thorns starfish on the Great Barrier Reef. The committee comprised: </para>
          <para>Commonwealth Nominees- Professor R. I. Walsh. O.B.E., Professor of Human Genetics at the University of New South Wales (Chairman); Professor W. G. H. Maxwell, Associate Professor of Geology at the University of Sydney, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr D.</inline> J. Tranter, Senior Research Scientist. Division of Fisheries and Oceanography, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. </para>
          <para>Queensland Nominees- <inline font-weight="bold">Dr J.</inline> M. Harvey, Director-General of Primary Industries; Professor J. M. Thomson, Professor of Zoology at the Queensland University, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr C.</inline> L. Harris, of the Department of Primary Industries. </para>
          <para>The announcement of the committee&#39;s membership followed agreement reached on 29th January 1970 by both Governments that such a committee be established and that it should be financed on a SI for  $1 basis by each Government. I am pleased to be able to tell the House (hat on last Thursday, 25th March, the  chairman  of the committee, Professor Walsh, reported to me on the results of the committee&#39;s work. In view of the importance of the report and of the widespread interest which has been taken in iti progress, I arranged for Cabinet to consider the report today and for the report to be tabled so that honourable members will be able to inform themselves fully of its conclusions, and of the reasons underlying these conclusions. </para>
          <para>Honourable members will be aware of the very deep concern which is felt by many about the possibility of destruction to the Great Barrier Reef by the crown of thorns starfish. This concern has been deepened for many by the belief that perhaps complete destruction of the Reef was inevitable unless early Government action was taken. Some have suggested that it may now be too late to save the Reef. </para>
          <para>It is therefore pertinent to draw to honourable members&#39; attention, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, a</inline> reference in the committee&#39;s report to articles in the Press and in semi-technical journals on the starfish as being either repetitive presentation of eye-catching speculations or exaggerations of the limited facts available (paragraph 2.8, page 13). Some of the confusion appears to have occurred because the available methods of estimating population densities of the starfish are rather crude. Extrapolations from these results are not reliable and are of doubtful value (paragraph 4.7, page 20). Also overlooked has been the fact that the published figures of the proportion of dead coral on reefs attacked by the starfish have included an estimated 10 to 50 per cent of corals killed by other means - such deaths being a normal state of affairs (paragraphs 4.17-4.19, page 21). </para>
          <para>Analogies have been drawn between the action which had been taken on Guam and the situation in the Great Barrier Reef. On Guam, teams of divers were used to combat the starfish; some felt that a similar operation should be mounted on the Great Barrier Reef. Such suggestions overlooked the fact that Guam has a comparatively simple reef surrounding it, around which the starfish were said to move, limited on one side by the island beach and on the other by the sea proper, whereas the Great </para>
          <para class="block">Barrier Reef is of a size and a complexity which makes similar generalised action to that taken on Guam ineffective. </para>
          <para>In the light of the wide differences of authoritative opinion as to the threat, if any, which the starfish poses to the Great Barrier Reef the Commonwealth considered it necessary to obtain more facts before any further action was taken to deal with the starfish beyond that already set in train by the Queensland Government and to which reference is made in the committee&#39;s report. The Great Barrier Reef is perhaps the most complex eco-system known to man and many experts considered that it would have been irresponsible for generalised action to be taken before knowing the likely consequences of such action upon the chain of life which comprises the Reef as we know it. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, as</inline>to the results of the committee&#39;s investigations, the committee has found that the crown of thorns starfish does not constitute a threat to the Great Barrier Reef as a whole; there is no danger of substantial erosion of the physical structure of the reef; and there is no threat to the Queensland coastline or ports.- The entire living cover, or even a large proportion of the coral cover, of the Reef will not disappear as a result of the crown of thorns starfish. Whilst there has been extensive damage to coral because of the starfish, serious damage is limited. Re-colonisation and regeneration of coral have occurred on all reefs examined by the .committee. The committee has not been able to determine whether the high density of starfish in some areas is a unique or a. cyclical phenomenon but it appears more likely to be an episodic event which may have occurred previously. </para>
          <para>The committee refers to . the. fact that the feeding by the crown of thorns on living coral constitutes, in the long term, part of the reef-building process, . whereby dead material is consolidated in orde,r to- provide the platform necessary for the Reef&#39;s continued growth. Tourist activity has not declined as a result of the starfish damage. The committee cannot give the. reason for the population increase of crown of thorns starfish in some areas. It reports (that the hypothesis that local collection of triton shells has reduced predator pressure on the starfish has not been substantiated&#39; nor has the hypothesis that pesticides and other organic chemicals may have been causal. The committee believes that there is no need to attempt to reduce the population of the crown of thorns starfish throughout the whole of the Great Barrier Reef at the present time. It does not dispute that certain reefs or portions of reefs having social or commercial importance may be protected by manual destruction of accessible starfish. </para>
          <para>The committee finds that present knowledge of reef ecology is inadequate to assess fully present and future problems concerning the crown of thorns starfish and related matters, lt therefore suggests a programme of research involving continued monitoring of starfish population; research into reef ecology, with particular attention to the biology of the starfish and corals; the experiments in local control of the starfish. To achieve this programme it recommends that a sum of money of the order of $90,000 to $120,000 be provided in the first year to allow such research and that the sum provided be increased progressively in each of the second and third years at which time there would be a review in the light of the operation of the Australian Institute of Marine Science. </para>
          <para>As 1 have already mentioned, Cabinet has considered the recommendations of the committee. I am pleased to be able to say that the Government agrees with the recommendations of the committee. I have been in touch with the Queensland Premier and we have agreed that $45,000 be allocated on a matching basis by each Government for research projects recommended in its first year by an advisory committee. The advisory committee would report to the Minister for Education and Science, who will act on behalf of both Governments. This amount will be increased by $10,000 by each Government in each of the second and third years. Each Government is prepared to increase its grant on a matching basis to the upper limits recommended by the report if the advisory committee finds in practice that it has sufficiently good research projects to warrant this. I shall announce the membership of the advisory committee as soon as possible. </para>

            <para>- by leave  -  I propose to make a statement on behalf of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> in relation to the future of Australian forces in Vietnam. When 1 use the first person singular personal pronoun honourable senators will understand that  I  am referring to the Prime Minister. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Government has been reviewing the position of Australia&#39;s military forces in Vietnam in order to determine what further withdrawal options are open to it, having regard to the security situation and the intentions of the Government of the Republic of Vietnam and of our other major allies. This review follows from the policy stated by the then Prime Minister in April 1970 when, in announcing the withdrawal of one Army battalion, he said that should the progress of pacification and Vietnamisation succeed as the  President  (of the United States) hopes and believes that it will, then at some stage during the 12 months period we will consider phasing additional troops into the planned withdrawal&#39;. </para>
          <para>During his recent visit to Vietnam, the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> had valuable discussions with Vietnamese leaders and with the Commander of United States forces in Vietnam. These consultations have confirmed our assessment that steady improvement is being achieved in the security situation. Many factors have contributed to this improvement. The policy of Vietnamisation, that is, the development of the capability and effectiveness of South Vietnam&#39;s armed forces, has produced a much stronger and more cohesive fighting force. The pacification programme has also achieved notable successes, and its contribution towards improved security in the rural areas has necessitated the enemy concentrating his effort against that programme. These developments, in combination with North Vietnam&#39;s manpower problems, have seen a significant decline in enemy-initiated activity over the last 2 years. </para>
          <para>An important consequence of these achievements has been that the South Vietnamese have been able to continue their operations in Cambodia against North Vietnamese regular forces. Additionally they were able to initiate and conduct the recent operations against the North Vietnamese supply lines in southern Laos. The effect of these operations so far has been to prevent the enemy mounting large-scale actions inside South Vietnam and thus they have given the South Vietnamese time for the further development of their forces and for strengthening the pacification programme. In a number of key areas within South Vietnam the North Vietnamese have for the present lost the military initiative. The enemy forces are thus being forced to a position of reacting to the South Vietnamese rather than being able to fight at a time and place of their own choosing. </para>
          <para>Turning to the overall security of South Vietnam, it is undeniable that there has been satisfactory progress towards the objective of establishing the circumstances in which South Vietnam can determine its own future. There remain, of course, difficulties which should not be minimised. The North Vietnamese at the Parrs talks have remained intransigent. Nothing constructive has been offered by them towards a negotiated settlement. In Vietnam itself there has been some resurgence in Communist terrorism, political agitation, and attacks against lines of communication. These tactics by the Communists, using their remaining infrastructure in the country, will doubtless be employed against the Government and people for some time to come. </para>
          <para>In its weighing up of the overall situation, the Government has decided that further reductions of the Australian forces in Vietnam are feasible and desirable. With the agreement of the Government of the Republic of Vietnam, and following consultations with United States military authorities in Saigon, some forces will now be withdrawn. These are; Selected combat and supporting forces of the Army task force, including the tank squadron, totalling about 650 men; Royal Australian Navy personnel, about 45 in number, serving with the United States Assault Helicopter Company; the RAN Clearance Diving Team - clearance of underwater explo sives - of 6 personnel; No. 2 Canberra Bomber Squadron involving 280 men: and some aircraft of the Caribou transport squadron and about 44 men.. </para>
          <para>The reductions are therefore to be spread over the 3 Services and will have the effect of reducing the total Australian personnel by about 1,000 men. The Australian forces then remaining in South Vietnam will comprise 6,000 men compared with a peak of 8,000 in the period 1968 to 1970. All these remaining forces, including the 2-battalion Task Force in Phuoc Tuy, will retain an effective operational capability. The tasks of . our forces will continue to change as the Vietnamese territorial forces accept increased operational responsibility. </para>
          <para>The units and personnel involved in these reductions will be withdrawn gradually over a period of 4 to 6 months, commencing in May. This timetable will permit detailed adjustments to be made between the Australian, South Vietnamese, and United States military authorities in relation to the security requirements of the areas involved. </para>
          <para>Events in South Vietnam, to which our own fighting men made such a . notable contribution, have made these withdrawals possible and they are entirely in accordance with the policy of the Government as announced in Parliament.-. It must be acknowledged that enemy forces in IndoChina still retain a considerable offensive capability, and there remains in South Vietnam a structure of Vietcong cadres and guerillas which has been long established and whose strength is very difficult to assess. No doubt the Government and forces of the Republic may from time to time suffer military setbacks, and the continuance of the war against aggression will be a heavy burden upon them. But perhaps more than ever before, the Government of the Republic acknowledges that getting on top of the internal threat to security and the development of progressive government in the provinces are tasks best performed by themselves once a sufficient degree of security from massive external attack has been established. Greater confidence now exists. The Vietnamese authorities have developed a variety of programmes which are becoming increasingly effective in bringing better administration in the countryside. </para>
          <para>The Australian Government will continue to assist the Republic of Vietnam, though the character of our assistance will progressively change. For example, the new Jungle Warfare Training Centre at Nui Dat has just completed its first course. Australian economic and military aid in a variety of forms will continue. We will continue to build houses for members of the Territorial Forces and their families. Other forms of civil aid and civic action will be examined by the Government. As to the future of our forces in Vietnam, the Government will keep the matter under constant review, bearing in mind the security of our own forces and our obligations to the Government of the Republic of Vietnam. </para>

            <para>- by leave - We of the Opposition are not satisfied with the statement which has been made. It is a statement on partial withdrawal of our troops from the war in Vietnam. The only statement which would satisfy us would be one which said that all the troops should come out and that they should all come out now, that the only thing we should have to do with that war tom country is lo aid it in overcoming the damage which we, along with others, have inflicted upon its people. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Vietnam war, along with the recent invasion of Laos, has been a disaster. There has been no military victory and there could be no military victory. We got ourselves mixed up in the internal affairs of Vietnam. Together wilh the United States of America and the other countries which have been dragooned into this war, we are suffering the consequences of it. Our participation has been immoral, unjust and, I believe, illegal. It has been a participation of which the Australian people will bc ashamed forever. The  President  of the United States said last year - 1 read this in his official journal - that he was aware that the majority of the American people were against the war. I believe that the majority of the Australian people are against this war. I understand that the New Zealand Government has announced that all its troops will be brought out of that conflict. There will be no half measures. No less should be done by the Australian Government. </para>
          <para>The statement read by the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson)</inline> - he is not responsible for it - is a mixture of the double talk and excuses for our conduct which one would expect from the Government. It would be more honest of the Government if it said that it realised that a mistake has been made. Governments are not infallible; sometimes they make mistakes. Assuming the sincerity of the Government, it has long been apparent that this has been a costly error on our part. Our involvement has been not only shameful and degrading, but it has been extremely costly for this country. There has been a heavy cost in lives lost and in injuries from which our troops will suffer for a long time. </para>
          <para>Economically this war has been costing Australia a great deal more than the Government is prepared to admit. One of the reasons for the economic difficulties we are in is the enormous cost of this war. During the last Budge; debate I produced in this chamber calculations made at my request by the Legislative Research Service in this Parliament which indicated that the cost of this war was between S400m and $500m a year. That cost was worked out according to sophisticated methods but one would admit that if the cost were worked out according to some rule of thumb calculations it would be about the same. We cannot afford to spend that amount of money. We are in the same position as the United States, which has found that it cannot afford to spend the S30,000m a year which it has been costing that country. </para>
          <para>I am pleased to hear that this number of troops is to be withdrawn. However. I think it would serve the interests of Australia much better and T think the Government would stand better with the people of Australia if it were to say that all our troops should now come out instead of trying to drag the matter out in some kind of endeavour to save face. Face should not be saved at the cost to this country of enormous sums of money and, more importantly, at the cost of enormous suffering on the part of Australians. Australians will continue to be killed there and their families will continue to suffer; others will suffer injuries. This is all part of the damage inflicted on the Vietnamese people and this should not have been done. After all, what have these people done which requires us to be mixed up in their affairs, helping to ravage their country and inflicting this immense suffering on them? </para>

            <para>- 1 know the tradition has been that a person should bc discharged from a committee if he requests his discharge. This may be a matter of course in the case of a Minister. There is an old tradition, probably going back to Roman times, that service on a committee is a matter of obligation and duty, it being a public office; that persons undertook responsibilities or responsibilities were imposed upon them and they had to carry out those responsibilities. It seems to me, from what appears in the interim report of the Committee and from what we cannot fail to understand from hearing of the operations of the Committee, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> has done a very great service as its  chairman.  1&#34; feel that the Senate is indebted to him for his service on the Committee. I would not like to see the occasion go by without it being noted that he has performed extremely well. The Senate is reluctant to lose his services on the Committee. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It seems to me to be a pity that this change has to occur. I appreciate the considerations that apply - that committees need to be independent of the Government and a Minister may be put in a difficult position by serving on a committee - but there may be a difference between a person who is not a member of the Cabinet and a Cabinet member. I would not like to suggest that on this occasion there should be a departure from tradition but perhaps we should study whether the rule should be invariable, or the custom invariable, that a Minister should not sit on a committee. This is particularly relevant when a committee has done a great deal of work and has reached the stage almost of reporting. This change produces quite a difficult position. </para>

          <para>-  I think I should intervene at this stage to deal with the question of membership of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. This is a most important backbench committee and it is to be regretted thatall significant parties in this chamber are not represented on it. I was a member of the Committee years ago and whenI had occasion to break my political association I immediately resigned from the Committee because, of course, I was there as the nominee of one party. The members of the Committee are there as nominees of particular parties. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The Regulations and Ordinances Committee performs most significant and valuable work. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> implied by interjection, it is essentially a backbench committee which should not accommodate ministerial members. That is all the more reason why it may be condign to expand the membership of the Committee in numbers so that all parties and perhaps the independent senators could find representation on it. In the new Senate after 30th June we shall have 3 independent senators instead of one as at present, and the Australian Democratic Labor Party will have an additional senator, making in all 8 senators who will have no opportunity to serve on the Regulations and Ordinances Committee because it is constituted of Government and Opposition nominees. </para>
        <para>The Senate could well consider this situation. Quite apart from members of the Democratic Labor Party there is an important role to be played in the Senate at the will of the electors by the independent senators who are to join us. I do not think they should be denied an opportunity to participate fully in the work of the Senate through its committees, and particularly the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. </para>

            <para>- No other party is involved to the same extent as our Party. We have been more than generous in the provision of the services of our members for committee work. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> knows, we have attempted furiously to be associated with the Standing Orders Committee. I understand that objection to our membership has been raised among the Opposition members. We fail to serve on that Committee not because of our disposition; we do not serve on it because we have not been permitted to do so by the Opposition. If Senate committees are to function effectively they must be as representative as possible of the composition of the Senate.I am making a plea not merely for the DLP but also for the independent senators who in increased numbers are to grace our chamber. If the Regulations and Ordinances Committee is effectively to be manned by backbenchers, the membership should be extended to embrace as far as possible all elements now comprising the Senate. </para>

          <para>The purpose of this Bill is to enable the Commonwealth to meet its obligation under a guarantee of repayment of certain borrowings by the Australian Wheat Board from the Reserve Bank of Australia in respect of wheat from the 1969-70 pool. A similar loan, the repayment of which was completed earlierthis month, was made last year in respect of wheal from the 1968-69 crop. </para>
          <para>Arrangements were made for the Board to borrow up to$398m from the Rural Credits Department of the Reserve Bank to assist in the marketing of the 1969-70 crop. The date for final repayment is 31st March 1971. approximately 12 months after the drawings were made, in order to comply with section 57 of the Reserve Bank Act, which requires that loans of the type made to the Board shall not be for more than 1 year. The Board will be unable to repay the borrowings in full by the due date because receipts from sales of wheat will be insufficient for the purpose. This will mean that the Commonwealth willbe liable under its guarantee for an amount currently expected to be in the vicinity of$1 90m, recoupment of which is estimated to take approximately 14 months. It is proposed that the Commonwealth lend to the Board sufficient funds to enable it to discharge its debt to the Bank. It is also proposed that the Board be required to use for repayment of the loan all net proceeds from export sales of wheat of the 1969-70 pool - after the date of the loan - as well as the Commonwealth&#39;s stabilisation payment. </para>
          <para>The Bill provides that the loan to the Board be at an interest rate of 5&#189; per cent per annum on the daily balances outstanding, with the actual timing of capital repayments and interest to be determined by the Treasurer. The interest rate is onehalf per cent higher than that charged on last year&#39;s loan and reflects, in part, the increased cost of borrowing to the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth financed last year&#39;s loan to the Board by the issue to the Reserve Bank of treasury notes on which the average rate of interest at the time was about 5 per cent. The expectation is that the loan to the Board in respect of the 1969-70 pool will again be financed by the issue of treasury notes, on which the average rate of interest is currently 5.725 per cent. It should also be noted that, on its exports sales on credit terms, the Board quite rightly charges commercial rates of interest. The Government therefore proposes to charge the Wheat Hoard an interest rate higher than the 5 per cent charged last year. Bearing in mind the circumstances of the wheat industry, a rate of 5&#189; per cent is proposed. </para>
          <para>The Bill authorises the Commonwealth to borrow up to $250m to make theloan to the Board. This exceeds the Board&#39;s current estimate of the amount required under the guarantee but, as such estimates are subject to substantial variation, the amount specified in the Bill provides a margin in case the estimate proves too low. The Australian Loan Council has agreed to a special borrowing programme for this purpose for the Commonwealth in 1970-71. The terms of the borrowing will be subject to Loan Council approval. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

This Bill provides for increases of 6 per cent in the salaries of the statutory office-holders shown in the first schedule to the Bill. Honourable senators will appreciate that the rate of increase of 6 per cent is identical with that granted by the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in its 1970 national wage case decision. This Bill is necessary because of the particular legislative provisions existing for the statutory offices referred to in the first schedule to the Bill. In the cases of various other comparable statutory office-holders, approval has been given for the 6 per cent increase to be applied, subject to compliance with the requirements of relevant legislation. The Bill provides that, as in the Commonwealth Public Service, the 6 per cent increase will apply from 14th January 1971. 1 commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

          <para class="block">That the Bill be now read a second time. </para>
          <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court Act to provide for the appointment of a second judge under sub-section (1.) of section 7 of that Act. The need for the Bill arises out of the Government&#39;s decision - which was announced to the . Senate on 19th May last - to establish a Law Reform Commission for the Australian Capital Territory. A draft of the ordinance to establish the Law Reform Commission was recently submitted to the Advisory Council of the Australian Capital Territory for comment, and it should be possible for the ordinance to be made in the near future. </para>
          <para>In accordance with the statement to the Senate on 19th May last year, the draft ordinance provides for the  Chairman  to be a judge. As the Commission will have the task of reforming the law of the. Australian Capital Territory, it is desirable that the  Chairman  should be a judge of the Supreme Court of the Territory. The present Bill will enable the  Chairman  to hold such an appointment. The present position is that the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory consists of 1 Judge appointed under sub-section (1.) of section 7 of the Act and the additional judges appointed under sub-section (2.) of that section. An additional judge is required to be a judge of another Commonwealth court and it would not be satisfactory for this requirement to apply to the  Chairman  of the Commission. The Bill accordingly provides for the appointment of a second judge under sub-section (1.) of section 7 of the Act. </para>
          <para>It ls expected that the  Chairman  of the Law Reform Commission will be engaged for the greater part of his time on the work of the Commission and that this work  will  take precedence over the normal judicial work of the court. However, it is thought that h  will  be desirable from many points of view, particularly in the early days of the Commission, for the  Chairman  to assist from time to time with the judicial work of the court, and this will be possible under the amendment provided for in this Bill. The work of the court has increased considerably in recent years and this has at times led to delays in the hearing of cases. The main proposal in the Bill is to be found in clause 4, which provides for the amendment of section  6  of the Act  so  that the Court  will  consist of not more than 2 judges appointed under sub-section  (1.)  of section 7 and the  additional  judges appointed under sub-section (2.). All the other amendments proposed in the Bill are merely consequential upon that provided in clause 4. They are necessary because the Act  is  at present framed upon the basis that only 1 judge can hold office under sub-section (1.) of section 7 of the Act. The Bill makes provision with respect to the relative seniority of the 2 judges holding office under the sub-section and provides for that seniority to apoly in several provisions that depend on seniority. </para>

            <para>That the  Bill  be now read a second time. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>The purpose of this Bill is to establish facilities on a national level for the conduct of research into crime and for the training of persons engaged in the prevention and control of criminal behaviour. The introduction of the Bill follows extensive discussions between the Commonwealth and the States. I should like honourable senators to know that the former Attorney-General, when introducing the Bill in another place, paid public tribute to our ministerial colleagues in the State governments for the help and co-operation that has made possible the introduction of this Bill for the setting up of machinery on a truly national basis in the form of an Australian Institute of Criminology, a Criminology Research Council and a Criminology Research Fund. </para>
          <para>The cost of crime to the nation is enormous. I speak not only of cost in terms of government expenditure, but of the tragic waste and loss of human resources, the unhappiness that is caused, the erosion of human character and the breakdown of families. People are the most precious resources of any civilised community. In this field, therefore, parliaments and governments should no longer confine themselves to law making and law enforcement. They must provide the facilities for the study of the causes and effects of crime and of means for its prevention. Good work has already been done in Australian universities and public interest in the problem has been stimulated by nongovernmental bodies such as the Australian Crime Prevention, Correction and AfterCare Council and the Australian and New Zealand Society of Criminology. But the resources of government are needed if  rea  progress is to be made. Here the Commonwealth believes, and the States agree, that the Commonwealth has an Australia-wide co-ordinating role so that the problem can be tackled on a national basis and the available resources of men and money can be applied to the task in the most effective way. According to one estimate, the cost of crime in the United States of America during  1965  amounted to some SUS20,000m. The Rural Bank of New South Wales in a publication that received wide publicity in  1968  estimated that the immediate cost of crime in Australia - that is to say the loss suffered by individuals,  as  distinct from the economic loss suffered by the nation as a whole - could well exceed S350m a year. This is probably a conservative  estimate. </para>
          <para>There can be no gainsaying that the incidence of crime is rising in Australia. This is no unique experience. Many overseas countries, particularly those that are highly urbanised and industrialised, have even greater problems than we have here. It has become generally recognised that there is a casual connection between rising crime rates and a number of aspects of development such as urbanisation, industrialisation, population increase and technological change. There is by no means a complete understanding of all aspects of this connection. It is an ironical feature of the times in which we live, that increasing standards of affluence have not had a diminishing effect upon the incidence of crime. Once upon a time it was thought that much crime was the illegitimate offspring of poverty. So it was, and some crime still is. But now, perhaps, we are witnessing an increase in criminal activity because of rather than despite our .ela.tively affluent standards of living. Affluence itself, particularly if it is unevenly distributed, creates greater criminal opportunities. There are more goods to be stolen; the appetite for possession is made larger by the vision of glittering material temptations. We know that these problems exist but our research into them has not yet gone very deep. </para>
          <para>Many related factors are involved - the greater complexity of life presented by modern society, the decline in social controls on behaviour, the absence in many highly urbanised societies of the supports and sanctions of a well understood traditional culture, the opportunities provided by urbanised societies for anonymity and freedom of action, and an increase in criminal activity with a lower risk of detection. In short, an element in the price of rising material standards in an industrial or post-industrial society is that the society becomes less firm-footed. I do not say any of this in any mood of depression or resignation; I say it because if we are to meet the challenges of the times, as I believe we can and will, we must have the vision to see why they have arisen and the honesty to admit that our way of life has a darker side. In the United Kingdom, the United States and other countries there are reports of alarming increases in the number  of  reported crimes in proportion to the population. Similar trends are discernible in Australia. Some estimates suggest that there has been an increase in Australia  of  the order  of  100 per cent during the last 20 years in the numbers of crimes reported per 1000 of population. Moreover, reported crime is only the tip  of  the iceberg. There remains what is called the dark figure of crime that is unreported. Some estimates suggest that it would be almost  4  times the reported rate for some offences. </para>
          <para>While statistics of crime increases are widely publicised it should not be assumed that the statistics presently available accurately outline or measure the problem. One of the big gaps in our resources both in Australia and overseas is the lack  of  basic information about the incidence and extent of crime. We do not know, for example, the extent to which statistics reflect increased police efficiency or improved crime reporting standards, bringing out into the light more of the dark figure than was previously known. We do not know the extent to which the figures reflect changing practices in the administration of justice. The recent population growth in the younger age categories has a close connection with the increase revealed in statistics. Nevertheless, if one makes all due allowances for defective statistics, there is in this country a trend of sufficient magnitude to give cause for real concern. </para>
          <para>Clearly, the provision of facilities for research into crime is an urgent and pressing need. There is no deployment, on a nationally co-ordinated basis, of existing facilities in Australia for criminological research. As part of the Commonwealth&#39;s consideration of the arrangements that might be made to deal with this problem, and in an endeavour to introduce some measure of co-ordination between the various State and Commonwealth agencies working in this area, a governmental seminar was held in Canberra in 1968 under the sponsorship of the Commonwealth. The seminar was attended by senior representatives of a number of professions - police, magistrates, probation and parole officers, child welfare officers, psychiatrists and other experts. The theme of the seminar was &#39;The Control of Deviant Behaviour in Australia&#39;. A number of mat- ters emerged from the discussions of the seminar. In the first place, the seminar demonstrated the value of inter-discipline discussion. Those attending obtained an enlarged understanding and appreciation of the work done by each other in the whole field of crime prevention and correction. Secondly, the seminar made a recommendation that there should be increased research into crime. They saw this as being achieved by the establishment of a national body, wilh the active participation of the States. </para>
          <para>In October 1968, the Commonwealth proposed to the States a scheme involving the establishment, under Commonwealth legislation, of an Australian Institute of Criminology, a Criminology Research Council and a Criminology Research Fund. In May 1969, the Attorney-General, the honourable N. H. Bowen, Q.C, announced in Parliament that the States had agreed in principle with these proposals; and in November last year, the then AttorneyGeneral. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr T.</inline> E. F. Hughes. Q.C, announced that agreement had been reached with the States on the details of the scheme. This Bill is the expression of the agreed scheme in legislative form. It is a worthwhile project. </para>
          <para>The Criminology Research Council will consist of one representative of each State and one Commonwealth representative. The Council will administer the Criminology Research Fund. The Commonwealth will provide one half of this fund, and the balance will be provided in agreed proportions by the States. The primary task of the Criminology Research Council will be to assess needs in the field of criminology research, and to allocate moneys from the Fund to specific research projects in universities and governmental institutions, lt is envisaged that a substantial amount of research will be carried out on this basis. These arrangements will give effect to the view that there should be a maximum utilisation of existing resources in Australia where, both, in universities and in government departments, there are many experts whose services might be made available for specific projects. However, there will be some areas in which it would be more appropriate for research projects to be undertaken on a national basis at governmental level. These projects will be undertaken by the Australian Institute of Crimi nology. The Institute will also be responsible for conducting seminars and training courses designed to keep police, prison and parole officers and others up to date with modern techniques and developments in their respective callings. The Commonwealth will accept full financial responsibility for establishing and maintaining the Australian Institute of Criminology. However, because of the considerable interest of the States at the regional level, the States will be represented on a Board of Management of the Institute. The Board of Management will consist of a  chairman  and 5 other members. The  Chairman  and 2 members will be appointed by the Commonwealth and the 3 other members are to be appointed by the Criminology Research Council to represent the States. The  Chairman  will have a casting vote. </para>
          <para>The Bill is divided into 5 parts. Part I deals with preliminary matters and definitions. Part II deals with the establishment of the Australian Institute of Criminology. The functions of the Institute are set out in clause 6 of Division I. In addition to the conduct of research and training, the Institute will advise the Criminology Research Council in relation to the needs for, and programmes of, criminological research and provide secretarial and administrative services for the Council. An important function of the institute will be to give advice in relation to statistical requirements and the compilation of statistics with respect to crime. The Institute will also perform incidental functions such as collating and analysing research and disseminating the results of research to the Commonwealth and State governments. Division 2 deals with the establishment of the Board of Management, and Division 3 deals with the appointment of the Director and the staff of the Institute. Provision is made for the appointment of an Acting Director. The finances of the Institute are provided for in Division 4. Part ITI of the Bill deals with the establishment of the Criminology Research Council and Part IV establishes the Criminology Research Fund. Clause 46 provides that there shall be paid into the Fund out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund an amount of $50,000. The Fund will also consist of moneys paid by the States to the Commonwealth for the purposes of the Fund. The Fund is to be applied only in the making of payments for such purposes of, or related to, criminological research as are determined by the Council, and in the discharge of any obligations or liabilities of the Council arising under the Act. Part V of the Bill deals with miscellaneous matters. The accounts and financial transactions of the Institute and of the Council are to be audited by the Auditor-General. </para>
          <para>The establishment of facilities for research into crime is a need that is recognised at the international level. No country has devoted enough of its resources to the problem of crime prevention. Nevertheless, efforts to encourage research programmes and establish institutes of criminology have been made by many countries. Australia too must play her part. I believe that the Australian Institute of Criminology has an international role to play, particularly in the South East Asian area. There is a need to provide training facilities for persons from these countries engaged in crime prevention and correction. There is need for international collaboration and consultation in the formulation of policies and programmes for the fight against crime. There is also the opportunity, both for Australia and South East Asian countries with developing economies and changing social structures, to seek to learn from the mistakes made by other highly urbanised societies, and endeavour to minimise the increase in crime that so often flows from development. If such a result is to be achieved, firm and vigorous action must be taken now. This Bill will provide the necessary base for such action. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

          <para>That the Bill be now read a second time. </para>
          <para>The Bill which I have just introduced proposes amendments to the Customs Act 1901-1968 which will allow certain provisions relating to the payment of customs duties and the granting of refunds of duty to be brought into line with current commercial practices. Clause 3 of the Bill provides for the repeal of section 137 of the Customs Act 1901-1968 which requires that duties be paid in Australian currency. The original purpose of section 137 was to give authority to refuse to accept payment for duty when tendered in foreign currency. In the light of present legislation in relation to currency and coin which is legal tender in Australia such a safeguard is no longer necessary. In fact, the provision hampers the conduct of customs business by raising a legal barrier against the acceptance of bank or other &#39;guaranteed&#39; cheques, or foreign currency even when known to be eminently stable and to present no repatriation difficulties. </para>
          <para>Authority for the granting of refunds, rebates or remissions of duty in prescribed circumstances and subject to prescribed conditions and requirements is contained in existing sections 163, 164 and 164a of the Customs Act. The absence of authority in section 163 to permit the prescribing of selective requirements for particular goods or for particular classes of goods, gives rise to administrative difficulties as &#39;commodity control&#39; procedures are progressively introduced by the Department of Customs and Excise. As honourable senators are aware, the &#39;commodity control&#39; concept relies on selective and random checks of companies&#39; commercial documentation reinforced by physical checks. For example, it has been found desirable to adopt, in respect of the petroleum products industry, a system whereby final settlement of duties on certain petroleum products is effected on the basis of a monthly reconciliation of duty liability offset by refunds payable. In its present form section 163 of the Customs Act does not provide for such a practice. </para>
          <para>To furnish authority for the adoption of progressive procedures and practices such as the example I have given, it is necessary to introduce into the refunds provisions of the Customs Act sufficient flexibility to allow requirements to be tailored to suit particular classes of goods and particular circumstances. Accordingly, it is proposed by the Bill now before the Senate to amend the Customs Act to provide, as well as a specific authority for the granting of refunds, rebates and remissions of duty, authority whereby the Customs regulations may prescribe differing conditions and requirements to apply to different goods or classes of goods. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

          <para>That the Bill be  now read a  second time. </para>
          <para>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Naval Defence Act to enable the Australian Sea Cadet Corps and the Naval Reserve Cadetsto  be  amalgamated into one body. This will bring  the  Navy into line with the Army and the Air Force, each of which operates a single cadet body. The Navy became associated with 2 bodies of cadets as a natural outcome of  the  different waysin which these 2 bodies began and developed. The Naval Reserve Cadets, the older and smaller of these 2 bodies, had its origin in the Defence Act of 1903. which authorised the establishment of bodies of Naval and Military Cadets. From 1909 to 1930 the Naval Reserve Cadets consisted of youths of 12 to 18 years of age who were required to render universal training under the Defence Act. With the discontinuance of universal training in 1930, the Naval Reserve Cadets reverted to a voluntary body and the minimum age was increased to 16 years. Priorto 1952, the units of the Naval Reserve Cadets which has always been wholly run  by  the Navy were attached to Naval Reserve training establishments. Since then 3 units have been formed at schools and in due course the practice of having units attached to Reserve establishments will be discontinued. </para>
          <para>There are about 200 Naval Reserve Cadets, aged from 16 to 19 years, most of whom belong to the 3 units attached to schools. The minimum age will be reduced to 14 years under the amalgamation. The Australian Sea Cadet Corps, on the other hand, comprises some 1,950 cadets divided into 39 units. These have been raised by the Navy League of Australia. The Navy League is a world wide organisation and was founded in the United Kingdom in 1895. Its object, briefly, is education in matters pertaining to the Navy and Merchant Navy. Sea cadets - not to be confused with the sea scouts run by the Boy Scouts Association - had functioned in England from the middle of the 19th century, when seamen returning from the Crimean war had formeda Naval Lads Brigade atWhitstable in Kent. This unit and others became affiliated with the Navy League subsequent to its founding in 1895 and the title &#39;Navy League Sea Cadet Corps&#39; was adopted. Branches of the Navy League were subsequently established in Australia, commencing with the South Australian Branch in 1914. The New South Wales Branch formed the first sea cadet units in 1921. </para>
          <para>From the beginning, the Navy League Branches sought recognition by, and assistance from, the Naval Board on the lines of that accorded to United Kingdom units by the Admiralty. The Naval Board granted concessions from time to time such as the purchase of naval clothing and preselection of navy boats and other equipment declared for disposal. Full recognition by the Naval Board and the provision of financial assistance could not be provided, partly because the Navy League in Australia had no central organisation with which the Naval Board could deal, and partly because the Naval Board was pressed for sufficient money to keep the Naval Reserves operating and was in no position to provide finance for the Navy League Sea Cadets. At the end of the Second World War there were 8 companies of Navy League Sea Cadets in New South Wales and 4 in Victoria. There was also an unaffiliated unit of cadets on Snapper Island in Sydney Harbour. In all the number of instructors and cadets at that time is estimated at about 300. The question of providing Government assistance for the Navy League Sea Cadets was again raised in 1946. A central council of the Navy League branches was formed in order to make arrangements with the Naval Board, which accorded recognition in principle to the Navy League Sea Cadets in 1947 and provided some practical assistance. A Sea Cadet Council, comprising officers of the Naval Forces, representatives of the Navy League and a merchant shipping representative, was established by the Naval Board in 19S0 to advise the Board on matters relating to the Sea Cadets. </para>
          <para>The title &#39;Australian Sea Cadet Corps&#39; was adopted. The Naval Defence Act was suitably amended in 1952 and the Australian Sea Cadet Corps regulations were made in 1954. These provided a statutory basis for the role of the Naval Board in the administration of the Corps and the assistance provided by the Board, and also accorded statutory recognition to the Sea Cadet Council. Section 39 of the Naval Defence Act as amended in 1952 empowers the Naval Board to make arrangements with the Navy League of Australia for the instruction and equipment of the Australian Sea Cadet Corps. The aims of the Corps include imparting to the cadets a foundation of naval knowledge and discipline, developing character and good citizenship and the qualities of leadership and self-reliance, and encouraging cadets to continue some form of naval service after leaving school. The ages of cadets range from 14 to 18 years. The division of responsibility between the Naval Board and the Navy League is along the lines that the Naval Board is responsible for training, the provision of uniforms and equipment and of financial assistance under the Australia Sea Cadet Corps regulations. The Navy League on the other hand is concerned with the formation of units, the provision of accommodation and buildings for training, the financial administration of units and with the social and moral welfare of members. </para>
          <para>Since being officially recognised by the Naval Board, the Australian Sea Cadet Corps has expanded significantly whilst the membership of the Navy League has steadily declined to such an extent that it is no longer able to fully discharge its responsibilities in all States. Because of this unsatisfactory position, the Navy League and the Sea Cadet Council have proposed that the Navy should assume complete responsibility for the Corps including, in particu lar, the provision of accommodation for units where necessary. The Naval Board concluded, following a detailed study of the matter, that a continuation of the existing arrangements would lead to a progressive deterioration in the efficiency and viability of certain units of the Corps. This would mean that the value of the Corps to the Navy would lessen. Some units are capable of representing the Navy with credit at public functions. It is true to say that, in small towns where there is a local unit of the Corps, the unit is regarded as the Navy. It is important therefore that the standard of all units reflects favourably upon the parent service. Many people, in fact, are unaware of the involvement of the Navy League and imagine that the Navy controls all aspects of the Corps. The Government has decided therefore that it would be in the best interests of the Cadets and of the Navy, if the Navy were to assume full control of the Corps. With the taking over of the Australian Sea Cadet Corps by the Navy, the perpetuation of 2 separate organisations would be inefficient and unnecessary, and members of the Australian Sea Cadet Corps could appropriately be enrolled in the Naval Reserve Cadets, which, as I have mentioned, is already fully controlled by the Navy. </para>
          <para>Section 38 of the Naval Defence Act makes provision for the Naval Reserve Cadets. As it stands, it will not be suitable to meet all the requirements brought about by such an amalgamation of the 2 cadet organisations. It is necessary to amend the section so that the regulations may provide for officers and instructors - that is the persons who, respectively, supervise a particular unit and train the Cadets - and for certain payments to these persons, such as annual allowances and travelling allowances. These have not previously been requirements for the Naval Reserve Cadets who are at present trained by officers of the Citizen Naval Forces. Section 39 of the Act, which deals with the present dual arrangement with the Navy League, ceases to be required and is repealed by the Bill. Since the Naval Board is already responsible under the existing regulations for the provision of uniforms and equipment and the payment of annual allowances and travelling expenses, the proposal will not involve any increased expenditure on these matters. Expenditure will be involved in improving the accommodation arrangements for certain units. This will not be great and will be spread over a period of some years. The implementation of this programme will necessarily depend upon the recently announced policy of the Government to secure economy in Government expenditures. </para>
          <para>In the meantime, the passing of this Bill will enable the Navy to proceed with the re-organisation of the administration of the various Cadet units. Although the assumption of full control by the Naval Board will remove authority from the Navy League, the Naval Board has advised the various Branches of the Board&#39;s wish for them to retain an interest in the units in their areas. This they have agreed to do. The Services&#39; Cadet organisations provide valuable training for boys who are interested in the Navy, the Army or the Air Force. Even where the boys do not ultimately join the Services, the activities instil discipline and develop qualities of leadership and self-reliance and a sense of responsibility - all of which contributes to making them good citizens. At this time I think it fitting to place on record the Government&#39;s appreciation of the work of the Navy League in raising and maintaining the Australian Sea Cadet Corps. Although not a large body, the members of the League have supported the units to the extent of their limited financial capacity and have built some first class training centres. Their work with the cadets has been a valuable contribution to the youth of Australia. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

            <para>- The purpose of this Bill is to authorise the Goverment to borrow $250m to lend to the Australian Wheat Board in order that the Board can meet a commitment to the Reserve Bank for money that it had borrowed to pay wheal farmers for the 1969-70 wheat pool. I understand that the amount borrowed was in the vicinity of $389m. The Government is doing no more than playing its part as guarantor. That is not always a sound proposition, but if we are to sell our wheat, which is not as easy to do as it once was, the farmers have to be paid at least portion of the money to which they are entitled. Therefore, until it sells the wheat, the Board has to borrow money to enable the farmers to have at least their liquid assets. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Australian Wheat Board had agreed to repay its loan by tomorrow, 3 1st March, with money that it would obtain from the sale of wheat and from money to which it is entitled from the Commonwealth stabilisation fund. The money in question was loaned to the Board at5&#189; per cent interest. That intrigues me a little. I am not opposed to this measure because we must do something to alleviate the position until such time as we are prepared to grapple with the whole question of rural production in this country. At present we are dealing with it only in a piece meal fashion. We give$1 00m to the wool growers and then the Government agrees to the Tariff Board&#39;s reducing customs duty on synthetics. To me, that does not add up. On the one hand, the Government hands over $100m to try to save the wool growers and, on the other hand, it reduces the tariff on synthetics which are wool&#39;s main competitor. </para>
          <para>I doubt whether there is a rural industry in Australia which we are not subsidising in one way or another. Let us trace the history of this. I see my young friend allegedly a farmer and a very nice fellow </para>

              <para>-  I would not suggest anything. That is a matter for decision by those who are in a position to make that decision. 1 am amazed that the Board has been able to borrow the money at 5i per cent interest. Last year when the Board borrowed money for this purpose the interest was 5 per cent. 1 ask myself this question: What does the normal young person pay in interest to the Commonwealth Bank if he can get money from the bank for a house? ls he not entitled to get the money he needs? Is he nol entitled to help? I want to help the wheat farmers but I also want to help my own people. I understand that those young people who can obtain a loan from the Commonwealth Bank for housing - they are hil by inflation just as much as anyone else in the community - are paying a much higher rate of interest. In my view it would be much better to give the Board an outright subsidy and charge the Board the current rate of trading interest. Thai would not affect the wheat grower one iota. </para>

          <para>This Bill has become necessary because the Board has not been able to sell our wheat at a price which would permit it by 31st March, which is tomorrow, to repay the money that it has borrowed. We have heard in this chamber that we should not trade with this country or with that country, that we should not have anything to do with this country or with that country and that we should not acknowledge one nation in particular. Canada recognises mainland China and, according to reports, Canada this year has received an order for $70m worth of wheat. We are being foolish. We recognise the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Can anyone tell me that there is any ideological difference between Russian Communism and Peking Communism? We have to look at this matter very seriously. </para>
          <para>One reads that Great Britain is striving to join the Common Market. If she is successful there must be an effect on our wheat sales to her. I cannot see the member countries of the Common Market allowing Britain to act in such a way that their secondary and primary industries will be affected. Suppose Britain were to say to the member nations of the Common Market: In the matter of primary products we have to look after the countries which are part and parcel of the Commonwealth&#39;. I do not think they would do that. We will have tremendous difficulties in finding markets for our wheat, not only now but also in the future, if what we expect to happen does happen. In his second reading speech an this Bill the Minister for Supply <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson)</inline> said that the Australian Wheat Board estimated that it would need Si 90m from the Reserve Bank, but he did not seem to agree with the Board&#39;s estimate because he said that it was proposed to lend the Board $250m. That is a rather loose way of conducting a financial transaction. </para>
          <para>It seems to me that the Board does not know where it is at the moment. I admit that it must have sufficient funds to cover its expected requirements, but when it asks for SI 90m and it actually needs $60m more than that one cannot have much respect for estimates made by the Board. Be that as it may, the Bill now before us is necessary. The Reserve Bank is very wisely governed by an Act which provides that money which it lends must be repaid within 1 year. The year ends tomorrow and, therefore, it is necessary for the Bill to go through tonight. No doubt on 1st April the Reserve Bank will receive its money. </para>

Having some knowledge of what transpired under the Government of 1947, I went to some trouble to find out what were the facts. I invite honourable senators to consider the facts, and I remind them of another occasion in this place some few years ago when it became necessary to nail another political canard, on that occasion in relation to Manus Island. At that time, on every occasion that something was said about defence it was suggested by Government supporters that the Labor Party would not take over Manus Island on behalf of Australia. At that time, through the courtesy of the then Prime Minister, the late Harold Holt, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr John</inline> Dedman, who had been a Minister in the Government at the time when Australia&#39;s taking over Manus Island was contemplated, was given permission to go through the official files, as a result of which he wrote the story of Manus Island in a publication called &#39;Outlook*. From that publication and from him I have obtained the facts. 1 propose to put on record the facts relating to wheat sales at that time. At the end of 1945 when the New Zealand Government approached the Australian Government to purchase its wheat supplies the export price of wheat was 9s 6d a bushel f.o.b. The New Zealand Government desired to obtain a firm price for 5 years covering its requirements. The Australian Government sold New Zealand wheat from the 1945-46 crop at 9s 6d a bushel f.o.b. and later entered into a contract for the succeeding 4 years at 5s 9d a bushel f.o.b. </para>

              <para>-  I am going on to tell you. 1 shall not hide anything. The problem of gauging future market prices, which might rise or fall greatly, was extremely difficult and. if attempted, would necessarily have to be a government responsibility rather than one for the industry. The opinion of experts in Australia and overseas at the time favoured the view that within a year or two prices would recede heavily. </para>

          <para>A guide to opinion at the time is obtained from a statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr J.</inline> Thomson, the former general manager of the Australian Wheat Board, dated 3rd March 1947. Referring to discussions which he had with a senior official of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture relative to the proposed New Zealand deal, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Thomson</inline> said: </para>

            <para>The foregoing was my guess at what might be market prices and  so far  it has proved very much  off  the mark.  The  average was around 7s a bushel and  I  offered  to  put  a  proposal  to the </para>

          <para class="block">Of course it is easy for critics to be wise after the event. The unprecedented rise in wheat values however has confounded all prophets. It turned what could have been a good deal into one subjected to criticism and also much political propaganda. </para>
          <para>It should be recognised, however, that the Government protected wheat growers against any loss resulting from a rising market by providing that the Treasury would make up to the pool any losses. Suggestions from some political quarters that originally the Government had no intention of carrying any losses are unfounded. This is confirmed by a statement in the letter referred to earlier by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Thomson</inline> who detailed information given him by a senior official of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Thomson</inline> said: </para>

          <para>The fact is that in this instance the growers received the export parity.

            <para>- ft is not my intention to attempt to hold the attention of the Senate for very long, but I have now an opportunity to draw the attention of honourable senators to a course of action that has recently been taken by the Australian Democratic Labor Party. It is of some significance that it should be put before the Senate because this course of action originated in this chamber. Honourable senators will recall that the DLP moved in the Senate for the appointment of a commission of inquiry into the rural industries. The motion was debated on a number of occasions and when it finally came to .a vote was defeated. In order to indicate that that motion was not merely an empty gesture by the Democratic Labor Party but was an expression of real concern and an attempt to help the rural sector 1 indicate to the Senate now the course of action we have subsequently pursued. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The relevance of that course to the Bill before the Senate is that this Bill highlights the recurring chronic and endemic situations in the rural industries. These continuing and recurring crises require urgent attention and all sorts of artificial props. Therefore they require recourse to the national Parliament for the provision of money from the revenue to support this or that area. All these things are absolutely necessary. The tragedy is that they are now inescapably associated with the conduct of the whole of the rural industries of Australia. For how long <inline font-style="italic">thi</inline> position can continue, for how long it can be permitted to go on in the interests of the nation and of those people who have committed their own lives and the lives of their families to the rural industry involves a big note of interrogation. That is why our Party has always said that unless the whole structure of the rural economy is closely examined and is given a new look in the light of our approach to the new world, we will continue to have these crises and the Parliament will continually be asked to try to retrieve a desperate situation and to succour the dying rural industries. If it is not this one today, it will be another one tomorrow. </para>
          <para>In those circumstances the attitude of the DLP has been that the whole rural sector must be closely examined by a commission properly constituted for that purpose. lt must be adequately structured and supplied with personnel, with competent evidence coming before it from the whole range of disciplines which will assist to discover the remedies that must be applied once the problems are established. That was the purpose of our Party in presenting our proposition for the establishment of a commission of inquiry into the rural industries. As I have said, it was not merely an empty political gesture. It was the beginning of a very definite and determined effort to embark upon a course of action. As a further step in that course of action the Democratic Labor Party has now written to all the rural industries, to all the bodies and organisations in the rural sector which are concerned with one or another of the rural industries or some aspect of their operations. It is proposing also to write over the whole field of agricultural and rural disciplines within the universities to appropriate bodies, agricultural economists and statisticians and to all those people who may bo able to indicate the assistance they can give in such an inquiry. I take the liberty of reading for the benefit of honourable senators a document that has been sent out by us. It has been widely distributed but not yet as widely distributed as it will be. </para>

              <para>- But it all takes up the time of the Parliament. I am not saying that this Bill represents a great concession to the wheat industry. I am saying only that it highlights the recurring difficulties that are becoming endemic. They are becoming deeper and more serious and obviously all we are doing from time to time is trying to plug holes, to fill in the gaps in the ailing industries that require a complete re-look, a re-examination in the light of the new world in which those industries are required to operate. I am sure, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, that</inline> in the circumstances I will earn your solicitude by my advocacy as to the relevance of my submission. I therefore would indicate the broad lines along which we have approached the rural sector. </para>

          <para>We have suggested that there should be constituted an expert commission of inquiry into the whole structure of the rural economy. That commission would examine the importance of the rural economy, its role and its function in the Australian economy. Honourable senators will be aware that we presented this proposition during the recent Senate election campaign, particularly in Victoria and Queensland where we gained very big numbers of votes. We regard that result as being in no small measure due to the response of the rural area in those States to our plans, to our positive approach to the problems which face the rural industries. We believe that the wheat industry in Victoria and Queensland played a conspicuous part in that result. </para>
          <para>The proposed rural commission of inquiry would necessarily face an immense task because of all the elements which go to constitute the rural economy and on which its welfare, viability and national value depend. It would have to be an inquiry which would assist to charter the course of our rural economy at least into the year 2000. The commission would have to be prepared to examine the role of every rural industry, present and future. It would have to examine the complex economic, social and personal implications of any restructuring of the rural sector. It would have to accept the fact of a rapidly changing national economy in its relation to a changing world economy and new and changing patterns of consumer demand throughout the world, particularly in the developing countries. Of course, they do not exhaust the appropriate matters for inquiry. Therefore it will be obvious to honourable senators, as the document we have prepared for distribution states, that an appropriate investigation will be entrusted only to a body which in personnel, time, technical knowledge and administrative assistance  is  equipped to discharge this immense task. </para>

In fact, it has pursued the matter since. My Party has been in touch with many of the people, organisations and functionaries in rural industry. I should point out that it has already received many letters of commendation and offers of support. As I have said before, this exercise is only in its early stages. However, the Democratic Labor Party, fortified by the widespread and growing belief that such an inquiry is necessary hopes that it will be able to persuade the Government that it should consider this proposition and embark upon the constitution of an appropriate body of inquiry. </para>

              <para>- 1 did not say that this was recurring legislation; I said that this was a recurring type of situation. We know that it is occurring throughout many of our rural industries. I want to point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Prowse</inline> that I do not disclaim for one moment the necessity for this legislation. In fact, the Democratic Labor Party supports the Bill. However, it has grave doubts as to whether this legislation will in any sense solve the problem which exists in the industry. The Democratic Labor Party believes that what is necessary is an examination of the problem in depth and a discovery of the solutions to it in depth also. This can only come about as a result of an appropriate investigation by a body which is properly equipped to discover both the problem and the solution. With those words and, more particularly, having put into the record the policy of the Democratic Labor Party and an indication of the sincerity with which it has pursued this proposal, I conclude my remarks. My Party supports the Bill. </para>

              <para>- 1 think this Bill is a sloppy piece of legislation in this respect. lt docs set out certain terms and conditions. These are broadly the sorts of terms and conditions upon which the Treasurer would proceed, lt is possible that it will be necessary to apply unforseen terms and condition:; in relation to this measure. Therefore, a blank cheque has been given to the Treasurer lo apply these terms and conditions. Will this legislation apply, for instance, to the area in which the wheat is sold or will it apply limitations as to whether the Australian Wheat Board shall deal in certain other directions? Many of the things which are exercising my mind at the moment are causing <inline font-style="italic">me to</inline> ask questions -about what sorts of terms and conditions are contemplated in this legislation. I hope that the Minister for Supply <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson),</inline> who is handling the passage of this legislation through this chamber, will give honourable senators an opportunity to learn something about this matter. </para>

          <para>The very crux of my remarks is the terms and conditions under which this legislation shall apply. Some are set out and some arc not set out. This chamber has been left to guess what terms and conditions have been left out. Surely the Parliament, in considering legislation of this kind, is entitled to at least some knowledge, some indication or some sort of an inkling of what further conditions are contemplated. There is no point in canvassing this matter any further. However, I hope that the Minister will give some indication to this chamber of the areas which are intended to be embraced by this legislation. </para>

        </motion>
        <para class="block">The purpose of this motion is to ensure that the problem of pollution, whether it be air pollution, water pollution, or land pollution - I suppose one can divide them only in some artificial way - continues to be under consideration by an appropriate committee of the Senate. Recently the Senate decided that the Standing Committee on Social Environment be appointed. We have had two important Select Committees of the Senate, one dealing with air pollution and the other dealing with water pollution. Both of those committees conducted lengthy investigations and presented reports which I think were pleasing to the Senate. The report of the Senate </para>
        <para class="block">Select Committee on Air Pollution suggested that certain nationally co-ordinated action should be taken. That Committee moved a fair way into the field of air pollution. With the experience gained by the Select Committee on Air Pollution and because of the agitation which was occurring in Australia and elsewhere, the Senate Select Committee on Water Pollution was able to go still further, and it produced a magnificent report of which the Senate was entitled to be proud and for which we thank its members and the <inline font-weight="bold">Chairman, Senator Davidson.</inline> We are proud of the work carried out by those two Committees. </para>
        <para>At the time the Senate embarked on these inquiries, the field of pollution was regarded as being a little way out, a little unusual I suppose. In fact, it was thought that this was a non-controversial subject, one on which energies could safely be expended. But as everyone knows, and perhaps as those who suggested the inquiry at the outset understand, these fields became centres of tremendous controversy, not only here but all over the world, even before the committees had rendered their reports. I think we all want to be sure that the reports of the committees are not lost sight of. If there are to be any alterations to the proposals advanced we want to see that the Senate and some committees of the Senate will be concerned with them. We want to be sure that there is someone who can remind the Senate, and perhaps the Parliament and the Government through the Senate, that action needs to be taken to deal with the problems. We want some body which can continue with the extremely valuable work which was started. I do not think any one of us wants to see that work regarded as being finished. The problem of pollution is a continuing one. The contribution made by the Senate select committees ought not to be regarded as ended. The committees themselves realised that a great deal would have to be done. I think there is almost a duty on us to see that the work continues and does not end there. That is substantially the reason for my proposing the motion presently before the Senate. </para>
        <para>Not only do we have senators who are expert in the field of pollution but also we have experts attached to the Senate staff. Others who are not on the Senate staff are available to us and can contribute to the oversight of this problem. The Standing Committee on Social Environment having been appointed, we have a body which could usefully continue to work on this problem of pollution. That is why the suggestion is made that there be a continuing oversight of the problem. The suggestion is not that there is some urgency for the Committee to bring down a report. It is suggested that it carry out a continuing oversight of the problem in the same way as standing committees in other countries do. Particular subject matters are constantly referred to those committees, and from time to time some urgent matter or some specific point may call for a report to be made. By this means there is a continuing oversight of particular legislative affairs. That is the nature of the proposal I am putting forward. I am proposing the continuation of the extremely valuable work that has been done by the select committees on air and water pollution in order to ensure that their recomendations are not shelved, as is sometimes suggested happens to recommendations made by select committees, although I believe this practice is diminishing. </para>
        <para>Previously we appointed the Senate Select Committee on Medical and Hospital Costs, and that Committee brought forward a report. Later the Committee suggested that there be a committee appointed to carry out a continuing investigation into this subject matter. We in the Senate then proposed the appointment of the Standing Committee on Health and Welfare. In a sense that Committee is continuing the work of the original Senate Select Committee on Medical and Hospital Costs. I think the appointment of that Committee is of value in the work of the Senate and is in the interests of the nation. I suggest to the Senate that we ought to do something on the same lines in relation to pollution. I do not think there would be very much difference of opinion about the suggestion that we should allow the work carried out by the two select committees on pollution to continue and the expert knowledge acquired by the Senate and the staff of the Senate to continue to be used. </para>
        <para>I now wish to make some general remarks about pollution. I suggest that during the past 2 years millions of words have been written and spoken about pollution and the need to conserve our national resources. Much more needs to be said to ensure complete public education, to coordinate different groups to define the problems clearly, and to plan solutions. The time is ripe for action. That was the view expressed by Professor John Burton, the professor on natural resources at the University of New England. He said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>But for those who are really prepared  to  listen, most of what matters  has  already been said  sud  the time  has  come for action,  not  more words.  lt  is not enough to be convinced  that  conservation  is  a good  thing,  plain hard work  is  needed before it can effectively be  put  into  practice.  We need action urgently  if  there are  to be  any brakes upon the wholesale  pollution  of our country and the contribution to world pollution by our country. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>Serious examination is now being given to the forecasts of prospective pollution levels in the Australian cities. In Sydney one can no longer delude oneself that the air of the city is cleaner than in older more industrialised cities of the world. Tests in George Street have shown that air pollution from carbon monoxide from motor vehicle exhausts is as bad as Chicago and Denver - cities with the highest readings in America. The maximum carbon monoxide concentration recorded during the Captain Cook celebrations was 114 parts per million over a 5 minute period. Denver&#39;s 5 minute maximum was the same and Chicago&#39;s was 81. Over an 8 hour period the maximum recorded in Sydney was 40 parts per million, compared with 37 in Denver, 39 in Chicago and 32 in Los Angeles. These figures should shake Sydneysiders and all Australians out of complacency. No longer can we comfortably refer to the <inline font-style="italic">terrible</inline> air pollution in America. We are breathing air in Sydney streets just as bad and often worse than in America&#39;s foulest cities. This degree of pollution is a day-by-day health hazard, lt calls for immediate action, not for more words, more guidelines, more reports. We know how foul is the air in Sydney. </para>
        <para>I suggest, for the benefit of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus,</inline> who might be thinking that the air in Melbourne is perhaps cleaner than that in Sydney, that the air in other major capitals is perhaps of the same order of foulness. </para>

            <para>-  It may be that the narrow streets in Sydney present a peculiar problem. It may be that the wide boulevardes in Melbourne and Adelaide - thanks to the great Surveyor-General - enable the pollution to be dispersed, but this is only a matter of degree. We have a tremendous problem. Action is needed. That action is partly legislative and partly administrative. The source of the legislative action must be Parliament. The superintendence of the administrative action must be Parliament. Probably the amounts of money required will be so tremendous that the source of this money will be the Commonwealth Parliament. Irrespective of whether the matter may appear immediately to be in many instances a State problem, there is no question but that the real solution to the problem will demand Commonwealth involvement on a grand scale - to provide money and, inevitably, to have some say in what is to be done to solve the problem. </para>

        <para>Certainly it is a national problem. The Senate, having embarked on the setting up of 2 committees - I think with the good will of everyone - and the committees having reported, with the approbation of everyone, should be continuing its work in this field. America has acted to cut down carbon monoxide pollution because it recognised that car exhaust fumes account for about two-thirds of the air pollution in cities. </para>

            <para>- 1 understand that all new cars in America must have their carbon monoxide emissions cut by about 97 per cent and other pollutants by similar high percentages by 1975. We can emulate that kind of action very quickly if we move quickly. The waters of our great cities are just as foul as the atmosphere. Recently tests on fish and marine life in Botany Bay showed mercury contents of up to 58 parts per million - a highly poisonous amount. In America all fishing in the Great Lakes was banned after fish were found containing up to 7 parts per million, but people are still fishing commercially in Botany Bay. Similar  degrees of pollution have been found in Port Phillip Bay. The River Murray is heavily polluted with sewage. That once great water artery is now a sewer. Sydney&#39;s incomparable beaches are filthy with sewage. The harbour is so polluted that people are unwilling to use harbour-side pools. </para>

        <para>With the Duke of Edinburgh in Canberra, it is timely to mention his warnings on polluting our environment. He appealed to Australians not to leave the future generations a legacy of exploited resources and thoughtless pollution. He said that he had noticed a marked shift in recent years to a concern for the environment - a concern to make this country a satisfactory place in all respects for civilised and rewarding human existence. We must think not only of our own enjoyment and use of our environment but of the next generation and following generations. We must try to restore the damage that we have done to the environment and then ensure that our future actions do not generate other pollution problems for subsequent generations. Professor Temple, Professor of Physical Chemistry at Sydney University - another expert - has warned that we cannot live high on private affluence and at the same time go on creating public squalor. He pointed out that, if we want clean air and water, the community will have to pay. This includes industry, which must take a very large measure of responsibility for polluting our environment. In 1968-69 industry throughout Australia spent only $40m on pollution control in Australia - about $2 per head of population per year. This is not nearly enough when one considers the amount of damage caused to the environment by industry. Heavy penalties are not enough. Industry must become closely involved with a programme to redress the damage which has been done over the years and which is still being done. The Senate committees recommended that urgent coordinated action be taken on a national basis. For the convenience of those who read Hansard, and with the concurrence of honourable senators, I incorporate in Hansard the conclusions and recommendations in the report of the Senate Select Committee on Air Pollution. </para>

        <para class="block">CONCLUSIONS </para>
        <para>The Committee has expressed views and conclusions throughout the report. Here it groups those which it believes to be most important. </para>
        <para class="block">Part of a Problem  -  Water pollution is only part of a much broader pollution problem which is threatening our whole national environment, lt can be solved most effectively by tackling it as a national problem. In doing so. Australia must recognise its responsibilities in an international movement to clean up &#39;spaceship earth&#39; and it must recognise that it may be both polluter and victim in &#39;international&#39; problems such as that presented by oil pollution. </para>
        <para>A Scarce Resource - Water is a scarce and valuable natural resources, more scare in Australia than in any other continent. Australia has advanced well beyond the frontier days when water could be considered free. Today there is an economic price on water, a price that is increasing steeply as the population grows and industry expands. </para>
        <para>Deteriorating Asset - Because polluters so often escape full payment of this price, water resources all over the country are being squandered, by neglect or deliberate action, or by lack of administrative co-ordination. Rivers, streams, lakes, coastline and underground aquifers are being polluted in all States and Territories. Some waterways can no longer be used except as sewers. Fortunately, the deterioration of our water resources has not become so severe in Australia as it has in most older communities and in other advanced industrial countries. But the difference is only a function of growth and time. </para>
        <para>Problems and Causes - The main water pollution problems in Australia relate to sewage, industrial effluents and salinity. They ave caused mainly by the lack of an effective pricing system, an abysmal ignorance of the causes and consequences of pollution, piecemeal and parochial administration of water resources, and half-hearted and illdirected methods of abatement. Until recently, there was no general public awareness that water pollution was a problem. Even now, the awareness is only limited and comparatively unco-ordinated The lesson has yet to be driven home that water pollution respects neither political boundaries nor social groups. Today, pollution is affecting the quality of our lives. Tomorrow, il may affect longevity. Yet all Australians may be numbered among both the polluters and the victims of pollution. </para>
        <para>Confused Values - Although the blame for water pollution must be shared by all, some are more to blame than others. The true weighting of pollution responsibility is reflected equitably neither in the financial costs of abatement nor in the social costs incurred in lost amenity and decreased efficiency. Pollution has too often been justified by false economics. Easily measured private profits have been used as a facile argument to justify intangible and immeasurable social losses. As the pressures to pollute have been economic, the pressures to abate will be most successful where they also are economic. Costs must be weighed realistically against benefits and paid for realistically by polluters. </para>
        <para>Ignorance and Inertia - Behind most pollution problems lie the twin factors of ignorance and inertia. A general lack of water pollution experts and an almost complete lack of training facilities are manifest, and there is no concerted programme of public education on pollution problems. Few opportunities are available for education in the technical fields related to water pollution. There are large gaps in the documentation of our water resources and there is no pragmatic programme of research into the causes and consequences of water pollution, or into its economics. The existence in Australia of many societies, voluntary organisations and individuals already dedicated to a particular aspect of environmental protection is widespread and plainly evident. Merely as illustrations, we refer here to bodies such as the Aus tralian Conservation Foundation, the Colong Committee, the Great Barrier Reef Committee, the National Parks Association of New South Wales, and to the very many individuals who are greatly concerned about aspects of the environment such as the protection of the coastline, the preservation of wildlife, and the maintenance ir their natural state of water bodies such as the Myall Lakes in New South Wales. The existence Of this keen interest gives promise that with proper stimulus, support and encouragement the nation may rely on a great body of Australian citizens willing and anxious to lend their aid to a programme of conservation, and pollution abatement. Although there was a marked improvement in public awareness of pollution problems throughout the world during the period over which our inquiry extended, there is, in Australia, neither a State nor a national programme of public education on water pollution. The problem of water pollution is intimately related to a lack of underStanding of water use and quantity. Any effective measures for the preservation of water quality must deal comprehensively with the management of water resources. The solution of the pollution problem in Australia will require the use of extensive resources of money and skills, and will call for the acquisition of knowledge through education and research on a scale that will require a national approach. </para>
        <para>Diffused Responsibility - There is nothing in the present piecemeal and parochial administration of water to prevent the insidious growth of pollution excesses. The problem of pollution is so vast, the responsibility so diffused, and the ignorance of causes and consequences so widespread, that only a concerted national effort can save many Australian water resources from becoming unusable. Adequate constitutional powers for such an effort are already available to the States and the Commonwealth. Water pollution control in Australia lacks authority, co-ordination and planning, and clearly defined objectives. It also lacks money. It is administered by a variety of organisations which respond inconsistently to sundry extemporaneous pressures. The Commonwealth is not exempt from this general criticism. Its administration of water pollution lacks cohesion and direction. There has been a reticence on the part of many local and State authorities to enforce the existing laws relating to pollution control. The closer the relationship between the polluter and the enforcing authority, the less stringent has been the enforcement. In fact, the enforcement authority itself is often a polluter on a much larger scale than the alleged offender. The absence of, or variation in, standards and implementation policies has led to a situation in which industries have been able to take advantage of this disarray in gaining the most favourable conditions when establishing a new polluter industry. Too little encouragement has been given to those authorities, communities, individuals and industries that have adopted a responsible attitude to pollution abatement and control. Such encouragement may be given by a co-ordinated and uniform approach which assists in promoting the use of new technology and prevents the irresponsible from gaining an advantage over the responsible. Water pollution problems influence a wide range of regional issues. Local considerations, however, must have regard to the interests of adjoining regions. The technical and financial resources required are often beyond the resources of the region, and a wider involvement is then necessary. The overwhelming weight of our evidence suggests that order can be brought to this chaos of authorities only if they are co-ordinated at the national level. </para>

        <para>The Committee concluded that the whole task of water resources management could best be undertaken on a national scale. It sees as vital the need to identify a national interest in water and to define a basic structure by which a national policy may be implemented. It leaves for later investigation and consideration by appropriate bodies within that structure the detailed processes by which the interest and policy may be effectively implemented. In particular, the Committee identified the following activities which it believes cannot be effectively handled otherwise: </para>
        <para>Co-ordination. There must be StateCommonwealth co-ordination in ensuring that a balance between conservation and development is attained. </para>
        <para>Assessment of present and potential pollution. There must be a comprehensive quantitative assessment of present and potential pollution problems and a continuing assessment of the country&#39;s water resources. </para>
        <para>Techniques for abatement and control. Technical resources must be co-ordinated to deal with common problems. Where unique skills and advice on techniques for abatement and control of pollution are required, these should be readily available from a national body. </para>
        <para>Determination of Criteria. General criteria are required for assessing the acceptability of water for specific uses. These could then be adapted to differing local conditions. </para>
        <para>Finance. As the existing problem is so extensive and the potential problem so great, there seems little doubt that financial aid will be a significant factor in the encouragement of pollution abatement and prevention measures. </para>
        <para>Legislation. The diversity of attitudes reflected in the absence of unity in legislative control suggests that a co-ordinated approach to new legislation is essential. </para>
        <para>International considerations. World concern and debate on water issues is increasing rapidly. A focus for Australia&#39;s participation in such debate and action is therefore desirable. </para>
        <para>Arbitration. Conflicts inevitably occur in water resources management, and in cases of dispute there is a need for a recognised authority to arbitrate. This could be undertaken at the national level. </para>
        <para class="block">The Committee regards as fundamental to a coordinated policy on water pollution the emergence of a national body (hat could operate and coordinate at the con of the whole national programme against pollution. The evidence tended to establish firmly that the Commonwealth may lay down and enforce a national approach through Commonwealth legislation alone. However, the Committee believes that, having regard to the Federal concept of the Australian Constitution, the creation of an effective national policy through one national agency acting with and through State pollution control bodies should preferably be achieved by the adoption of concurrent, parallel or complementary legislation. There are certain areas in relation to services such as research which require only Commonwealth legislation. An effective approach to water quality, conservation and water development can best be achieved by bringing together a wide range of skills, used in a vigorous corporate approach but maintaining the integrity of the individual disciplines. The wide variety of skills and interests involved in water pollution issues does not allow the identification of any national body with any individual Government Ministry. There could be direct conflict of interest in the location of the water pollution responsibility in the Department of National Development, the Department of Health or any one of a number of other departments. Although there can be a measure of arbitration within the national body, conflict between Commonwealth. State and individual interests will require resolution. It is necessary, therefore, that an independent body within the Federal concept be created or utilised for this purpose. In this regard, the Committee has noted the nature of the inter-State Commission provided for in the Constitution, and believes that consideration might well be given to its re-formation with, if constitutionally possible, effective arbitral power, and in a form suitable for the resolution of these potential conflicts. </para>

        <para>It is clear that the urgency of the problems have been widely impressed on a majority of our people. The 2 committees have carried out a thorough analysis of what action is needed, but the matters must be kept alive. We can do that effectively by referring the matter to the Standing Committee on Social Environment, which can look at the problems in the light of the thorough investigation by those 2 committees and in the light of what is or is not being done by the Government to carry out these recommendations. The Committee could suggest what measures, in its opinion, from the legislative view point should be taken. We can thus take the problem from the level of every day discussion to one of planned action. There is need to strengthen or to create new legislative controls and enforcement agencies. There is need for heavy government spending on more research so we can find how to reconcile progress with conservation. We must find out where to locate power plants. For instance, the proposed nuclear plant at Jervis Bay may create a major water pollution problem with the heated water that it will pour into the sea. Apart from the possible radiation hazards, the plant could destroy the ecology of the area. We must learn how to locate housing away from industrial areas. We should plan to avoid the suggested conservation tragedies such as the proposed Clutha coaldust dump near Wollongong which, it is suggested, will ruin one of the most beautiful landscapes in the country and which will pollute and air of a major provincial city. </para>
        <para>The Committee on Social Environment may be able to play -I hope it will - an important national role. It can provide a forum for the experts to warn of the dangers. I refer to what President Nixon said to Congress about pollution about a year ago. He said: </para>

          <para>The fight against pollution is not a search for villains. For the most part, the damage to our environment has not been the work of evil men, nor has it been the inevitable by-product either of advancing technology or of growing population. It results not so much from choices made; as from choices neglected; not from malign intentions, but from failure to take into account the full consequence of our actions. </para>

        <para class="block">It is time for us to look at the full consequences of our actions in Australia and to move urgently to restore and preserve the environment. The Leader of the Government in the Senate was kind enough to suggest to me that there may be some suggestions as to the wording of this proposal. The substance of my resolution is that there ought to be a committee which is concerned in a continuing way with this problem, especially as it has the opportunity to carry on the extremely valuable work which was done by the 2 Senate select committees. I would welcome any constructive proposals which are directed towards this end. This is not a party political matter at all. The preservation of our environment and the endeavour to do what is right in the national interest is away  beyond any question of partisan politics. This is the way in which the problems were approached by members of the 2 committees. This is the way in which we approach the problem this evening. I ask the Senate to support the proposal which is directed towards these simple ends. </para>

            <para>-  The Senate is obliged to the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> for the comments which he has made. I am sure members of the Senate Select Committee on Air Pollution and the Senate Select Committee on Water Pollution - the 2 committees to which he has referred - have noted with appreciation the compliments he has extended to them. I think the Leader of the Opposition will agree when he looks at the official title of the Standing Committee on Social Environment and when he looks at the terms of reference which he himself has proposed should be submitted to the Committee that the matters referred to it are not simply confined to the areas of air and water. Indeed, in some report which I read recently the matter of pollution and environment relates not only to air and water but also to the areas of noise, soil, the sea and coast and perhaps even includes radioactivity. However from the remarks the Leader of the Opposition has made the Senate will readily understand that he is painting a broad canvas in connection with environment and pollution. The inclusion of the term &#39;social environment&#39; in the very title of the Committee to which we are referring paints a broad picture and goes far beyond the areas of air and water, ft is natural that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> and all of us who may speak in this debate or who may have any connection with the Committee will have a deep and continuing interest in these 2 areas. These are areas in which 2 Senate select committees have been established and which have done a considerable amount of work. Furthermore without doubt these are urgent areas and they are the areas which create the greatest amount of public interest. They are areas in which we, not only as senators but as citizens, are concerned. </para>

But both words and both areas are serious. They are not only serious in the concerns of life itself but also serious in terms of management. The Leader of the Opposition said he understood that there might be a suggestion to change the form of the motion I shall read the suggested change now. So that he may have an opportunity to think about this 1 shall pass a copy over to him. I suggest that the resolution might read: </para>

          <para class="block">The Leader of the Opposition will readily see that most of his words are included. Perhaps it may be said that there is not a great deal of difference between what he has put forward and what I have suggested. But I invite him to think about this because in my view the suggestions which I have put forward provide a little more concise area of action and perhaps a greater directive. &#39;Social environment&#39; is a somewhat new term in Parliament. Of course it is not new in public usage, in other Parliaments, in modern studies and research or in committee jargon. The resolution proposes to refer to the Senate Standing Committee on Social Environment the 2 matters which are set before us on the notice paper today. I hardly think that the Leader of the Opposition is suggesting the maintenance of a Senate Standing Committee to be constantly in office as a body exercising a continuing oversight of the problems of pollution, including ways and means of preserving the environment from pollution. Rather I suggest that the Senate Standing Committee on Social Environment might come into this Senate with a report following upon what I would hope would be the examination of the necessary steps to ensure the continuing oversight. In short, The Senate Standing Com- mittee on Social Environment if it so thought might well recommend to the Senate that a body, either existing or yet to be recommended, might be the body which would ensure the continuing oversight. </para>
          <para>If a Senate standing committee is entrusted with continuing oversight then it has totake unto itself a great deal of activity, research, time and effort as well as employing within its structure a whole range of additional personnel of a consultative, legal, legislative and research nature. Furthermore tonight I suggest to the Senate that we look at this matter - ifI may put it in this way - in terms of confining the Senate standing committee&#39;s activities to a deliberate and defined area of activity. As all honourable senators will know, one of the problems in the emergence of this committee work is that often our terms of reference have not been defined sufficiently and we have had a wide ranging canvas. This has made for problems because circumstances change and because we are dealing with problems that are now on the Australian horizon. We are involved in all the variations of the problem concerned and. as time goes on, circumstances alter and we find ourselves with new problems and new work to do. Consequently, we are not bringing in our reports with sufficient rapidity. We come to a conclusion and make suggestions to the Senate, and then we take up our duties on either another action altogether or a related area of the action to which we have just been referring. </para>
          <para>Therefore, I suggest quite genuinely an alteration of the form of words in paragraph (1) of the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition.I suggest that there should be an examination of steps to ensure the continuing oversight of the problems of pollution rather than a submission of this whole matterto the Committee which would then beas it were, the established body to undertake this work. </para>

          <para class="block">Two or three things stand out in the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition. One is the reference to the reports of the Senate select committees on air pollution and water pollution. Let me point out the common area of activity of those 2 committees. At page 64 of its report the Select Committee on Air Pollution said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It was brought hometothe Committee many limes during the enquiry that air pollution is but one small part of man&#39;s contamination of his environment. Pollution of the water resources of the world, pollution of the soil and, in this mechanised world of ours, pollution of the environment by the noise of man&#39;s activities are all parts of the same problem. In some cases, such as the use of wet-scrubbing methodsto clean exhaust gases from industry, the curing of an air pollution problem can lead directly to the creation of a problemof water pollution. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In short, the emphasis is on the fact that that inquiry revealed that air pollution is but one small part of man&#39;s contamination of his environment. I turn now to the report of the Select Committee on Water Pollution. At the beginning of its conclusions it said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Water pollution is only part of a much broader pollution problem whichis threatening our whole national environment. </para>
            <para>It can be solved most effectively by tackling it as a national problem. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That last sentence leads me to refer again to the report of the Select Committee on Air Pollution, which suggested that if this matter is to be dealt with at all it must be dealt with as a national problem. The report stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Committee therefore considers that, in any future arrangements for the study of pollution problems, cognisance should be taken of the total environment and the interaction of the different facets of what is virtually one problem. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">When tabling in the Senate the report of the Select Committee on Water Pollution, I pointed out with particular emphasis that the problem needed to be dealt with on a national basis. In order to give effect to that objective, the main recommendation of that Committee was the setting up by the Commonwealth of a national water  commission. We set out many details in this connection. We even went so far as to refer to the matter of constitutional authority, because in our view this was a very important issue. We submitted that, on the evidence that was presented to the Committee, the Commonwealth, through a coalescence of powers in a number of fields, had sufficient legislative competence to establish a national approach. </para>
          <para>So, for those two reasons - the total pollution problem in the sphere of the environment and the fact that both the committees that have already done work on this matter considered that a national approach was not only desirable but also necessary - I believe that paragraph  (2)  of the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition should read: </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>the recommending as soon as possible ot what further measures might be taken to overcome the problems revealed by the reports of the Senate Select Committees on Air Pollution and Water Pollution, and which measures, if any, should be taken urgently. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">I suggest that that provides the Standing Committee on Social Environment with the opportunity to discuss very definitely the recommendations and conclusions presented in those  2  reports and to present recommendations to the Senate as soon as possible. I believe that that is important and imperative. But it is not much good saying &#39;as soon as possible&#39; if the canvas is so wide that the Standing Committee cannot bring forward matters which are relevant, upon which decisions can be taken and upon which action can be based.  1  hope that the report will not cover too much of the canvas of the forms of pollution that we have in the community today. We are all tempted to refer to them. Of course, we are concerned about them and therefore we refer to them. </para>
          <para>The motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition is related in principle to a plan of action. That is what I am concerned about. I trust that, whoever is on this Standing Committee and whatever work it undertakes, it will be able to go forward on the basis of terms of reference which it understands quite clearly and quite definitely and which are within a defined area. I suggest that the Standing Committee should report to the Senate as soon as possible so that we will receive an immediate report from it, even though in that report it may recommend that the Com mittee itself should go on to do certain other things or make certain other investigations. If we give it too broad a canvas or if we make its terms of reference too uncertain, it may go on and on and, because circumstances can change, the whole area of the study of the environment may well be brought into disrepute and also the whole Senate committee system may run the risk of being in danger. </para>
          <para>It is very popular today to be on the bandwagon of the pollution of the environment. It is all very well to criticise industry, communities and even humanity for what they are doing to the various elements of our environment. But never let us forget that in our acceptance of the standards of living that we enjoy, appreciate and talk about we run the risk of being offenders against our social environment. If we are prepared to accept a way of life that we think is a good one and if we are prepared to work for and contribute to an improvement of our standards of living, we should also be prepared to act responsibly and to accept the discipline that such improvements in our standards of living, such <inline font-style="italic">improvements</inline> in our affluence and such improvements in our opportunities impose on us. </para>
          <para>So,  1  take the liberty of suggesting this small change in the form of words in the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition. I leave it to the decision of the Senate. I express the hope that in the end the Standing Committee on Social Environment, in the motton that is before us tonight, will have clear guidelines and clear directions as to the areas in which it is to operate and the areas on which the Senate expects it to report. With those observations and qualifications, I support the motion before the Senate. </para>

I have been informed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> that it is suggested that paragraph (2)  in the motion might be altered in some minor particular which might give it a slightly different orientation. Possibly <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson</inline> is aware of the proposal. It would meet with the approval of my Party. We support the motion in its present form but, if the amendment is forthcoming, we will support the motion in its amended form. </para>

          <para class="block">I was a member of the Senate Select </para>
          <para class="block">Committee on Water Pollution and was aware of the deliberations and recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on Air Pollution. When the report of the Water Pollution Committee came before this chamber it dealt with a very peculiar situation. The States had been activated very considerably to operate in this field of the control of pollution of the environment. There was a great deal of activity in State regulation and in State legislation. The proposal of the Water Pollution Committee was that the Commonwealth should move quickly so that it might capture the activity and enthusiasm of the States and, contributing ils own activity and enthusiasm by the passage of parallel legislation, produce a national code and a national machine to control the pollution of the environment both in the States and in Commonwealth territories. One of the elements implicit in the recommendations of the Water Pollution Committee was the note of urgency. </para>
          <para>When that report was presented lo this chamber an amendment was moved by the Party to which t belong to the motion that the report be received. That amendment was to the effect that the motion to be conveyed to the Government be treated as a matter of urgency and that the Government should act urgently on the contents and recommendations of the report. 1 understand that that was a somewhat rare procedure. Perhaps it had not been adopted before. Nevertheless it was an indication of me seriousness with which the Senate regarded the whole matter and of (&#39;le urgency which it thought should accompany consideration of the report. To my knowledge there has been to this stage no activity by the Commonwealth Government. Within ils own territories of which J am aware, or elsewhere, there has been no attempt by administrative action, by regulation or certainly by legislation to operate in terms of the report. I am not altogether familiar with whether the Government has been in touch with the States in an attempt lo arrive al that co-ordinated position of the Commonwealth and State activity which the report so strongly commended. That being the case, it unfortunately does appear necessary that there should be constituted some on-going body which would have under continuous scrutiny the steps that are necessary from time to lime to implement a programme of environmental control and protection. </para>
          <para>In other words, the motion now before the Senate would be much more effective if the Commonwealth had moved or had given an indication of moving and the proposed on-going body, therefore, would have under its scrutiny something that was already operating. To the extent to which that is not the case, this motion contains some criticism by implication of the Government for the fact that it has not moved in terms of either of the reports - at least to my knowledge and perhaps to the knowledge of other honourable senators. Nevertheless if, as is suggested by the motion, this matter is referred to the Standing Committee, the Committee then can do what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson</inline> has suggested. Without attempting to cover a very broad canvas in one or two sweeps of the brush, it can attempt to pick out the steps that can be taken, that should be taken and that most urgently are required to be taken, and commend those to the Government so that at least step by step a programme of co-operative federalism in the concept of control of the environment may be carried into operation. </para>
          <para>For example, in terms of the Water Pollution Committee&#39;s report, I can imagine that the Standing Committee might first of all look at the extent to which the Commonwealth Government has moved to implement within its own territories any of the recommendations in the report. That is a limited section of reference which might well occupy the attention of a standing committee if it had such a reference as this before it. lt might then pose another question: What approach has been made by the Commonwealth to the States to try to co-ordinate the legislative and administrative actions of both? That could be another limited area, but nevertheless an area of an urgent character, which could produce a definite and effective answer. That is the kind of operation that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson</inline> has in mind - not that there should be, as it were, a permanent select committee looking at this question  of  environmental control but a committee which could investigate from time to time one step or another which might be taken, which has not been taken and which should be taken to implement finally a total programme  of  control and protection  of  the environment. </para>
          <para>As I listened to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson&#39;s</inline> speech, it seemed to me that that is the kind of concept that he has in mind. If it is, it is a concept with which I would agree completely. I have expressed before my deep concern that standing committees which have before them major references of tremendous breadth and depth might be so delayed in their investigations and in the presentation of their report and so interrupted in consideration of any matter that the question under review loses all significance with the passage of time. Therefore, to operate such a reference as this within the terms of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson&#39;s</inline> suggestion would appear to me to he the most effective manner in which a standing committee with such a reference, or for that matter any reference, might operate. 1 hope that the motion which was carried so firmly by the Senate on the presentation of the Water Pollution Committee&#39;s report will receive the urgent attention of the Government as we asked. Perhaps it would be proper if at question .; n. r - I may well do it within the next few days - a question were posed to the appropriate Minister asking whether the Government has acted in terms of that motion of the Senate and, if so, what has been done. If this reference is made to the Standing Committee it would be not inappropriate for the Committee, as constituted with this reference, to ask the Government what has been done in terms of the reports, more particularly in terms of the commendation contained in the reports that the Government take urgent action. </para>
          <para>In this field of environmental control we find now that the States are far ahead of the Commonwealth. They are more interested, they are more active, they are achieving results. If we are to have environmental control on a national basis it is vital that, so far as possible, legislation shall be uniform and co-ordinated. Once the State legislative action falls into State patterns it will be very difficult, if not impossible, to disturb them. This is the time when the Commonwealth should be most active in co-operation with the Stales which are at the peak of their activities. If this moment is lost it will be difficult, if not impossible, to recapture it. I would hope that a committee of this nature with this reference might well press the Govern ment, not on a political basis but on the basis of the operation of the Parliament, the protection of the nation and for the most effective implementation of a programme of environmental control, for early and urgent action to co-ordinate the activities of the States with those of the Commonwealth in devising a programme of environmental control as recommended by the reports of the select committees to which reference has been made. I commend this motion to the Senate and firmly support it, either in its present form or in the amended form as suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> which I think would be accepted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson</inline> and other honourable senators. </para>

            <para>-  Very briefly, I support the very lucid exposition which was given by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> on this subject. I think the watchwords in his remarks were &#39;planned activity&#39;. I differ with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson</inline> to some extent, although I might have misunderstood him. Perhaps I could begin by saying that the outstanding feature of the Senate Select Committee on Water Pollution was not from the direct implementation of its recommendations by the present Government but in that the Committee pinpointed certain problems in the States, as a result of which the States galvanised themselves into activity. </para>

          <para>While the Committee was in Melbourne taking evidence a controversy existed about a sewerage diversion into Port Phillip Bay. It was remarkable that during the time that we were there taking evidence the Premier of Victoria saw the light and decided to divert the sewerage line into Bass Strait. Conversely, when the Committee was in the Northern Territory we found that we were able to assist the Department of the Interior by exposing the depredations of the Rum Jungle project which grossly polluted the Finniss River. It is history now that the Department of the Interior has conducted field surveys to see what rehabilitation has been carried out by the Atomic Energy Commission. Applying those experiences and following the original line taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy,</inline> I say with all due respect to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson</inline> that I would not be content to see surveys and that sort of thing only. I want to see interim measures, and in order to achieve these I would adopt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne&#39;s</inline> thesis that we should be calling witnesses and making spot checks on the activities of some Government departments to see what is being done about environmental pollution, even if it is only in its infancy. Some matters call out for an independent body to mediate 1 conclude by referring to 3 classic illustrations. At the moment in the Australian Capital Territory there is a tug of war involving the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department about erecting a combined television tower and restaurant on Black Mountain. In this matter the Minister for the Interior is trying to be a benevolent neutral, the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department is wanting to embark on pollution by environmental rape and some of the lower echelon of the Department of the Interior are opposed to the proposal. Some of the officers have not committed themselves. But the Minister has remained silent. This is a mailer in respect of which a public inquiry lasting one or two days could bring all the issues into the open, as a result of which some people would be obliged to pull up their socks. </para>
          <para>Another matter which I mention relates to  out  new frontier. I refer to Dampier Sound and the operation of the Hamersley empire. The plain fact of the matter is that despite all our talk about pollution, in some rivers in that area pollution has been perpetuated under the guise of mineral exploration. 1 suggest that in that case, if we brought the Minister for National Development before us and asked him what obligations he had in this regard, and for that matter what obligations the Western Australian Government had, we would be able to embark on immediate effective interim measures. This is the way that I see the situation. I think we would find that if we proceeded in this way we would not have to wait for the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Alan Hulme)</inline> to act as a generalissimo on anti-pollution measures so far as the Commonwealth is concerned. If there were public hearings at which Ministers and their departments could be asked to defend themselves in relation to what they were doing in the cause of pollution - particularly water pollution - we would be able to get somewhere. </para>
          <para>Again following on with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne&#39;s</inline> thesis in relation to Federal responsibility and again adverting to the Australian Capital Territory, there has been an amazing delay in the proclamation of additional parklands in the Australian Capital Territory. Obviously the greater the open space the better it is. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton,</inline> who is not now in the chamber, would be aware that 1 have been waiting since last November to learn when the Minister for the Interior will take courage and say that a certain number of acres in the Northern Territory will not be a play area for the mining interests and for him to accede to the original request made by the Northern Territory National Parks Board for additional open spaces. 1 welcome the move which has been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy,</inline> but I believe that any inquiry should not be restricted to academic discussion. Only by confrontation with some of these departments will we be able to get quick measures which will prevent in a practical way intrusions into our existing environment. </para>

            <para>- The principle inherent in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy&#39;s</inline> motion is that there must be a continuing and definite Government activity for the preservation of our environment. I agree completely with this attitude and 1 commend him for having introduced the proposal. Perhaps the honourable senator could have used verbage to make it a more definite reference of the whole matter, but I agree with the attitude and the intention behind the proposal. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henty</inline> proposed that there be set up 2 select committees, one to study the problem of air pollution and the other to study water pollution in Australia, I felt at the time that the proposal was rather premature. Bearing in mind the vast open spaces of Australia one would spontaneously react that it could not happen here, that the things that, we read about as happening in other parts of the world just could not happen in Australia. It was not very long after the formation of the Senate Select Committee on Air Pollution, under the chairmanship of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Branson,</inline> that we realised from evidence that we had a problem in Australia far beyond that which could have been even remotely anticipated by anyone in this chamber or by the public at large. </para>

          <para>Reference was made this evening by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> to the presence of carbon monoxide at certain peak periods of traffic in Sydney. Frightening figures were revealed to us in evidence showing that at some peak traffic hours there were recordings as high as 80 parts per million of carbon monoxide in Sydney at certain locations. When one realises that that is within 20 parts per million of a toxic presence of CO, one realises that it is high time that we as a nation became interested in our environment and that what is happening here has not before been completely recognised. I feel that the activities of both the Senate Select Committee on Air Pollution and the Senate Select Committee on Water Pollution have led to a deep awareness in Australia of a problem of environment generally and that therein lies one of the greatest benefits of setting up these committees. </para>
          <para>I have before me a feature article issued by the Information Service of the British High Commission in Australia on 25th March - 5 days ago. It states that environment is now more than a passing fashion. lt refers to the appreciation of the old countries of the world of the need for drastic action to remove a condition which was applying there to a degree which was most detrimental to the quality of life of the people. It mentions action that was taken in Great Britain. A year and a half ago, from the top of Australia House and looking over London, I was able to see what had been achieved in a few brief years to improve the atmosphere and obtain clearer air. I would have expected to see a rather smudgy, grim and smoky city. I had the delightful experience of seeing the effect of a proper approach by Government to ensure an improved environment in the City of London. For example, there had been the prohibition of coal grates in homes in certain areas where tremendous amounts of smoke had been exuded into the atmosphere, leaving behind a grime which in addition to the effects of industry had put over the city a ceiling through which the sun could not penetrate. Today the sun is penetrating through what was hitherto a ceiling over the old city of London. As a result the environment and the people&#39;s place of living has been vastly improved. </para>
          <para>We can learn from the old, but we must realise also that we will have in Australia very similar problems unless we act. as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> suggests, in a continuing role of persistence in ensuring that we maintain here an environment to which we would all ascribe.

We have to keep it as it has been in the past. Judging by the present trend of things and the concentration of pollution in certain areas, woe betide us unless we do become active. </para>
          <para>While taking evidence during the inquiry by the Senate Select Committee on Air Pollution I and my fellow Committee members were impressed with State activity to combat air pollution. Action taken in New South Wales impressed me particularly. According to evidence given to us, in the 7 years following the passage of the Clean Air Act in New South Wales pollution problems in the major industrial areas in that State had abated by 40 per cent. This was in spite of a doubling of the industrial capacity. This shows what can be done when there is a concerted effort on the part of a government and which is appreciated by the public. I would like to see greater activity by this Government in accordance with the recommendations of both the Select Committee on Air Pollution and the Select Committee on Water pollution. The No. 1 recommendation of the Committee on Air Pollution was that the Commonwealth should enact legislation immediately to control air pollution within its territories. Realising that environmental control basically is a State matter, it is incumbent upon the central authority to lead the way and thereafter to act jointly with the States to ensure a better approach generally and a common attitude to the problem. </para>

There should be no undue intrusion by the Commonwealth but there should be helpful co-operation between the Stales and the Commonwealth by use of the bureau we proposed. I have no desire to speak at length on this matter. My point in rising was to commend the proposal to refer this matter to the Standing Committee on Social Environment. The Committee has been set up and now it must become active. In brief, I heartily support this proposal.

            <para>(9.55) - The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> has moved that the matter of pollution be referred to the Standing Committee on Social Environment. I do not oppose this motion. The Senate hai received reports from the Senate Select Committee on Water Pollution and the Senate Select Committee on Air Pollution, both of which were chaired by honourable senators from the Government parties. Both committees produced very valuable reports. Therefore it seems to me that this motion is a very natural succession to the reports from those committees. I think there is every reason why the matter mentioned in the motion should be referred lo the new standing committee that the Senate has set up. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson,</inline>who wa&#187; the  Chairman  of the Senate Select Committee on Water Pollution, suggested some variation in the wording of the motion without departing from the principle and substance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy&#39;s</inline> proposal. I leave it to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> to indicate whether ite intends to react to the suggested variation. I do not believe that it is something upon which the Senate should divide or about which an amendment should be moved because all of us are in accord with the principle. 1 find myself in complete agreement with some of the things said in this debate tonight. 1 think that bofh <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laucke</inline> said that the time has come for action. We have heard the words and there is now a need for more action at this time in our history when we have far greater advantages in tackling this problem than have the denser and smaller countries. If we are vigilant we can seize the nettle and solve the problem with far less difficulty than, for instance, the authorities in Europe, the United States of America and other countries where there are highly concentrated industrial areas with huge populations. </para>
          <para>Perhaps the situation in which I grew up enables me to visualise this problem much better than most people. The family home from which 1 am very proud to have come was on the banks of the Parramatta River in Sydney. 1 think that area was visited on one of the first tours of inspection undertaken by the 2 pollution committees. They visited Hen and Chicken Bay and the area along the river to Flemington and so on. In my young days there was a swimming pool at Meadowbank at Uhr&#39;s Point Bridge. There was a little sandy beach on the banks of the Parramatta River. We swam there, but he would be a very courageous man who would even put his foot in the Parramatta River at this stage. If a man fell out of a boat he would want to get out of the water as quickly as he could and then wash himself because the river is polluted. Now I live in an area at Eastwood above the smog line. From my front verandah in the mornings I can look across towards the western suburbs and see the smog line. All of us who travel by air to  and from Sydney at various times see evidence of the industrial pollution, lt is not evident to such an extent in Melbourne. lt is true, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laucke</inline> said, that the New South Wales Government made a significant contribution to solving the air pollution problem when it introduced the Clean Air Act. The authorities in London for instance, who face difficulties many times greater than our own, have been able to accomplish much towards solving the problem there. We have had select committees of the Senate investigating water pollution and air pollution and both of them put down comprehensive, intelligent and very worthwhile reports. The Senate has since created the Standing Committee on Social Environment and this motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy,</inline> subject to adjustment or otherwise of the wording, seems to me to be a natural consequence. I see no reason why we should not give a speedy passage to this motion. </para>

            <para>- in reply - I thank the Senate for the way in which it has dealt with this matter. Although it is of the highest importance it has been dealt wilh expeditiously, lt concerns us because of the work of the 2 Senate select committees but it is of greater concern to the nation. I listened to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson</inline> said. I think for technical reasons paragraph (1) should remain as it is. Strictly speaking, it is the matter that is referred and not the examination, because that is involved in the nature of the Committee itself. Further, the scope of the words is a little wider and it would obviate argument as to whether one was stepping beyond the wording when matters were being dealt with by the Committee. </para>

          <para class="block">The important step was taken on referring the petitions to the Standing Committee on Health and Welfare. From a public point of view it illustrated what can be done. Petitions in important terms emanating from ordinary citizens of the Commonwealth could be referred to a standing committee of the Senate because they commended themselves to honourable senators by their commonsense and wisdom. It was expected that the Committee might be. able to investigate these extremely important matters, but it was not really the appropriate body to deal with them. At the time no other appropriate committee was available. </para>

It has happened that the Standing Committee on Health and Welfare has not proceeded very far into this matter as it has been heavily engaged in considering other matters. Certain submissions were invited from police authorities and various other State authorities. I understand that the Attorneys-General were invited to make submissions. The submissions received can be made available to the </para>

It fits in with a previous decision of the Committee and is really a machinery measure for the better functioning of the committee system. I ask that the Senate accordingly accept the motion. </para>

          <para>- 1 wish to bring to the notice of the Senate and the Government the crises now occurring in the hospital services in Victoria. I am referring not only to the general hospitals that look after the health and welfare of the ordinary citizens -but also to the homes and hospitals for the aged and infirm. These institutions in Victoria, and no doubt similar institutions in other States, are facing great financial difficulty. They have reached the stage at which in some cases the beds that are urgently required cannot be filled because of lack of finance to employ sufficient staff to care for the patients. The situation has been reached where many of the hospitals which could and would willingly expand their services are unable to do so because of a lack of finance, despite the fact that an expansion of these services is vital. The situation has been reached where hospitals in Victoria for the aged and infirm - I can refer to one in particular because I am a member of its committee - have been instructed by the Victorian Hospitals and Charities Commission that under no circumstances are they to employ any more labour during the current financial year. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The hospital of which I am a committee member is not permitted, as a result of a direction of the Hospitals and Charities Commission, even to replace its wastage of staff. The hospital is Grace McKellar House, which is in the city of Geelong. lt is controlled by the Hospitals and Charities Commission. The members of the committee of this hospital and the citizens of Geelong have worked very hard over the years to make it probably the best hospital of its kind in Australia and probably one of the best hospitals of its kind in the southern hemisphere. We are very proud of what we have been able to achieve over the years since the initial public appeal for the establishment of this very fine hospital. </para>

            <para>- At the moment it has in the vicinity of 234 beds for aged and infirm patients. The number of beds should be at least trebled. We are in a situation where we cannot proceed any further with the expansion of this hospital because of financial difficulties. The 54 beds which we have added to the establishment over the last few months - I might say that we have been able to do so only a.s a result of the assistance of the Commonwealth in the form of subsidies - will be available for occupation in May of this year but they will not be occupied because of the direction of the Hospitals and Charities Commission that staff must not be engaged. The result is that these beds will have to remain unoccupied. </para>

        <para>I am able lo inform the Senate that, tragically, there are 800 aged and infirm persons on the waiting list of our hospital. A total of 250 of the SOO persons waiting are urgent cases who should be hospitalised immediately. Many of the people who arc on the waiting lists of hospitals are dying because they are unable to gain the medical attention and hospital accommodation they need. Part of the reason for this is the fact that insufficient finance is being made available by the Commonwealth to the States for the servicing of hospitals. Urgent meetings have been held by 2 organisations which are associated with hospitals in Victoria, namely, the Country Hospitals Association and the Association of Victorian Homes and Hospitals for the Aged and Infirm. Both organisations have met recently. The Association of Victorian Homes and Hospitals for the Aged and Infirm met on 25th March of this year to study the serious crisis which is facing the administrators of homes at the present time. Tn the course of that meeting 3 resolutions were unanimously carried. The first resolution was that there should be an increase in the personal care subsidy and a reduction in the age qualification. The second resolution was that there should be an increase in the Commonwealth&#39;s nursing home benefit and supplementary nursing home benefit. I will <inline font-style="italic">go</inline> into these matters in a little more detail later on. The third resolution was to the effect that there should be an extension of hospital benefits to patients accommodated in nursing homes. I wish to quote 2 sections of the address which was given by the  Chairman  of the Association of Victorian Homes and Hospitals for the Aged and Infirm when he opened the meeting. He said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Our executive has obtained figures from som; 21 member institutions. This has revealed that at the 30lh June 1970 their  combined  overdrafts were S355.000- </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I will speak in round figures for the purposes of this quotation -  but by the end of December last it had increased to 5762.00(1, an increase of 5426.000 and 127 per cent. To turn to the operating costs these again are alarming, because the actual combined deficits of these 21 institutions was $431,000 as at 31 st December last, but according to budget estimates the combined deficit as at 30th .lune 1971 will be Sim. This will be an increase of $655,000 and 152 per cent. </para>
        <para class="block">I know from experience that many of these hospitals, because of their financial difficulties, have approached their banks for increases in their overdrafts and have been told quite clearly that no further financial accommodation will be made available to them and that they will have to exist on their present overdrafts. The situation is being reached where these hospitals are unable to pay their creditors. If something is not clone urgently - it can only be done at this stage by the Commonwealth making an urgent grant to these hospitals - the situation may well arise where the wages bills will not be met by the end of the current financial year. The  Chairman  of the Association went on to say: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The executive committee considers that the Commonwealth Government&#39;s claim that it provides for pensioners is most unrealistic with the allowances made for nursing homes and other benefits. It is 8 years since the S2 per day nursing home benefit was introduced. There has been no change except that the Commonwealth Government pays $3 per day for a limited number of cases which the Commonwealth claims are intensive nursing care patients. Commonwealth officers carry out the assessment of these cases and they do not give approval lightly.  1 repeat that I will deal with these matters later in my remarks. He went on to say: </para>
          <para>Those of our member institutions which are State subsidised have found that the additional Stale grants made available through the  Hospitals  and Charities Commission are quite inadequate to counter rapidly rising costs because of the limited amount made available by the Commonwealth to the States. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I repeat that I am quoting a part of the address which the  Chairman  of the Association of Victorian Homes and Hospitals for the Aged and Infirm gave when he opened the special meeting which was set down to consider the financial difficulties of homes for aged and infirm people. In moving a resolution later in the meeting  -  I think it was the third resolution, which related to extension of hospital benefits to patients accommodated in nursing homes - one of the delegates to the meeting stated: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Because of the lengthy waiting periods prior to admission - </para>
        </quote>
        <para>He was referring to the long waiting lists of homes for the aged and infirm -  these patients, who, for various reasons, cannot be kept or nursed at home, must necessarily be admitted to private hospitals or nursing homes. The present nursing home benefit of $2 per day or $5 daily for the relatively low percentage of those accepted by the Commonwealth Department of Health as intensive nursing care patients, is far from sufficient to cover the fee costs involved. </para>
        <para>People who are active in the conducting of homes for the aged and infirm are well aware that the Common-wealth&#39;s subsidies are not providing sufficient finance for them to be able to meet the additional costs which are accruing in both administrative expenses and the field of expansion. I make a plea to the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Greenwood)</inline> to take up with the Government as an immediate objective the making of an emergency grant to the Victorian Hospitals and Charities Commission, earmarked for providing the financial relief that is urgently needed by both the homes for the aged and infirm and the general hospitals. </para>

            <para>-  I think the need is Australia-wide as I mentioned earlier in my remarks. That would be the position, but as a Victorian I speak for that State. I want to make a further plea to the Minister to look more closely at the way in which the granting of the S3 per day supplementary allowance for intensive care patients is being administered by officers of his department, lt is generally felt by people associated not only with the larger hospitals controlled by the Hospitals and Charities Commission but also with private nursing homes that there are many patients who should be receiving that extra $3 per day supplementary allowance but who are being denied it by departmental officers and/ or medical officers without any proper or adequate examination of (hose patients. In fact, in many instances it is done administratively by an officer in Melbourne. </para>

        <para>Honourable senators will recall that I raised this matter late last year during the debate on the estimates for the Department of Health. I was advised by the Minister representing the then Minister for Health that I should take up - specific cases in which 1 felt some injustice had been done. I have done this in two or three of what I would term glaring cases. The most recent of these was the case of an 86-year old lady who was an inmate of a private nursing home in the city of Geelong. This lady broke her hip and is in no way ambulant at the present time, as I am able to indicate from medical evidence which I have in my possession. This patient was refused the supplementary allowance initially, despite the fact that a qualified medical practitioner who had treated her for many years had submitted a comprehensive report indicating that she needed intensive care. This opinion was supplemented by the matron of the home. The Minister indicated that he would investigate the case. Finally 1 received a reply from him. 1 do not wish to go into the detail of the reply because I have already made a copy of it available to the present Minister for </para>
        <para class="block">Health, and he has been able to examine it. 1 was most disturbed that this plea of mine had been rejected. I found that as part of his inquiries the then Minister for Health had sent a doctor from the Department of Health to Geelong to investigate this case. 1 learnt, and I have it in writing, that the doctor did not even have the courtesy to go to the matron when he visited this nursing home. </para>
        <para>When he arrived there he simply found this 86-year old lady who had been lifted physically out of bed and placed in a chair in the sun. He spoke to her for a short time and indicated that she was reasonably healthy and would not require the intensive care supplement, despite the fact that there was ample evidence that she needed a tremendous amount of physical care from at least 2 nurses when she had to be moved for various purposes. </para>

            <para>- We are hoping it will not. During this visit the doctor indicated verbally that this patient was fit to go home and that they, whoever they may be, could well look after her. As far as I am concerned the word &#39;they&#39; is in inverted commas, because there is  noboty  else who is able to look after this lady in her present slate of health. The previous Minister indicated in the final paragraph of his reply to me that the doctor suggested that if <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs B&#39;s</inline> condition deteriorated they could reapply for the supplementary benefit. Of course, if there is any further deterioration in the condition of this 86- year old lady I am afraid that she will no longer require any type of benefit. This is the type of case that has been treated very cavalierly by members of the administration. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>I have received evidence and  submissons  from persons closely associated with the management of aged and infirm hospitals in Victoria that they believe that the payment of this additional supplementary allowance is based on a percentage of the number of persons who are inmates of aged and infirm hospitals rather than on the merits of the cases concerned. In relation to Grace McKellar House my own personal investigations indicate that despite the fact that people are moving in and out of that hospital - some are rehabilitated and able to leave it and many die there - there is an almost static figure of  33  per cent of the inmates who are receiving the additional  S3  supplementary allowance. Obviously the allowance is being paid on the basis of a budget rather than on the needs of persons who are in these institutions. </para>
        <para>I had intended to quote from a medical report that I. have in my possession relating to the old lady about whom 1 spoke previously but 1 have made it available to the Minister concerned and I am certain that he has all the information he requires without my quoting directly from the report this evening. This evening I am in the position of not only appealing to the Minister to have another look at this case, because I believe it merits a closer investigation, but also to look at the general administration of the fund to determine how allowances are allocated to the various people who apply for them. I have said before and I repeat it, that the doctor on the spot, who is able closely to examine his patient and who has had that person in his care often for a number of years, and the matron of a hospital, who is equally closely associated with an aged person who is ill, frail or infirm are in a far better position to decide whether that person needs intensive care than an officer or a medical practitioner who may be sitting in an office 45 miles away. </para>
        <para>Far too many patients have their claims rejected without any medical examination. It is on record in relation to the case that I. have quoted this evening that when the doctor came from Melbourne to see- this patient he made no medical examination of her. He simply spoke to her for a short time and made his decision on that basis. It is the height of rudeness for any officer of the Commonwealth department not to have even the courtesy to advise the matron of a hospital that he has arrived for the purpose of seeing one of the inmates of the hospital. If this is the type of administration that we are to have, people will lose complete confidence in the  operation of such a fund. Again J refer briefly to the points that have been made about aged and infirm persons homes by the association which looks after these people. That organisation is asking for direct Commonwealth finance immediately, ft is asking for an increase in the subsidies that are now being paid and it is asking for it urgently. </para>
        <para>Another aspect on which it. wants urgent action is the promise made during the last Senate election campaign by the then Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> to do something about the availability of hospital benefits to persons who are chronically ill and who are forced to remain in aged persons homes or private nursing homes. It <inline font-style="italic">seems</inline> that 1 am always talking about exMinisters and ex-Prime Ministers. There is such a turnover at the moment that we can hardly keep up with the new Ministers and Prime Ministers. In the short period that I have been a senator - about 4 years - 1 have seen 4 Prime Ministers. That is not a bad effort. In many cases, the people who are chronically ill and who are forced to remain in these homes have paid into hospital benefit societies or similar benefit societies almost all their lives. When most reach the last years of their lives and need urgent medical attention, after 3 months the benefit is taken from them and the burden that should have been carried by the organisation to which they have perhaps been paying for a lifetime has to be carried in part by the families; many of whom can ill afford to meet the cost of hospitalisation of their aged parents, aged aunts or aged relatives. I appeal to the Minister to ascertain when the legislation will be forthcoming. It has been promised. When will there be an extension of hospital benefit payments to those people who are urgently in need of financial assistance and who are probably in more need of it now than during the years when they were paying into the societies to which they belong? </para>
        <para>I refer again to the position of general hospitals. Recently urgent special meetings of the Country Hospitals Association in Victoria have been held because its memben are facing a similar situation to that which effects the aged and infirm homes. Again I shall cite the position at the General Hospital at Geelong. It supplies hospital facilities for a population of about 120,000. If it cannot get finance within the next 3 months, it will be forced to close down large sections of the hospital. It has reached that stage. A warning has been given by the  chairman  of the hospital committee. I have permission to quote him. He has put. on record these words: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The Committee may at some future time have to consider the propriety of remaining in office if they find themselves unable to pay wages and other creditors. The question is the same as in business. We, as the board of management, have to pay our debts <inline font-style="italic">or go</inline> out of business. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">The hospital&#39;s deficit this year, will be $250,000. It also has been advised that no further finance will be available in the current financial year and that it is anticipated that the allocations of finance will not be made until about November. This hospital has approached its bankers and has sought an extension of the overdraft on which it operates, lt has been refused, and I presume that it has been refused because hospital management committees are now bad risks. They are bad risks because they have no foreseeable way of raising the finance necessary to pay the normal maintenance costs associated with hospital care. </para>
        <para>A similar position applies al Ballarat also. The stage has been reached where the services required in an expanding community cannot be provided. The Ballarat Hospital has written to ali Victorian parliamentarians in similar terms to those which I have indicated. Its problems are similar to those that exist in the Geelong Hospital. We could well find that within 3 months not only will the hospital not be able to meet its creditors, but even dismissals will be taking place at the Geelong Hospital. The situation then will be that large sections will close and the need for beds which exists at the moment will be far more urgent. We will find that persons who need urgent hospital care will bc unable lo get it. They may, in effect, end up like many of our aged people now and be dying before they can obtain the care so vital to their rehabilitation and their return to good health. So I make a plea to the Minister to place before the Government the urgent need for a direct grant in the immediate future to the State Government for allocation to the Hospitals and Charities Commission. This will enable direct financial assistance to be given to those hospitals that are in such urgent need. 1 also make an appeal to the Minister to submit to Cabinet the other matters that I have mentioned in relation to increased subsidies associated with the care of the aged and infirm. I sincerely hope that my plea will not fall on deaf ears and. as 1 said earlier, that the administration of the supplementary allowance will be treated in a more humane and practical manner than at the present time. </para>

          </talker>
          <para>-  I had intended to raise 2 matters on the adjournment debate this evening, the first relating to an answer lo a question that was given to me today by the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Drake-Brockman)</inline> concerning the activities of the Australian Wool Commission. I understand that because of certain circumstances the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry cannot be here this evening. I defer that matter for the time being, except to say that I regard it as arrogance and high-handedness on the part of the Australian Wool Commission and, indeed, bordering on contempt of this Parliament for the Minister to come up with an answer that for commercial reasons it is the policy of the Australian Wool Commission not to release information on matters raised by an honourable senator when a representative of the Australian Wool Commission can appear on a programme of the Australian Broadcasting Commission and tell certain sections of the public who might be listening to that broadcast some details of the transactions engaged in by the Commission. But I will have something more to say about that at another lime when the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry is present in the chamber. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The other matter that I want to raise relates to the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department and concerns the existing state of the Australian television industry. A number of Australians have become very concerned at developments that are taking place, and which have taken place over recent weeks, to deprive Australians of the right to work at their own profession in their own country. Today during question time 1 raised a matter of share transactions concerning John Fairfax &#38; Co. and I hope that that matter will ultimately be investigated. But in fairness to that company I have to say that it appears to me that the Fairfax station in Sydney, although in my opinion not doing sufficient to project more Australian programmes, is probably doing more than any other commercial station in this regard. But the fact is that Australian artists, writers, producers, actors, the unions and the production houses engaged in the industry all tell me that the situation today is in fact worse than it has ever been and that urgent and drastic action has to be taken by someone to protect the livelihood of those who work in the industry. We all know that the Australian Broadcasting Control Board has a statutory responsibility, a responsibility vested in it by Act of Parliament, to ensure that adequate and comprehensive programmes serving the best interests of the Australian public are presented. Under section 114 of the Broadcasting and Television Act the Board has a statutory obligation lo ensure that as far as possible Australians will be used in the production arid presentation of programmes. </para>
        <para>We know hat last year a very hard and long fought battle was waged to obtain an . improvement in the number of hours of transmission of Australian programmes. We all know that last November about 4 or 5 days prior to the Senate elections  -  I emphasise that date bearing in mind the hard fought battle which had been waged over the preceding 12 months - the Control Board laid down a new quota system to come into force as from next September. I have already made the observation in this Parliament by way of question that new production episodes of &#39;Homicide&#39; and &#39;Division 4&#39; are being stockpiled by commercial television stations in order to cope with the new quota which will be required of them next September by the Board&#39;s edict. Just as the Australian Wool Commission is stockpiling Australian wool, it appears that Australian commercial television  stations are stockpiling Australian television- productions. At the present time they are engaged in filling their existing requirements so far as Australian productions and dramatic productions are concerned with the use of repeat programmes. </para>
        <para>I want to bring to the attention of the Senate a section of paragraph 463 of the 22nd Annual Report of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board which appears at page 106. In that paragraph the Board mentions that 8 stations failed to comply with the requirements to televise : 50 per cent of Australian material. The stations are named. The Board mentions that a number of the stations were country stations faced with technical difficulties in that they did not have videotape reproduction equipment available to them. But 2 of the stations mentioned are long established stations, namely GTV and ADS. The report states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>With regard to GTV and ADS, which are wellestablished metropolitan stations, the Board recognised that the margin of failure was not statistically significant. However, it indicated an unsatisfactory trend in the. stations programming, and the matter is under discussion with the respective managements. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I do not know what discussion has taken place but I am informed that last week in Melbourne GTV9, one of the stations mentioned in the Control Board&#39;s report, and, I understand, a Packer station, has removed an Australian programme, namely In Melbourne Tonight&#39;, which employed about 120 Australians. I am informed that as a result of that programme being removed from the air most if not all of the 120 Australians have been sacked. It appears that the policy of the stations will be: &#39;We will comply with &#39;he quota if we have to comply with it but we will not reduce our importation of overseas programmes. We will cut down on our variety programmes and transfer that money info dramatic productions.&#39; The stations cannot cut down on documentary programmes because they have very little, if any. It appears that the commercial stations are using the weight of their power with this Government and using their wealth and influence to superimpose their own authority and standards on anything which the Control Board might determined </para>
        <para>I have been told that several people engaged on the executive side of this industry are considering testing the legality of the power of the Board to lay down quotas under the regulations governing programme standards. I suggest to the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Greenwood),</inline> who in this Chamber represents the PostmasterGeneral <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Alan Hulme),</inline> that if such a challenge goes ahead the Government should immediately amend the Broadcasting and Television Act to write into the Act in clear and express terms provisions which will provide minimal standards for Australian dramatic, variety and documentary programmes. It has also been mentioned to me that several production companies throughout Australia that have been engaged in this industry since it came into existence and which are now very much feeling the pinch, suspect very strongly that by the non-acceptance of their productions by commercial stations they - the production companies - are being victimised because of the part they played in securing a greater quota for Australian dramatic productions. </para>
        <para>I do not intend to mention names at this stage because, as I have said, it is only suspicion at this stage but should it turn out to be a fact then I will bc insisting that the whole of his industry be investigated by the Trade Practices Tribunal. If the suspicion on the part of these people becomes more than suspicion and there is direct evidence of victimisation because of the part these people have played in securing an improvement in Australian standards, then 1 will be naming in this Parliament the channels which are victimising, the executive personnel of those stations who are engaged in the victimisation and where the victimisation is taking place. But surely it is more than suspicion when I am told that certain programmes, which are being offered at half the cost of other programmes that the stations are purchasing, are in fact being rejected by the stations. lt may well be that if the Minister or the Control Board will not act - and 1 am afraid the Board itself cannot act much more than it has to date because it appears to have become a toothless tiger against these commercial interests - then the trade union movement itself may have to take action as it did in the Dunlop case, lt may well be that if it is found that victimisation is taking place because Australians are concerned about the extent of Americanisation of their country per medium of the television screen, that the trade union movement will have to consider boycotting certain stations. 1 emphasise that I will have no hesitation whatever in naming the stations and the executives of those stations if it is proved to my satisfaction that victimisation is occurring. But before it comes to that the Postmaster-General should take strong action to protect those who obtain their livelihood from the Austraiian television industry. </para>
        <para>Finally J ask the newly appointed Minister representing the Postmaster-General in this chamber to ensure that all matters coming within his responsibility to this Senate and which are raised in the Senate under the heading of this portfolio are sheeted home to the Postmaster-General and that expeditious answers arc given to the Senate by that Minister. </para>

          <para>-  I listened with great interest to the remarks of my friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland but I do not propose to traverse his entire speech as 1 did not hear the whole of it. 1 simply say this. I was one of 5 men who helped to fix the Australian quota and I say categorically that no pressure from any company, from any producer or from any organisation was brought to bear upon me or to my knowledge on any other member of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. The quotas that were fixed were fixed after hearing representatives of production houses, the licensees, Actors Equity - of which T was at that time and still am a member - and every section of the broadcasting and television industry. 1 know we are dealing with television but every section of the industry, including the writers, were given an opportunity to present their case. I merely want to say that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland had any evidence of malpractice in this industry I would cheerfully join him in hunting it down because this is a most important and significant industry and, as he says, it employs large numbers of Australians. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I share his regret that the &#39;In Melbourne Tonight&#39; programme, which as he said employed 100 to 120 Australians, was discontinued by Channel 9. The reason given by the company&#39;s chairman of directors was that the ratings for the programme, which had run since 1956  -  to some extent the television channels are the slaves of the ratings - had dropped to 56 per cent of what they were 2 years ago. I am not justifying the discontinuance; I am merely mentioning the reason given by the  chairman  of directors. I believe that the Senate has reason to be grateful to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>
        <para class="block">Douglas McClelland for his careful watch on the transgressions - real and, might I say, in some cases imaginary - of the licensees and the operatives in this very important industry.

I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poyser</inline> will appreciate that any answer I might give him tonight could not give him the satisfaction for which he would be hoping. I say that for 2 reasons. The first is that in a relatively short time I have endeavoured to come to grips with the many aspects of the health administration, and I am still in the process of doing so. But that is not the only reason. There is a reason which would be more permanent and enduring and which v/ould affect any Minister who had the responsibility, and that is that when matters involve, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poyser</inline> has urged, the provision of Commonwealth finance the most any Minister can do is to put such claims as he considers are appropriate before the Government for its consideration in the light of the many priorities and competing claims that the Government has to consider. </para>

With regard to his broad plea that the situation affecting Victorian hospitals in particular was such that they were nigh on bankruptcy and in need of urgent financial assistance, 1 believe that the point is well sustained. 1 appreciate his concern, 1 share his interest, and I recognise that this is a pressing problem.

            <para>- I do not doubt that the pleas, which may be made by hospitals in other States are the same as those made by hospitals in Victoria, but 1 think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poyser</inline> would join with me in asserting thai in these matters of finance Victorians have always adopted a forefront role in pressing their claims, and so it is with the hospitals. The point I make is that the provision of hospital services and the arrangements for financing those services are primarily the responsibilities of the State governments, and any general claim .that there should be an emergency grant from the Commonwealth Government is to be placed in the context of what is accepted as CommonwealthState financial relations and the various financial assistance grants which the States receive from the Commonwealth. In that area I cannot&#39; say anything tonight which would be more informative to the honourable senator than that which he has culled from his own reading, and experience over the years. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>Apart from that, there is a role in which the Commonwealth does assist in the pro vision of hospital finances. Of course, the Commonwealth&#39;s main role is through the hospital benefits scheme, and it is through this scheme that assistance is provided to patients in meeting their costs of hospital treatment. But it should be recognised that in providing this assistance to patients the Commonwealth also is indirectly assisting the States in their financing of hospital services. The extent to which the Commonwealth Government is meeting its responsibilities in the provision of hospital benefits, and thus indirectly assisting the States hospital systems, can be gauged from the fact that during the last financial year Commonwealth expenditure on hospital benefits totalled more than S64m, and a further &#167;1 18m was provided by way of fund benefits through the Commonwealth administered hospital insurance scheme. I think it should also be noted that during the same financial year total expenditure by the Commonwealth and the funds on hospital benefits payable to Victorian patients amounted to the substantial sum of $46m. These figures clearly indicate a Commonwealth responsibility and interest. </para>
        <para>I think all honourable senators are aware that the Government is at present reviewing its hospital benefits scheme, and this is one of the areas which I am endeavouring in a short time to master in some respects. This examination is being undertaken in the light of the Nimmo Committee&#39;s report which was presented last year. This review is proceding at the present time, and I trust that it wil be completed as soon as practicable. But it is a complex matter. On thai aspect. 1 think the only, other comment which I might usefully add is that 1 have under way at the present time arrangements to meet some people representing the hospital administrations who have been meeting recently, in the hope that I can get from them some further information which will be of assistance to me. </para>
        <para>The. other matter which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poyser</inline> raised concerned the manner of administration of the grants for intensive nursing home care. As I understood <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poyser,</inline> he suggested that the way in which these grants were administered was unsatisfactory because initially they are administered in the light of documents and material which is provided without that on the spot examination which he said should characterise the consideration of every grant. If one were able to do as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poyser</inline> suggested, undoubtedly there would be greater satisfaction and less of the types of criticisms which one hears from lime to time. It is important to recognise that a tremendous number of these grants are applied for and that a limited number of Commonwealth medical officers is available to supervise each application which is made. I think that this is recognised by the provisions of the National Health Act under which these grants are administered. I think that, in this sense, the Senate would accept that the administration should be in accordance with what the Act provides. Section  57a  of the National Health Act, if anyone is interested in looking to the source of this provision, indicates that applications for these grants shall be made by the proprietor of an approved nursing home, that application shall be made in a particular form and that it shall be supported by a certificate of a medical practitioner. Where the DirectorGeneral or the person to whom he delegates his authority is satisfied that the person in respect of whom an application is made requires intensive nursing home care and that the nursing home is adequately fitted, furnished and staffed, there may be a grant. That does not exclude an on the spot investigation by a Commonwealth medical officer and invariably, where any complaint is made that a grant should have been made which has not been made, that investigation is undertaken. </para>
        <para>In the case which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poyser</inline> has drawn to my attention - and I acknowledge that it was brought to my attention earlier today that it was to be the subject of remarks during the adjournment tonight - that was the procedure which was followed, f have some details which f feel I should communicate to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poyser</inline> privately because he showed a reticence to mention the particular lady&#39;s name and 1 feel that an equal reticence should be shown by me in giving some personal details of her position. But, though those matters will be available to him, I should say this: A grant is made not because a person is aged, not because a person is incapacitated in some way and not because a person requires general care, but because a person requires and is dependent upon nursing care. The Act provides:   . . &#34;Intensive nursing home care&#39; means nursing home care for a person who, by reason of infirmity, or any illness, disease, incapacity or disability, is bedridden or virtually bedridden and is wholly or substantially dependent upon nursing care, or, by reason of the treatment of any illness, disease, incapacity or disability, is wholly or substantially or dependent upon nursing care. </para>
        <para class="block">There is a difference, from the inquiries that I have been able to make in the course of the day, between nursing care and general care. I can assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poyser</inline> that it is in that area that the particular rejection has been made of the lady whose case he has been espousing. She has been determined by a Commonwealth medical officer who investigated her case to be a person who certainly requires general care, but she does not require nursing care. Having said that and having- </para>

            <para>-  She is certainly not ambulatory. The point I make is that this represents the way in which this matter has been administered. All 1 can say at the present time is that I propose to look at this case with a view to ascertaining whether his is a reasonable interpretation of what amounts to be nursing care. It must be appreciated that the administration of this provision is dependent upon what interpretation is given to the language of the statute and, as far as it is within my power, 1 hope to have a charitable and humane administration of these provisions so that, where there is a genuine case which requires assistance, that assistance can be given. </para>

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poyser</inline> raised many matters. I have taken note of the matters that he did raise. Indeed, they were in the material which he provided to me earlier. I have noted those matters and 1 shall do what I can to examine the procedures under .which these determinations are made. I repeat what 1 said earlier, that this is a question which should be looked at in terms of providing assistance where it can legitimately be given in accordance with the provisions of the Act, and that the administration should, so far as is possible in the many instances where applications for assistance have been made, deal with the applications humanely. </para>

        <para>I turn to the matters which were raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland. I sense that there were two broad aspects involved in what he said. The first was the regret that he expressed that the television show, In Melbourne Tonight&#39;, which has run for many years in Melbourne should have ended.I am indebted for the general information which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hannan</inline> provided. I shall certainly convey to the PostmasterGeneral <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Alan Hulme)</inline> the general substance of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland has said, for such comments as the Minister considers are appropriate, but I feel that I ought to say in regard to the first aspect that it is not the role of the Postmaster-General or the role of any person within government to determine what programmes shall be shown by a particular commercial television station. While we have commercial television stations the ordinary considerations which motivate them in determining what they shall show and how much they shall pay for what they are prepared to show remain essentially financial business considerations. I suggest that while we have a system of television in Australia such as we now have - it is a very satisfactory system which has served the people of Australia well - those considerations will always prevail. </para>
        <para>The second aspect which I understood <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland to raise was that there might have been victimisation and unfair practices, and I understand that he will investigate these matters with a view to exposing them if his suspicions are right.I can only say that if unfair practices and victimisation have occurred he would have much support in exposing these matters, becauseI feel that exposure is the most certain way of ensuring that what is being criticised does not occur again. But. on the other hand, I should say that the basis upon which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland based his accusations appears to me to be particularly flimsy. As I have said, I shall convey the tenor of his remark&#39;s to the Postmaster-General for his comment. </para>
        <para>In reply to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hannan</inline> said, I am sure that the Senate is indebted to him for his invaluable reminder that quotas are fixed by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board after inquiry, in which all interested parties are given the opportunity to be heard. I believe that under the scheme of the Broadcasting and Television Act this is a far more satisfactory way of doing it than to leave it to what might be the fluctuating decisions of different Ministers and different governments. It is far better to have those decisions made in the way in which the Act provides. </para>
