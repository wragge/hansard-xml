            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Is it a fact that the Australian Government for many years has contended that there is only one lawful government of all China? Is it a fact that this day the United Nations has overwhelmingly recognised the People&#39;s Republic of China as the one lawful government of all China? Will the Government now cease its foolish course of claiming that the Chiang Kai-shek regime in Taiwan is the one lawful government of all China, including mainland China, and will it give immediate recognition to the People&#39;s Republic of China as the lawful government of China? </para>

I quote the figures from memory; there may be a slight inaccuracy. With regard to the latter part of the honourable senator&#39;s question, I take objection to the form of it.

            <para>-  It is my understanding that this matter is being investigated at the present time. There has been some housing problem in the Territory, compounded by 2 particular factors - a rather rapid growth of population because of activities of the mining industry and governments themselves, and equally the very high cost of constructing in the Territory. I understand this is the fact. I know that the investigation is proceeding. If I receive further information which will aid the honourable senator on the matter, I will see that he receives it. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister for Health. It refers to the current public discussion regarding conditions in nursing homes. Firstly, will the Minister outline the areas of responsibility and supervision of the States and the Commonwealth on this matter? Secondly, will he ensure by cooperation with the States, with whom the basic responsibility lies, that the State health authorities and the Commonwealth are thoroughly vigilant in their regular inspections of all such nursing homes so as to ensure the highest possible standards of care and treatment? </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir KENNETH</inline>ANDERSONI respond to the honourable senator&#39;s question by saying initially that the question of setting and maintaining the standards of nursing homes, which is most important, is primarily a State area of responsibility. That is the fundamental thing which has to be understood. Legislation exists in each State for the registration or licensing of nursing homes and the supervision of the minimum standards of such homes. Each State has its own inspection team which carries out inspections of homes directed to their standards. It follows that any criticism of the standards of a particular home should be directed in the first instance to the State authorities. </para>
          <para>The Commonwealth supervision is concerned with the payment of nursing home benefits. Of course close co-ordination between the Commonwealth and the State authorities is maintained. Where unsatisfactory features are disclosed by Commonwealth inspectors the State authorities are immediately informed. I see a need for even greater co-ordination in this area. I plan to talk with the State Ministers regarding the intensification of efforts by the State authorities to ensure that ali nursing homes provide the proper standards of care. That is in fact a brief summary of the situation as I see it. If any honourable senator has evidence of a nursing home being below standard, I feel that he has an obligation to make that information available either direct to the State authorities or to myself. If it is made available to me it will be treated in confidence and the States will be informed of it. Because there is a Commonwealth subvention in respect of nursing homes the Government has an obligation not only to inform the States of any unsatisfactory situation but also to make an examination of the payments it makes in respect of that nursing home. </para>

            <para>-  My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry. Is it a fact that under the Wool (Deficiency Payments) Act payments go to the mortgagee or the holder of a bill of sale, namely, the wool broker, for the wool involved? If so, does this mean that money allegedly paid to help the wool growers and to resuscitate dying country towns will not in fact reach either the wool grower or the local trader? </para>

Can he give any reason why the Australian Apple and Pear Board is not prepared to consider and act on the carefully prepared submission presented to it by the West Australian industry regarding freight and other matters of vital concern to the growers? Will the Minister request the Minister for Primary Industry to examine immediately the submission that is at present in the hands of the Board, which claims that it would put the industry in each State on a much more satisfactory financial basis, and if necessary make a recommendation to the Board? * </para>

            <para>- I understand the reason behind the honourable senator&#39;s question. The Western Australians attended a meeting that was held recently in Melbourne and put their case to the Board. I believe that they had 3 different proposals to put in the way of shipping and shipping freights, but that the Board adopted the view that as it is at the present time negotiating with the shippers on this matter it should not look at the Western Australian submission until it had thoroughly completed its negotiations. I understand also that the Western Australians want to bring representatives of the shippers into the meeting, but this was not accepted by the meeting and unfortunately the Western Australian delegates walked out of the meeting. </para>

              <para>- It is true that most of the States are introducing legislation to make compulsory the use of seat belts in motor vehicles. On reflection I recall that the compulsory use of seat belts was recommended by the Senate select committee of which I had the great honour to be  chairman  some years ago. It is my understanding, subject to correction, that the purchase of safety belts for use in motor vehicles attracts sales tax. If that is true, as I suspect it is, I will refer the honourable senator&#39;s question to the Treasurer together with the views he has expressed. </para>

            <para>- I ask a question of the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry. In the rural community there appears to be widespread uncertainty as to whether those producers who qualify for assistance under the terms of the rural reconstruction scheme will continue to have their financial affairs directed through their usual bank or stock firm, or whether there will be direct government-to-producer provisions of funds. Can the Minister clarify this position for me? </para>

            <para>- I am quite sure that the honourable senator will be aware of the fact that under the rural reconstruction scheme the Commonwealth and each of the States agreed that moneys  should be paid to eligible producers engaged in the rural industries. The scheme stipulated that each State had to set up its rural reconstruction authority, and that authority was to make available to the eligible producers the money that had been provided to it by the Commonwealth. I understand that if the authority sees fit it may require that the moneys received on account of the property be received by the authority, by its agent or by some other authority or body nominated by the authority. I understand that under this plan payments within the approved budget are made through normal channels. </para>

On that occasion he indicated that a replacement aircraft was being examined and that a decision as to a suitable replacement would be made in the &#39;reasonable future&#39;.

The aircraft I mentioned as the one being studied was the Boeing 737 which has some capacity to serve Norfolk Island and possibly Wellington, New Zealand, as well on a 3-cornered operation. That study is still taking place. I have not heard from Qantas Airways Ltd the final results of the study, but the question will be a reminder to me to ask Qantas how far it has progressed. </para>

          <para>I shall provide a comprehensive answer to this comprehensive question which contains many implications, particularly as to conditions which may apply in the various States. As a general rule in New South Wales a condition of the treatment of a pensioner in a hospital is that no charge shall be made. It is a consideration in regard to payments by the Commonwealth to the States for this purpose that no charge shall be made in respect of pensioners who are treated in public wards of hospitals. Insofar as pensioners are insured and would attract a refund in respect of intermediate wards, there are implications as to the position in one State vis-a-vis another. I would not like to give an answer on that point during question time, but tomorrow I shall give a comprehensive answer which will cover the position in all States. Bearing in mind that the honourable senator and I are from different States, I would not like there to be any confusion as to what I said and in which State it applied. </para>

Is the Minister aware of the growing concern among Australian producers of grass seed that importations of seed into Australia are creating a depressed market for local production? Is the Minister aware that grass seed is basically unrestricted in its volume of imports into Australia and that in general no duty applies to its importation, the only restriction being that seed must receive a certification by officers of the Department of Primary Industry? Will the Minister investigate allegations of the dumping of seed, particularly of perennial rye grass, from the 3 main exporters of seed to Australia, and will he assure Australian producers that the Government will not countenance them being harmed in this way? </para>

            <para>- It was my impression that most of the grass seed that came to Australia came from New Zealand, particularly from the North Island in the case of rye grass and from the South Island in the case of clovers. I understand that there is quite a substantial production of grass seed in Australia. I am not aware of the impact that imports have had on that Australian production, but I shall certainly take the matter up and speak to the Minister about it to see what the situation is and what can be done to make sure that there is adequate protection for the local seed producers. However, I must make the comment that under the New ZealandAustralia Free Trade Agreement, I imagine, there is some right of entry for New Zealand grass seed, but I shall need to check the matter out in detail. I think the honourable senator would understand that. </para>

Is the Minister aware also that the former Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gorton,</inline> before the 1969 election, promised that all discriminatory laws against Aborigines would be abolished in the life of the present Parliament, and that the then Minister-in-Charge of Aboriginal Affairs. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wentworth,</inline> had his Department prepare a list of State laws discriminatory against Aborigines which comprised 6 foolscap pages, many of which laws have not yet been repealed? Will the Minister consider sending an apology to the Rhodesian Government for the insult implicit in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young&#39;s</inline> equation of that Government&#39;s, discriminatory laws and practices with those of Australia? </para>

In the light of the current policy of rather rigid vaccination procedures applying to all air travellers entering Australia, what were the reasons for the apparent favouritism accorded to the United States vocalist Bobbie Gentry who apparently was able to avoid these procedures? In particular, did she specifically refuse to accept the needle vaccination procedure? </para>

          <para class="block">I have had some inquiries made about this matter. Australia reserves the right in respect of arrivals by air from areas not specially exempt under provisions of the Quarantine Act 1908-1969 to isolate any persons who do not have a current valid international certificate of vaccination against smallpox and who refuse or are unable to be vaccinated against this disease. In September 1969 the vaccination certificate requirements for travel by air from the United States and Canada were modified for persons who are not vaccinated against smallpox and who are subject to medical conditions or treatment which would make vaccination medically inadvisable. The quarantine officer must satisfy himself that the passenger is suffering from a condition or undergoing treatment which contra-indicates vaccination or is suffering from certain specific conditions. Further, the person must make a statutory declaration that he or she has not been outside the United States. Canada or intermediate countries situated in the direct trans-Pacific air route between Australia and North America or an exempt area for at least 14 days immediately prior to departure for Australia. Finally, he or she must apply for release under surveillance and undertake to observe the conditions set out in a permit or release issued by the quarantine officer. Surveillance entails attendance at an office of the Department of Health or at a specific place to be seen by a doctor for a period of up to 14 days, usually at second daily intervals. Miss Gentry was permitted to enter Australia after Commonwealth medical officers had determined that she was receiving medical treatment preventing vaccination against smallpox. She was released under quarantine surveillance subject to the conditions which I have indicated in my reply. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister for Civil Aviation. It relates to the possible extension of the runways at Adelaide Airport and also to whether there is substitute land, now owned by the Department of Civil Aviation, which would be made available in the event of the trust lands being required for runway extensions. Since the meeting of the relevant Estimates Committee, has the Minister had a chance to examine the issue as to whether the vacant land might be a fair substitute for the reserve trust lands? When is the Minister likely to visit the area to examine conditions for himself? </para>

Does the report say that the base is 300 miles north of Adelaide and is believed to be at Narrungar, Woomera? As the report also claims that Narrungar is controlled by the Pine Gap base will the Government now reveal the role of Pine Gap and Narrungar, or are Australians to be kept in the dark forever about foreign military installations which will ensure that this country is an essential early target in any nuclear war? Further, I ask the Minister: As China is now to become a member of the community of nations, will the Government as a member of that community ensure that Australiansited bases are not used to spy on another friendly member country? </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Attorney-General and, perhaps, to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Is the Attorney-General aware that the Fire and All Risks Insurance Group which consists of the Fire and All Risks Insurance Co. Ltd, the Car Owners Mutual Insurance Co. Ltd, Falkirk Insurance Co. and Australian and International Insurance Ltd has come to the attention of the Workers Compensation Commission of New South Wales and that a few days ago after evidence given by a number of the judges permission to operate as a compensation insurance company was surrendered by the Fire and All Risks Insurance Co. Ltd and a motion, again instituted from the Commission, has been made similarly in regard to Australian and International Insurance Ltd, and that this action is based on the unsound financial structure of the companies? If the Attorney-General is not aware of these matters, is he aware that a series of incidents concerning insurance companies has occurred which suggests that tens of thousands of people who have paid premiums in good faith have only dubious protection because they are insured with unsound companies? I ask the Minister: How much longer will it be before legislation will be introduced under the insurance power of the Commonwealth to regulate and to supervise fire, accident and other insurance companies including particularly those dealing with motor vehicle insurance, in the same way as is done with life assurance companies by Commonwealth law? </para>

            <para>-  I cannot give the precise date of the Concorde option that Qantas holds at the present time but I am under the impression that it is March or a bit later next year. The Department of Civil Aviation has undertaken to give all its material to the Academy of Science with a request that it look at all the scientific data available from us or anywhere else to make a calculated and careful judgment of any effect that supersonic aircraft might have on the upper atmosphere. I would hope to see that concluded about March next year but I cannot guarantee it. That is the situation we are in. The economic evaluation is being made by Qantas with help from time to time from my Department. The Concorde situation of course rests very much upon other option holders, much further up the option table than Qantas, taking up their options. </para>

            <para>-  I go back to where I started. It is quite incongruous to suggest that a Minister for Foreign Affairs would not inform the Prime Minister, or that his Prime Minister would not be aware, of statements he makes particularly while overseas. The second point 1 would make for the benefit of the questioner is this: Do not take too seriously some interpretations that certain political writers and certain newspapers wish to make in relation to statements made by Ministers for Foreign Affairs, other Ministers, or sometimes even by senators. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry. What answer has the Government to the growing criticism from a wide variety of informed sources that the measures to assist the wool industry have failed to make any real impact on the rural crisis? How does the Government reconcile its open-ended commitment to boost the price of wool for one year - a decision which could cost the taxpayers $l60m - with the decision to pay only $lm over a period of  4  years for rural reconstruction? Will the Government consider a major rationalisation of the wool subsidy scheme to allow more money to be channelled into the rural reconstruction scheme instead of pouring millions of dollars into the wool industry - much of it to wealthy brokers and big grazing companies? </para>

            <para>- I think the honourable senator is a little astray when he says that we are pouring money into the wool industry. I would like to remind him that, if the Australian Wool Commission had not come into being and used its reserve price scheme to protect the growers from receiving even lower prices, it is quite possible that the total return from the wool clip could have been down by 20 per cent. I think that is borne out by the prices received for those wools that are not under the protection of the Commission. In regard to the remainder of the question, I think the honourable senator meant SI 00m in his reference to the rural reconstruction scheme. All these schemes are brought in to play a part in the overall reconstruction of the rural industries. Each one of them cannot be taken separately and criticised; they must all be fitted into an overall picture. I will have a look at the question again and, if I have anything to add, I will do so on the next day of sitting. </para>

Could the Minister for Air hand over the 100 empty homes and the recreation area at the now closed air unit at Tindal near Katherine, Northern Territory, to the Northern Territory housing authority and thus release homes which are deteriorating through vacancy to assist in relieving the acute housing shortage at Katherine? If the close proximity of a defence area now prevents the use of these unused homes by civilians, could not the housing area be separated from the defence area to permit their use? </para>

But I will say that BHP has to our knowledge been engaged in trading transactions with the People&#39;s Republic of China to advantage. With regard to that aspect of the honourable senator&#39;s question relating to the Government&#39;s initiative, it is well known that this Government has been taking purposeful initiatives over many months now with the object of establishing diplomatic relations with China. </para>

            <para>-  My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer, relates to the interest rate charged by Australian trading banks. I ask: Is the Government satisfied that what is known as the classical method of exerting a measure of control over the bank funds available for loan is to charge a relatively high bank interest rate? Can the Government refer to any achievement, either by way of control of the cost of goods sold, a lower, inflation rate or limitation of the demand for funds, which is generated by a relatively high bank interest rate? Is the Minister aware that within the last 10 days the governments of both Germany and Italy have cut the going bank rate of interest to 4i per cent from an existing 5 per cent? Will the Government give consideration to reducing the present high rate of interest of <inline font-style="italic">Si</inline> per cent? </para>

          <para class="block">I am very delighted to learn that the honourable senator now recognises that there is such a thing as a classical method. The honourable senator has posed many questions to me on this matter and each time I have responded by referring to what he has described as the classical method. But I do not agree that the classical method relates only to higher bank interest rates. It is my understanding that the classical </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-style="italic">Questions</inline>1451 method involves pitching the interest rate to the problems of the economy and1 using the interest rate as a vehicle to adjust the economy. To that extent it may well be - as was the case in the United Kingdom - that it is not a higher interest rate which is used in the classical method but, in certain instances, a lower interest rate. The balance of the honourable senator&#39;s question relates clearly to a matter of policy. It would therefore be a decision for the Treasurer to make as to whether he wishes to respond to it. I will direct the honourable senator&#39;s question to the Treasurer and see whether he wishes to respond to it. </para>

The Australian Government is constantly in touch with other governments and with the United Nations with regard to this matter. It is a fact that the United Nations suggested the stationing of supervisory teams in this area but that suggestion was unacceptable to India. </para>

            <para>- My question is addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Is the fact, as reported in the &#39;Australian Financial Review&#39; of 22nd October 1971, that the Government recently brought pressure to bear on the Metal Trades Industry Association to resist moves to have collective bargaining agreements with unions? If so, is such an action a contribution to industrial peace or an unwarranted interference with the rights of employers and unions to negotiate freely in the spirit of conciliation for the fixation of just wage rates? 26 October 1971 </para>

              <para>There have been several cases where persons submitting proposals involving the takeover of a bank or the merger of a bank with other interests have been advised that the proposals were unacceptable to the Commonwealth Government. Also, under the Banking (Foreign Exchange) Regulations, approval is not normally given to proposals involving the acquisition of Australian shares by an overseas company which do not provide for the shares to be paid for in full with overseas funds at the time of acquisition. Such proposals are confidential and they have not been publicly disclosed. Apart from such cases, and the effect of the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942-1971, the Life Insurance Act 1945-1965, the Companies (Life Insurance Holding Companies) Ordinance 1968-1970 and the Companies (Uranium Mining Companies) Ordinance 1970 of the Australian Capital Territory, the Commonwealth Government has not vetoed any company mergers. </para>

            <para>The National Service Act imposes on young men in the 20-year old age group who are ordinarily resident in Australia the liability both to register and to render service. Exempted from the liability to register are serving members of the Australian permanent forces and persons who have served for not less than 18 months and been discharged from those forces, certain diplomatic personnel as described in the National Service Act and certain Aboriginal natives of Australia as defined in the National Service Regulations. </para>
            <para>A man required to register who fails to do so renders himself liable to prosecution and to be called-up for service regardless of the result of the ballot for his age group. The first step in such cases is to determine whether or not the person is in fact liable to register, and those who come to notice as not having registered as required may be requested by letter to answer certain questions intended to assist in establishing whether they are in fact so liable. In no case are proceedings initiated or the likelihood of legal action communicated to the individual concerned whilst any doubt remains as to his liability to register. </para>
            <para>On the same day that his question was placed on the notice paper, the honourable senator wrote to me on the particular case. I have already explained to him that the man in question furnished the preliminary information requested of him and further inquiries on the basis of that information established that as an Aboriginal he was not liable to register. He was in no way threatened with legal action and has been advised formally to the effect that he has no liability. </para>

              <para>As requirements fluctuate it would not be practicable to guarantee any specific level of activity in respect of Government orders for defence equipment. This is particularly true in the defence aircraft industry which suffers from troughs in demand between major production runs. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>It is recognised by the Government that the present Australian aircraft industry relies on defence contracts for its basic workload, and a good deal of effort has been put into the development of projects for the industry in order to reduce the present trough in requirements. At the same time the industry is being encouraged to diversify its activities so as to broaden the workload base. The main purpose of the rationalisation studies now in hand at Fishermen&#39;s Bend is to achieve a more economic and effective industry. This course is considered to be in the best interests of the industry and those who work in it. </para>

              <para>It is stated policy to maintain a small viable defence aircraft industry in Australia and to support the &#39;industry with the available defence work which can be appropriately allocated to it: this is well known in the industry. </para>

          </list>
          <para>The requirements of the Services which will result in workload for the industry are included in the Defence Programme. The industry, however, is normally aware of these requirements in advance of the Programme. </para>
          <para>Early knowledge of forward projects and their timing does not of itself permit elimination of employment troughs. The problem is a complex one. The aim is to reduce the troughs in activity by a combination of rendering the industry more flexible, economic and effective; broadening the workload base; limiting production peaks on major projects: and developing projects for attention between major production runs. </para>

              <para>The River Murray Commission and appropriate authorities of the Contracting Governments have been examining the report of the Commission&#39;s consultants on salinity in the River Murray system. To that extent it might be said that all proposals contained in that report have been before the River Murray Commission. Suggestions for the handling of proposals for salinity mitigation works have been forwarded by the Commission to the Governments for consideration. Until these suggestions have been considered I cannot deal with them in detail, but I can indicate that they are designed to provide for appropriate liaison in the extensive study programmes that will be needed. </para>

However, as I have mentioned above, I expect that provision will be made for liaison between the Authorities investigating these matters. In addition, it has been indicated that projects for salinity mitigation in the Murray valley will be regarded as eligible for consideration for Commonwealth financial assistance under the National Water Resources Development Programme, and any such submissions will be examined in the usual way by Commonwealth authorities. </para>

            <para>- On 18th August <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Little</inline> asked the following question: ls the Minister aware of the enormous increase in the flow of acrylic tow crude materials into Australia in the last 10 years? </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Has the increase been from 1,827,817 lb in 1959-60 to 13,221,455 lb in 1970-71? </para>
          <para>Is it a fact that 1 lb of acrylic tow can be spun into the equivalent quantity of yarn that comes from 2 lb of greasy wool? </para>
          <para>As most acrylic tow is imported from the United States of America and is duty free, whilst the United States has a duly of 25ic per lb on wool, will the Government give consideration to the imposition of protective duty against this strong competitor of our wool? </para>
          <para>Will the Minister explain why the duty on yarn manufactured from acrylic tow was reduced from 40 per cent to 20 per cent? </para>
          <para>What increases have occurred in the inflow of this yarn since the duty reduction? </para>
          <para>Why is the raw material allowed in free of duty whilst even the 20 per cent duty applies to the manufactured product? </para>
          <para class="block">The Minister for Trade and Industry has provided the following reply: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Acrylic tow and staple are relatively newly developed products. They are not produced in Australia and have always been admitted duty free. This fibre came within the scope of a recent Tariff Board inquiry but, as the Board received no request for duties on acrylic low and staple, it recommended continuation of the duty-free treatment. Under normal procedures, consideration would not be given to imposing duties on this fibre unless in the context of a further inquiry and report by the Tariff Board. </para>
            <para>Imports of acrylic tow and staple have increased from about 2.3 million lb in 1961-62, the first year for which official statistics are available, to about 14.6 million lb in 1970-71. In this latter year, the major sources of imports were Japan, followed by United States of America, United Kingdom and the Netherlands. </para>
            <para>In the case of acrylic yarns, the Board in the same report recommended a reduction in duty from 40 per cent to 20&#39; per cent. It considered that as spinners obtain their basic fibre free of duty they should be able to continue to operate profitably under the same level of duties found appropriate for other discontinuous yarns. No request was received at this inquiry that duties be imposed to protect the Australian wool industry. </para>
            <para>Imports of wholly man-made yarn predominantly of acrylic fibre rose from about 0.23 million lbs in 1969-70 to some 2.27 million lbs in 1970-71. Local yarn spinners, however, supplied more than 82 per cent of the market acrylic yarn in 1970-71. A proportion of local usage of this yarn is in carpet production where it competes against imported wool. </para>
            <para>The relationship between the weight of raw wool and acrylic fibre varies but 1 lb of acrylic staple or tow is equivalent to about 1 lb of scoured or carbonized wool. </para>

          </motion>
          <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is to provide parliamentary approval for a scheme of deficiency payments to give wool growers an assured return during the 1971-72 season and to appropriate funds accordingly. The broad details of the scheme were provided in my statement to the Senate on 24th August last. This is not a short Bill and in order that honourable senators may be aware of its provisions it will be necessary to recapitulate on the earlier statement. It is common knowledge that wool growers&#39; incomes have fallen markedly. Gross returns from wool declined from $839m in 1968-69 to $547m in 1970-71. During 1970-71 more than half of all wool growers were estimated to have less than $2,000 on which to live after servicing their debts. For a significant section of the Australian community this situation will be reflected in reduced standards of living; indeed it has been estimated that approximately one million persons are wholly or partly dependent upon the wool industry for their living. </para>
          <para>In these circumstances the Government decided to supplement market returns on wool for a period of one year. This will provide a much needed breathing space to enable adjustments to take place with a minimum of economic and social disruption. In addition the scheme will allow some payment of unsecured debts in the rural communities which are so dependent upon servicing the wool industry. During the course of the year it is anticipated that there will be a settlement of the international currency situation and other factors bearing on the price of wool, so that the market outlook will be seen with more clarity. So that there shall be no confusion I shall set out again the method for the determination of entitlement for deficiency payments. There will be a notional price schedule for all wool types constituting the Australian clip which would give an average price as near as possible to 79.37c per kilo greasy over the whole season for the full clip. This price is the metric equivalent of 36c per lb. </para>
          <para>Certain inferior wool types, making up about 10 per cent of the clip, will not receive deficiency payments. At the end of each auction week the Australian Wool Commission will calculate the difference between total proceeds realised for eligible wools uttered at all selling centres at which the Commission operated in that week and the total proceeds which would have resulted if the notional prices had been received for the same wool types. This difference will be calculated as a percentage and applied to the gross value of the eligible wool sold by a producer to determine the amount of the deficiency payment for each grower. For all wool sold during a week the same deficiency percentage will apply but the actual amount of deficiency payment received by each grower will depend on the market price of his wool. </para>
          <para>The scheme will cover wool sold and delivered by a producer in the period 2nd July 1971 to 30th June 1972. Wool which was delivered to brokers but not sold on 2nd July 1971 will be eligible for a deficiency payment when it is sold. Unsold wool on hand at close of business on 30th June 1972, will not be eligible. Wool purchased outside the auction system before 2nd July 1971, to be paid for before that date but not delivered until after that date, will not be eligible for a deficiency payment. However, where there was an agreement made before shearing to sell wool but payment did not become due until after 2nd July 1971 the wool will be eligible for a deficiency payment when it is delivered and full payment is made. For private sales made in the period 2nd July to 31st August 1971 the deficiency rate will be that established by the first week of auctions. </para>
          <para>For wool sold at auction brokers will forward to the Australian Wool Commission a list of their clients who sold wool at auction showing the amount of deficiency money payable. This will be calculated on the deficiency percentage for the auction week and applied to the sale value of the eligible wool sold on behalf of each client. The excluded wools will be identified during the normal pres ale appraisement by the Australian Wool Commission. Before the prompt date the Commission, acting as an agent of the Commonwealth will make the payment to the broker for disbursement to his individual clients. Eligible wool owned by a producer which has been included in a price averaging plan pool during the period of this Act, that is pools 3 and 4, shall receive a deficiency payment. There will be a common deficiency percentage applied to the pool proceeds for each lot of wool sold from a pool, based on the average deficiency payments on wool sold from the pool. There is also provision in the Bill that the Commission may take interim deficiency payments on wool in a PAP pool. </para>
          <para>Merchants willing to make deficiency payments will be registered. A first sale to a merchant will attract a payment on the basis of the price in the wool shed on the property. At the time of sale the merchant and grower will sign a document attesting the sale. Registered merchants will claim on the Commission for a deficiency payment and then transmit it to the grower. In the case of an unregistered merchant, when the wool is delivered for resale either to a registered dealer, or at auction through a registered broker, the documents will accompany the wool and will be retained by the registered dealer or broker who will make the claim on the Commission and subsequently pass the deficiency payment directly to the producer. The whole of the Government&#39;s deficiency payments scheme and the market support by the Commission is based on the auction system. The calculation of deficiency payments for private sales on an &#39;on farm&#39; basis as against deficiency payments calculated on a gross value basis for wool sold at auction should have the effect of encouraging merchants to increase the prices they are prepared to pay to growers which in turn will reinforce the auction floor prices. </para>
          <para>For privately sold wool it would not be practicable to have a Commission appraisement to determine for each sale the amount of inferior wool excluded from deficiency payments. Much of this wool loses its identity before it reaches a capital city. The only practicable means of estimating the amount of such excluded wools is by taking account of the average price paid to a producer by a wool merchant. The proportion of the sale proceeds on which the deficiency payment will be calculated for private sales will be progressively reduced as the average price falls below the market price for eligible wools. When the price of any private sale falls below the average market price of wools excluded from deficiency payments it will be regarded as containing only excluded wools and there will be no deficiency payment. The adjustment to take account of excluded wools will be made in accordance with a conversion table contained in the Second Schedule to the Bill which is calculated to have the same average effect as if the wool were appraised by the Commission. Provision is made to vary the conversion table by regulation to take account of changes in the market price on which the table is based. </para>
          <para>Where wool is exported by a producer, sold by tender or used by the producer in manufacture the value for such wool for the calculation of deficiency payment will be the current market value as determined by the Commission on an Australian auction floor basis and the inferior wools will be excluded on the basis of the appraisement. I referred earlier to the inferior wool types which make up approximately 10 per cent of the clip. The aim in excluding these wools was to withdraw support from wools which do not bear the full cost of the disproportionately high sale and handling costs they involve. The Government considered that it would be undesirable to encourage delivery of such wools by increasing their value through the mechanism of deficiency payments. </para>
          <para>It will be seen from the First Schedule to the Bill that the excluded wools are primarily locks, clutching and similar wools which are common to the whole clip and the incidence should be equitable as between growers. Honourable senators will note that some change from the list tabled in the Senate on 24th August last has been made in the wools to be excluded, to ensure that in the present apparent over supply situation of wool, all growers would share in the exclusion. These wools are easily identifiable by growers and are difficult to mix with eligible woo! without being readily detected. Growers who fail to class out these types of wool will be penalised either by having their wool re-classed at their expense or by the lower price received. </para>
          <para>In general, the intention is that the deficiency payment will be paid along with the proceeds of the wool and there will be the same legal rights in the deficiency payment as in the sale proceeds unless there is  a  separate agreement between a producer and a creditor covering the direction of  a  deficiency payment. Accordingly it is necessary for the legislation to provide who is to get the payment and what are the rights of persons for the payments. This is set out in Clause  9  of the Bill. In my earlier statement reference was made to the exclusion of wool on sheepskins from deficiency payments. In this situation the scheme may provide some inducement for shearing of sheep before slaughter. Such a practice could interfere with the local fellmongering of skins and Australia&#39;s overseas trade in sheepskins. Accordingly the Bill provides that wool received from butchers, who purchased the sheep for slaughter, will not be eligible for a deficiency payment. This whole matter will be kept under review. </para>
          <para>The payments mechanism will depend upon the active co-operation of persons carrying on business as brokers, registered classing houses, wool merchants and agents who export wool, or who sell wool by tender on behalf of producers. Such persons will be registered on application to the Department of Primary Industry and will undertake certain responsibilities in the documentation of sales, the provision of information and calculations relating to deficiency payments and the passing on of such payments from the Commission to eligible producers. It is not intended that such persons will be paid for their services as all sectors of the wool industry will benefit directly or indirectly from the scheme. However the wool industry has in recent years become increasingly geared to computers in the calculation of accounts and where the Government is satisfied that a significant cost has been incurred in reprogramming these facilities for the purpose of the scheme it may make some reimbursement. The Government will also meet the costs incurred by the Commission in the administration of the scheme. </para>
          <para>The Bill contains the necessary provisions to protect public moneys by way of penalties for fraudulent activities and the recovery of moneys. The measures provided in this Bill give effect to a scheme which is as fair to all growers as can be devised, having in mind the objective of lifting the average price of the Australian clip of wool and the need to preserve equity between growers. At the same time the Government has been mindful to ensure that, as far as practicable, the position of the various persons who service  the  industry has been protected. Coming at a time when the Commonwealth and the States are deeply involved in rural reconstruction this is a most appropriate measure. While substantial restructuring and readjustments in the industry are inevitable the scheme now before the Senate will provide some cushioning of these effects and will be a steadying influence on those lenders who are concerned to realise on their security. It will allow necessary changes to take place in a more orderly manner. </para>
          <para>The Government recognises that the present crisis in the wool industry calls for a number of measures which in aggregate represent a concerted approach to the urgent problems affecting wool growers. The deficiency payments scheme should be viewed in the context of this total approach. While marketing, research into industry problems and farm reconstruction are being pursued with all urgency, these are essentially longer term in their effects. Immediate assistance is clearly needed in the present situation. The combined effect of the Commission&#39;s marketing activities and the deficiency payments scheme will be to lift wool growers&#39; returns by some $100m over last year&#39;s market place realisations. This will go far towards preserving the wool industry&#39;s viability and the beneficial effects will be widely felt throughout the whole Australian community of people, particularly in the rural areas.I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

            <para>- I rise at the behest of the Seamen&#39;s Union of Australia and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter</inline> of the Australian Council of Trade Unions to speak about the undue delay by the Government in signing the Refugee Seamen&#39;s Convention. On the last occasion that I raised this matter I pointed out that during the last parliamentary recess I had received from the Minister for Works <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wright),</inline> who represented the Minister for Foreign Affairs, a reply to my question in which I was informed that the initial impediments to Australia becoming a signatory to the Convention had been removed. I pointed out also that since 1957, when the Convention came into being, the Australian Government has been extremely dilatory in ratifying it. In raising this matter I was prompted to some extent by the fact that not so long ago when I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> a question on this subject I received in reply a curt &#39;no&#39;. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I had an opportunity at a Legacy dinner this week to listen to the Reverend Colin Craven-Sands, a leading seamen&#39;s chaplain in Sydney, who made a plea on behalf of refugee seamen. He said that it was time that removed impediments to the Convention having legislative application to seamen from various countries. He pointed out that today, with a quicker turn-round, ships seldom were in port for more than 3 days. He mentioned also that today a 200,000- ton tanker might be manned by a crew of only about 22 men. The point he was emphasising was that surely with the small number required to operate ships it was necessary to find sonic means of avoiding irritation between masters and crews. </para>
          <para>Relating that aspect to the Australian scene, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> who represents also the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch),</inline> will know that the South Coast and Newcastle trades and labour council on frequent occasions has been brought into disputes between crews and masters of foreign ships. I refer particularly now to Greek ships and those sailing under the Philippines flag. These are not ordinary industrial disputes. In many cases the men involved find that they could have to answer serious charges under the criminal code of their homelands. I suggest to the Minister that foreign seamen should have some alternative to action of that kind. Perhaps some travel document could be provided. I do not suggest that these men regard themselves as potential migrants to Australia. They want to continue with their careers as seamen. They should not be put in the position where they may lose their means of livelihood because they have protested about some victimisation or exploitation, nor should they be told simply that if they do not toe the line Australia will not help them. They should not be in the position where the Australian authorities are saying to them: &#39;You are a prohibited immigrant and, therefore, when you get back to your own country you may face a serious industrial or even criminal charge&#39;. </para>
          <para>It is against that background that many of us have advocated that the Commonwealth Government should take the plunge and become a signatory to the Refugee Seamen&#39;s Convention. An earlier reply that I received on this subject could be interpreted as meaning that the Australian Government feared there could be some complications if seamen attempted to desert a ship in New Guinea. Quite apart from that aspect, since receiving the last reply from the Minister I have spoken to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr John</inline> Benson, secretary of (he Seamen&#39;s Union in Sydney, to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter</inline> and to chaplains of various denominations, all of whom have urged that the double penalty which could apply to foreign seamen should be removed. In making these remarks I do not indict tankers sailing under the Scandinavian flags or ships belonging to the British or American lines; I refer mainly to some of the lesser maritime services. </para>
          <para>I suggest strongly that Australia should join the 14 nations which signed the Convention in 1957. Quite apart from the aspect of civil rights of seamen, I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> that a check with the provincial labour councils in the major States of Australia will reveal that seamen who have been fined have been unduly harrassed. Someone should be able to say to them: With the aid of the Australian Government we will get you alternative documents so that you can pursue your career as seamen without being subjected to the fierce penalties applying under the industrial code of your own country&#39;. It is with that plea that 1 leave the matter with the Minister. </para>

On 18th August in this place I replied to the honourable senator to the effect that acceptance by Australia was dependent upon our ironing out conditions in relation to Australian territories. The application of conventions is a matter of serious concern. It is a complicated business, especially in this case. Difficulties arise because of the necessary exchange of communications between us and the Government of Papua New Guinea. </para>

          <para>Our acceptance of the Convention must have regard to the contingency of independence in that Territory and, naturally, we wish to be entirely in agreement with the Government of the Territory. We would not wish to take any action without the agreement of the Administrator&#39;s Executive Council in Papua New Guinea or until the difficulties have been finally hammered out. However, I can give the honourable senator an assurance that the matter has been proceeding through discussions since I gave him an answer on 18th August and that the matter is currently under active consideration. I do not wish to detail the matters that are under discussion between us and Papua New Guinea, but with that assurance I am sure that we both will be calm in the interval until the matter is mentioned again. </para>
