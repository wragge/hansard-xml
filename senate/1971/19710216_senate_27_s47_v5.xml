          <para>Jim Ormonde, as we all knew him. was a former coal miner, journalist and public relations officer. He brought with him to the Senate a wealth of human understanding. He was a simple, forthright and direct man who was dedicated to furthering the ideals he held to be true, and dedicated to his convictions in relation to his Party. Jim Ormonde was a practising Christian, not only in the sense of being deeply involved with his church, but also in his dealings with his' fellow human beings. He had a brother who was a priest. In the district where I live and where Jim Ormonde lived, he was a foundation member of the beautiful little Catholic Church of St Therese.

              <para>- by leave - The Australian Labor Party gathers today, very deeply conscious of the loss that has been occasioned by the death of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jim</inline> Ormonde. We knew last session - it was <inline font-style="italic">very</inline> obvious, and I think Jim knew it - that he did not have a long time to live. Many of us thought that he would not see the session out last year.  His  death was a very great loss to the Australian Labor movement, to his colleagues in this Senate and to »H his comrades in the Labor movement. Jim Ormonde was our friend and our loyal colleague. Everybody in the Labor movement recognises that Jim dedicated his life to that movement. He was a man of compassion, humanity and humour. AH his friends will miss his wry comments on life, his penetrating insight into politics and his firm belief in democratic socialism. Throughout his life he worked for his ideals; he genuinely wanted to create a better life for his fellow men through a political system concerned with human values. </para>

          <para>James Patrick Ormonde was born in Kirkcaldy. Scotland. After his arrival in Australia he was educated at the Marist Brothers College, Maitland, and then worked in the coal mines. Later he trained as a journalist and worked on the old Labor Daily'. He had a distinguished career in journalism. He was editor of the Weekly Standard' in the 1940s, worked as a feature writer on the 'Sydney Morning Herald" and later became public relations officer for the Joint Coal Board. Many of us remember the joke that Jim liked to tell against himself in the field of journalism. He frequently told the story that at a Labor branch meeting one night he was dealing with the history of Labor newspapers in New South Wales and said: 'I know something about them because I worked on all of them'. He recalled that someone interjected and said: 'Was there any other reason why they went broke?' Jim loved to tell this story against himself. </para>
          <para>Jim Ormonde was appointed to the Sen ale in 1958 to fill a vacancy which, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson said, was caused by the death of his great friend and predecessor. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bill</inline> Ashley. Later in the same year he was elected to the Senate in his own right. In 1964 he topped the ALP Senate ticket and became the first Australian politician ever to win more than a million first preference votes. He held a number of important posts within the Labor Party. He was an executive officer of the <inline font-style="italic">ALP</inline> for more than 20 years, holding the position of New South Wales Vice-President in 1954 and 1958. In 1962 he was appointed to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and the Printing Committee. He was also an executive of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and Secretary of the Australian Labor Party's Automation Committee. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline>Anderson referred to the spontaneous way in which Jim Ormonde used to ask questions. I felt that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson waited for Jim to ask a question because he had a way of bringing in the topical headlines of the day. In the days when unity tickets were given much publicity he would refer to a unity ticket between a member of the Liberal Party and the Australian Country Party or the Australian Lab. or Party. These topical references resulted. 1 suppose, from his training in journalism. But in all his comments there was never a barb but always much good clean humour. I think we were fortunate in having a journalist to bring the news of the day before us. I think it must be said that his days in the Senate, valuable as they were to the Party, were perhaps the least turbulent of his life. He was an early supporter of the Lang Labor Party, standing as its candidate for the New South Wales seat of Waverley in the 1930s. He was defeated by the official Heron Australian Labor Party candidate. Later he opposed Lang during the State split. </para>
          <para>Jim Ormonde always held strong anti-war views until his death. He was one of the first Labor men to associate himself with Australian peace groups and worked for peace, despite criticism that came, particularly in those days, because of the misunderstanding of what the people in those groups were doing. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> has asked me to say that he feels a great personal loss at the death of his comrade from New South Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jim</inline> Ormonde. I think that expression of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy's</inline> can be backed by all of us. lt is a personal loss and a political loss and (he Australian Labor movement extends its sympathy to Jim Ormonde's widow and family. </para>

            <para>- On behalf of the Australian Country Party I support most sincerely the tributes paid by the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson)</inline> and the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Willesee)</inline> following the passing of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ormonde.</inline> Jim Ormonde, as he was known to most of us, was a friend of mine. Ours was a friendship that went back to the early days when we became members of this Senate. We were appointed by our respective State Parliaments within a matter of weeks of each other in 1958. Later we contested the Senate election and were returned to the Senate. For various reasons both of us were out of this chamber for a matter of 7 months. From the outset Jim Ormonde and I had a common bond in that we came into this chamber as political novices very much aware of the important jobs in front of us. 1 speak for the Australian Country Party and, <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> believe, for every honourable senator in this chamber when 1 say that at all times Jim Ormonde applied himself with dedication and vigour to the task of ensuring good government for Australia. He staunchly supported his Party and attended to the needs of the electors. Jim Ormonde possessed a very human streak. When things got tough and tense in the Senate he used his sense of whimsy and joviality to remove the tension from this chamber instantly. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> believe that such traits in a man are very important and 1 think it was because of them that Jim had so many friends not only in this Senate but throughout the Parliament. He will be sadly missed here both as a political colleague and as a friend of all of us. I and my Country Party colleagues extend our deepest sympathy to his widow and family. </para>

Whether they agreed with mine or with others 1 suppose is secondary to the individual's sense of purpose and sincere desire and motivation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ormonde,</inline> as has been said, had been sick for some time off and on and his death was not altogether unexpected. However, death comes to us ail - it is the only thing we can be sure about - and it comes in different ways, but we do not want to dwell on that subject. I believe he contributed something to the parliamentary and political life of this country for which the people of Australia owe him a debt and which f believe will bring him some merit. </para>

I had known him since I joined the Labor movement just on 40 years ago. He was a good Labor man. He came from a great Labor family. As has been said he worked in mines before serving on the Joint Coal Board, during which service he gave great help and assistance in the war years to Labor Prime Ministers John Curtin and Ben Chifley, f know of the great work he performed in this trying period when a lot of difficulties arose. </para>

          <para>Tt has been truly said by other speakers tha! he worked as a journalist on the 'Labor Daily' and the 'Weekly Standard' and was <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> Labor publicist of the highest order. He was for a number of years vice-president of the same executive on which I served and his diligent work there earned him the respect of people right throughout the length and breadth of . the Labor movement. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> has already pointed out, Jim Ormonde contested the State electorate of Waverley, but it has not been mentioned that prior to that, as a very young man, he also contested the blue ribbon conservative seat of Wentworth as Labor's representative. </para>
          <para>Jim Ormonde was always at the forefront in fighting for every tenet of the Labor movement. Tt can be truly said that he was a man of very high principle. One could disagree wilh him but one could never disregard his friendship. I think all honourable senators regarded him as one of the most loveable characters ever to enter the Federal Parliament. He was a good man in every respect. He loved his family deeply. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> and many other distinguished members of this Parliament attended the church service which was held in his honour. T think we were all touched by the very fine tribute which was paid to him by the attendance of such a large congregation. I was very moved by the remarks made by his own brother, the Rev. Father Ormonde, who conducted the service, and <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> am sure we all understood the strain that the occasion placed on Father Ormonde. </para>
          <para>On behalf of my own family and all Jim's friends in the Labor movement I would like to express to his dear wife, sons and daughters my deepest sympathy in their bereavement. </para>

            <para>- i wish to pay my personal tribute to my good friend, great mate and colleague throughout the years, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jim</inline> Ormonde. I first met Jim Ormonde in 1947 when I joined the Labor movement. He was then a member of the New South Wales Executive of the Australian Labor Party and I was there attending my first party branch meeting. From then onwards we trod practically the same path for a great number of years. I had the honour of serving with him on the New South Wales Executive of the Australian Labor Party. I also had the honour of serving with him in this chamber; indeed, I can say that he was one of those who encouraged me in 1966 to seek my Party's endorsement as a Senate candidate- </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>He was a member of the Australian Journalists Association, as I am a member of the Australian Journalists Association. He was a member of the Federated Miscellaneous Workers Union of Australia, of which I am a member. He and I often went to the Sydney Cricket Ground together to watch a game of rugby league football, which sport we both loved. When the late <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Evatt</inline> decided to step down from the Barton electorate to seek Labor endorsement for the seat of Hunter. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ormonde</inline> and I, with others, accompanied the then Labor Leader to Newcastle. </para>
          <para>As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turnbull</inline> said, the late Jim Ormonde was a great lover of humanity. He was never vindictive. He was a tolerant and understanding man. He had a great love of children and he took a great interest in the affairs of the younger generation of Australians. He was a friend of my late father's and also a close personal friend of mine and of my family. He had a great love for his country. He had a wonderful sense of humour. He will be missed not only by his immediate relatives but also by the great Labor movement. Honourable senators may not know that within a couple of weeks of the death of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ormonde</inline> one of his brothers, another eminent journalist, also passed away. I thank Jim Ormonde for his friendship and for his guidance to me." My sympathy and that of my family go to his widow, <inline font-style="italic">to his</inline> sons and to his daughters in their very great and overwhelming loss. </para>

            <para>- I align myself with other speakers in paying tribute to the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ormonde.</inline> Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland,</inline> the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ormonde</inline> and I had links, as fellow Labor Party officers, on the New South Wales Executive. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee,</inline> in his opening remarks, said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ormonde</inline> s period in the Senate was for him a lot less turbulent than his early days. I know that in the 1950s, in his Party work, he went through a somewhat turbulent period, but Jim Ormonde always had the ready quip to ease tense situations. I can recall attending a meeting of the New South Wales Executive in the early 50s when I wished to make out a case. When I entered the room I was greeted with a cheery remark from Jim Ormonde which put me at ease. In 1964 he and I were part of a New South Wales Senate team. Recently I visited some of the areas that he traversed then, lt was remarkable to discover the little things that he was always available to do for small hamlets in those areas, lt certainly could be said that Jim Ormonde left the world in a much better state than that in which he found it. He was always accessible. He had a cheery disposition. He had no rancour in his make-up. </para>

            <para>- I wish to add a few brief words to. what has been said about the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ormonde.</inline> When I became a senator a short time ago, it was my privilege to sit next to Jim Ormonde. I benefited from the advice that he gave me. As honourable senators arc well aware, 1 needed that advice quite often. I, and other honourable senators, gained considerably from his experience, from his good humour and from his advice. I will find this corner a particularly lonely one for the next 6 months. I wish to add to the condolences which have been extended to his wife, whom I came to know very well, and to members of his family who I am sure will follow the tradition of Jim Ormonde. </para>

          <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I have to inform the Senate that a former Governor-General, Field-Marshal Viscount Slim. K.G.. G.C.B., G.C.M.G., G.C.V.O., G.B.E.. D.S.O,. M.C., died in London on 14tt December 1970 after a long illness. He was born on 6th August 1891 and spent most of his youth in Birmingham where he began his working life as a junior clerk in a Birmingham city office. Then he became a gang foreman and after that an elementary school teacher. At the outbreak of the First World War he joined the Royal Warwickshire Regiment and after a short spell in the ranks was given a commission. By August 19.15 he had seen action at Gallipoli where he was wounded, France and Mesopotamia where he was wounded again and awarded the Military Cross. Although he was then discharged as permanently unfit he rejoined the Army within a year and saw action in France and in Baghdad. After the war be went to India and spent the next 20 years in the Indian Army. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>When the Second World War broke out he was a brigade commander in the 5th Indian Division in the Sudan. He also served in Eritrea, Iraq and Syria and when Burma was falling he was sent to command the First Burma Corps. He was given command of the famous 14th Army which finally cleared the Japanese from the Indian frontier and eventually right out of the sub-continent. He wrote 2 notable books about the war in Burma - 'Defeat into Victory' and 'Courage'. In 1947 he left the Army to become a full time member of the British Railways Executive. In 1948 he was asked to return to the Army as Chief of the Imperial General Staff and was promoted to Field-Marshal. </para>
        <para>In 1952 he was appointed Governor-General of Australia in succession to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> McKell. He remained Governor-General until January I960, a term of office longer than any except that of Lord Gowrie. He was a highly respected and popular Governor-General in Australia who in lime of war had been a down to earth, courageous professional soldier who had risen through the ranks. He travelled eagerly to all parts of Australia and both he and Lady Slim, though she had a great deal of illness, obviously relished their tasks. On retiring from his post as Governor-General <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Slim was created Viscount Slim. In 1963 he was appointed  Deputy  Constable and Lieutenant Governor of Windsor Castle. He remained in that post until June last year. </para>
        <para>On behalf of the Australian Government and people and speaking on behalf of honourable senators on the Government side, including members of the Australian Country Party, I extend our sympathy to his widow and family. I take this opportunity to inform the Senate that a memorial service for the late Lord Slim will be held at St John's Church, Reid, Australian Capital Territory, at noon on Wednesday, 24 February. 1 move: </para>

          <para>- 1 second the motion. I say on behalf of the Australian Labor Party that the late Field-Marshal Viscount Slim was one of the best of the overseas Governor-general in Australia. He was one of the last English Governor-general and was certainly one of the most outspoken. It was not. always that many of us liked to hear some of his outspoken remarks but he made them without fear or favour. It was only by studying his life in later years that I personally was able to obtain a different slant to this outspokenness. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I remember that on one occasion while he was Governor-General of Australia I was in a group of people whom he told that he had been asked to inspect some people who wore uniforms and rode motor bikes. He said that after inspecting them - looking up and down their lines and examining the bikes - he had remarked: 'I thought that your uniforms had been used to clean your bikes but I changed my mind after I inspected the bikes.' To me, the inspection of guards is a pretty serious ceremonial. This type of humour and outspokenness was something which took some understanding. It was only after reading books about him, his life in Burma, his attitude as a soldier and his attitude since returning to England, that T have been able to accept some of this humour which, quite frankly, I found difficult to accept in those days. He was certainly a down-to-earth person with a very egalitarian manner. </para>
        <para>I think the phase of his character of which 1 am speaking came through clearly in his book 'Unofficial History', a volume of his World War I reminiscences, which told deprecatingly of his rise from private to corporal and his return to private. It is a gentle satire on ponderous official war histories, full of the dry, sardonic humour which helped him greatly in his duties in Canberra. At one point in the book <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> remarked that Nap ole an never felt as Napoleonic as he did while in command of British forces in Mesopotamia. He then went on to record all the mistakes he had made. Yet Lord Slim later proved to be a highly competent general against the Japanese in Burma.  His  campaign there was described as a model of strategy and a triumph of leadership. He was a general who looked after his men and won their support. Men who fought under him apparently took to him because he never strutted, posed or played to the crowd. </para>
        <para>As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson has said, he came from the position of Chief of the Imperial General Staff to Governor-General in Australia in 1.953 and stayed here until 1960. When he left in 1960 thousands of people fare welled him at Canberra Airport. I believe this to be a tribute to his great personal popularity. As I have said he was one of the last of the English Governor-general of Australia and I think that he is certainly the best remembered of them. In supporting the motion the Australian Labor Party extends its sympathies to those members of his family who remain. </para>

The fact of the matter is that in relation to the economic condition of this country - indeed, of most countries - at the present time all thoughtful governments and all thoughtful people are having regard to the world trends. I hope at a later time tonight - if not tonight, then possibly tomorrow - to read on behalf of the Prime Minister a statement in relation to the economy which he may well have it in contemplation to make. At this point of time, therefore, 1 do not think any demand is put upon me to go any further. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy,</inline> in his capacity of Leader of the Opposition, wants at question time to postulate speeches instead of questions that seek knowledge, I cannot do anything abou! that. </para>

            <para>- In addressing my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Transport I draw his attention to Press reports appearing today in a number of States, including South Australia, of further unfortunate accidents. on the Eyre Highway in South Australia and a statement by the South Australian Minister of Roads and Transport. Can the Minister say whether the Government has received recent representations from the South Australian Government on this matter, and whether it has in mind or  in hand a plan to make funds available for the sealing of the important section of the Eyre Highway which is involved? </para>

            <para>- I have been aware for some time that the honourable senator has a deep and continuing interest in problems associated with the Eyre Highway. I have in my papers some information on the matter which may help him, but I may Well need to get more information for him.  The present- situation, as I understand it,- is that 300 miles of the Eyre Highway in South Australia are unsealed. The Western Australian portion is fully sealed. The South Australian Government is upgrading the section of 44 miles from Penong to Ceduna, and it-is to be completed by 1972. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Representations have been made by  the South Australian Government to the Commonwealth for grants to seal the remainder of the South Australian section of the highway. Those representations have been made by the Premier of South Australia to the Prime Minister. The importance of the highway is recognised by the Commonwealth, as 1 have said on many occasions on behalf of the Minister for Shipping and Transport. </para>

              <para>- After thanking <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> for his interjection perhaps I should comment that South Australia received a 50 per cent increase in the road grant under the 1969 Commonwealth Aid Roads Act and can allocate those funds at its own discretion among defined classes of roads. Under that Act South Australia received $13.67m for rural arterial roads and a supplementary grant of $9m, any portion of which can be spent on the Eyre Highway. 1 imagine that I should now obtain any additional information available to bring up to date the reply to the honourable senator's question. I have no further advice of representations to the Commonwealth. I am aware of the newspaper reports referred to by the honourable senator. </para>

              <para>- In response to the first part of the question, I am informed that all trade commissioners at our 46 overseas posts in 35 countries are competent to handle trade inquiries for agricultural products. All trade commissioners receive specialist briefing from the Department of Primary Industry and the various marketing boards. Because of peculiar and particular problems where specialist policy knowledge is required, trade commissioners of agriculture are specifically located in London, Rome and Washington and provide a trade commissioner service from those bases. I was asked whether there was an agricultural attache in Tokyo and, if not, why not. The answer which has been supplied to me is that at present there is no specialist trade commissioner service in Tokyo dealing exclusively with agricultural products. However, the Department has a minister commercial heading a relatively large staff in Tokyo, all of whom are fully aware of the importance of sales of primary produce in this market. In the third part of this question the honourable senator asked what apportioning of time was allocated to increasing agricultural product sales in various countries by our trade commissioners. The answer with which I have been supplied, on request, is that it is not possible to state with any exactitude the proportion of time that each trade commissioner post would spend in attending to the promotion of exports of primary produce. This would depend on the market for those products within the area of each post and the situation existing from time to time in each post. </para>

            <para>- As one has learnt to expect, this is a long question. The telegram was received and was sent to the Department for a considered answer which has not yet been supplied. The telegram should have been acknowledged by informing the honourable senator: 'Received your telegram. Preparing answer for you.' However, if that was not done the honourable senator has my apologies. I could not go further than that at that stage. We have been in discussion with the State Planning Authority of New South Wales and the golf club to which the honourable senator referred about the acquisition of some land adjoining the Bankstown Airport. Bankstown Airport is a general aviation field. This means that it caters for light aircraft, including the occasional agricultural aircraft which is taken to Sydney for repair work. The De Haviland enterprise is based there. I cannot say any more than that but from that one should not conjecture that it is to be the brand new international airport. That is not to be conjectured. I do not think there is anything more that I can tell the honourable senator now, but I will ask the Department to get some information for him and see that he gets it this week. </para>

            <para>- The honourable senator is anxious to ascertain the terms of the final settlement in the claim by the Queensland Government against the owners of the 'Oceanic Grandeur'. This is a matter in which he has had a lot of interest - indeed, so have I. I do not know the final details of the terms of the settlement. The honourable senator was good enough to tell me today that he was interested in this matter and I am trying to find out for him. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate or to the appropriate Minister. Can he inform the Parliament whether one or more of the DC3 planes purchased from Jet air and donated to Cambodia and other countries was previously owned by a Commonwealth department and sold to Jet air? If this is a fact, what was the original sale price to Jet air and what was the purchase price from Jetair? </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir KENNETH</inline>ANDERSONI cannot give the honourable senator a direct answer to his question this evening but I can provide some background and subsequently perhaps we can get further information. The Minister for Foreign Affairs issued a statement on 14th February which I presume the honourable senator would have received by now. In it he indicated that Australia bad agreed to supply 11 DC3 aircraft to 3 countries, the Khmer Republic, which was formerly Cambodia, Nepal and Laos, as a foreign aid project. In that project there- was a component of 6 DC3 aircraft which are to be purchased from Jet air Australia Ltd. Those are the aircraft involved in the questions asked by the honourable senator. At this point of time the Department of Supply has <inline font-style="italic">no</inline> policy initiatives in this matter at all. The Department of Supply is the body which will complete the final transaction. At present I am not in a position to say whether, the policy decision having been taken, the transaction has been completed. It is obvious that after the final completion of the contract t will be asked to give information about whether the 6 aircraft that Jet air is selling to the Government for it to give away in the form of foreign aid were in fact purchased by Jet air from the Government and then resold to the Government. I think that is the implication of the honourable senator's question. I am not clear on this matter, but I would think - I will have to make some inquiry with the Department of Civil Aviation - that this is not so. I will make some inquiries into this matter. I should think that they were probably purchased some time ago by another organisation and sent out of Australia because these are the circumstances under which we would normally sell. </para>

When I receive this information I will make it available However the truth of the situation is that the Department of Supply is not the policy maker in such a transaction; it is the instrument for the carrying out of the Government's decision to buy these aircraft for presentation in the form of aid to other countries. </para>

            <para>- I wish to ask a question of the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I refer to the question asked of him earlier by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> concerning the purchase of DC3 aircraft to give to Cambodia. When the Leader of the Government is searching out information on this subject will he ascertain why it was necessary to buy 6 DC3 aircraft from Jet air Australia Ltd when others were available and will he take steps to assure the Senate that this was not a convenient arrangement to assist Jetair's directors to rid themselves of a serious liability, especially when at least one of its directors is closely associated with leading members of the Liberal Party of Australia? </para>

            <para>- Proposals for the introduction of a research scheme which will benefit the pig industry have been put before the Government. This scheme, which would be similar to the research schemes operating already in several other rural industries such as the wool, wheat, meat, dairy, tobacco, egg and chicken meat industries, would be financed jointly by the industry and by the Commonwealth. The proposals put forward by the Australian Commercial Pig Producers Federation, which represents all pig producers, have been accepted by the Government. The operating levy suggested by the Federation is 5 cents per pig slaughtered for human consumption, with a maximum payment of 10 cents. Any rise in the levy would be on the advice of the industry. A small section of the Victorian pig industry has made representations for a poll of producers, but in view of the widespread acceptance of the whole scheme in all States it is felt that a referendum on this matter would serve no useful purpose. </para>

It would be an odd circumstance if it were regarded as audacity - if that is the appropriate word - for the Government, which has to accept the responsibility to govern, to choose to do something which was in contradiction to what the Senate resolved. The very process of government in our democratic system is such that we can express a view, that we can pass resolutions, that we can move amendments and that we can seek requests.

              <para>- lt will be a long time before the honourable senator appreciates them because he does not do his homework. Our expression of a view is not binding on the Government when it makes a decision. If it were a:t Act of Parliament which we amended that would be a different matter. But the fact of the matter is that the Government in its wisdom - and I think it was good judgment - decided that it was appropriate to allow this export of merino rams. The Senate did not think that was a good view. But the Government, believing it to be proper and right in the interests of the people of Australia, made its contribution to see that the decision was carried out. </para>

              <para>- We will hear the altitude of the Australian Labor Party on this matter in seeking assistance for those in hardship, ls the Minister aware that it is estimated that in excess of 20,000 tons of peats will rot in orchards in that area as local canneries are unable to accept these goods for processing? Will the Minister assure urgent consideration of a request to the Government for financial assistance to those growers who are facing extreme financial loss due to the conditions applying in that area? </para>

            <para>- I am aware of the situation and it is a serious one. The problem is that the production of pears in 1970 was the largest ever and the carry over of canned pears at the end .of 1970 was something like <inline font-style="italic">li</inline> million to 2 million cartons. In the light of the marketing possibilities for the 1971 season the canneries have agreed that this year they will be able to process only about 75,000 tons. This leaves the situation which the honourable senator remarked on that there will be somewhere in the vicinity of 20,000 tons of pears surplus to requirements. It is true that the former Minister for Primary Industry visited the Shepparton district and discussed the problem of over production of pears with the growers concerned. At that time <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony</inline> discussed the possibility of growers submitting a claim for assistance for hardship. The growers agreed that they would raise the matter with the Victorian Government which has prime responsibility for this matter. It was agreed that if the Victorian Government passed the application on to the Commonwealth Government the matter would receive careful consideration. </para>

            <para>- I would like to ask some questions about the Jet air air  craft. I was out of the chamber for a short while and 1 may be repeating a question that has been asked already. What was the price, date and purpose of the purchase of 6 DC3 aircraft from Jet air Australia Ltd? At the time of the purchase did the Royal Australian Air Force have any similar aircraft for disposal and, if so, why were these not used for the purpose to be outlined in the Minister's answer to my first question? 1 would suggest, if I may, that the Minister make a statement. Some very serious aspersions seem to be cast oh people concerning this matter and 1 think it would clear the air if the Minister made a statement tomorrow. </para>

          <para class="block">Perhaps the honourable senator was not here at the beginning of question time and 1 do not blame bini for that. As I pointed out, the Minister for Foreign Affairs did in fact make a statement on 14th February. The honourable senator should have a copy of it. I will be happy to supply him with a copy of it. 1 do not want to read it again at question time, although I would be quite happy to do so. I think everybody should have the burden of it. The burden of it really is that a decision was taken to acquire 1 1 aircraft for the purpose of giving aid to certain countries by supplying them with the aircraft.- Perhaps 1 could read a little of the text which 1 think is germane to the honourable senator's point. The statement reads in part: </para>

            <para>The availability of the Jet air fleet was most opportune, particularly as il consisted of a mix lure of passenger and freight aircraft in very good condition with civilian certificates of airworthiness which is a prerequisite for Nepal and Laos, and in configurations required by the receiving countries. </para>

          <para class="block">That is Cambodia:   . . requirement is for freighter aircraft for use by the Khmer Air Force as general freight and personnel carriers. The 5 ex-RAAF freighters and 1 ex-Jetair freighter consequently will be supplied to fulfil this need. </para>
          <para class="block">I suggest that if there is any doubt honourable senators should read this statement and then ask questions tomorrow. </para>
          <para>In relation to the questions asked by Senior Turnbull, I have been supplied with answers by the Department of Foreign Affairs. The Government is in the process of purchasing 6 DC3 aircraft from Jet air. The actual contract should be completed in the very near future when the precise purchase price will be made public. My Department has the responsibility of completing that transaction and that information will be made available. The purpose of the purchase is to supply 2 passenger planes for civilian use to Nepal, 2 passenger and 1 freighter aircraft for civilian use to Laos and 1 freighter to the Khmer Republic. The honourable senator's question as to whether the RAAF had any similar aircraft for disposal at the time of purchase can be best answered by stating that under its foreign aid programmes the Department of Foreign Affairs has a requirement for 11 DC3 aircraft, 5 of which are coming from ex-RAAF sources and will be supplied to the Khmer Republic and the remaining 6 will be obtained from Jet air. The decision to purchase from Jet air was made because its planes have both the configurations and civilian certificates of airworthiness which are required for Nepal and Laos. The RAAF aircraft do not possess these. 1 hope this information will help to give a background to the situation, ff it does not, the matter can be raised again tomorrow. I will certainly try to find the information that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> asked for earlier. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Industry, ls it a fact that mainland China has not yet renewed its order for Australian wheat and that it is now 2 months after the normal ordering date? Is this market worth over $ 10Om annually to Australian wheat growers? Could the loss of this market cause the present rural crisis to become catastrophic? Is it correct that Canada received an order for wheat from mainland China which was 10 per cent larger than the usual order after Canada accorded Peking diplomatic recognition? If these are facts - perhaps the Minister will indicate if they are not - will he tell us for how much longer the Australian Government will maintain the fiction that the 700 million or 800 million people in mainland China are represented by the Chiang Kai-shek Government in Taiwan? </para>

One relates to the recognition of mainland China and the other to trade relations between that country and Australia in terms of the sale of wheat to it by the Australian Wheat Board. T am not in a position to answer the question relating to the prospective sale of wheat. That would be more within the administration of the Minister for Primary Industry who would be better equipped than I to answer it. I certainly shall take the question on notice and obtain a reply for the honourable senator. The question nl the recognition of mainland China comes within the administration of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Government's views in relation to it have always been clear and 1 do not believe that they need to be re-stated here tonight. </para>

      <para class="block">That is a valid question but, in fairness, I think it warrants a reply by the Minister for Trade and Industry, not by myself as the Minister's representative in this place. lt is definitely related to the question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy.</inline> This is the first question time of the new sessional period and I do not want to start pontificating on the issue at this time. I have promised to obtain a reply to the first part of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy's</inline> question, and I shall certainly refer the question now asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack to the Minister for Trade and Industry for a considered reply. </para>

            <para>- Is the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry aware that the fruit growers of the Goulburn Valley also have a problem in that the price being offered for peaches is uneconomic and that the export market for pears can be affected disastrously unless the supply of peaches is maintained because overseas buyers will not purchase pears unless peaches are also available at the same time? Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the disastrous circumstances of the fresh fruit growers in the Harcourt Valley in Victoria? Is the Government aware that grower co-operatives and canneries are paying ordinary overdraft rates of interest on money that is being used to finance these primary producers in their difficulties? </para>

Because the report of the inter-departmental committee on the site of the second airport for Sydney was received by the Minister on 24th September last year, can he say what stage has- been reached in his Department's consideration of the report and the proposed .reference to the New South Wales Government for that Government's consideration? When does he expect he will be able to make an announcement to the Parliament on this matter? </para>

            <para>- Firstly, I should like to say that since I gave the last answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland</inline> a note has been passed in to me to the effect that the telegram that he sent me was acknowledged to his secretary on receipt in our office. That ought to clear up that point. I turn now to his question regarding a second airport for Sydney. That report is on its way to the Government with a recommendation. All 1 want to say in addition io that is that when we are looking at a major airport in a major capital city we should think about Tullamarine in Victoria. It cost S82m of which S52m was Commonwealth expenditure and S30m was expenditure by the State Government for an expressway about 16 miles in length. Then there was a sum of money, which one cannot really apportion, for reserved land without housing outside the boundary. The analysis which all honourable senators can make will show them that any State Government has a tremendous interest in any proposal for the development of an airport in its capital city. </para>

            <para>- I address a question to the Minister representing the Minister for the Interior. Was the recent tragedy in Canberra during the period of heavy rain, in which lives were lost, the result of excessive water flowing over Melrose Drive? Was the volume of water flowing over the road greatly increased by the national development committee acting on a plan of the Department of Works in directing alt drainage water into a cement channel that stopped 25 feet from the road, resulting in flood waters having to take an S course to flow through pipes under the road? Did the construction of the channel up to the road before the construction of the channel under the road cause or contribute to the volume of water flowing over the road and therefore contribute to the drownings that occurred? </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir KENNETH</inline>ANDERSONI have here a brief on this matter. The Commonwealth has already offered to join with the Victorian Government in the usual way in financing a scheme for the relief of personal hardship and distress in the areas affected by floods in Victoria. The Prime Minister had a letter from the Premier of Victoria regarding damage to public structures and the destruction of crops. The information furnished by the Prime Minister's Department of 15th February states that the Prime Minister expected to be replying shortly to the Premier of Victoria. </para>

            <para>-  The Department does not behave like that. This general information is what J think the honourable senator wants: When a number of country towns were without air services following a withdrawal of airline operations and the subsequent failure of commuter services, 1 agreed that the Director General of Civil Aviation should exercise his discretion under- regulation 203 of the Air Navigation Regulations so as to permit the operation of DC3s on these routes by Jet air without the necessity of obtaining an airline licence. Jet air had acquired the DC3s from various sources. They had been completely overhauled and in every way met the demanding technical and operational standards of the Department of Civil Aviation. lt is a matter of history that the services did not attract sufficient patronage to enable their continuation on an economic basis. </para>

            <para>- My question is addressed to the Leader of the Government. Owing to the death of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ormonde</inline> there is a vacancy in the representation of New South Wales in this chamber. That death occurred on 30th November of last year, lt appears that owing to the neglect of the Government of New South Wales, for the second time within 12 months New South Wales is to be deprived unnecessarily of its representation for some time in this chamber. I refer to the constitutional provisions which require action to be taken by the Government of New South Wales to replace a senator in the case of a casual vacancy occurring. Will the Leader of the Government use his best offices, whether officially, unofficially or both, to see to it that the representation of New South Wales is brought up to what it should be and that the State has full representation in this chamber? </para>

              <para>- I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that it is desirable that any casual vacancy, whether it is for New South Wales, the mother State, or for any other State, should be filled as quickly as possible. I do not want to take too much time on this, but unfortunately there is a constitutional problem which relates to whether a parliament is in session or has been prorogued. We had this situation when the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colin</inline> McKellar died. Because the New South Wales Parliament was not in session, and had not been prorogued, we had to wait a long time for a replacement to fill the casual vacancy. 1 understand that there has been an election in New South Wales and that the Parliament was prorogued for the purposes of the election. During this time the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ormonde</inline> passed away. Now that the election is over, although the Parliament is Stilll prorogued, I am sure that it will be competent for a recommendation to be made to the State executive council, prior to the reassembly of the Parliament, to fill the vacancy. If representations do not bring about a quick result I shall add my weight to the request that something be done about fining the vacancy. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKellar</inline> died the Opposition granted a pair to the Government for a considerable time and I already have indicated to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> that the same rule will now apply in relation to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ormonde's</inline> replacement. A pair will be permitted for a reasonable time if necessary but I hope it is not necessary and that the position will be filled very quickly. </para>

            <para>- Has the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry seen a report on wool prices which appeared in yesterday's 'Financial Review'., which pointed out that wool prices could go even lower and which stated that 70's quality wool is 34c per pound cheaper, 64's is dawn 25c and 60's is J 9c cheaper than the prices ruling at the same time last year? The article pointed out that the average price now is 30.33c per pound, which is lower than the cost of production. As this price of 30.33c has been maintained only by the purchase of 20 per cent of the clip by the Australian Wool Commission and there seems little likelihood of an immediate improvement, what does the Government propose to do to alleviate the depression in the wool industry? </para>

            <para>- In the last parliamentary session as well as in recent months there were great discussions on the wool industry and the situation prevailing therein. Last November the Government put through legislation setting up the Australian Wool Commission. The Commission has been in operation now for some months. I believe it has been the salvation of the wool industry and t hope it will continue to operate. Following a detailed report by an inter-departmental committee the Government had talks with State Ministers and offered assistance to wool growers in the form of the SI 00m reconstruction plan. In the last Budget the Government made available a §30m emergency grant to the wool industry, because of falling wool prices and drought. These things speak volumes in themselves for the assistance that the Government is giving to the wool industry. The Senate can rest assured that the Government is having frequent talks with leaders of the industry, is watching the situation very carefully and will take what action it can to assist wool growers further. </para>

At the same time, the sale of the 575,000 TVW shares and some other investments of West Australian Newspapers Ltd. rectified the contraventions of the provisions of the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942-1969 by the Herald and Weekly Times Ltd, in respect of the licences for commercial television station TVW Perth, BTQ Brisbane.

          <para>The table makes no allowance for differences in quality or for the way in which the proportions of coals of different types supplied by a country may have varied from year to year, and hence the figures are not strictly comparable. For example costs of coal to Japan from the various fields in New South Wales vary from one to the other depending on their chemical and physical specifications and freight rates at the time  of  shipment. Also much of the coal from the United Slates of America is regarded as the world's best for coking purposes and hence commands a high price. </para>

        <para>The Minister is no doubt aware of the isolated nature of Cape Barren Island in Bass Strait. It is often cut off from shipping in bad weather, and the aerodrome is in bad shape. Is the Minister aware that the indigenous community on the Island is most concerned about the closing of the hospital and the departure of its trained nursing sister? They are concerned also at the lack of someone on the island trained in first aid for amongst the Island people are aged and invalids as well as families with young children and babies. Will the Minister make representations to the Minister-in-Charge of Aboriginal Affairs to have an inquiry made into the closing down of the hospital and the lack of a trained nursing sister on the Island? </para>

      <quote>
        <para>The Tasmanian Department of Health Services has advised that the whole question of the continuation of a District Nursing Centre on the Wand is at present under review and also alternative suggestions are being considered. The Sister who served on Cape Barren Island for some 15 years finally reached the stage where she was no longer able to continue. It is extremely difficult to obtain the services of a trained nursing sister for such a remote and lonely area as Cape Barren Island. </para>
        <para>Atthe present time the District Medical Officer is visiting the Island on the second and fourth Thursday of every month. This service is supplemented by a Royal Flying Doctor Service medical chest which is administered by the Headmaster and his wife on a voluntary basis. The Royal Flying Doctor Air Ambulance Service provides an emergency service and can reach the island in approximately one hour, except at night and exceptionally bad weather conditions. There is also a fast Police Launch based on Flinders Island which can make the night crossings with the Doctor in emergencies. Until a firm decision is reached regarding the future of the District Nursing Centre the medical care of the Islanders is adequate. </para>

He asked whether the Government would put in hand a feasibility study into the wisdom of establishing an EDP industry in Australia. </para>
      <para>The Prime Minister has provided the following reply: </para>
      <quote>
        <para>There are already in Australia a number of companies engaged in the manufacture of EDP equipment. Although the range of local manufacture is being extended, the rate of expansion of local manufacture is necessarily constrained by basic economic and commercial considerations. These considerations include the size of the domestic market, the costs of design and development work in this industry and the extent of established manufacturing capacity and competition overseas. There are disabilities in these areas which are not easily overcome in relation to an industry such as this. </para>
        <para>The Government does provide direct financial assistance to manufacturers in the form of grants for research and development in new products and processes. However, it would not accord with established policy foi the Government to initiate a feasibility study as proposed by the honourable <inline font-weight="bold">Senator. Any</inline> feasibility studies into the expansion of EDP manufacturing facilities in Australia would, in the Government's view, best be left to individual manufacturers who have ambitions in this area. </para>

        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir KENNETH</inline>ANDERSONOn 15th October 1970 <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laucke</inline> asked* me a question without notice on the subject of the professional qualification requirement of the Industrial Research and Development Grants Act. I undertook to have the question referred to the Minister for Trade and Industry. The Minister for Trade and Industry has now supplied me with the following answer: </para>
      <quote>
        <para>Under the Industrial Research and Development Grants Act the Government provides Australian manufacturing and mining companies with an incentive to spend more on research and development. Grants are paid in relation to an increase in a company's own expenditure in circumstances where the Australian Industrial Research and Development Grants Board, which administers the scheme, is satisfied that the company has met all the Act's requirements. </para>
        <para>The main purpose of the Act is to stimulate an increase in the overall level of industrial research and development performed by Australian industrial companies. </para>
        <para>While acknowledging thai on occasions worthwhile research can be carried out by nonprofessional teams; the Government was conscious of the need to ensure that the funds available for grants were used in the most productive manner. </para>
        <para>The Aci therefore aimed, by a few simple rules, to ensure that the work assisted could be generally expected to be of a high standard. The Act requires that to be eligible for assistance the industrial research and development must be undertaken on a full-time basis and by. or under the supervision of, a professionally qualified person. "I he company  referred to by the honourable senator did apply- to the Board for a grant. On a preliminary examination of the company's application it was found that the company did not meet the Act's requirements relating lo professional qualifications and was therefore ineligible for a gram. Consequently, there was no need for the application lo bc. subjected to full investigation by the Board lo determine whether or not the professional qualification requirement was the only ground on which the company was ineligible for a grant. </para>
        <para>The operation of the Act is now under review to determine the future form and extent of the Government's assistance to industry in this field. All the points of concern about the provisions of the Aci which have been drawn to the Government's attention will be fully considered in this review. </para>

It is that the responsibility for any financial assistance as the result of damage to crops rests solely with the Slates, lt is only when major disasters occur that the Commonwealth is prepared to consider the provision of assistance to a Stale for the purpose of relief measures. </para>

            <para>Under arrangements which operated some years ago, part of the money payable to Aboriginal pensioners living on pastoral properties in the Northern Territory was retained by the pastoral management to provide special facilities for pensioners. Under these arrangements the Wave Hill Pastoral Company erected eight cottages near the old Wave Hill Station and these are in the process of being removed to the site of the new homestead for occupation by pensioners residing on the pastoral property. lt is not considered that there is any obligation to erect the cottages on sites where pensioners may wish to live from time to time. A number of pensioners who contributed to the cost of erecting these cottages by deductions from their pensions have elected to live away from the homestead area and two of these have now been identified as living at Hattie Creek. These pensioners would be given a preference in occupying the cottages should they wish to live at the new homestead site. </para>

              <para>A comprehensive survey ot mineral .-.and resources of the northern cost of New South Wales and of the southern coast of Queensland was conducted by the Bureau of Mineral Resources in 1948-50 with the purpose of investigating the potential of the industry. This survey did not cover the Coo loo la area. The results of the survey were published as Bulletin No. 28 - Beach-Sand Heavy-Mineral Deposits of Eastern Australia.

However, these estimates have been superseded because (hey were based on a cut-off grade of about 4 per cent by weight of heavy mineral, which was reasonable in 1950, whereas increase in prices and in the efficiency of the industry since that date have lowered the cutoff grade to about 1 per cent heavy minerals and consequently greatly increased reserves. Reserve figures by individual mining companies have recently been collated by the Bureau and, on the basis of an average cut-off grade of about 1 per cent heavy minerals, these reserves along the east coast (including the Coo loo la area) total about5.8 million tons of rutile with an equivalent tonnage of zircon.

          <para>Note (1)- Denmark- In Denmark, voters who cannot without excessive difficulty present themselves at  a  polling station within the limits set for voting may for Lower House elections register their votes in accordance with the regulations. Voters domiciled in Denmark may register their votes at a Registry Office including that in the municipality in which they are listed on the Electoral Roll. Voting by inmates of certain public or private hospitals, certain nursing or convalescent homes is conducted by the local Registry Office at the hospital or institution. Voters residing outside the borders of the country may register their votes at a Danish diplomatic or consular post abroad or at the home of a person authorised by the Minister for the Interior. Voting in Denmark under these provisions may take place at the earliest three weeks before the holding of the elections and at the latest on the week day nearest polling day. Voting abroad may take place at the earliest three months before polling day. </para>
          <para>Note (2) - Norway - Norwegian legislation provides that a voter who will be prevented from personal attendance at the booths on polling day by absence from the constituency on polling day, official functions within the constituency or hospitalisation, has, in conformity with the provisions of the relevant Act the right to cast his vote in advance by delivering his ballot-paper to a vote receiver in or outside his constituency. Advance voting must not take place prior to the 18th day before polling day nor later than 8 p.m. on the day before polling day but must in any case take place early enough to enable the vote receiver to ensure that the ballot-paper reaches the returning officials of the constituency in question before the closure of polling. Persons who expect to be outside the Kingdom on polling day may cast their votes before departure or abroad. Provision is also made for voting aboard Norwegian ships in which case the owner of the ship is responsible for ensuring that balloting equipment is immediately forwarded to the master of the ship. </para>
          <para>Note (3) - Sweden - Under the Swedish Parliamentary Elections Act and the Municipal Elections Act a person entitled to vote who. owing residence abroad or at another place within the. Kingdom, or for other reason is prevented from voting on election day at the polling station for the electoral district in which be is entered in the electoral register, may vote at a post office within the Kingdom, at  a  Swedish diplomatic or consular mission or on a Swedish vessel in foreign trade. In' the case of a person eligible to vole who is' within the Kingdom but outside the electoral district for which he is enrolled, voting may take place at  a  post office during the 30 days preceding and including election day. Temporary post offices can be  set  up in hospitals, old peoples homes, prisons or other similar institutions but voting  at  such temporary  post offices may take place only during the 7 days preceding and including election day. A Swedish citizen who has moved abroad and who is no longer registered for census purposes in Sweden may, on application, be recorded on the electoral register which entitles him to take part in elections  if  he (a) complies with the Riksdag Act and (b) has had his name entered in a parish register in Sweden at any time during the 5 calendar years preceding the year in which the electoral register is compiled. For persons thus eligible voting may sake place at Swedish diplomatic and consular missions as from the 30th day, and on a Swedish vessel as from the 45th day prior to the date of the election until the date on which voles shall be dispatched to the National Board of Civic Registration and Tax Collection. </para>

If the petition is granted, a numbered certificate (proxy-identity card) will be  issued authorising the proxy voter to vote and the name of the proxy voter will be recorded. The fact that the voter is not permitted to vote will be recorded on the electoral roll. When voting, the proxy voter hands his identity card to the  chairman  of the polling committee. The second member of the committee will sign the card and record that the proxy voter has attended the polling booth. The proxy voter has the same rights and duties as the voter. </para>

When the activity is conducted by a pilot holding an unrestricted private licence and no remuneration is received by the pilot or operator, the activity is classified under the Air Navigation Regulations as a private operation. Under the Air Navigation Regulations aircraft arc required to maintain a minimum height of 1500 feet over built-up areas and 500 feet over other areas. Some dispensations are granted in the former case to responsible and qualified pilots to facilitate their particular tasks. Aircraft operating simultaneously in the same general area are separated by 500 feet. </para>

            <para>In the context of the honourable senator's question, it would appear that he is referring to the highly toxic radioactive waste remaining after spent fuel is processed rather than the spent fuel itself. The latter presents only a minor problem of safe storage while awaiting reprocessing for the recovery of the remaining uranium and plutonium in the fuel. </para>
            <para>It will be many years before we accumulate sufficient fuel to justify a fuel reprocessing plant. As a result no decision has been made on possible sites for storing the wastes arising from such a plant. Certainly no official statement has been made that this waste will be buried in the Northern Territory or North Queensland. </para>

M.H.A., was coming to Madang and that he was arranging a Pang Pat i meeting at which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Somare</inline> would speak. The enquirer asked whether it would be in order to place notices of the meeting around the town on posts, trees etc. The District Commissioner said that only a few weeks earlier he had circularised all associations and clubs (viz Lions Club. Apex Club. Rotary Club. Horticultural Society. Musical Society. CWA. Yacht Club, Gun Club. Small Bore and Rifle Club. </para>
          <para>Soccer Club, Rugby League Club, Motor Cycle Club, Sports and Social Club) in Madang saying that, before notices were exhibited around the town, permission should be obtained and that notices should be removed when the event was over.  The  District Commissioner then said that he preferred notices not to be placed indiscriminately on trees and posts as there were public notice boards on which notices could be placed. He did not, however, forbid the posting of notices. The enquirer told the District Commissioner that he would have the notices put on the notice boards. At no time was the District Commissioner asked for permission to hold the meeting and at no time did he state that the holding of the meeting required his permission. </para>
          <para>It is relevant that shortly before sending out the circular the District Commissioner had been asked by the  President  of the Madang Local Government Council to take action with respect to the indiscriminate notices.

      <quote>
        <para>Has the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry been drawn to the extensive damage caused by frost to cereal crops in the southern Murray-Mallee area  in  South Australia? Experts have estimated that the expected barley yield of 3.5 million bushels will be cut to 500,000 bushels, that approximately 10 per cent of the sultana and wine grape crops have been affected and that the wheat yield will  be  affected. Will the Minister ask the Government to extend to the growers affected by this disaster the same assistance that is extended to those entitled to drought relief. </para>

      <para>The Minister for Primary Industry has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question: </para>
      <para>The  long standing policy of the Commonwealth in these matters is clear cut and  is  well recognised by the States. It is that the responsibility for any financial assistance as the result of damage  to  crops rests solely with the States. It is only when major disasters occur that the Commonwealth  is  prepared to consider the provision of assistance  to  a State for the purpose of relief measures. </para>

The Association wished to increase the interest rates on all policy loans to the rate charged on new loans and offered existing borrowers the alternative courses of agreeing to pay interest at the rate fixed from time to time by the Association for policy loans or of repaying their loans. This is a matter between the Association and the borrowers concerned.

          <para>The Government does not Interfere in. or arbitrate  on,  what are essentially commercial negotiations between the parties directly concerned with the commercial contracts involved  - the  shippers and shipowners. </para>
          <para>The Trade Practices Act  is  designed to provide a framework within which these negotiations  can  take place between the Conference and the appropriately constituted Shipper Body-  in  this  case  the Australia to Europe Shippers Association or AES. and also to provide safeguards to ensure that the Conference provide an adequate, economic and efficient service. </para>
          <para>In this trade, protracted negotiations took place. As  a  result, from a much higher overall starting point, the Conference, eventually came down to increases of  4  per cent for the predominant cargo, wool, and 10 per cent for other cargoes (excluding fresh fruit and close weight cargoes which are covered by individual contracts). The recent increase in basic freight rates to U.K./Europe was the first since  1966.  In that period there has been  a  weighted average increase  of  freights over  all  cargoes in the trade of only about  4}  per cent. In the same period costs of  all  kinds outside the control of the Australian Government or of the shipping companies have risen markedly. </para>
          <para>It has not been suggested to me by AESA that the negotiations were not conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Trade Practices Act. Nor has it been suggested to me from any source that the Conference service in question is not adequate, efficient or economic as required by the Act. </para>

          <para class="block">The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:  fi) On 9th October 1969 the Minister foi Trade and Industry, in his election policy speech as leader of the Australian Country Party, said: it is now a policy objective of the Country Party that Commonwealth funds should be made available, through the State Governments, as a contribution to the costs in the smaller centres of population, of such amenities as swimming pools, child-care centres, civic centres and showgrounds, playing fields and the like.' This has not yet been adopted as Government policy by the Government. </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>and (3) As local authorities are constituted and function under State laws, it is relevant that real progress has been made in recent months towards substantially improving the financial position nf the States. In fact, it is estimated that the new financial assistance arrangements for the 5 years beginning 1970-71 will result in an increase of some $790m in the revenue funds available io the States compared with their position if the previous arrangements for revenue assistance had continued unaltered. At the discretion of the States, some of these increased funds may. of course, he directed towards local government authorities. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>The problems facing the rural sector, with consequent effects on rural municipalities, are well recognised and the Government is helping to alleviate these problems through a range of policies. Some measure of the Government's direct assistance to the rural sector can be gained from the fact that in the 1970-71 Budget, bounties and direct payments to rural industries are estimated to total $21 5m out of total payments to all industry of $272m. Substantial Government assistance has. moreover, been provided through such measures as taxation concessions and contributions to agricultural research, farm extention programme; and finds for market promotion. The Government has also acted to ensure the availability of favourable rural credit facilities. </para>

The Minister for Trade and Industry has now supplied me with the following answer: </para>
      <quote>
        <para>Under the Industrial Research and Development Grants Act the Government provides Australian manufacturing and mining companies with an incentive to spend more on research and development. Grant-, are paid in relation to an increase in a company's own expenditure in circumstances where the Australian Industrial Research and Development Grants Board, which administers the scheme, is satisfied that the company has met all the Act's requirements. </para>
        <para>The main purpose of the Act i.s lo stimulate an increase in the overall level of industrial research and development performed by Australian industrial companies. </para>
        <para>While acknowledging Am on occasions worthwhile research can be carried out by nonprofessional teams, the Government was conscious of the need to ensure that the funds available for grants were used in the mount productive manner. </para>
        <para>The Act therefore aimed, by a few simple rules, to ensure that the work assisted could be generally expected to be of a high standard. The Act requires that lobe eligible for assistance the industrial research and development must be undertaken on a full-time basis and by. or under the supervision of, a professionally qualified person. </para>
        <para>The company referred to by the honourable senator did apply to the Board for a grant. On a preliminary examination of the company's application it was found that the company did not meet the Act's requirements relating to professional qualifications and was therefore ineligible for a grant. Consequently, there was no need for the application to be subjected to full investigation by the Board to determine whether or not the professional qualification requirement was the only ground on which the company was ineligible for a grant. </para>
        <para>The operation of the Act is now under review to determine the. future form and extent of the Government's assistance to industry in this field. All the points of concern about the provisions of the Act which have been drawn to the Government's attention will be fully considered in this review. </para>

            <para>- by leave - Earlier this evening I indicated that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> would be making a statement in the other place. I now have a copy of the statement made by the Prime Minister, lt is very brief. When I use the first person personal pronoun it refers to the Prime Minister. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I  recently spoke  to  the nation  on  the state  of the  economy and on the likely  inflationary  effects of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission's award  of a  6 per cent increase in wages and salaries.  I  said then that in order  to  decide what action should be taken now, Cabinet had sought to discover the areas in which demand seemed to be growing most strongly. One of those areas is the public sector - spending by governments - and we believe one of the first lines  of  attack on rising costs and prices should be  to  restrict what is being spent in that area. </para>
          <para>When our Budget was introduced last August it was estimated that total Commonwealth expenditure would be $7. 883m. I should say here, I think, that although called Commonwealth expenditure, this amount included $2, 708m for reimbursement grants and other payments to the States. Indeed, such payments made up  more than one-third of the Commonwealth Budget. The total increase was 11.2 per cent more than the year before. But since that Budget was formulated the Government has been faced with significant additional expenditure. The national wage case decision and other wage determinations are estimated to add directly, in the rest of this financial year, S88m to the Commonwealth's own wage and salary bill in 1970- 71. In addition, those wage determinations, because they nave led to an increase in average wages greater than what was expected, will require the Commonwealth to pay an additional $20m to the States under the formula between the Commonwealth and the States. In addition, we will need to pay some $58m to the States in this financial year to recompense them for the loss of the receipts duty tax on which they had budgeted. Mainly as a result of these outlays, payments to the States are now expected to exceed the Budget estimates by some $83m, and emergency payments associated with recent Moods will doubtless increase the outlays required. </para>
          <para>Other additional demands on our resources since the Budget was brought down include the provision of $12m as a capital advance to the Australian Wool Commission, and we believe some $6m will be required this financial year for rural debt reconstruction and farm adjustment. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir KENNETH</inline>ANDERSONAs soon as I get them I will make them available. I cannot do any better than that. We must also expect increases in costs of the material used by the Government. So all in all, it is estimated by the Treasury that the net increase in expenditure since the Budget was prepared will amount to approximately $242m, if departments were provided with the sums they have asked for. This is the background against which we have decided that we should make reductions in what would otherwise have been spent. </para>
          <para>Having made a complete and detailed survey of Commonwealth expenditures, we propose to reduce the amounts which departments have sought by some $75m in the remaining months of this financial year. These reductions are' made across the whole range of Commonwealth departments, but they do not involve any reductions in our payments to the States. Our object has been to effect reductions in the Commonwealth expenditures for its own purposes. We have not sought to achieve this at the expense of the States. A dissection of the reduction of $75m as between the main categories of Commonwealth expenditure is provided in a table which, with the concurrence of honourable members, I incorporate in Hansard. </para>
          <para class="block">
            <graphic href="047232197102160_39_13.jpg" />
          </para>
          <para>Further details of the various reductions will be provided as necessary by individual Ministers. Thew reductions are spread right across the board, but it will be observed thai the areas where the more substantial savings have been made are defence, capital works and capital advances. and departmental running expenses. We were particularly anxious to effect economies in administrative expenditure, including the overtime and salary expenditures of Commonwealth departments. At the same time we have endeavoured to avoid reducing expenditures on essential development activities. In more general terms, we have sought to reduce the contribution of Commonwealth expenditures to total demand and to curb the Commonwealth's demands on the labour market. </para>
          <para>Thus the reductions in departmental expenditures will involve restraint on Public Service employment. The Public Service Board reported to me that a routine statistical projection made prior to my instructions indicated an increase in 1970-71, in full-time employment under the Public Service Act, of 4.6 per cent on the numbers employed as at 30th June 1970.In 1969- 70 the comparable increase was 4.8 per cent, whilst the increase in total civilian and defence forces employment in the community was 4 per cent. The Board advised me that my instructions for restraint on establishment increases could benefit the health and soundness of administration in the Commonwealth Service, and it suggested that a limitation should be placed on the increase in Service employment. </para>
          <para>The Public Service Board has now reported to me that in its discussions with departments, it has stressed the Government's policy of restraint but has not endeavoured to impose arbitrary cuts in employment. The Board's recommendation, which has been accepted, was that departmental increases in employment, which will be kept to the minimum, should not exceed at 30th June 1971 an overall increase in the Service of 3.4 per cent as compared with numbers employed under the Public Service Act on 30th June 1970. This is a reduction of about 25 per cent on the projected increase in employment disclosed in the Board's earlier survey. Put another way, the Board's original projection was that the Service would grow by 10.534 in 1970-71. This growth has been cut by 2,735. </para>
          <para>The Commonwealth has, I believe, moved quickly and firmly in the area available to it. It is necessary to do so. For, as we see it, the best interests of the community require that inflation shall be overcome, and one of the first steps to this end must be action to restrain our own expenditures. </para>

            <inline font-style="italic">I do so</inline>for the purpose of debating a matter of urgency, namely: </para>
          <para>The need foi the immediate introduction of the necessary legislation to provide for increases in the rates of Social Service payments-Aged, Invalid and Widows' Pensions - to a level compatible wilh the minimum needs of the recipients, the total inadequacy of the present level of payments having been further exposed and now to be exacerbated by the judgment in the National Wage Case. </para>
          <para class="block">This is the first opportunity the Democratic Labor Party has had to move an urgency motion without having to depend on the support of a senator or senators from outside the Party. That changed position is due, of course, to an increase in the number of DLP senators since the recent Senate election. The DLP is now able to comply with the Standing Orders concerning urgency motions. </para>
          <para>The matter that has been proposed for discussion tonight' is in connection with allowances paid to the pensioners of Australia. I am confident that no senator will dispute that the matter is one of urgency which merits immediate action by the Government This is not a new concern of mine or my Party's, ft is not something that has suddenly occurred to us overnight. Anyone who cares to peruse or read the speeches I have made since my election to the Senate and those of my colleagues will observe the continuing interest and concern that we have had for pensioners and those unable 10 obtain a pension because of the iniquitous means test. I nave raised the subject during every Budget debate and I have participated in the debate on every social services Bill dealing with pensions. The DLP wants action on the pensions question. Because we believe that it is one of the most important domestic problems facing Australia, we expect early action by the Government. </para>
          <para>We hope, during this debate, to place the spotlight on the inadequate pension rate, the anomalies in the system existing at present, the injustices in the means test and the failure of the Government in this sphere. When Mt Wentworth, the present Minister for Social Services, was appointed to that position we hoped that the pensioner would be given a better deal. That hope was based on the statements and speeches made by him when he was a private member. He frequently criticised the means test and the inadequacy of the pension rates. But his performance has not lived up to expectations. Either he has been muzzled by Cabinet or he has been disregarded by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> and the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bury),</inline> because since his appointment no marked improvement has been effected in the pension rates or in the means test. lt is true that there have been minor variations of the rates here and there - $1 in 1968, SI in 1969 and 50c in 1970. 1 regard the miserable 50c that was provided for pensioners in the 1970 Budget as  a  deliberate and definite freeze of pensions, lt was clearly intended to be a freeze of pensions. There has been no evidence 10 the contrary up to now, notwithstanding the fact that the Government has become acquainted with the 1.9 per cent increase in the cost of living in the last quarter of 1970 and the fact that the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission declared an overall 6 per cent rise in wages and salaries, in addition to the indirect taxation imposed by  the  Government itself in the last Budget. All of that has had and will have the effect of eroding the purchasing power of the pittance paid to pensioners. Apart from the amounts 1 have mentioned, the Government has done nothing to lift the pensioner to a position where his pension rate is really adequate. Those amounts were intended only to offset increases in the cost of living. We want to see the position of  the  pensioner lifted so that he will not he asked to continue to live as a pauper, chasing the specials or going without the things which might make his life more livable. </para>
          <para>Then there was the introduction of the tapered means test in 1969. That was a move in the right direction, I will concede. But it introduced an element of unfair discrimination. It debarred a section of pensioners from receiving the fringe benefits normally given to all pensioners. They were not only debarred from Commonwealth fringe benefits, but the State and local government authorities also denied them fringe benefits because they were not entitled to a full pension. I have said  before  and I repeal now that the means test is iniquitous and  imposes  a penalty on thrift. It has become even more iniquitous in this era of growing inflation, because inflation severely affects people on fixed incomes who were thrifty enough in their working lives and were prepared to provide for their old age to some extent. They find now that their savings are eroded because of inflation. They find that the sum they thought sufficient to maintain them in a reasonable condition is being whittled away by increased costs of living and transport, and other increased charges with which they are faced. The amount they thought would be sufficient has proved to be insufficient. The purchasing power of their savings has been eroded, yet the means test is still applied. </para>
          <para>Inflation and the means test have caused many people to wonder whether they would have been better off to spend and not to save during their years of employment, thereby making themselves eligible for a pension. All honourable senators are aware of people who had a small reserve which prevented them qualifying for a pension and decided to spend that reserve on tours. Those people are not anxious to travel but they can see that what they have must be expended before they can qualify for a pension. That situation is cultivated by the present system of social services. It is contrary to the best interests of individuals and Australia. </para>
          <para>Pensioners today are. as badly off as they were under the last Australian Labor Party Government. That is an undeniable and indisputable fact. I invite honourable senators to compare present rates of pension and those paid by the last ALP Government with average weekly earnings, making allowance for the fringe benefits that pensioners enjoy today but did not receive from the last ALP Government. That comparison supports the statement I have made. In 1945 single age pensioners were paid 32s 6d a week. In today's currency that is $3.25. In 1947 they were paid $3.75 and today they are paid $15.50. Obviously in the intervening period there has been a fall in the real value of money. One cannot buy today for 50c the same amount of goods or services that could be obtained in 1947 for 5s. Therefore these rates of payment must be compared with another figure to establish a true comparison. This result can be achieved by relating pension rates to what the Commonwealth Statistician calls the average weekly earnings per employed male unit in Australia. </para>
          <para>Last year, following the pension increase of 50c in the Budget bringing the single age pension to $15.50 a week, that pension represented 19.1 per cent of average weekly earnings. In 1947 the single age pension represented 24.0 per cent. Clearly there has been a decrease in the pension as a proportion of average weekly earnings from 24 per cent to 19 per cent. But it would be grossly unfair to end the story at that point. In the years of the Liberal-Country Party Government since 1949 a number of significant fringe benefits have been made available to pensioners. The major fringe benefits I have in mind are the medical and pharmaceutical benefits. </para>
          <para>It would be a task beyond my capacity to evaluate those fringe benefits monetarily, but I am quite certain in my mind that they would equal the 5 per cent difference established by the comparison I have made if not more. Therefore I believe that there is truth in my claim that pensioners today are as badly off as they were under the last ALP Government. Of course, I am conscious of the categories of pensioners. The first group of pensioners, and the ones about whom I am most concerned, are the aged people who, because of their advanced years and poor state of health, are unable to supplement their pensions. They rely wholly and solely on their pensions. Another group of pensioners consists of those who are willing to work if they can get jobs suitable to their capacities and abilities. Because of advanced years and failing health these people experience great difficulty in securing suitable employment. They are limited by their capacity to work. Was it ever intended that a woman of 60 years or more should be required to seek employment to enable her to supplement an inadequate pension? </para>

Last year, following the pension increase of 50c in the Budget - that great freeze of the pensions - a great public reaction occurred, not from pensioners alone but from almost every citizen of </para>

          <para class="block">Australia. They registered their protests in some form or other and are continuing to register their protests at the inhuman approach of the present Government to the widows and the aged and invalid in our community. </para>
          <para>Ever since the formation of the Democratic Labor Party we have advocated and pressed for the introduction of a contributory national insurance scheme to cover the aged, to provide for the widow of the breadwinner and to provide for our people in times of sickness and hospitalisation. Our ultimate policy remains firm. But we are also realists. We recognise that the entire social welfare system cannot be changed overnight. Pending the introduction of any new scheme we have called for pension rates to be increased to a more realistic level, the extension of fringe benefits to all pensioners and the abolition of the means test for all pensioners particularly for those over 75 years of age. We contend that the Government should raise pensions immediately. If it was really just, it would make the payment at the increased rate retrospective, if not to the date of the last Budget in August of last year, when the pensioners should have received more than a miserable. 50c, at least to the beginning of the calendar year 1971, after which date the Government became aware of a marked increase of 1.9 per cent in the cost of living in the previous quarter. I believe that it was then that the Government, became aware of the inflationary trend. </para>
          <para>Now it has been suggested, seriously, that pensions and allowances cannot be increased because that would add to the inflationary trend. The interpretation f put on that statement is that the Government is content to allow the pensioners to carry the burden of the inflationary evil which has come upon us and which has been contributed to by the Government itself. That statement could be interpreted to mean also that the Government is content to allow the pensioners to live in their stale of penury because the economy might be disturbed by a dispensation of justice to the aged, the invalid and the widowed. The Government should raise pensions immediately. lt must have other effective means of correcting this inflationary trend of which it has become aware in recent times only. If the Government claims that inflation prevents it from increasing pensions immediately, I repeal that it is singling out the pensioner for unfair treatment. Pensioners needed increased rates even before inflation became a real menace, or became apparent, at least to the Government. </para>
          <para>The Government cannot escape some blame for the inflationary trend. The S280m tax rebate in 1970, which was much in excess of what had been promised, and the growth of bureaucracy have both contributed to inflation. Governments, federal and State, have given no lead in arresting the inflationary trend. In 1969 we had before this chamber the Judiciary Bill by which the salary of the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia was increased from §24.000 - a real bread-line salary - to $30,000. That was an increase of $6,000. In 1965, 4 years earlier, his salary had been increased from $20,000 to $24,000. Yet in 1 969 he was given also a non-taxable allowance of $2,000. At that time the salary of a justice of the High Court was increased from $21,000 to $27,000 and. in addition, each justice was given a nontaxable allowance of $1,500. The salaries for judges of the Commonwealth Industrial Court, the Federal Court of Bankruptcy, the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory, and for presidential members of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission were increased by $5,000 with a nontaxable allowance of SI. 000. The Chief Judge and President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission received an increase in salary of $5,000 with a nontaxable allowance of SI .500. </para>
          <para>In 1970 the salary for the Commissioner of the Export Payments Insurance Corporation was increased to $16,931. for the Assistant Directors of the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation the salary was increased to $15,592 and for the Director of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority it was increased to $1.1,822. At that time. I said that these increases would trigger inflation. The consequence has been that all the high bracket public servants have helped themselves to big increases in salaries. The States, which are always crying for money from the Commonwealth, also have offended in this direction to a great extent. Victorian Parliamentarians recently gave themselves a salary increase of 20 per cent. 1 recommend that Queensland State Ministers should curtail their frequent pilgrimages abroad and that the Premier, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen.</inline> might consider cancelling the order he has placed for an aircraft costing $170,000 and the appointment of a full time lady pilot. All these actions have done nothing to emphasise the need for economy in the inflationary era which has arisen. </para>
          <para>If the Governments failed to give a lead, who could blame the trade union movement for going to the courts seeking an improvement in wages? But the point that I want to make tonight is that everybody appears to be able to improve his own salary and the trade unions are able to get recognition from the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, but nobody seems to be concerned about the pensioners, the poorest section of our community, particularly those who rely wholly and solely on the pensions that they receive. Surely the Government will not wait until August and the next parliamentary session, to remedy this injustice. Surely the Government is not so inhuman that it will ask the pensioners to persevere and to continue to live on this inadequate allowance. Its value, of course, is being eroded because of the increased cost of living, higher transport charges and taxi fares - al! those things which are prohibitive to pensioners. In many centres where public transport is not available old sick people have to walk if they require to go to hospital. Yet we are told that any increase in pensions will only add to the inflationary evil. </para>
          <para>In this country which we claim to be progressive, democratic and Christian, a country which is relatively affluent and rich, can any one of us go to bed at night and rest knowing the injustice that is being perpetuated against a section of our people, most of whom have contributed greatly to the development and progress of this country and have made possible the conditions which we enjoy today? I have outlined what I believe to be the facts about the position of pensioners in Australia. I have only half an hour at my disposal to make this speech. I did not very much appreciate the intrusion into the business of the Senate of a statement that could have been read tomorrow.

            <para>(10.3) - I rise to speak to the motion brought before the Senate by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> and his supporters. All of us are concerned, of course, about people in need and all of us at all times wish to help them whenever we can. I believe this Government over the years has demonstrated its concern by the assistance it has given to these people. I think it appropriate for me at this point to remind honourable senators of what is available to pensioners today from Commonwealth sources and to mention the part played by Liberal and Country Party governments in developing the present comprehensive range of benefits and services. Year after year since Liberal and Country Party governments first took office they have reviewed social services. They have increased the basic rate of pension on no less than 15 occasions in the case of single pensioners and on 14 occasions in the case of married pensioners in order to bring their respective base rates to Si 5.50 and $27.50 a week. I say, very deliberately, that these governments have constantly reviewed these matters because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> implied that this Government has not concerned itself with the problems of pensioners. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Liberal and Country Party governments have recognised that, there are groups of pensioners with special needs requiring special consideration. I remind the Senate that this was the reason for the introduction in 1958 of supplementary assistance for single pensioners who were entirely dependent upon their pensions and were paying rent. The rate of supplementary assistance now is $2 a week and the conditions of eligibility have been considerably improved since 1958. Honourable senators will remember that I introduced into the </para>
          <para class="block">Senate legislation to give effect to the dwellings for single age pensioners scheme. That legislation was specifically brought in to assist single age and eligible pensioners who had no other income than their pension. It is good to know that this scheme is progressing and units are being provided for these people. Approval has been given for more units to be made available throughout Australia, in rural and in metropolitan areas. The fact that S25m is to be made available over 5 years - 1969 to 1974 - will assist in housing these people, lt was recognised that this was one of the areas in which there was a great deal of need. Single eligible people with no income other than their pension were paying rent far beyond what they could afford. This scheme was designed to assist one of these very special areas. </para>
          <para>Another group of pensioners whose position has engaged the attention of the Government consists of those with children in their custody, care and control. When the Liberal and Country Party Government came into office in 1949 a pensioner with more than one child received no additional cash assistance for the second and subsequent children in his or her care. Let us contrast that situation with the situation today. Not only has the Government introduced an additional pension, which is now S3. 50 per week, for each child or student child after the first for all pensioners, but it has also legislated for a guardian's allowance - called in this case a mother's allowance, for widow pension - of up to S6 per week for single and widowed pensioners with the care of one or more children. At present S2.50 per week is paid for the first or only child of all pensioners. </para>
          <para>The marked improvement in the position of the single or widowed pensioner with children can best be illustrated perhaps by reference to the case of a widow pensioner wilh. say. 3 children. The maximum cash assistance available to such a woman under the Social Services Act today by way of pension and supplementary payments is S33 per week excluding child endowment. When the Libera! and Country Party Government took office in 1949 a woman in similar circumstances would have been receiving a pension of '"54.75 a week. Surely al! these things show a tremendous improvement over that period of time. </para>

              <para>- If the honourable senator listens to me he will receive all that information, lt will prove the point about which he is interested. Other special groups are recognised in provisions introduced by this Government. I refer to such matters as the extension of benefits in respect of student children up to 21 years of age who are in the care of age, invalid or widow pensioners. There is the provision for dual payment for up to 12 weeks to the survivor when one of a pensioner couple dies. I believe every honourable senator recognises that this is of great assistance in this very real area of need. Then there is the payment of the standard rate to certain married pensioners who have to live apart for health reasons. Wc know there are cases where a husband or a wife may bc in hospital or in a nursing home. This is a matter which was causing very real concern, lt was another area of great need which deserved some special consideration. This matter was looked at and assistance given. </para>

          <para>Reference has been made tonight to the means test. I think this is something which should be looked at because under the means test pensioners are allowed a substantial amount of income and 'or property before the base pension or the additional payments I have already mentioned are affected. I shall refer to the effect of (he Government's liberalisations of the means test later on in my speech, lt is interesting to note - this is a point to which I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cant</inline> was referring earlier  -  the improvement which has been achieved in the real value of pensions since the Government came to office. When this Government came to office in 1949 the base pension was S4.25 a week. Had this pension been varied in accordance with movements in the consumer price index it would be §10.33 a week now instead of the $15.50 a week - single pension - or SI 3.75 a week - married person - now payable. Thus the real value of the single pension has increased bv some 50 per cent since 1949. </para>
          <para>Under the Gorton Government increases in the age pension have also more than kept pace with increases in prices. When the Gorton Government took office in January 196S the single age pension was §13 a week and the married age pension was SI 1.75 a week. The consumer price index for the December quarter of 1967  -  the quarter immediately preceding the date the Gorton Government took office - was 103.0. The index for the December quarter of 1970  -  the latest available - was 114. To maintain the real value of the January 1968 pension the weekly rates of the single pension would be $14.39 and for a married person it would be $13. Having regard to the increases which have been provided in subsequent budgets, weekly increases of $2.50 and $2 have been made in the standard and married rates respectively, bringing their present levels to $15.50 and $13.75 a week respectively. Thus the increases have significantly exceeded the amounts required to maintain the real value of the January 1968 pension. </para>

              <para>- I would reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> by saying that this Government's interest in all fields of social services is shown by the record of what it has done for the people. The Government's performances in the field of social services should be judged not upon who is or is not in the chamber at present but upon the record of its achievements. 1 wish to continue discussing the new benefits which have been introduced and the widening of eligibility for some of the existing benefits. This Government introduced in 1956 the payment of an additional pension for children after the first and subsequently provision was made for extending the payment in respect of student children. The supplementary assistance allowance was introduced in 195S, the mother's allowance was introduced in 1963 and the guardian's allowance was introduced in 1965. These allowances have been paid to single and widow pensioners with children. In 1965 there was a further extension of the eligibility for the wife's allowance to include cases where the pensioner husband is not an invalid but where there is a child. This allowance was payable previously only where the pensioner husband was an invalid. I think that in itself shows a realisation of an area of need in which this Government has assisted. Honourable senators are no doubt well aware of the sheltered employment allowance. This allowance was introduced in 1967 to assist invalid pensioners employed in sheltered workshops and it has been of very great assistance to these people. </para>

              <para>- That is a good idea. 1 will do that. 1 think it also necessary to look at the need which exists in the field of housing. The Government has been of great assistance in providing dwellings for aged persons. In this respect I think that recognition should be given to the church and charitable bodies which have given care and attention to providing housing assistance for aged persons. Honourable senators are no doubt aware that the aged persons homes scheme has been in operation for some years now. The subsidy was originally on the basis of $1 for $1. but it was increased to $2 for Si because the Government recognised that there was a great need in this area. This, of course, has meant that all over Australia - as far away as Alice Springs or as close as one's nearest suburb - there are now homes for aged persons under the aged persons homes scheme. This is taking away from these people the fear of being alone and uncured for - -the fear of insecurity. Assistance is now being given in this very important area, f am sure all honourable senators will agree with me when I say that this is a very important area. This Government is providing more and more assistance in this field and more and more homes are being built to meet this need. </para>

              <para>- I. am talking about the areas in which these homes have been built. Some of them have been built in the honourable senator's own State of Victoria. I think I have already given in this chamber a list of the places in which the building of these homes has been approved under the dwellings for aged pensioners scheme and in which 578 units will be available. Let me go on to speak a little more about other forms of assistance. The hearing aid service is one. These fringe benefits all add up and are of tremendous importance. If honourable senators opposite are concerned about, pensioners and about what is being done for them they should be interested in fringe benefits. Fringe benefits are important to pensioners. Another fringe benefit is the training scheme for widow pensioners. I believe that this has given to many widowed people not only great pleasure in being able to be trained to do something that they wish to do but confidence in themselves., a feeling that they can be secure again and take a new interest in life. The personal care subsidy for aged persons is much more than just the actual care; I believe that it is the person who gives the care who contributes greatly to the assistance. Is there anybody in this chamber who does not agree with me when I say that the Meals on Wheels subsidy is another fringe benefit which is of great assistance? A nutritious, hot, good meal is being taken to the homes of pensioners under the Meals on Wheels scheme. All these benefits also have been introduced by this Government to assist pensioners. </para>

That was a most unfair statement. Many of the benefits to which I referred have been introduced since the present minister has been in office. I shall remind honourable senators of other fringe benefits that have been introduced. I refer to the pensioner medical service and to the nursing home benefits. These are of tremendous importance. I think it is almost impossible to assess in money terms how beneficial these are. As I proceed I shall give honourable senators an idea of what the benefits would average a week. </para>

              <para>- I think that comment detracts from what has been done. I am showing how the Government is endeavouring to assist these people and how it is introducing more and more benefits which cover a wide range. Not only has the actual pension rate been increased but also other benefits such as the nursing home benefits and the telephone, radio and television concessions have been made available. The Government has provided assistance in housing, which I have mentioned. Travel concessions are also available. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </interjection>
          <para>Honourable senators will recall that last year, when dealing with the Social Services Bill, 1 tabled details of the fringe benefits available to pensioners from both Commonwealth and State Government sources. I think it is important that honourable senators should acquaint themselves of the benefits which pensioners may receive. I pointed out then - and I refer to it again - that the value of these benefits to eligible pensioners averaged about $5 a week. It is worth emphasising, to remind honourable senators, that the figure was an average one and that it can be misleading. The value of fringe benefits in individual cases can be considerably more than the average figure. I am sure all honourable senators will appreciate this point. If a pensioner requires constant medical attention, which is provided under the pensioner medical service, this is a benefit which is of tremendous assistance to the pensioner. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gairs</inline> motion makes no mention of the amount of increase that he sees necessary to meet, as the motion puts it, the minimum needs of the recipients. It is easy to make sweeping statements about what should be done to benefit the community, or sections of it, in one way or another. It is also easy to overlook the matter of responsibility for finding the funds to give effect to these proposals. </para>
          <para>Last year, in connection with the Senate election, I read with interest what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> was reported as saying. I have only the Press reports on this. He was reported as saying that the pension rate should be increased immediately to half the minimum wage. Presumably that is still his view: I do not know. That is the point he made then. The existing minimum wage under Commonwealth awards is $46.40. Therefore his proposal would involve increasing nil pensions to $23.20 a week. Assuming the proposal relates to basic pension rates only - that is, disregarding additional pensions and allowances where there are children, about which I have informed the Senate already, as honourable senators will recall - the cost in respect of the number of age. invalid and widow pensions current at the beginning of this year is estimated to be $443m a year. It should bp noted, too - and I think it is important that we should note these figures because we have a responsibility to do so - that an increase in pension on the scale mentioned would enable a number of persons at present ineligible because of means to qualify for a pension, but the number and cost involved cannot be assessed accurately. </para>
          <para>Typically, no mention appears to have been made of the source of the funds from which the heavily increased charge for pensions would have to be found. All of us would like lobe able to spend more on social welfare and on the other activities of government. As we all recognise, our desires for increased expenditure must be limited by the funds available. I think that those of us who appreciate these points recognise that this Government has a very fine record in the field of social services, it has a record of a continuing review of all areas of social services, lt has done a very fine service in the areas of special need. This Government will continue to study these matters. It will continue to be concerned with the needs of the people and with the areas of special need. </para>

They arc benefits additional to the pension rates. These additional benefits are tremendously important. They are not be be disregarded.

              <para>- 1 do not know what the tribal warfare is about so I cannot come in on the side of the right or on the side of the left. I shall continue. Tomorrow I shall read in Hansard what was said. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair,</inline> in the course of his speech, claimed that the pension should be a specific proportion of the average weekly earnings or that it should be adjusted in accordance with movements in average weekly earnings. In reply to my friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair.</inline> I say that no Commonwealth Government has ever accepted the proposition that the pension should be related to either criteria. The pension rate has always been determined in the light of the various commitments of the government and in the light of the revenues at its disposal. The record of this LiberalCountry Party Government since 1949 has illustrated and has proved that pensioners and their needs have always been given a high priority when available funds have been allocated among the various government responsibilities.I believe that that situation will continue. The Government's policy is <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> use available funds to the greatest advantage of the community as a whole. As honourable <inline font-style="italic">senators</inline> know, there are many competing commitments. These cannot be met in full without straining the economy unduly. The Government has examined with care the position of pensioners. At all times it. will continue to examine their position. It will continue to assess their position as and when it can. Honourable senators can be assured that pension increases have been granted at the maximum that could be prudently made. </para>

            <para>-  We in the Australian Labor Party support this motion. The motion is one to debate as a matter of urgency the proposition that there is a need for the immediate introduction of the necessary legislation to provide for increases in the rates of social service payments - aged, invalid and widows' pensions - to a level compatible with the minimum needs of the recipients. There is a reference to the total inadequacy of those being further exposed by the national wage case. We support the motion not on the basis that the national wage case gave any sum that was too great because that was merely some adjustment for the falling value of money. We do so on the basis that this is calling for a discussion in order to push for the immediate introduction of legislation to upgrade the social service pensions in this country. The judgment of this country is that the pensioners are not getting a fair go. That is the judgment not only of the Opposition Parties here but also of the churches and the other agencies to which the Minister for Housing <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Dame Annabelle Rankin)</inline> referred as themselves having to undertake the care of some of these persons who are depending on social services. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It does not matter What the Minister says about the fringe benefit.It is the basic pension which is inadequate. We know that pensions were increased only by some 3 per cent during a period when there was a 5 per cent inflation. We know that there is a heavy inflation continuing and that it has been produced in part by the actions of the Government. The Government introduced indirect taxation. It increased sales tax. It was not merely an increase in the amount of sales tax because the amount was being increased already by the inflation which was continuing. It actually increased the rate of sales tax by some 10 per cent from 25 per cent to 271/2 per cent over a whole range of commodities. The Government also increased the excise on another range of commodities which would inevitably affect the costs of goods and services throughout the community. On top of that by its directions to the Reserve Bank of Australia and through it to the other banks it pushed up the interest rates to a record high and it has maintained them at that level. Now what else could one have but inflation? </para>
          <para>The Government has been producing this inflation itself. Partly the inflation may be a response to world wide trends because inflation is going on in the United States of America, Great Britain, Germany, all over Europe and almost everywhere in the world. Some of the economists say that inflation is desirable. That is why it is extraordinary to hear some of the statements which we heard made tonight by the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson)</inline> when towards the end of his statement he said: </para>
          <quote>

            <para class="block">It is extraordinary, is it not, to hear these remarks from the very Government which was potent in producing the inflation by its own measures. The statement goes on: </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline>we know that inflation is not going to be overcome. If one were to over come inflation entirely this would be as destructive as over inflation because the world is moving at a rate of inflation. If this is the basis upon which the Government is going to proceed heaven help the community. We see that there is a cut back in various areas but no endeavour is made to do anything to relieve the position of the pensioners. The pensioners are not responsible for the inflation. It is not the pensioners who introduced indirect taxes. It is not the pensioners who increased interest rates to the highest level. It is not the pensioners who are neglecting to see to it that Arm action is taken against the restrictive practices which are admitted on all hands to be a powerful inflationary factor in the community. Who are the guilty people? The guilty people are members of the Liberal Party and Australian Country Party. There has been a combination of inaction by the Federal Attorney General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hughes)</inline> who has at last said that he will quicken up his review of the Trade Practices Act and the LiberalCountry Party Governments in the States which have resolutely refused lo introduce legislation as the Federal members of the Liberal Party have asked them to do. </para>
          <para>We have allowed the restrictive practices to go on in the community without any real check until 1 think even the Government is becoming frightened of what is happening in the field of restrictive practices. Those who indulge in those practices are able to go on unchecked. But somebody has to bear the brunt and that is thu people on the fixed incomes, the pen'sioners, super annuitants and others. This Government will not do anything to help them notwithstanding that they have done nothing to cause the inflation and they can do nothing to avoid the effects of it except look to the Government, the Government on behalf of which the Minister who has apparently now left the Chamber keeps on saying - we have heard it ever since she has been the Minister - how concerned she is as the pensioners go down the drain  is  do the other people whom the Government is supposed to look after. The honourable senator says the Government is actively concerned until it is like a record. One gets sick of hearing how concerned the Government is about these people. But we do not want concern to be expressed in this Chamber. What we want is some action. The obvious action lo deal with this problem is to introduce legislation to upgrade the basic pensions and at the same time to introduce into that legislation self acting machinery to see that this plight of the pensioners does not recur, ls that too much to suggest? lt is the policy of the Australian Labor Party that social security payments will be tied to a proportion of the average weekly earnings so that persons receiving benefits will receive automatic increases as either productivity increases or as other factors increase general prosperity or as inflation occurs. </para>

The Australian Labor Party is not the only one which has this view. Even the Republican President in the United States shares the same view. In one of his statements in 1969 he .said:  1 have requested an across-the-board increase of 10 per cent in Social Security benefits to compensate elderly Americans for the losses they are suffering because of an inflation they could do nothing either to prevent or avoid. In addition. I have proposed a new reform, an escalator in Social Security lo insure thai benefits will rise correspondingly whenever the cost of living  goes  up. When this reform is enacted, never again will those Americans least able lo alford it be made to bear the brunt ot inti at ion. These necessary steps can and should be taken by Congress before the end of this year. </para>

              <para>- Of course there may be a difference in detail, but there is a great difference, a gulf, between the views which have been expressed by my Party and others tonight and the Government's philosophy. The difference is that we consider that the pensioner should not have to bear the brunt of inflation. The Minister has made it clear that the Government has examined the position. She says: 'We have carefully examined the position of the pensioners.' She makes clear by her silence  that  nothing is going to be done to alleviate  that  position. </para>

              <para>- It would not be a bacl idea if some of those who are producing the inflation, such as those who are engaging in restrictive trade practices, were made to bear the brunt of it. It would not  be  a bad idea if the Government went across to Norfolk Island and started to deal with some of the tax lurks that are operating to a shocking extent in this community and to deal with some of the other ways in which people gain revenue. It would not be a bad idea if we got out of the Vietnam war, which is costing hundreds of millions of dollars and which is one of the most powerful factors in producing inflation in this community. It would not be a bad idea if the tremendous mineral resources of this country were utilised for the benefit of the people, as has been done in other countries such as Italy and Libya where they are making a great deal out of those resources, instead of their being handed over for a pittance, as ours were by this Government, in the legislation which was raced through just before the Senate election before last. </para>

          <para>There are many ways in which the Government could see to it that, with the immense resources of this country, which is one of the richest countries per head of population in the world, a fair go was given to the pensioners and those people who are not able to look after themselves. The Australian Labor Party will support the proposal because it is important that the question be looked at. There is no need to specify the exact increase, because the motion would not be capable of amendment. No amendment to it is proposed. We think that the matter ought to be discussed and that there ought to be immediate legislation. I do not propose to allow the honourable senators who brought forward this motion to escape without some criticism, because although they have rightly criticised the Government for adding to the inflation and leaving the pensioners to bear the brunt of it, who was it that voted with the Government to allow the indirect taxation which they mentioned to go through? It was the Democratic Labor Party. Who was it that voted with the Government to allow the imposts on posts and telegraphs? Who was it that allowed the Appropriation Bill to pass through this chamber in the last sittings of this Parliament? It was the Democratic Labor Party. Who was it that allowed the Judiciary Bill to pass through this chamber when the Australian Labor Party voted against it? The Democratic Labor Party did not vote against it. The DLP should not criticise measures for which it voted, ft not only voted for the measures but also supported the Government at the election by means of its preferences. </para>
          <para>I hope that what we are seeing now is a change of heart, that it is going to take a different attitude towards the Government of this country. What we need is what is set out in this motion. We need that immediate legislation. Tt ought to be introduced. Other corrective action should be taken also in the interests of the people of this country to overcome the unwise, inadequate and panic measures for which this Government has been responsible and for which it indicates it will be responsible in the future. 1 hope that joint action will be taken in this chamber to prevent the Government from indulging in measures which are against the interests of the pensioners and against the interests of the people. Therefore, on behalf of the Opposition, I indicate that we will support this motion and assist in bringing it to a vote instead of allowing it to lapse. </para>

            <para>- 1 rise tonight not to support this motion but to express a few views which I think have been expressed before but which obviously need to be repeated in answer to this motion. I was amazed to hear the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> say that he supports the Australian Democratic Labor Party because he agrees that the matter should be debated urgently. I see no reason for not agreeing if a subject of urgency needs to be debated. But that is not the bass of the motion. The motion is in the terms that we need the immediate introduction of necessary legislation to alter the pension rates. I do not agree with this. 1 deplore the fact that the pensioner, the person who is perhaps i little less well off than some others in the community, is being used for political purposes. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In his opening remarks tonight <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> himself said that this was the first time that the DLP had been able to move a motion of this type without having to seek support. In other words, the purpose of his moving this motion is to show the new found strength of the DLP. He is exploiting the pensioner in order to show the public that the DLP can now move a motion without seeking the support of somebody else. This is the wrong motive for debating in this chamber the needs of any one particular section of the community. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> gave us many reasons why the pensioner should not be exploited - I think they were his words - because of inflation. But. after all, is not the pensioner the person who will suffer quicker than anyone else if inflation does escalate? The Government's responsibility, and prime responsibility, is to consider all sections of the community, and this means the whole of Australia. The pensioner is a part of that whole. If we cannot control inflation at this present time the pensioner, along with all other people in the community, will stiffer. For this reason we are all sympathetic to the pensioner's plight; but we must control inflation first. I would be the first to support any move to increase pensions in the next Budget, if inflation is controlled by then. But I repeat that we must see that inflation is the first thing that we do control. </para>

              <para>- Inti at ion was not imminent at the time the judges' salaries were raised. Although this is not a factor in assessing judges' salaries here, in other countries corruption and bribery have entered into the law. I hope and pray that by giving judges the best of salaries we will continue to eliminate any bribery and corruption. 1 am not suggesting that it might creep in. I said that we must pay people properly for the jobs they do so that they are not tempted by such things. I am fully in support of good wages and salaries for the workers. I think that the Arbitration Commission has made a great mistake, in raising wages lo the extent to which it has done, but I do not entirely blame it for this. Probably employers have contributed to this inflationary trend by offering incentive wages for skill. It is unfortunate we have not sufficient skilled people but they are all contributing to the inflationary trends. </para>

          <para>Today I went to the religious ceremony to mark the opening of this Parliament and it interested me very much that one of the lessons was based around the story of the Good Samaritan and of Christ's message to the people to look after their neighbour and to love their neighbour as themselves. The servant was placed in the same light in the Good Samaritan story. In his sermon the preacher asked: 'Who is my neighbour?' Today we should be thinking about that ser man and asking ourselves: Who is our neighbour? Who are we concerned with in this Parliament? As the preacher said, our neighbour is everyone in need and there are many people in Australia in need. 1 would venture to say that most people in Australia have some need which they require the Government to consider. </para>

There are people who have a need in the field of drug abuse and the Government is paying attention to that aspect by making grants for education. There are needs of people overseas which are perhaps even greater than our pensioners' needs and we are contributing towards meeting their needs by our overseas aid. There are many people in need in Australia and  the  Government is paying attention to all those needs. </para>

              <para>- I said these were in addition to pensioners. Of course the pensioner is a neighbour and one who needs attention. As to the rise in pensions and the provision of fringe benefits over the years 1 do not need to repeat what the Minister and many of us have said on many occasions in this Senate. However, it suits certain people to forget those benefits to the pensioner in order to arouse the emotions of the people, ft is very easy to say that the poor pensioner is not getting a fair deal. I ask: Who pays for the extra things which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> is asking the Government to do? Who will pay for the abolition of the means test? Who will pay for many of the things he has asked for? The main payers will be the family man who has great needs himself and the young person who will probably pay into the taxation pool for 50 years before he qualifies for any of these benefits. He may never qualify at all. It is the young person who is about to establish himself who is trying to set up a home to get married or to rear children, who should be given the best of opportunities. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> would call on him to pay. I am sorry for the young person, the married man and the family man. They need attention also. I am not unsympathetic with the pensioners but let us keep these problems in balance. Let us consider ail people in need in Australia and stop seeking political credit by picking on those subjects which we know can arouse the emotions of the people. We heard an honourable senator, I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy,</inline> speak about the judgment of the people or the judgment of the churches on the Government. After all, ii is the responsibility of the churches to pay attention to those who are in particular need. The churches can well pass judgment because theirs is not a balanced responsibility; it is a particular responsibility. 1 am saying that we in this Parliament have to maintain a balanced responsibility in order to see that everybody gets a fair go </para>

              <para>- No. we certainly have not a detached view. We have a very involved view. It embraces all the people who need attention. It would be irresponsible for any government simply to pay attention to one section and to prejudice all the other sections by allowing the inflationary trend to be aggravated. To me it is completely ridiculous to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> and others ask for a pension equal to half the minimum wage. After all, a married pensioner couple do not have the responsibility to build a home, of beginning to educate their children or building up their requirements. This is the basis on which the minimum wace is fixed - the requirements of a man, his wile and his growing family. In most cases the pensioner - the invalid pensioner could be the exception - and certainly the age pensioner does not have those responsibilities and therefore does not need half of the minimum wage to maintain himself. </para>

          <para>I shall make only one further point. 1 am amazed at the campaign for a little Budget, lt is most .selfish to suggest that the pension rate should be raised, and that in order to find the money to pay for the increase the tax benefit granted to the lower and middle income earner should be revoked. After all, during the years that this Government has been in office the pension rate has been raised, I think, on 1 4 occasions, but the rate of taxation for the lower and middle income taxpayer has not been reduced once. Now it is his turn, and it is completely unreasonable to say that the pension rate should be raised at the expense of the lower and middle income earner. I hope that this suggestion is not repeated because, as 1 have said, this is an area of need and we, as a Government, have to watch for these areas of need. 1 think it is most unreasonable to ask that the pension rate should be increased at the present time when we are devoting our attention to checking inflation and thereby eventually benefiting every section of the community. </para>

            <para>-  It is very obvious from the closing remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> that 2 questions have been introduced into the debate. The first is the question of inti at ion upon which the Government has been focusing attention in a very nebulous way, judging by the sketchy statement which was made tonight. The second is the question of pensions and the position of people on fixed incomes. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> has pointed out. we have experienced a steadily increasing inflationary trend throughout the world during the whole of our lifetime and probably during the lifetime of our fathers and mothers. Possibly the only exception was during the depression years. If one were to draw a graph of inflation over the last 50 to 100 years one would see the line steadily rising. On very few occasions would the line on the graph be steady or fall to any extent before rising again. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>We have built into the economy in the Western world, in particular, a system whereby people can look after themselves by way of profits or through the arbitration court. In Australia the trade union movement has been able to look after its members, to some degree, by appearing before the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and making a very careful analysis of the economy and of price rises against demands. The people who have suffered are those who are not able to go before a controlled Arbitration Commission or to enter the uncontrolled business area to make profits. These people mainly are super annuitants and pensioners. This Government has been falling further and further behind in giving assistance to these 2 classes of people. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> referred to people on superannuation. People work for 50 years of their lives and pay into superannuation funds or, in the case of pensioners, pay taxation over a period of 50 years in order to receive something in return, not for 50 years but for a comparatively small number of years. The number of years may be none; it may rise to 15 or 16. 1 do not know what the average would be. It would probably be about 8 or 9. </para>
          <para>In view of what has been said tonight and the clamour that has arisen because of the offending of the national conscience since last August, it does not seem to be loo much to say that dignity ought to be given for that short period of people's lives. In the field of superannuation, there has not been a review in the case of Commonwealth employees for a period of nearly 4 years. The Government will not do something which could easily be done; that is, write an automatic adjustment provision into the relevant Act or, as is being done by some of the private companies, write in a fixed amount of increase over the years. The Government is not doing that for that section of fixed income earners, lt is also refusing to do something similar for the people who are affected far more seriously by this problem, namely, the pensioners who receive so much less. The Government's approach is inherent in the way this debate has gone on tonight. The approach is that a pension is something that a government in its great generosity hands out to people. The fact is that a pension is a prepaid right. People have prepaid their pensions in the form of their taxation payments over 50 years of work. A pension is not some sort of generous handout; it is a right that has already been earned over 50 or more years of work. </para>
          <para>What is civilisation? What are the things on which one judges how great a country is? I suggest that when one travels overseas and examines the situation in other countries, if one finds that they have a high infant mortality rate, a high disease rate, the hospitals and doctors are not somewhere near the optimum standard in looking after people or the poverty rate is very high, one regards them as uncivilised countries, lt is not on Rem bran dts and that type of thing that one judges civilisation. One judges it on the way people treat their brothers, about whom Senate: Buttfield learnt at church today and from whom somehow or other she excludes the pen- stone* s. This is how we will be judged. If wc arc to judge ourselves, surely we ought to be looking at who are the poor people  in  the community. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> ranged very widely. She said that there were many needy people in the community, such as transport people. That is drawing a very long bow. The poor of Australia are in a very neat compartment. They are the aged, the invalid, the widowed, the sick and the members of very large families. That just abou: covers the people about whom we are talking - the needy people. When we talk of needy people we should think in terms of the things that affect the every day way of living and the things on which civilisation is judged. </para>
          <para>I come  now  to the challenge of inflation - a point about which <inline font-style="italic">we</inline> are talking and on which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> closed her speech. She referred to the problem of galloping inflation, whereas I referred previously <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> steady inflation. In the last 8 or 9 months the rate of inflation has jumped from about 3 per cent to about 8 per cent. That is what the panic is ail about at the moment. It is nor sufficient to do what this Government is doing; that is, to move into the government sector only and say: 'We do not intend  to  increase pensions'. I thought the closing remarks of the Minister for Housing <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Dame Annabelle Rankin),</inline> who represents the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth),</inline> were very ominous. They ought to be noted by everybody listening to this debate tonight. I made a note of them.  Her  words were that 50c - the amount of pension increase that was given in the Budget - was the maximum amount that could prudently be given. So much for the hope  of  a little budget or for pension increases before the Budget which will be introduced probably next August. </para>
          <para>By attacking only the Government  sector  not only win pensions be affected but those people working in the Public Service  will be  told: "You will not receive promotions. Recruitment will be stopped. You will not get overtime. There will be no staff replacements and travelling must be curtailed'. It the Government were administering the Public Service correctly  and  efficiently it would not be necessary to say this, because the Government should not employ more people than are necessary, overtime should not  be  worked unnecessarily and people should not be travelling the countryside unreasonably. Ultimately the Public Service must recruit staff, so this proposal is merely postponing that day. The Government says that overtime is not to be worked before 30th June, but the work must be done at some stage. The Government is discriminating between the private and public sectors and those who work in the Public Service and are beholden to the Commonwealth Government will become the second eleven in the working community and pensioners will drag behind them. </para>
          <para>If the Government curtails expenditure in the Government sector we will reach the situation that Professor Galbraith referred to when he said that there could be private affluence and public squalor, because the public side of our community will run down. We have heard much in this chamber of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Nimmo.  His  committee investigated medical costs. He estimated that in Australia there are one million people below the poverty line. During the last Budget debate many honourable senators suggested that more than one million people would be driven below the poverty line as a result of Budget proposals. It is now obvious that more than one million Australians are in that situation today. </para>
          <para>Earlier this evening <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> pointed out that much was expected of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wentworth</inline> when he became Minister for Social Ser ices but that it is now a different <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wentworth</inline> from the <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wentworth</inline> who spoke as a backbench member, lt has been pointed out during this debate that the spin to this vicious financial wheel was given in the last Budget. When the Government increased petrol prices it did not merely put up the price to the person who owns a car. The increased cost applied to everything that was carried in a petrol driven vehicle. Even pensioners have to pay this added cost on the articles they have had to purchase. When the Government increased telephone charges pensioners were affected because they had to pay more for telephone calls. Indirect taxation applies to pensioners the same as it does to low wage earners. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline>has referred to the middle income earner but as was pointed out when the Government provided a 10 per ecn: rebate in taxation it did not assist the low and middle income earners to the extern that it assisted upper middle and high income earners. This rebate was granted because of a rash election promise which the Government wanted to honour quickly It did not give the Taxation Office time to work out a proper curve and the 10 per cent flat rate of rebate was introduced. This is why the rebate granted totalled more than what the Government had promised prior to the election. </para>
          <para>Mention has been made of the 6 per cent increase which was granted in the national wage case. During its 20 years in office the Government has adopted a laissez faire approach to things. It has allowed a situation to develop where people believe that the moment there is a wage increase then ipso facto there will be a price increase. Never at any stage has this Government encouraged by way of legislation, influence or otherwise a method of overcoming this ipso facto approach. This is a technological age. Manufacturers should not say. 'The wage increase 1 have to pay has increased my costs by $X. I will divide that sum by the quantity of goods I sell and add a little more along the line.' lt was obvious following the last Budget that immediately the Government gave the green light by raising prices through increases in indirect taxation, the sellers of goods went in for their cut as well. Prices were increased not only because of indirect taxation increases but because a little bit was added by the sellers. lt has become increasingly obvious that the community was shocked by the last Budget, as taxpayers were not really to receive a handout and pensioners were to receive an increase of only a miserable 50 cents a week. 1 have been interested to hear figures cited here tonight. I have some sets o! figures of my own and it has been interesting to see how they differ from those cited by other speakers. The fact is that the pensioner is worse off today when his pension is compared to the average weekly wage. A study of the cost of living index shows that pensioners have been made remarkably worse off by the 50c a week increase granted in the last Budget. If the words of the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth)</inline> are to be taken as seriously as I took them to be, and the maximum pension that can prudently be paid is being paid, it is a living disgrace to this Government. That situation is exacerbated by claims by Government supporters that we are in a situation where it has become necessary to grapple with inflation. That is even more disgraceful. </para>
          <para>There is no doubt that the terms of the motion emphasise what was said al the time of the last Budget not only by the Australian Labor Party but by the people of Australia. The national conscience has been offended. There is no justification for denying justice to these people who have already paid for their right to an adequate pension, lt is not charity, as seems to be implied. These people paid during a lifetime of work for their right to a pension. Surely to goodness any government that wants to be judged by world standards ought to be ensuring that our pensioners can live out the remaining period of their lives and die with some dignity. </para>

            <para>- The motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> refers to the need for the immediate introduction of the necessary legislation to provide for increases in the rates of social service payments, bringing pensions to a level compatible with the minimum needs of the recipients. I fear that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> in moving his motion made a speech which hardly did him credit, particularly in airing the idea that the Government was using the pensioners to carry out the burden of inflation. As he proceeded along that line I heard from him no constructive plan to meet, in Ins words, 'the minimum needs of the recipients'. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I join with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> in noting that within a few weeks of the Australian Democratic Labor Party's achieving its new situation it has brought forward this motion, lt was widely publicised and a great deal of political capital was made out of it. I ask: Who now is using the pensioner for political interests? The matter of pensions has always been contentious. In a large and complex social service programme it is natural that one or more sections of the community will invariably want more services, more concessions, more favours or more money »han are provided for by current legislation. Every time legislation relating to social services is introduced some people will claim to be in an anomalous situation and to have been unfairly treated. </para>
          <para>An enormous section of the community today receiver social service benefits. Other sections of the community are crying out for additional benefits. Reference has been made tonight in this debate to our young people, newly married people and people in the middle income group. Who has a word to say for the farming community in its dire need today? This is a section of the community that requires benefits. There is a very large number of people in Australia today at one level or another, under one circumstance or another, who require or who are asking for benefits, favours or money of some kind. The social services programme carries on its widespread and diverse activity, some of it in direct benefits, some of it in fringe benefits and some in the value received by members or relatives of pensioners' families. The Government's programme has both in its basic situation and its background situation extended and increased with each extending budget the variety of social services and the value of amenities that have been made available to more and more people by way of  m  greater range of benefits. I mention this because this resolution has produced some speeches in which some cruel statements have been made, one of which I referred to earlier in my remarks. We have seen the development of an attack which consists only of criticism with little or no appreciation of the work that is being done now, with little or no reference to the work that has been done already and certainly with no constructive plans whatever as to how the increased benefits which have been referred to in the resolution can be either financed, organised, or even serviced. </para>
          <para>To suggest that the Government is unsympathetic, of course, is quite wrong. To suggest that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> has no sense of concern is quite wrong. Of course every action which he and the Government takes may not satisfy everyone. The pension situation does not satisfy everyone, lt certainly does not satisfy rae. lt is recognised that while the resolution that is before us refers to age, invalid and widow pensions it also refers to them as social service benefits'. Therefore, the pension situation becomes part of the total social service activity of the government in office at the time. Therefore, pensions are related to the amount that a government can pay and the amount that the people want the government to pay. They are related to the amount that the people are prepared to pay to the government in the form of taxation so that revenue can be accumulated for the purpose of paying out additional social service benefits. </para>
          <para>The items which are included in the Commonwealth expenditure on social services in addition to age and invalid pensions run to great length Some of them include child endowment, the Commonwealth rehabilitation service, funeral benefits, maternity allowance, unemployment benefits, sickness and special benefits, widows pensions, sheltered employment allowances, deserted wives benefit, personal care, delivered meals and others. All of these items are forms of care and of practical concern for the pockets of needy people within our community today. These activities are not the only ones which the Minister for Social Services has to care for and for which the Government has to pay out considerable sums of money. If we look at the section dealing with the Department of Social Services in the Commonwealth Directory we find that in addition to the items I have mentioned we should also take into account the enormous pattern of the administration of the Aged Persons Homes Act, the Commonwealth Employees' Compensation Act, the Sheltered Employment (Assistance) Act and a lot of other items which I shall not go into at the moment, except to say that they are well over 30 in number. </para>
          <para>The Department of Social Services is not the only department concerned with various forms of care and assistance. Other departments come to mind, particularly those related to the territories which make long term loans at very low rates of interest so that aged people- -1 have a specific instance in mind - can be cared for. In this way such people not only receive benefits but they are also cared for and know the benefit of total security. I would like to look at one or two ways in which the Commonwealth has been extending over a period of time the amounts of money and the percentages which are devoted particularly, especially and exclusively to the pension situation. Consider the Budget year 1967-68 when the amount spent by the Commonwealth on age and invalid pensions was more than $500m. This represented an increase of 6.7 per cent over the expenditure of $48 lm in the previous financial year. Let us take one more year. 1968-69. In this year expenditure on age and invalid pensions was S558m, which was an increase of 8.7 per cent over the expenditure in the previous year. For 1969-70, which is the last completed financial year, the expenditure on age and invalid pensions was $641 m, which was a considerable increase of 14.5 per cent over the expenditure on the same items in the previous year. </para>
          <para>In deciding what it will spend each year a government has to make decisions between competing claims. This has been made abundantly clear tonight and has been referred to in speeches from the Opposition. This becomes particularly true when it comes to the allocation of the amounts available for social services between the various items of expenditure that come under that heading. When the figures which L stated earlier if expenditure on age and invalid pensions are compared with the total Commonwealth expenditure on social services it will be found that the commitment for age and invalid pensions has continued to rise steadily year by year as a percentage of the total expenditure. One or two points should be noted rather carefully. In 1967-68, 64.8 per cent of the Commonwealth expenditure on social services was spent on age and invalid pensions. In 1969-70 the expenditure was 65.6 per cent. In the Estimates for the current financial year, 1970-71, age and invalid pensions represent 68.3 per cent of the total Commonwealth expenditure on social services. From these figures it will be seen that there is a constant and developing increase in expenditure devoted to social services and that an increasing percentage of this expenditure is for age and invalid pensions alone. </para>
          <para>None of us is satisfied with the programme as it is. We are pleased with the developments and the Government has taken every opportunity to extend its services and to increase fringe benefits. I have heard no argument tonight as to whether fringe benefits should be abolished altogether so that the total pension figure can be raised, or that the amount used for the purchase of transportation facilities, for rent or some other purpose should be taken into the total figure. I do not think any one of us would object to the fringe benefits, but it is not a bad idea from time to tin to to take into account what fringe benefits mean. T do not intend to press the point that fringe benefits are worth $X in addition to the pension, but the fringe benefits of transport, radio and television licences, medical services and all the other tilings represent elements of security with.n the community. But in addition, allied with the Government's programme of subsidising various institutions, they provide the opportunity for the community to accept its responsibility and help io care for people who are in need. </para>
          <para>There is too much of this business of putting the whole pattern of caring for aged and invalid pensioners onto the Government. Nobody has answered the question as to who will pay for (he increases that are suggested. The greater the increases, the greater the cost, but who is going to pay for it? Somebody has to lind the money, f suggest that the Government's programme of increasing the pension year by year, together with its programme of increasing services in the last 20 years, from pharmaceutical benefits some time ago to the latest subsidy for meals on wheels, has enabled people in receipt of a pension to have a better standard of living, to have a sense of being cared for and a sense of belonging. As the Government deals with these things it has to take into account its humanitarian project on the one hand and its securing of a rapid economic growth and moderation of inflation on <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> other. No  speaker  who has supported this motion has taken into account a matter which is a real problem not only in Australia but RiSC throughout the world. That is the phenomenon of a large aged population, which I would describe as one of. the most dramatic and influential developments of this 20th century. Never before in history have there been so many older people as there are at this time. At the turn of the century, throughout the world people over 65 years of age represented about 4 per cent of the total population. Today people over 65 years of age represent in excess of 10 per cent of the total world population Society, therefore, is confronted with ;t new situation with which it is beginning so grapple only now. Money is not always the only and the total answer. There are influences, there are community associations and there are community services, some of which I have mentioned. </para>
          <para>Of course there are needy people. Pockets of need exist. There are pensioners who are in real need. Everyone of us has a desire to see that their need is met. The Government through its extending programme over the years has done its best and has done a great deal to meet this need, f think that we all can be assured and satisfied that it will do more. The Prime Minister has said: 'I have not given up the battle to conquer and to do away with need'. In the area of need in Australia there is the pensioner community. The discussion of this matter of public importance does not do anything to assist in meeting the need. Indeed, it is introduced to put pensions into an area of discussion that does not do the Party that proposed this matter for discussion any great credit. 1 hope that the Senate will reject the question when it is put. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- I am amused at the sensitivity of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson</inline> who suggested that somebody in this debate actually said something that was cruel about himself and about his Party. Of course, the honourable senator waited to make those remarks until after he had suggested that the Australian Democratic Labor Party had raised this matter of public importance for discussion in the Senate only because it wished to gain political popularity and some political kudos out of the question itself. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> already had made the same statement. I think that evil is he who evil thinks. If people wish to think that that was the motive of the Australian Democratic Labor Party, what wc would want to do is not to disillusion them but to remind them that the letter to the  President  proposing that this matter should be discussed in the Senate today - that letter was sent to the  President  on 15th December last year - came several days after a judgment which increased wages throughout our community by 6 per cent had been handed down in the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>If one was charitable and not cruel in one's approach to other polit icians, one might say that the Australian Democratic Labor Party had been inspired by ils economic knowledge that this 6 per cent increase in wages must deprive further the most poverty stricken section of our community and increase the hardships that people iti this section were suffering already. Therefore, it was a matter of urgency that this Senate should express its opinion on this matter at the very first opportunity that it had. I do not expect <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson</inline> who is so sensitive about cruelty to himself to be as sensitive about the situation of other people and to place an economic construction on the actions of the Democratic Labor Party because the honourable senator does not understand economics. He has proved that, if I now can resort to being a little cruel, by the balderdash that he has spoken in debating this matter of public importance. </para>
          <para>The honourable senator gave us figures as to the increased amounts that the Government has spent on pensions from year to year. He made no mention of the increased numbers of pensioners. The number of persons eligible to receive the pension increases year by year. Because the Government was increasing the proportion of its Budget that was going to pensions, the honourable senator said that, automatically, pensioners were getting a better deal. But without an analysis of the numbers of pensioners what good are those figures and what contribution did that argument make to this debate at all? </para>
          <para>The Minister for Housing <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Dame Annabelle Rankin),</inline> who is the Minister in charge of the debate now before the Senate, tried to convince us that pensioners were all right by the quotation of a number of figures, particularly with relation to fringe benefits. For her information - if she does not know this - let us take one of the items that she mentioned, namely, the provision for home nursing care. The 6 per cent wage increase alone has led to some of those providing this service in the last month increasing their fees by $20 a fortnight for people who are bedridden. Is that increased charge being met by the Government's home nursing care scheme? ls this a fringe benefit that has accrued to these people? lt is a special payment for a very special need. The Government does not pay for the cost of that special need at all. It pays only a proportion of it. That proportion becomes smaller as prices continue to rise. We do not want the Liberal and Country Parties to judge us on this question: we will allow the community to judge us. The people seem to do so very intelligently as election after election takes place. </para>
          <para>In defence of my Party I want to reply to the suggestion by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> that we had a tremendous opportunity to do something about this during the 1970-71 Budget debate. I will read from that debate the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy.</inline> He suggested that if we had supported his contention we would have done something to alleviate the position of the pensioners. I am reading that part of the debate in which he moved an amendment catling for the addition to the motion of the words and the Senate condemns this deceptive and negative Budget because it fails to meet the real needs of the Australian people, especially with respect to (a) standards of social service and war pensioners, (b) assistance to schools, hospitals and urban authorities' etc., etc. That was merely a pious expression of opinion. </para>
          <para>Let us compare that with the constructive attitude of the Democratic Labor Party. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> is trying to assist me but I must be going very badly indeed if i have to go almost to Yuendumu to get assistance in a speech on this question of economics. The constructive attitude of the Democratic Labor Party towards pensions over the years in this chamber answers the criticisms aimed against this Party. We have moved for the entire pension area to be taken out of the political arena and placed in the hands of an independent tribunal which would assess what actually can be afforded by this affluent community to those people who have created such a community. If only one of the other parties had supported that proposition we would not have had to say cruel things to one another tonight and suggest that the whole question of pensioners was being debated only for the purpose of some party gaining some political advantage from the question.

          <para class="block">These people are not able to keep pace with inflation as it takes place. They are falling further and further behind because of the inevitable results of the recent wage increase decision. </para>
          <para>I read with interest that when the present Budget was discussed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> produced certain figures once again, lt seems to me that he would have required a computer to assist him. He showed that in the 12 months since the previous increase costs actually had gone up only by 49c and the pensioners were going to get 50c. He at least ought to vote with us tonight because on his computations as a result of the 6 per cent increase in the national wage level, now in the process of taking place, the lc profit that the pensioners were making at the end of last year - according to his figures - obviously has gone. together with a lot more cents besides. If for no other reason that his own computations he should support us tonight. Let us realise that pensions are a part of the general economy. For the Minister <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> say tonight that we should look at what the Government has done for the pensioner with children is in itself an admission of the inflation that has taken place. The Government recognised that by not allowing general child endowment payments to keep pace with the general inflation under its management it had to make special concessions to the children of invalid pensioners. These are special rates aimed at replacing what those people have lost because the Government did not increase endowment to keep the benefits commensurate with those that applied before the inflation it deliberately allowed to take place. </para>
          <para>My main purpose in rising to speak to this motion was to defend my party. We were attacked because we brought this motion before the Senate. 1 think that this matter has been well debated. The parties have had almost equality of representation in the debate, with the Government having 3 speakers to reply to 2 speakers from each of the other parties. I believe that at this hour of the night the most sensible thing is for us to get a decision on this motion, and I move: </para>

With apologies to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Bracken 1 wish to say: 'I would to God that men could see more clearly or speak less harshly where they cannot see'. I think this applies very vividly to some of those people who tonight would like to interject and create an atmosphere; who cry and squeal about being kept up at this late hour. There are people in these flooded areas who are not sleeping tonight. </para>

        <para>I visited the Narrabri area and was able to bring a realistic picture to the attention of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> who,I am aware, controls the purse strings of this nation. As a result, I forwarded to him the following telegram on 8th February 1971, which was last Monday: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Tremendousflood devastation in north-west New South Wales towns of Wee Waa and Narrabri alone estimate their losses by Mayor Alderman Heath and other reliable authorities in excess of $40m. No doubt your parliamentary colleagues and members for the district have advised you of the position. I personally feel that a further announcement by you as Prime Minister should be made giving greater financial assistance to all who have suffered in this disastrous flood. Only for the magnificent voluntary work performed in the area losses would have been much greater. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">The telegram was forwarded by me from 9 Bridge Street, Narrabri. I sent a copy of the telegram to the Premier of New South Wales together with a letter to the effect that the telegram had been forwarded to the Prime Minister and I fell that it was important that the Premier know its contents. I want to say in passing that prior to ray sending that telegram the Prime Minister had made a statement to the effect that the Commonwealth had already agreed to provide $50,000 to the New South Wales Government on a $ l-for-$l basis to relieve the personal hardship and distress of the New South Wales flood victims. A Press statement about the Prime Minister's offer was issued on 8th February - the day my telegram was forwarded to him. On 9th February the Prime Minister made a further statement, which is too lengthy for me to read. However, in it he advised the Premier of New South Wales that certain things would be done. In winding up his statement he said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Preliminary estimates suggested that an amount in excess of$10m could be involved. This would, of course, be additional to the substantial expenditure on restoring flood damage that would be financed through private insurance. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I felt that it may have been argued that the figure which had been mentioned to me was excessive, so I checked it last night with the Mayor of Narrabri, who advised me that the Minister for Agriculture and the honourable member for Barwon, whose electorate includes the towns of Narrabri and Wee Waa, had asked him where he got the figure of S40m. The Mayor went on to say bow he had assessed this amount. The Minister for Agriculture said: 1 do not think you are far off the mark.' That is the situation that exists at the moment. </para>
        <para>I have raised this matter at this late hour because I know of the callous and indifferent attitude shown to people in need in these flood areas. The saying 'To hell with von, Jack. I am all right' is applicable not only in this Parliament but also in areas not far distant from Narrabri itself. I know of a young man employed by an insurance company in Tamworth who was sacked because he was held up one night and decided to slay and help his parents. He returned to work after some time had elapsed and when he gave his reason for being held up he was told that he knew the Hoods were coming and that if he thought his family was more in need of assistance than his employer then he had better leave. This is the situation that exists at the moment and I am bringing this matter up because I believe it is very important. </para>
        <para>I ask that urgent assistance be given to thos.: <inline font-style="italic">who</inline> are in need of unemployment relief and. of course, I am asking for the most sympathetic attitude to be taken in this field by departmental officers. Jobs are not available in the area. The cotton has been completely destroyed and the men who were working in that field are in need of assistance. I repeat that while the hour is late there are many men, women and children who are not sleeping soundly tonight in these flood towns. Over the last fortnight the floods have swept through these townships in many areas of the north west of New South Wales, and after the people have cleaned up their homes the floods have returned. In the Sydney 'Sun' tonight there is an article headed 'Towns Still Fighting Floods'. The article states: </para>

          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Major flooding</inline>is continuing today in the north-western areas of New South Wales. The towns of Walgett, Wee Waa. Pilliga, Burren Junction and Collarenebri are isolated and some telephone lines are cut </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">This is the situation at the moment and 1 appeal most sincerely to the Government to give immediate and substantial help. As regards the future let us have our engineers - the men who constructed our dams in the Snowy Mountains scheme - investigate this problem and try to advise us of a solution. There must be a solution to this problem. Too frequently do these flood tragedies take place, costing far too much in human lives and in the destruction of property. We must do everything possible now and pledge ourselves to make certain that these floods will not occur again. I ask the Government to do everything possible to help these people who are desperately in need. </para>

          <para>(11.48)  - It  is true, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fitzgerald</inline> has said, that there have been major disasters in parts of New South Wales due to recent floods and despite what he may have said in passing  - I  know it was not really-germane to what he wanted to say - there has been very real understanding and assistance given by the Commonwealth in helping in this matter in conjunction with the New South Wales Government. As has been said, the Prime Minister issued a Press statement on 8th or 9th February in relation to the type of assistance that has been extended to New South Wales in connection with this disaster. There are 3 ways in which the Commonwealth has assisted or offered assistance with regard to these floods. Firstly, 1 am pleased to say that the defence forces have made a considerable contribution towards rescue and other emergency operations. Secondly, we have agreed to join with the State on a 'si for SI basis in providing funds for the relief of personal hardship and distress in the affected areas. Thirdly, we have agreed to meet all expenditure for 1970-71 on natural disaster relief measures in New South Wales in excess of S5m. This last arrangement will have the effect that the substantial part of the expenditure on the restoration of public assets damaged by these floods, and of the expenditure on carry on loans to farmers in appropriate cases, will be met by the Commonwealth. </para>

We have agreed to meet all expenditure for 1970-71 on natural disaster relief measures in New South Wales in  excess of$5m. That is the wording of my brief. Its terms are categorical. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fitzgerald</inline> has stated the problem.I know that he has a personal concern in the sense that he has been into the area on 2 occasions. We are aware of the magnitude of the floods in this area. The Commonwealth has shown its awareness and its responsibility by providing to the States the assistance I have outlined. Nevertheless, I will accept the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fitzgerald</inline> and will have it referred to the appropriate department. </para>
