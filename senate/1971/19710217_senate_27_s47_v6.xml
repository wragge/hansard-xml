            <para>- Is the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs aware that the West German Government has taken steps to expel from that country certain Yugoslavs suspected of being members of the Ustashi, a Croat terrorist movement responsible for bombing incidents in that country? Is he also aware that the Yugoslav Government is concerned that such people expelled from West Germany may seek a haven in Australia? Will he give a firm assurance that, in conjunction with the Minister for Immigration, steps will be taken to improve screening methods in West Germany to ensure that such people do not enter Australia and add to the previous bombing incidents against foreign consulates for which in the main no perpetrators have been apprehended? </para>

              <para>- I am aware that an extradition treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and Yugoslavia was signed in November 1970 and that West German courts have sentenced Yugoslav citizens for terrorist acts committed in West Germany. At present I am seeking information as to whether suspected Yugoslav terrorists have been expelled to third countries. We have been informed by the Yugoslav authorities of their concern lest members of terrorist organisations of Yugoslav origin and inimical to the interests of the Yugoslav Government should be permitted to immigrate to Australia from other countries, including West Germany. That is the point of the question. Of course I cannot answer for the Minister for Immigration within whose province the third part of the question falls. However, I am given to understand that the screening process which is fully operative in Germany seeks to avoid the entry of people with extreme political views, and this should cover members of known terrorist organisations. </para>

            <para>- I desire to ask a question of the Minister representing the Minister for National Development in the Senate. Has the Minister's attention been drawn to recent disturbing reports of heavy pollution of the River Murray before its waters reach South Australia, leading to the river's description as a major sewer'? I refer to pollutants other than those of saline origin. Is the Minister aware that the River Murray is the vital source of water supply to South Australia for domestic, stock watering, irrigation and industrial purposes? To what extent does the Ministry of National Development, in conjunction with the interested States of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, supervise and control the discharge of obnoxious effluents into the River Murray to ensure water of acceptable quality to South Australia as the end receiver? </para>

            <para>- Yes, I have seen references to this problem and I do understand it. In fact, I was in Mildura looking at the airport, I think, on the day that this matter was first mentioned, and the concern of the local people was shared by me. Because of my association with that State and also with that part of Australia I do understand the great importance of this matter to South Australia. I made some inquiries about this earlier and I am given to understand that responsibility for control of waters, including their quality, entering the River Murray and of diversions from it rests with the individual States. It is also suggested that the River Murray as such, particularly in its lower reaches, should not be regarded as a source of municipal water supply without being treated before use. </para>

          <para class="block">Government has' at all times: kept under constant review what is happening it i primary industry, lt has done this in many ways. It has done it, first of 'all, by having the door of the Minister 'for Primary Industry open to the leaders of. primary, industries to see him whenever they feel they want to discuss problems with him. The Minister for Primary Industry has met State Ministers of Agriculture and their departmental officers oyer the years. We have 'Cabinet discussions with sectors of the rural industry in regard to economic problems. Also the Department of Primary Industry itself is constantly in touch with rural industries and their problems. From time to time the Government may assist in or commission special investigations. A good example of this was when the Government, made the Bureau of' Agricultural Economics available to the Australian Wool Board Advisory Committee which was set up to consider the economic probe lems facing the wool industry. The Bureau of Agricultural Economics undertook a special review of reconstruction and farm adjustment for the Government. This was followed by the Minister for Primary Industry and the Treasurer discussing with State Ministers the setting up of a national reconstruction board. </para>
          <para>The honourable senator asks why w.e do not set up some body to look at the whole situation. Let me take his mind back to 1948-49,. when a similar situation and feeling existed among rural people. They asked for a board on the lines of the present Tariff Board to be set up. The Government came forward with a suggestion for a primary industries investigation board whose, job would have been to investigate the whole rural scene. But the individual sectors of primary industry said: *N.o, we do not want that. We are quite capable of looking after our own industries'. The wheat industry pointed to the costs index committee and said that that committee was quite: capable of looking after the problems of . that industry. I believe, that the Government has the problems of primary industry under close scrutiny and that it is up to the individual sections of industry to come and consult with the Government on their problems. </para>

I refer to the question I raised with him yesterday about the serious situation of pear growers in the Goulburn Valley area of Victoria. Has his attention been further alerted to the very serious position that faces many growers of pears in the Goulburn Valley area of Victoria? Did he note a radio report today that a grower who faced probable financial ruin was sufficiently mentally distressed when his delivery of pears to the processor was refused that he resorted <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> threat with a gun? As on previous occasions and in instances of disaster, the Prime Minister has initiated the sending of a telegram which offered financial assistance to various areas of distress in the States, will the Minister give urgent consideration to my plea that he advise the Prime Minister to do likewise in this instance of industry distress? </para>

            <para>- 1 did answer a question asked by the honourable senator yesterday in regard to pear growing in the Goulburn Valley. Although 1 did not hear the radio announcement to which he refers, it has been drawn to my attention today. As 1 pointed out yesterday, the production of pears last year was the greatest  the  industry has known, so much so that the carryover of canned pears at the end of 1970 was in the vicinity of <inline font-style="italic">li</inline> million to 2 million cartons. The Minister for Primary industry visited the area recently, had discussions with the growers and informed them that, if a case seeking assistance from the Commonwealth was made out by the State Government, within whose responsibility this falls, the Commonwealth would give it very careful consideration. In view of: what the honourable senator has said to me about approaching the Prime Minister, I shall take, his request forward. </para>

            <para>- Has the Leader of the Government in the Senate seen statements to the. effect that the price of petrol is again to rise? In view of the Prime Minister's appeal to industry and to all sections of the community to maintain stability and to keep prices down, will the Minister ask the . Government to intercede with the oil companies with a view to preventing a further increase? As the Minister knows, the prices of oil and petrol were increased four or five months ago before the Parliament went into recess. </para>

              <para>- Petrol is one of those very  Fare  commodities the price of which is determined  by a  prices commissioner in South Australia. It is rather unusual for the price of  a  commodity which is used throughout Australia to  be  fixed  by a  commissioner appointed  by  the South Australian Government, but  by  this procedure a guide line is provided for the price of petrol in this country. The matter that the honourable senator has raised comes within the administration of the Minister for National Development and I will have the question directed to him this afternoon. I do not think there is any need for intercession  by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton;</inline> who represents the Minister for National Development. </para>

            <para>- In addressing my question to the Minister for Air I refer to the purchase of DC3 aircraft from Jet air. Is it  a  fact that the Royal Australian Air Force had 7 DC3 aircraft available for disposal at Laverton? Can he explain why only 3 of them were made available for external aid and 4 were allowed to remain rotting away at the base? How does this fit in with the Government's austerity campaign, especially since these planes needed only $5,000 to  be  spent on them to make them airworthy whereas the Department -of Foreign Affairs is reported to have paid Jet air 540,000 for each of the aircraft obtained from that company? </para>

              <para>- 1 did not say that. I said they are surplus. They are at Laverton awaiting disposal. Their disposal is not simply a matter of flying them away. Certain procedures1 are laid down for the disposal of aircraft which are surplus to the requirements of, the Boya! Australian Air Force. Their disposal is arranged through the Department pf Supply and the aircraft must be taken to ,a certain location where they ate put up ton sale. They cannot fly to that point so in some cases they have to be dismantled and transported to it. These are certain procedures by which L through the If Board, can dispose df Air Board property. I observe those procedures, fino offers are made to purchase- the aircraft th§y remain' where they are. </para>

            <para>- I can assure the honourable senator that the Department of Works does have regard to the availability of materials and services in an area where work is expected to be executed. Its objective at all times is to utilise local materials where economically possible. Qf course, it is necessary to have regard to the function or requirements of the particular project and the suitability and availability of the materials; but so long as they are available on time, in quantity, of the specified quality and at a satisfactory cost, the Department's objective will always be to utilise those local materials. I remind the honourable senator that as most of the Department's work is done by contract he can depend on the business acumen of the' contractors, to seek materials that are economic pally to their advantage in the performance of the contracts; Mostly these will be local materials. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I am conscious of one case in which local materials were not used. It has been brought under reference in recent months by two of my colleagues. Explanations have been given as to the necessity of matching new materials with old materials. As to other aspects, that arise in particular cases, there will be some odd exceptions to the principle. </para>

In. view of the new hard line taken by appeal and assessment tribunals of the Repatriation Department, the chairmen of which are legal officers capable of conducting searching cross-examination on repatriation requirements, will the Minister take steps to amend the Repatriation Act to permit an appellant against an entitlement or assessment decision of the Department to be represented by a legal officer? </para>

            <para>-  I ask (he Minister fbr Air a question which follows on the question which was just asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges,</inline> I understood the Minister to say in reply that the Royal Australian Air Force DC3 aircraft could not be given to foreign governments because the aircraft would not fly and could not be brought under the control of the Department of Supply. I ask: How much would it cost to make these RAAF DC3 aircraft serviceable? If it is necessary for work to be done through the Department of Supply, could not officers of that Department be driven to the RAAF aerodrome to inspect the aircraft to see whether they were suitable for donation to foreign governments? I think that the Minister, in his answers to these questions* is building up another VIP incident. </para>

              <para>- The situation is that the Royal Australian Air Force had some aircraft which were surplus to requirements. These planes had not been in service for many years. In addition, later this year we will have 3 more aircraft of the same type surplus to requirements. For the Air Force to be able to dispose of these aircraft the Department of Supply must be informed that they are available for disposal. From then on action to dispose of them is taken by the Department of Supply. </para>

I also ask the Minister: Has there been a speedy examination of the proposal? If that examination is at present being conducted, will he .endeavour to have the costing and policy decisions speeded up so that the necessary works might be started during l,971;? </para>

            <para>-I would' presume, not knowing a. great deal about this, that: any South Australian Railways Commissioner who generated in his own department a proposal for doing a j6b in his State cheaper arid more efficiently than a previously expressed view would communicate that information, certainly to the Commonwealth. I cannot say :more than that. I do riot know the details of this but I shall certainly make inquiries arid try tq find out and I will do what I can to speed up the matter mentioned by the honourable senator. </para>

            <para>- I ask the Minister for Supply: In view of the fact that the Department was advised by the. Department qf Air of. a surplus of DC3 aircraft, why were not arrangements made for possession to be obtained of these aircraft and for their disposal as foreign aid rather than, the purchase of such aircraft from a private company </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir KENNETH</inline>ANDERSONI verily believe that there is a crossed line here somewhere. I understood that the question directed to the Minister for Air was in the generality. I am quite certain the terms of his reply did not refer to the particular aircraft, which presumably the Departmen of Foreign Affairs acquired for distribution as foreign aid. It would, I imagine, be very difficult for him to know, and I arn sure he would not be in a position to know, that the honourable senator was talking about a particular aircraft. There is a general rule relating to the disposal of aircraft or of any defence equipmen by the Services. The Departs ment concerned makes a decision at some point of time that certain equipment, be it aircraft, a building or anything you like, is surplus or redundant Or is up for disposal. The Department then goes through the procedure of notifying the Department of Supply that it is for disposal. It then becomes the responsibility of the Department of Supply to dispose of it. </para>

The honourable senator should ask his question again. 1 am saying that there is a normal procedure to be followed when a Service department declares something surplus.

Am 1 to understand that the Department of Air was not asked by the Department of Foreign Affairs or the Department of Supply to tender for tha supply of these aircraft? If so, how did three of these aircraft come to be supplied to (he Department of Foreign Affairs? If three of these aircraft were actually supplied what would be the difficulty in supplying the remaining four? The Minister has said that no request was made. I want an explanation as to how these aircraft came to be supplied. </para>

              <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> 1 think I had better intercede again because this is quite obviously an elementary matter. The fact is the Department of Foreign Affairs wanted to buy some aircraft for foreign aid purposes. Every aircraft is not the same. Because three out of a parcel of a dozen are bought, it does not mean that one has to buy the balance. When I go to buy a shirt I do not have to buy every shirt that is on the rack. I was asked questions yesterday by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> about the sale of aircraft by Jet air Australia Ltd to the Government and. because the honourable senators were getting excited, I promised to obtain some information for them.

          <para>The Minister for Foreign Affairs issued a Press statement in which he indicated that the Department of Foreign Affairs had elected to buy 11 aircraft, six of which were to be purchased from a com.pany named Jet air Australia Ltd. 1 made it perfectly clear yesterday that the Department of Supply would come into the matter only after a decision had been taken as it was the department which was responsible for completing the transaction. As I said yesterday and I repeat today, if and when the transaction is completed I will give the details of it to the Senate. </para>

          <para class="block">It will not be very long. That is the answer to the first part of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe's</inline> question. The second part of it, as I recall, was in relation to whether the 6 aircraft which were being purchased from Jet air were in fact aircraft which had been disposed of by the Government to Jet air. I said that I did not know but I would seek to find out. I have sought to find out and I have been able to glean the following information so far: No aircraft which were originally owned by the Royal Australian Air Force were sold by the Commonwealth Government to Jet air. 1 was fairly certain that this was right. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe's</inline> question went beyond that in that he said it could well be that these aircraft were involved in some transaction before then. </para>

              <para>- I am talking about DC3 aircraft. These aircraft were sold in June 1968 to Stan air. They were military type and were unfitted. These aircraft were sold after tenders had been called from all over the world. The price of two of these aircraft was $8,396 each. These aircraft were sold to Stan air and acquired by Jet air from Stan air. The third was owned originally by the Bureau of Mineral Resources, lt was disposed of for $13,000 to Airlines of New South Wales which, in turn, presumably sold it to Jet air. The fourth, a 21 -seater, was acquired by Jet air from Trans-Australiann Airlines-. 1 do not have any information about that acquisition. 1 know only that it was sold by TAA. Then there were 2 freighters. One was acquired from TAA. I do not know anything about that acquisition. </para>

              <para>- Yes. The other was sold by the Department of Supply to Stan air (US) at a RAAF disposal in June 1968. lt was a military, unfitted aircraft and was sold for $8,396. The only other note I have on these sales is that the Government does not know what Jet air paid for the aircraft it acquired in the subsequent transactions. All aircraft originally owned by the RAAF were sold as bare military aircraft and brought a total of approximately $38,000 in open public tenders. It is estimated that the cost of converting them to passenger con figuration, and of obtaining a certification of airworthiness for civil operations would cost upwards of $50,000 per aircraft. I have taken a little time to provide this information. That is the maximum of my knowledge and the Senate now has it. </para>

            <para>- I ask a question of the Minister representing the Treasurer. Will the Government bear in mind that any austerity programme by Commonwealth and State governments should be planned and controlled carefully so that the private business sector and the private investor, are not panicked into excessive similar programmes and so lay the foundation for depression and unemployment, as happened in 1930? With the share market in a bad way and with the rural community's purchasing power gravely diminished, is there not need for great care lest austerity get out of hand and lead to a lack of confidence, unemployment and depression? </para>

            <para>- I direct a further question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. It arises out of the reply that he gave about the Jet air Australia Ltd Stan air (U.S.) transactions. Can the Minister inform the Parliament whether 2 longstanding customs policies have now been broken? Apparently Stan air purchased the aircraft from the Department of Supply. 1 understood that all aircraft purchased in this manner were supposed to leave Australia. Can the Minister tell us whether these aircraft ever left Australia? 1 again ask this question of the Minister: Has the 2-airline policy been breached in that Jet air Australia Ltd was able to secure passenger carrying planes of this size when the Spec organisation and other companies have been refused permission to purchase such planes? </para>

          <para class="block">I think the honourable senator asked that question yesterday and that was the answer given. As to the first part of the question, the terms and condition of sale in relation to disposal are that the planes to be disposed of have to be exported. It is true that there have been some legal difficulties in relation to the application of that condition. My memory is not good in relation to this incident but there were certainly some difficulties in fulfilling the contractual arrangements surrounding the disposal of some Viscount aircraft. I shall obtain the facts as to what happened to these aircraft now under discussion. The notes I have on this matter do not reveal whether or not they actually went out of the country and came in again.

              <para>- 1 have seen the Press statement to which the honourable senator refers. I cannot give a complete answer to the points he has raised but 1 shall take the matter up with the Minister for Health. 1 have some information concerning the funnel web spider which shows the problems which laboratories face in obtaining an antivenin to combat the spider's bite. Although the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories have produced a red back spider antivenin, to date they have been unable to produce an antivenin to the venom of the funnel web spider. This is because none of the toxic components of the venom is antigenic and the usual process of immunisation to produce antibodies in the sera of laboratory animals is ineffective. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </interjection>
          <para>Since 1957 Commonwealth Serum Laboratories have been trying to identify the chemical constituents of the venom and combine one of these with a protein to produce an antigen. In this way antibodies could be produced in animals and antivenin produced. One of the main difficulties in the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories' experimental work has been the supply of venom. Each spider produces only a very small amount of venom and it would be necessary to milk over 1,000 spiders a week to obtain reasonable supplies. This covers one of the very real points of difficulty which confront us. </para>

            <para>- 1 will be as helpful as I can to the Senate to the extent to which the Department of Civil Aviation is involved in this matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Turnbull</inline> asked a question regarding the operational position and I think he obtained a factual answer. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> asked whether I could find out from the Department of Civil Aviation where the aircraft were purchased. I have asked the Department to obtain that information for me, if it can, by searching through the records - the log books and things of that kind. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson has already given some information which shows where the aircraft came from that Jet air finally assembled and sold. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland</inline> says it now appears that TAA sold two of them and Airlines of New South Wales sold one of them to Jet air. I will endeavour to find out the selling price from both of these companies, if I can. </para>

            <para>- I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate a question. While the Government is searching for material on the matter of the sale of aircraft from the Royal Australian Air Force to various people, will the Minister try to find out whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Alexander</inline> Barton, whose activities seem to extend into the Meld of Stan air and Jet air Australia Ltd, is the same person who has raised tens of millions of dollars from the public for dubious projects, one being an opal as big as the Ritz? Can the Minister say whether Stan air (US) is a bona fide overseas company and whether there is any connection between Stan air and Jet air? 1 could also add hot air to these companies. </para>

              <para>- 1 do not really think I have a responsibility to look into the bona fides of a person. I question the wisdom of casting reflections by implication upon any person while the proceedings of the Senate are being broadcast. lt seems a bit like a drumhead trial. However, that is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne's</inline> responsibility. I am certainly not going to react to it. I have now been handed a little more information and, being in a helpful mood, I think I might as well supply it to honourable senators, lt relates to the disposal of the aircraft and their numbers. I am told that 10 surplus DC3 aircraft remain at Laverton air base, 5 of which have been sold lo (he Department of Foreign Affairs. That is consistent with what we have been told already. They are destined for Cambodia under our aid programme. A further 5 DC3 aircraft have been declared to the Department of Supply from the Royal Australia Air Force. In other words, it has now put its imprimatur on them for disposal. </para>

Got ley Glacier extends down the south southwestern side of the 8,000-feet Mawson Peak on Heard Island. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Budd,</inline> a medical officer, put <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Holmes's</inline> leg in a splint and left him with sedatives and adequate clothing, food and fuel. He and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dillon</inline> then walked 40 miles in 2 days across the hazardous terrain back to the base camp at Atlas Cove on the north-west side of the island to report the accident. Because of the rugged terrain it was decided that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Holmes</inline> could not be carried back to the camp. </para>
          <para>The 'Nella Dan' look on 2 helicopters at Mawson and is expected to reach Heard Island, 1,000 miles away, on Saturday, 20th February. An attempt will be made to lift the injured man off the glacier by helicopter. On board the 'Nella Dan' are a doctor and a radio operator who both have mountaineering experience. The 'Nella Dan' was on her way to Mawson to pick up Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition expeditions for return to Melbourne, when she was asked yesterday to assist, inquiries by the Department of Supply among other Antarctic Treaty signatory nations have shown that no other ship carrying a helicopter is nearer to Heard Island than the 'Nella Dan'. I am sure we all hope and pray that this expedition will be successful. </para>

          <para class="block">I do not know whether the question is intended to be in a flippant vein or is intended to be a serious one. All I know is that because of the phenomenal rains we have had in Sydney one has to cut the lawn more often. However, I suggest that this is a normal matter within the department or authority concerned. I certainly will not direct the question to the Prime Minister's Department because it has no relationship at all to the austerity aspect. If the honourable senator wants certain information because of a change in procedure, I will attempt to obtain an answer for him. </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister representing- the Minister for Customs and Excise, who I think is the appropriate Minister. Does the Minister realise that recent publicity on possible tariff revision and reform, including divisions of opinion at Cabinet level, has left secondary industry in a condition of extreme doubt and uncertainty, thus making future planning and development most difficult? Will the Government, with the Tariff Board, expedite the making of a clear statement of decisions proposed, so that secondary industry may know where to go? </para>

            <para>-  I think that this would apply equally to the Minister for Trade and Industry and to the Minister for Customs and Excise. I would say that the Minister for Customs and Excise would be aware of the factors that the honourable senator has mentioned, and I would say also that the Government would be aware of the fact that people are speculating. However. I think one should comment that a lot of the speculation Bows very properly from people with certain of their own interests to serve. This matter is under examination and review and I am sure that it will be cleared up before very much longer.  -v,DC3  AIRCRAFT </para>

            <para>- My question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate follows questions already asked relating to the fact that the terms of sale of DC3 aircraft and Royal Australian Air Force Viscount aircraft have been broken on more than one occasion, ls it a fact that in 1969 the terms of sale relating to 2 RAAF Vis counts, that is, that the aircraft were to be exported, were broken? I remind the Minister that the aircraft were being sold at the very low figure of 3153,000. If the Department knew that the terms of sale had been broken what legal remedies did the Government take to prevent their breach? Is it a fact that despite the fact that the terms of sale had been broken the Department of Civil Aviation decided to permit the use of those aircraft on certain domestic routes? </para>

              <para>- Yes, I will ascertain the facts. My memory sometimes is pretty accurate in these things and I rather fancy that the Viscount aircraft eventually did leave this country. However, as I have said, T will ascertain the facts. Because of the difficulties associated with the alleged breach of contract the matter moved away from my Department and into the hands of the legal officers of the Attorney-General's Department, and certain proposals have been made in relation to closing the hole so that this kind of thing cannot happen again. I think the suggestion was made that a prospective purchaser should have to ente into a contract to take delivery outside of Australia. That is a legal question and perhaps I should await a legal reply. </para>

              <para>- I should like to add something. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> probably will be delighted to learn that his assumption that the Department of Civil Aviation had allowed the aircraft to which he referred to fly in Australia in the field of civil aviation is incorrect. Those aircraft have been exported from Australia in accordance with the terms of the original tender schedule. I repeat that at no time did they fly in Australia in the private or commercial category. </para>

In view of the apparent irregularities in the acquisition of aircraft from a private company by a government department for the purpose of making a gift to Cambodia, will the Minister have a search made of the books of the companies Jet air Australia Ltd or Stan air (US) to ascertain whether any member of the Government is connected with those companies? </para>

I do not know that there really was any irregularity. There was certainly no irregularity in respect of my Department. I do not see that the Government has a responsibility to probe shareholdings or persona) holdings in private companies. The Department of Supply disposes of aircraft by tender. Whilst some people may think that the tender system sometimes proves to be unsatisfactory, in the long run, in view of the types of questions that are sometimes asked here, I say thank God that we do it that way. </para>

              <para>- The question is directed to me as representative in the Senate of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. My understanding is that the arrangement entered into between Jet air Australia Ltd and the Department of Foreign Affairs was by private treaty. It comes to my Department to be formalised, in the event. I will seek some further information from the Department of Foreign Affairs, but I really think it is available in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McMahon's</inline> Press release issued several days ago. </para>

            <para>The following action has been taken by the Metric Conversion Board since July 1970 when it was established to plan, guide and facilitate Australia's conversion to the metric system: </para>
            <para>Ten committees, which between them will cover all the sectors involved in the change, have been appointed to advise the Board on metric conversion. Each Advisory Committee comprises about 10 leading members of the community concerned with the various important aspects of the change in that sector and is chaired by a member of the Board and has on it at least 3 other Board members. Most of the committees are now fully operative. Each Advisory Committee will, in its turn, be assisted by a number of Advisory Subcommittees charged with tendering advice on particular aspects of conversion. </para>
            <para>The immediate tasks of these committees are to formulate proposals for the manner and timing of conversion within the sectors with which they are concerned. Already a draft programme for the building and construction industry has been developed and is being critically examined. It is expected others will follow shortly. </para>
            <para>An overall picture of the metric position in other countries has been obtained through visits made by the  Chairman  and Executive Member of the Board to South Africa, Kenya, United Kingdom, France, Canada, United States of America, Japan and New Zealand. </para>
            <para>Attention has been given to the units proposed for use under metric conversion and lists have been prepared and will shortly be issued for those units recommended for common use and those whose use is still under review. </para>
            <para>A symbol has been adopted to signify metric conversion in Australia. The Board hopes that the symbol will be used widely, for instance on official and unofficial publications, technical specifications, and metrically marked packaged goods. </para>
            <para>The endeavours of the Standards Association of Australia to extend its facilities for the preparation of the new technical specifications which will be the prerequisite for many phases of metric conversion have been supported. </para>
            <para>A committee comprising senior personnel from the news media, a representative of the Australian News and Information Bureau and four members of the Board has been set up to advise the Board in regard to dissemination of information regarding metric conversion. This committee's major task has been the preparation of a brochure on the functions and composition of the Board and its committees, preliminary proposals for conversion and recommended usage in respect of units. This brochure is intended to provide key information to those desiring an early guidance regarding conversion.It will be made available to honourable senators before it is distributed generally. </para>
            <para>A nucleus of technical and administrative personnel has been established to provide the high calibre assistance needed to service and assist the. Board and its committees and provide advice on conversion to those throughout the community in need of it. It is not proving simple to obtain suitable staff in adequate numbers. </para>
            <para>Premises have been leased in Sydney and Mel  bourne for the main secretariat and a branch office respectively and will be ready for full occupation shortly. Branch offices will be established in other States as the need arises. </para>

The Department is still discussing the proposal with the Club and the New South Wales State Planning Authority. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline>the need for such an affirmation arises from the regrettable events which took place in January 1970 and January 1971. In those months the Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam,</inline> visited the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. In the course of his visit he was given wide Press coverage of his many statements. Those Press statements unfortunately destroyed what had previously been the bipartisan policy which generally had been exhibited by Australia to the people of Papua and New Guinea. They not only reduced the voice with which the Australian people could speak in the discharge of a trusteeship obligation but created within the Territory of Papua and New Guinea friction, suspicion and the seeds of distrust of Australia. I think it important that we recognise that what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> did in Papua and New Guinea was a disservice not only to the people of the Territory but to the Australian nation. I think that on examination the views he put forward will be found to be totally inconsistent with the precepts which his own Party has espoused over the years and totally inconsistent with what is the proper course that Australia should be following. </para>
          <para>We believe in this country not in democracy as an end but as a means to a higher and more desirable objective and we are endeavouring to give, in a very short space of time, to the people in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea a recognition of the advantages of this democratic method. The whole point of what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> has been saying in the Territory is a negation of the developing democracy in that country and for that reason, if not for many others, his remarks are to be deplored. </para>
          <para>We do not know why he made these trips. If they were fact finding trips it is surprising that on the very first occasion in 1970 when he visited the Territory after a lapse of some5 or 6 years he should state before he had gone outside of Port Moresby that the policy of the Australian Labor Party was self government for the Territory in 1972 and independence by 1976. The assertion of such a policy is totally inconsistent with the assumed motive of visiting New Guinea because he was desirous of finding out the facts. </para>

The Senate should not be used as the vehicle for the making of personal reflections upon and the suggestion of improper motives against a member of the other House of this Parliament. I do not have any objection to a discussion of the proposition which is before the Chair, but I do not think that personal reflections should be made upon the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives. </para>

          <para>The proposition which is before the Chair is a simple one. It involves the affirmation of a policy and discussion of that policy. While facts may be stated, I do not think that it is necessary to speak about the motives of any member of the other place. It would save a great deal of time and it would conform more to the practices and dignity of the Senate if honourable senators were to abstain entirely from making these suggestions. They do not help, and I do not think that they are necessary in order to permit this debate to be conducted. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy</inline> President,I ask you to direct <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> not to make any personal reflections against a member of the other place. </para>

              <para>- Addressing myself to the point of order, I wish to make a number of comments. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> has come into this chamber and, in the form of a point of order, has presumed to lecture us. He is the greatest offender in making imputations against others when he wants to make a case. The Senate is debating a matter of urgency, namely, the need to affirm a policy in relation to New Guinea. Important members- even insignificant members - of this Parliament who come into controversy when they are in conflict with the policy that we wish to affirm are relevant subjects to which to advert. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> referred to the Standing Orders. Standing order 413 provides that no senator shall allude to any debate or proceedings of the same session unless such allusion is relevant to the matter under discussion. No reference has been made to any debate. Standing order 416 states that no senator shall allude to any debate of the current session unless it is relevant. Standing order 418 simply states that no senator shall use offensive words against either House of the Parliament. </para>

          <para>I have been stressing the fact that there is need for an affirmation of this policy. I believe that there is need for a clear recognition of the fact that Australia respects the developing democracy of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea and will respect the wishes of the local people. I believe that there is a need for us in Australia to show that we will neither abandon the people of the Territory nor ignore the decisions of the democratic organ which we have helped them to establish. I believe also that it is implicit in the language of this statement of urgency that there is a need to assist the Australian Labor Party to clarify - if it An and if it wishes - whether it will acknowledge the role of the House of Assembly or impose its own inverted colonialism upon the people of the territory. </para>

              <para>- Yes, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whittorn.</inline> On arrival in Port Moresby he asserted a policy which is completely inconsistent with all that is contained in the platform of the Australian Labor Party. An examination of the section of its platform relating to New Guinea - a platform which was drawn up at a conference held in August 1969  -  will show that there is no suggestion of immediate self government and a 1976 target of independence for the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. What one will find in the platform is an indication that there will be a gradual abolition of the power of the Australian Government to veto the decisions of the House of Assembly and, set out in some detail, a tremendous number of provisions which an Australian Labor Party government would seek to enforce throughout the Territory. That approach, of course, is totally inconsistent with the idea of self government in early 1972. On that score there is some reason for the Australian Labor Party to indicate whether it proposes to abide by its own platform, whether it proposes to abide by the statement which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> has made or whether it is prepared to acknowledge that the House of Assembly in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea desires that the target dates for self government and independence should be set with its concurrence, which is a viewpoint which has been emphatically denied by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> on various occasions in the 2 years that he has visited the Territory. </para>

          <para>I think that it is important to recognise the nature of the obligation which Australia has in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. It is an obligation which has to be discharged in the light of what is in the best interests of the Australian people. It is also an obligation which has to be discharged in the light of what is in the best interests of the people of the Territory. The people of Australia and, until recently, members of both - all political parties - major political parties have believed that that obligation is best discharged with its twin facets by developing the social, political and economic abilities of the people of the Territory so that we can ultimately - when they have self government and independence - maintain friendly relations on the basis that one country has discharged honourably the trusteeship obligation which it had. For the proper discharge of this obligation there must be a belief and a trust within the Territory that Australia is pursuing policies designed to bring to the forefront the inherent abilities which these people have. </para>
          <para class="block">Likewise there should be on the part of Australia a recognition that these people have under proper training and through appropriate standards the ability to maintain themselves and to govern themselves in a way which will reflect credit upon not only themselves but also upon the way in which the trust authority has discharged its mandate. </para>
          <para>We should never forget that we hold Papua and New Guinea, as we now administer Papua with New Guinea, under an article of the United Nations Charter which states on what conditions trusteeship bodies may be established. Under Article 76 of the United Nations Charter - not by a decision of the Assembly or of the Council - we have an obligation to promote the political, economic, social and educational advancement of the inhabitants of the trust territories, and their progressive development towards self-government or independence as may be appropriate to the particular circumstances of each territory and its people and - I stress these words - the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned, and as may be provided by the terms of each trusteeship agreement. Under the Article we have clearly to recognise the need to have regard to the freely expressed wishes of the people of the Territory. </para>
          <para>For many years the Australian Government has maintained that it will work towards the self government and the independence of the people of the Territory in partnership with the House of Assembly, which was established in 1964. The Minister for External Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Barnes)</inline> and his predecessor, the present Governor-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Paul</inline> Hasluck, as Ministers have discharged an obligation which I think has redounded to their credit and which should be recognised by the Australian people. Under the policies laid down by them and officers of the Department tremendous advances have been made. 1 think the success, which is to be seen everywhere one goes in the Territory, is a tremendous tribute to the work of dedicated public servants in Australia and in the Territory. If Australians observed the progress that has been made in the Territory, they could hold only that view. When delivering a speech to the Institute of Political Science in January 1968, the Minister said: </para>

            <para>Let me re-state in formal terms another basic policy: that on the status of Papua and New Guinea and its futare relationship with Australia. There are 4 points: </para>
            <para>The choice of their future form of government is one for the people of the Territory; </para>
            <para>Changes which the majority of the people do not want will not be imposed on the Territory; </para>
            <para>It is the prerogative of the Territory people to terminate the present Territory status and take independent status if they wish to do so. Should the people wish to remain in association with Australia after self determination this will require the agreement of the Australian Government of the day; </para>
            <para>So far as decisions by Australia are required as to the nature of possible future forms of association that would be acceptable to Australia, such decisions cannot be made now, but should be made at the appropriate time by the Government of the day in the light of the circumstances then existing. </para>

          <para class="block">In each session the House of Assembly has appointed a Select Committee on Constitutional Development. That demonstrates the interest which these people are taking in the steps which they should pursue towards their ultimate self determination. The Select Committee on Constitutional Development has been in operation since June 1969. The presentation of its report to the House of Assembly is imminent. That Committee has been to Australia. Twice it has been throughout the Territory seeking views that can be weighed in its deliberations as to the recommendations to be made to the House of Assembly. The Territory is a developing democracy. I think it would be a tragedy if we in Australia did not allow these people to work out in their own way the form which their self determination should take. It would be inverted colonialism for us to say that they shall have, whether they like it or not, a certain type of self government imposed upon them. The Leader of the Opposition did not speak of complete self-government or of complete independence. He said, without prior consultation with anybody, that there could not be any self government or independence in relation to matters of external affairs or defence. Obviously statements such as that indicate the imposition of an authority rather than the evolution of a democratic process by the people concerned. </para>
          <para>I draw the Senate's attention to the fact that on 3 occasions the House of Assembly has indicated specifically to the United Nations and to the Australian Government that questions of self-government and independence are for the members of the House of Assembly. That was first stated in the To Lim an resolution of 1964. It was reiterated in March 1969 when the House of Assembly resolved: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>That we the elected representatives of the people of Papua and New Guinea desire to convey to the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, the Trusteeship Council and the General Assembly of the United Nations Organisation the expressed wish of the people that they, the people, and they alone, be  allowed  to decide when the  time  is ripe for self government in Papua and Ne.v Guinea, and the form that such government will take and the people's further firm conviction that the road to self government can best be travelled with one guide - and that guide the Administering Authority, and thai undue pressure from without can lead only to that disruption, chaos and bloodshed which the people have observed with great alarm in certain newly independent countries. </para>

          <para class="block">I think resolutions of that character reflect a very healthy attitude that we in Australia would do well to recognise. That has been the bi-partisan policy which characterised the Australian approach to this Territory until the unfortunate remarks made by the Leader of the Opposition on his recent visit to the Territory. I have said that the view he expressed was held before he had embarked on any fact finding tour of the Territory. He constantly urged not only at that first interview but at subsequent interviews and in subsequent statements that the Territory of Papua and New Guinea have self-government in 1972 irrespective of the wishes of the local people. Interspersed with such comments were statements that persons who disagreed with him were foolish or stooges of the Administration. He thereby reflected upon the persons about whom he was speaking and sowed distrust in what should be an area of confidence as to the intentions and motives of the members of the Administration. On his last trip to the Territory <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> had a conference with members of the Select Committee on Constitutional Development.

If they take the viewpoint of the General Assembly of last year they will have an expression by the General Assembly that Australia should fix target dates; but the view of both the Australian Government and of the House of Assembly is that those target dates should not now be fixed. </para>

          <para>If one asks which is the more consistent with the United Nations Charter then obviously the United Nations Charter says that self determination must be made in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the people. The further point may be made that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> in his comments in the Territory and about the Territory has ignored the vast area of self-government which already exists. In the middle of 1970 a wider responsibility Wai conferred upon the elected members of the House of Assembly who comprise the Administrator's Executive Council. They have the final decision in a range of areas from taxation to local government and education - vast steps which have been made towards self-government. All of this has been done in co-operation, in confidence and on a basis of trust between the House of Assembly, the Administrator's Executive Council and the Australian Government. This is sought to be set out nought by a politician who seeks to bring Australian divisiveness in politics into the New Guinea scene where it will not exist and where it need not exist. I believe that we in this Senate owe it not only to the people of Australia but also to the people of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea to affirm positively that we respect their developing democracy and that we will not impose upon them self-government or independence contrary to their wishes, it is up to the Australian Labor Party to indicate clearly and emphatically whether it believes in democracy in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea or whether, contrary to democracy, it will impose the wishes of its own authoritarian party. I hope this motion is supported. </para>

A fiery speech has been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> suggesting that the Senate should adjourn to a somewhat different time tomorrow morning in order to discuss the question of the future of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea.

          <para class="block">The honourable senator's case has been that it is necessary to discuss this matter. We do not mind the discussion taking place although we do not support the motives of the honourable senator in raising the matter, because the reality is that he has 2 bases. One basis is the democracy owed to the people of Papua and New Guinea and apparently the second is that the Australian Labor Party is not observing its policy. Both bases are fallacious. I shall deal with the second one first. The policy of the Australian Labor Party in regard to Papua and New Guinea appears under the heading 'Papua New Guinea' in the 'Platform, Constitution and Rules' of the Australian Labor Party. It states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Australia's administration of Papua and New Guinea must be to work to bring about independence and an economically viable nationhood as early as possible. </para>

We know the history of the acquisition of the 2 territories but, for practical purposes, they are both now regarded as territories which Australia holds in trustee ship. We are trustees for the United Nations. We have certain obligations to the United Nations in respect of those territories. Like any other trustee, we ought to be carrying out the terms of our trusteeship and obeying the directions which are given to us by the principal to whom we have the obligation. I suppose there can be no greater principal in the world than the assembled nations of the world. Those assembled nations have given certain directions to Australia. Over the years they have made various pronouncements about the necessity for freeing the colonial peoples and not allowing any excuses - whether it be the backwardness of the people, their lack of education or lack of performance - for colonial peoples not proceeding rapidly to self-government and independence. </para>

              <para>- They have, yes. This country has been criticised not only by various organs of the United Nations and by the Trusteeship Council but also by numbers of its members. Outside those formal agencies it is known that Australia has come in for criticism. It is also known - it is a regrettable fact of life - that Australia is handicapped in its presentation of views on other international affairs because of its fear that if it opens its mouth on any subject at all the other nations will hammer into Australia because it is one of the colonial powers. </para>

I was there, and I think that  of  all the countries in the world - I may be corrected but I think I am right - Australia did not put forward one motion on human rights, nor did it join as a co-sponsor of any amendment on the question of human rights. Honourable senators know how other countries join in by the dozen to cosponsor motions. If honourable senator. applied their minds purely to policy they might say that it is a disgrace that, in the year that was set aside <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> consider the whole topic of human rights, Australia,  Which  once had a proud position in the advancement of democracy and its contributions to human rights, was not cosponsor to one motion. The secret ballot system, for example, is referred to all over the world as the Australian ballot. Australia had a proud history in the emancipation of women and in all sorts of matters, but no longer has it a proud history. In international affairs  a  shadow hangs over Australia. Everyone who is aware of these matters knows the truth of what I am saying. This Government is afraid of becoming involved in any disputation because it will inevitably be met with the answer: 'Look what you are doing in Papua and New Guinea and to the Aboriginals.

              <para>- Of course. The United Nations has called upon Australia to prescribe, in consultation with the freely elected representatives of the people, a specific timetable. The whole burden of what was put by the honourable senator in his speech was this: 'We will do nothing except leave it to the people there. They are ignorant people. They are not properly educated. They are much too far behind to have independence. They are a dependent people not. fit for self-government and not fit for independence. We will leave it to them to make a prescription. We will leave it to them to take the initiative. We will leave it to these poor people who are not fit for self-government, not fit for independence and not fit to look after themselves.' </para>

          <para>The United Nations has called upon Australia to consult with these people and to prescribe a timetable. As trustees, our obligation to them is to do that. But that is the very thing that this Government will not do. There can be no escaping from it by saying: 'We will sit on our backsides and wait until these people, somehow or other, pull themselves up by their boot.stramps, because they axe not fit to look after themselves'. That is the view of members of the Government parties here. These people are supposed to be able to carry out this task on their own, although the United Nations has said that it is Australia's task to make a prescription in consultation with them and it is not for them to do it by themselves. That is the key to the whole matter. The Government wants to sit back and ignore what the United Nations has said. It is neglecting to prescribe a specific timetable. It is neglecting its obligation to the United Nations. </para>
          <para>Who are the members of the United Nations? Who are the people who would go out of their way to make this decision? What small group of nations would set out to give this kind of direction to Australia? They must surely be the enemies of Australia or people who are just trying to create trouble - this is what the Government thinks - not people who understand what is happening in New Guinea. The Government thinks that these people do not understand the problems of colonial people; that they are remote people who would not really know what it is all about. Members of the Australian Government, in their paternalism, think that this matter ought to be left to the people there. They  say:  'It will be a long time yet. Do not let us take any immediate steps.' I seem to remember somebody on the Government benches mentioning a period of 1,000 years in relation to the people of New Guinea. </para>
          <para>Let me continue with this important and, I believe, most recent pronouncement by the United Nations General Assembly. It further requested the administering power to intensify and accelerate the education and technical and administrative training of the indigenous peoples of the Territories and the localisation of the Public Service, and requested the Trusteeship Council and the Special Committee to continue to examine this question and to report thereon to the General Assembly at its Twenty-sixth Session. What was the voting on this question? The nations in favour included Algeria, Argentina, Australia. Bar bar as. Belgium - the Belgians are familiar with the problems of colonies - Brazil, Bulgaria- </para>

I am not surprised to find that he asks that question. I will tell him what year it was. It was 1970. The date was 14th December 1970. In the resolution there are some pretty specific directions to Australia as to what to do. I will tell honourable senators opposite what the position of my Party is on this matter, if they want to know it. We stand for supporting the United Nations. </para>

          <para>Australia has adhered to the Charter of the United Nations which contains declarations against colonialism. We have also bound ourselves to observe the decisions of the United Nations. Here is a decision of the United Nations. It would not matter if there were dissent; but in fact this resolution was carried without dissent, lt is our clear obligation to observe it. If the Government does not observe it, what does it intend to do? Does it intend to go out and talk to the people of Australia about how important it is to have law and order? Here is an international law. Australia has bound itself to observe decisions of this body. Our country has accepted trusteeship obligations to the United Nations in respect of the Territory, and it is our obligation to observe them. The position is as simple as that. That is what it boils down to. </para>
          <para>The Labor Party is proud of what has been done by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> and the other members of this Party who have gone to New Guinea and endeavoured to awaken the people of New Guinea to what they need to do in order to effectuate the wishes of the United Nations and to have self respect for themselves. It is the right of every man on earth and every society to have freedom. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> says that we should not impose self government or independence upon people. We are long past the day when the world will tolerate any kind of slavery, subjection or dependence. This country is not entitled to impose or to continue any kind of subjection or dependence on other people. I do not believe that any group of people can request us to remain in the position of masters or imperialists. We have rights. The United Nations has seen and has stated clearly what should be done. We should act in accordance with its wishes promptly and fully and without any reservation. Therefore I believe that the proposition with which we should be dealing is not one in the terms put by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> but one in the terms which I propose to outline. Since there seems to be some doubt whether one can amend the terms of a subject matter of urgency I ask for leave to move: </para>

            <para>- The Australian Democratic Labor Party will support the motion that has been moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood.</inline> Frankly, we do not see how anyone could oppose a motion which merely asserts that self government or independence should not be imposed upon the people of the Territory contrary to the freely expressed wishes of the people through their parliamentary representatives. There has been some discussion on the question whether the people of New Guinea are ready for independence. There has been a suggestion that anybody who hints that they are not is not playing the game. I think independence is inevitable and I think it will come soon. However, I also want to make it clear that I do not believe that independence will come because New Guinea is united or ready for indepencene. I do not believe it will come because the Government of this country believes in its heart that New Guinea is ready for independence. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In New Guinea today there is a large number  of  completely unsophisticated people who would not know the meaning of independence if you were to mention it to them. There is a more sophisticated section which has some understanding of what is involved. The latter group is vocal, but not over-vocal in expressing its opinions. At the moment the people of that section are inclined to go for independence  Got  so much because in their hearts many of them believe that they are entirely ready for it, but because they think that it must come and that outside world opinion will force it on them. Therefore they think that they must accept it. </para>
          <para>I believe that independence for New Guinea is inevitable and within a very short period. Of course, it is easy to impose independence upon a country. It will be a very different thing when that country has to be govern mentally and economically viable. I have  no  hesitation  in  saying that I do not think that New Guinea is yet ready to become governmentally or economically viable, but I accept the situation that the people of New Guinea will be given their independence regardless of whether they are ready for it. Independence will be imposed upon New Guinea, not because of the attitude of the people there and not because of the attitude of the Australian Government. It will be imposed upon New Guinea because of international pressures, particularly from the United Nations. </para>

I would like the people who talk so glibly of independence for New Guinea to show me that when independence comes New Guinea will not break out into another Congo. I would like them lo prove to me that the violent antagonism between the highlanders and the people in the large towns on the coast will not burst forth into extreme violence. 1 would like them to prove to me that New Guinea will not follow the course of events in Africa and end up under the dictatorship of an army trained soldier from the Pacific Islands Regiment, or under the dictatorship of a number of others who have been trained in that field. </para>

          <para>In the circumstances, and conceding as I said before that because of pressures from outside which we were not game to resist independence will come, I want now to refer to statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> to show that in my view they have been injudicious and reckless and have not contributed to the welfare of the people of New Guinea. I do not know why he made those statements. I assume he made them because of his problems with the left wing of his Party and the feeling that New Guinea was one field in which he might be militant enough to conciliate the left wing without regard to the consequences. He has assured the people of New Guinea of independence by a definite date. That is a remarkable promise. </para>
          <para>He did not say to them: 'In the event of a Labor government taking office we will do so and so.' He made the people of New Guinea a definite promise that they would be independent by a certain date. He went even further and informed them that there would be no problems about money with independence because Australia would pick up the bill. I contest the right of any Australian leader to give a blank cheque io people who, he says, will be independent of this country within 2 or 3 years. I believe that the Australian taxpayers would regard such a promise with a good deal of reservation. Is it wise to say to the people of a country approaching independence that an outside body will pick up the bill? </para>

              <para>- Many nations are providing loans and other forms of credit for Indonesia. I would like to know how many nations today which have granted independence to countries formerly under their control have informed them, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> has informed New Guinea, that once those countries become independent their bills will be paid for them. Look at the situation in New Guinea today. No doubt Australia's attitude has conduced to that kind of promise. Last week I spoke to a man with some knowledge of the affairs of New Guinea. He pointed out to me that under the kind of self-government which New Guinea has at present Australia is providing about $300m a year in aid and works. 1 have not checked that figure, but whatever it is, his claim was that a considerable sum was being provided. My informant told me that the Australian Government has relinquished any right Co say how that money shall be spent. The determination of that money which Australia provides is now, in his view, in the hands of the self-governing people of New Guinea. How many senators would be prepared to say that as costs rise and more money is wanted we will underwrite such a system, and that we will provide the money without any say as to how it will be spent? That is the kind of promise that has been made to the people of New Guinea. I think it is entirely unrealistic. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>When the people of New Guinea become independent we will continue to give them aid. I think we will always do that, but to say to them that there will be a blank cheque available for their expenses once they become independent is not the kind of promise that ought to be made by an Australian leader. It can give rise only to hopes and expectations which the people of Australia may fulfil in the future but which many of them would be unlikely to want to fulfil. I believe, therefore, that in talking to the people of New Guinea we should explain to them particularly the economic facts of life. We should inform them that if theirs is to be an independent country it will be necessary for it to a big degree to be economically viable. We should point out to them that this will involve many problems. Independence is not a matter of breaking out a flag on a mast and then declaring a party; independence is something that involves very serious problems. When independence is given to a country, one of the first things required by that country is an administrative class or group. Where are the administrators in New Guinea today? There are some who, 1 am pleased to see, have been given positions of considerable importance, but there does not exist in New Guinea today anything like the number of trained administrators that would be necessary to enable independence to function. </para>
          <para>One of the things which obviously would be required if a country such as New Guinea were to function would be a proper system of education. But what is the situation at present? I spoke to some members of the highlands group of parliamentarians when they were in Australia and they informed me that in their view there had been a most unfair allocation of Australian assistance to Papua and New Guinea. They pointed out that because the urban proletariat, if they could be so called, in the urban cities near the coast were more vocal than others, in those areas of New Guinea there were secondary schools, technical schools and even a university. Yet up in the highlands, apparently because the people were not so vocal, they did not have primary schools even. Everybody is in favour of independence for Papua and New Guinea, but let us not fail to recognise the immense difficulties of running an independent country in a place where the problems of economic viability are very considerable, where there is not an administrative class and where education has not attained a standard at which the great bulk of the people can understand even what independence means, let alone function under it. </para>

              <para>- I am not in favour of speeding up education in the case of people such as those in Papua and New Guinea. To some degree in some areas these people are still stone age people. It may seem all right to some people to speed up education for people of that kind and to plunge them into a twentieth century civilisation overnight, but experience has shown that when that happens it is not altogether to the advantage of the people concerned. I want these people to be given every assistance and I want them to be educated, but I do not think that we can turn them into functioning democrats overnight. </para>

          <para>The attitude of my Party is that whether or not we think the people of Papua and New Guinea are ready for independence, they are going to get it. We must face the facts and be realistic; they will gain independence in the very near future. What is the best way to deal with the situation? My Party accepts that independence will come, but my Party says that any attempt to have a centralised government controlling the whole of the area is bound to fail. lt can result only in bitterness and hate between different groups, it will cause tribal fragmentation and, in some cases, civil war. The attitude of my Party is that we must introduce a federal system of autonomous States that would provide for cases such as Bougainville that want independence. Let us introduce a decentralised scheme of independence of autonomous States. Those States could have a central council for the discussion of common problems. We do not believe that an independent New Guinea could function effectt- lively under any system other than one where there was a federal system with decentralised control. Bearing in mind that we accept that independence is coming in the near future, our view is that a system of the kind I have mentioned will have to be introduced. </para>

When this was refused he endeavoured to move for a suspension ot Standing Orders to achieve this objective. When this happened we saw a great panic in the benches on the Government side of the chamber because honourable senators, opposite feared to debate this part of the subject. They were frightened of the monster that they had created by the introduction of this matter into this chamber. </para>
          <para>Let us consider some of the remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood.</inline> I am being very charitable when I say that he initiated this debate for two reasons, the first of which was the protection of the white controlled monopolies in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. Somebody must be spokesman on their behalf because they fear independence coming to that country. They fear that their businesses and factories might be nationalised when the people take over and administer the country on their own behalf. On many occasions in this chamber <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> has hern the Government spokesman and the apologist for the Australian policy of colonialism. Australia is the last major country in the world that indulges in colonialism to the extent that we do in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. Somebody must apologise for the Government's behaviour and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> has always been a very vocal expert in this field. He claimed that the House of Assembly on numerous occasions had said that it did not want independence yet. </para>
          <para>Let us consider the make up of the House of Assembly. Right from the inception of the first Parliament in the Territory in 1964 there have been appointed members in the Parliament. The appointed members are in the position where they can dominate the thinking of many of the elected representatives. There is a fair grouping of white people who want to retain the present system; they do not want to see any change for the benefit of people outside, f am delighted to see that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> has come back into the chamber. The people to whom 1 have referred do not want to see any change in the system; they want to be able to dominate others. With few exceptions the Pang Party is about the only organised political group in the House of Assembly. The planters., the business people and members of the Liberal Party are afraid of some sort of democratic government being instituted. So that the kips and others can control and dominate the thinking of other elected members in the House of Assembly, they, in conjunction with the appointed members, are able to get through the sort of resolution that their counterparts in this country need and want. 1 suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood's</inline> argument is completely fallacious when he tries to advance this crocodile tears story of how the House of Assembly has carried these numerous resolutions. </para>

              <para>- 1 accept that the honourable senator's knowledge of New Guinea has been gained from his observations on the very comfortable routine of the cocktail circuit. As 1 have said before, there are people in industry who are using <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> to preserve their own monopolies. That is the only reason why he has raised this matter in the Senate today. The missions comprise the other big group of people who play a dominant role in Papua and New Guinea. It is true that the missions have done tremendous work it i many fields. It is equally true that those who have come under the influence of the missions have been taught about God to matriculation standard. But the education that they need to operate in any sort of society is not up to primary standard. This is one of the unfortunate factors that we have to face. It is there and it has to be faced. </para>

          <para class="block">Australia has failed to carry out the first sub-section of Article 76. We have failed in the field of education. There are tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, of youngsters who have not yet received an opportunity to have a primary education, let alone a secondary education in Papua and New Guinea. We know from reading reports and listening to people who have knowledge of life in that country that the health programme has not been implemented either. </para>
          <para>There was an attempt early in the 1960s to set up a trade union organisation in Papua and New Guinea. But who blew the stomach out of trade unions there? It was the planters and the employers with the aid of the pro-Government kiaps. It has been said on several occasions in recent weeks that if you are a member of a trade union in Papua and New Guinea you will be replaced in your job or you will not be employed. This again is part of the society to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> subscribes. The Public Service Association has fought a continuing running battle with the Government to get basic justice, both for indigenous officers - and for expatriates. It did not know where it was going until recent times but now it has a programme and we hope that the Government will do something about fortifying its belief in the job it is trying to do. Members of the Public Service Association were not able to implement a programme because the Commonwealth Government and the Minister for External Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Barnes)</inline> would not let them. They have been hounded all along the line. This is typical of the way that those favourable to the Australian Government have disrupted trade unionism at any level. In other words. 1 think that honourable senators on the Government side would like to see the Territory remain the Angola of Australia. People of this side of the chamber do not want that to happen. </para>
          <para>There are tens of thousands of people in Papua and New Guinea who are prepared to obtain independence and if the Government is going to stick to its current attitudes in perpetuity sooner or later blood will be spilt there. The Government will force these people to seize their independence by the use of guns and bullets if necessary. </para>
          <para>The Australian Labor Party attitude of setting down a programme for independence is the right one, the humane one and the Christian one. If the Government wants to keep the people of the Territory under subjection because of its racist attitude it will pay for it in the long run. But it will excuse the shooting of these people by saying they are trying to create a civil war. </para>

              <para>-  Thank you. It is interesting to note that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> cannot get even my name correct so we cannot take much notice of the other things he said. However he did say - this will be borne out tomorrow in print in Hansard - that we had to say how the money would be spent. Yet he said that gradually we can give them independence. If the Government is not going to give the House of Assembly and the Territory the right to decide how money shall, be spent, whether it is raised internally by taxes or whether it comes from this country as part of our quota of foreign aid, how is it going to take these people along this slow, tortuous and gradual path towards independence that the honourable senator was so delighted to tell us was the right thing to do? Right throughout his speech there were very serious overtones of paternalism and racialism. In other words, he says that these people are black: let us keep them down there for another 200 years and then maybe we will allow them a little more independence. Perhaps we might allow them to spend the money in the petty cash tin because they will have developed some sort of spirit of responsibility by that time. </para>

              <para>- There is no need to refer to the Victorian ALP. It is well known that when deciding upon leaders in your Party the names are drawn out of a. hat and you squabble about it afterwards. I suggest, you stay right away from that subject. You are under the complete subjugation of the Liberal Party. You can do nothing else but run backwards and forwards. Even when you have to vote on great social problems such as we have spoken about here today, you are under the nail of the Liberal Party. </para>

          <para>I suggest that the correct way to handle this situation "is the manner stated today by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy).</inline> We ought to have the right, in accordance with the requirements of the United Nations, to lay down a timetable so that these people know where they are going and so that they can plan for their own independence. To achieve this in the right way we must step up the education programme. Far from cutting down the contributions or telling them how the money should be used, as was suggested by my friend over here on the left who comes: from the right section, we ought to be increasing contributions in the 3 fields I have referred to, health, education and the overall administration. By doing this we would be making a worthwhile contribution towards the immediate independence of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. I suggest, in all sincerity, that for Government supporters to move a motion of the nature moved here this afternoon in this chamber is a negation of all things that are democratic, lt is a negation of the freedom to Which these people are entitled. It is a negation of human values because the things that they need in their society are exactly the same as we heed in our society. ' </para>

          <para class="block">The Commonwealth of Australia has been obedient to Articles1 and 76b of the United Nations Charter in pursuing its policies, yet theAustralian Labor Party has stated this afternoon through the mouthpiece of its Leader in this chamber, that no lens vol ens - whether the people of Papua or New Guinea like it or not - independence is going to be forced on them by at least 1976.I believe that independence will come to Papua and New Guinea. I also believe that we are being unjustly pressured by what is in my opinion an illegal committee which has appointed itself to the General Assembly.I refer to the organisation known as the Committee of Twenty-Four. Most respectable nations, including Australia, have resigned from this body. I understand that two of its representatives are attached to the Trusteeship Council's mission which is in the area at the present moment. </para>
          <para>I have talked to representatives of the Committee of Twenty-Four.I know that they arc determined to force Australia to make the people of Papua and New Guinea independent. A clash has resulted between he2 major political parties in this House and in the other place as on whether the Australian people and their. government owe a responsibility to the indigenous people of Papua and New Guinea or whether they are to be obedient to an irrational attitude which has been taken by the Committee of Twenty-Four in the United Nations. </para>
          <para>During the debate this afternoon I heard an interjection about the breakdown of government in African countries. I heard from the Opposition side of the chamber a mild voice say: 'Oh, yes. Well, there may have been mistakes'. I am highly resentful of the expression 'there may have been mistakes'. It was said by one of those curious characters who go round mouthing slogans about universal brotherhood, who make contemptuous noises about colonialists, imperialists, capitalists and this, that and the other; but when things go bad, when massacres occur, when governments are destroyed and when vile government is forced upon people by brutality, the ideologue of that sort says:'Well, perhaps we were a bit hasty'. </para>
          <para>The attitude of every honourable senator on this side of the chamber is that Australia must mark what has happened in other parts of the world, particularly in Africa, and ensure that it does not happen in New Guinea. There may be arguments about whether it should have a Westminster style government. I make the prophesy that if we give them independence with a Westminster form of government there will be within 5 years a presidential system of government. I believe that it will, be a one party state, as is the position in nearly every state in Africa, where the trappings of democracy may be maintained but stark anarchy is the method by which the governments operate and the people cower under the heel of single party governments which arc reinforced by secret police and often a brutal military command. </para>

          <para>The Australian Labor Party will not send a battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment there to try to restore order. This afternoon it was quite clearly signalled here that the process that will be used will be to instruct the Australian Ambassador to the United Nations to raise the matter in the General Assembly. The matter will then be dealt with by the Security Council. From New York a peacekeeping expedition will be mounted. Countries in South East Asia will be invited to provide the troops. Australia will be invited to provide the aircraft. Into Papua and New Guinea will flow the kind of United Nations organisation that was stationed in the Congo when one battalion, provided by a South East Asian nation, had to be sent home at the end of 6 months because the battalion had 1,000 mcn and there were 1.000 summaries nf evidence against them for rape and for robbery with violence. That kind of thing will happen. </para>
          <para>Indonesia will object. It will say that it will not allow .foreign troops into the area because this is a sphere of influence of Indonesia. We will be in trouble with the powerful neighbour to the north - Indonesia. It will probably take .unilateral action to send troops across the border. That action will be upheld .. by the United Nations. When a similar situation happened in relation to West. Irian, the United Nations paid no attention to the wishes of the people of West Irian. It was handed over willy nilly to Indonesia. For the last 2 years Indonesia has sent the best of its paratroop command into West Irian rounding up natives and shooting them down right, left and centre. It is to. avoid these kinds of happenings that, the Commonwealth Government is pursuing a policy which is in obedience to the Changer of the General Assembly. That Charter cannot be changed by the committee -of 24 or by any other self-appointed committee in the United Nations. Australia is. pursuing the policy, in accordance with Article 76, that independence will be given to the people of the trust territories concerned when they freely express a wish to be independent. </para>
          <para>I repeat that there is- no attempt to enforce an Australian overlords hip on the people of Papua and New Guinea. In obedience to the charter of the United Nations the Commonwealth Government is determined to pursue the path that it is pursuing at present and is determined that the <inline font-style="italic">2i</inline> million to 2$ million people in Papua and New Guinea will -not become a quivering mass under the control of men who will seize power- and -they will seize power as men have seized power in Africa - and who will use the sanctions of armed police, security services and perhaps the soldiery to impose their will on the people. </para>
          <para>I redirect the attention of the Senate to the remarks made earlier by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> when he took up the point that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> made when he was in New Guinea. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> said that he would see that the Australian contribution to aid abroad was raised to 1 per cent of the gross national product. He said that the people of Papua and New Guinea need have no fear as massive subventions would be continued from Australia to the people of Papua and New Guinea. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> correctly pointed out that the most ludicrous of all situations that could be contrived by. rational governments would be to band hundreds of millions of dollars to a single party government to spend in any way it liked. The money would come from the Australian taxpayer via the Australian Treasury. A similar situation to that which occurred, for example, in Ghana would occur in Papua and New Guinea. When Ghana was granted independence it received from Crown agents £800m accruing to it from the sale of its cocoa crops during the war. In 5 to 7 years the country was bankrupt This could happen in Papua and New Guinea if we force its people into assuming the roles, responsibilities and trappings of a modern State before they are ready. Therefore, I support the motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood.</inline> I hope it is endorsed overwhelmingly by the Senate when the vote is taken tonight. </para>

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack's speech was a remarkable one because it was so backward. The honourable senator is living back in the days of feudalism, in the days of one-party government by those who had the opportunity - not the wealth, but the opportunity - to receive an education. The speech seemed to me to be quite a strange one, coming as it did from an honourable senator who is a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs. He dipped into feudalism in an attempt to justify the motion. I shall treat the remainder of his comments, dealing with the Australian Labor Party, with the contempt that they deserve. The honourable senator quoted from Article 76 of the United Nations Charter which provides that independence should be given to a trust territory only when it freely expresses a desire, of its own will, for independence. What opportunity have the people of Papua and New Guinea had to express their will as to whether they would take independence today, in 5 years time, in 10 years time or at any other time? What steps has this Government taken to determine the will of the people? lt has not taken one step to determine the will of the people. The only way that the will of the people can be determined is for the Government to hold a referendum, if the Government wants to ascertain the will of the people it should conduct a referendum. </para>

              <para>- Then this is another gerrymander to which honourable senator's opposite subscribe. A similar situation arose with Australian Aboriginals. The bosses on the stations and on the missions voted on behalf of the Aboriginals. This is the type of government that honourable senators opposite want and this is the type of government that they want 'in Papua and New Guinea, lt is the type of government that the Democratic Labor Party wants. It wants a federation of States. Where will the surveyors draw the lines? Are the tribal boundaries to be the boundaries of the various States? There are about 1,000 different tribes in Papua and New Guinea. Will there be 1,000 different States? What kind of government do honourable senators opposite want to impose upon the people? </para>

          <para>I return to the motion. Standing order 64 can be used if an honourable senator wants to bring before the Senate something that, in his opinion, -should be dealt with by the Senate urgently. The only urgency I can see in the present situation arises from the fact that in 1970 and 1971 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> was so successful in Papua and New Guinea that it is necessary for the Government to affirm its policy. That is the only urgency. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> said that, if he were the Prime Minister, he would grant self government in 1972 and independence in 1976. What urgency could there be for this motion other than that the Government is unsure of itself or that the Government is afraid that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> has been too successful in Papua and New Guinea? That is the only urgency that would warrant the matter being brought before the Senate at this time. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline>spoke about Australia's obligations in this Trust Territory. I invite honourable senators to listen carefully to what I am about to say. I may not have the honourable senator's exact words and I shall apologise later if I have wrong sense of what he said. Me said:  . . the obligation to be discharged in the light of what is in the best interests of Australia'. This immediately brings into focus the interests of the Australians and other people in the trust Territory. The second proposition put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> was whether the obligation was to be discharged in the light of what was in the best interests of the people of Papua and New Guinea. So the interests of the people of Papua and New Guinea come second to the interests of Australia. We of the Australian Labor Party believe that the interests of the people of Papua and New Guinea should come first, not second. One may wonder why these things have to be recounted. </para>
          <para>What has the Australian Government done in Papua and New Guinea? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> said that on the fringes of the cities one could have a high school and a university. If one travels to Western Australia, one will find only one university - in Perth. There is nothing in the north west for the people except a couple of junior high schools. When I was in. Papua and New Guinea schools were situated in the highlands. I do not know what has happened to them now. I do know that not many students were going to the schools, but at least the schools were there. This is the knowledge which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> has of the Territory about which he proposes to speak. </para>

              <para>- The honourable senator would quote anything that would make a case to suit himself. He should go and find out the truth a,nd not quote what other people say. What was the position with Bougainville Copper Pty Ltd? What were the conditions' which the Minister tried to impose upon the people of Bougainville Island about Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Ltd taking over the copper deposit on that island? The indigenous people of Papua and New Guinea were able to negotiate a much better agreement with the company than was the Administration representing this Government which tried to enforce its agreement upon the people with tear gas and weapons. We are supposed to be looking after the people of Papua and New Guinea. We have given away everything that they had. We have given away the massive copper deposits on Bougainville Island and obtained a 20 per cent interest for the indigenous people. We lent the money to the Administration to take up the shareholding. But the indigenous people were able to do better than the Minister for External Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Barnes)</inline> was able to do. </para>

          <para>What is the position with the off-shore oil in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea? It is governed by the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act. lt is interesting to know that this legislation does not stand up. The Senate will know.. about that in a short time. But the important thing about it is that section I I of the Act applies to the laws of Papua and New Guinea and into the waters adjacent to the Territory. What laws are there for the Territory of Papua and New Guinea Which are capable of being extended into this area? But we have given the exploiters of this country permit areas, each over" 10,000 square miles, for this purpose. There- is a massive gas supply in the Gulf of Papua. It is waiting there for the Phillips oil ' company to exploit it. What are the .indigenous people of Papua and New Guinea going to get out of it? What are they getting out of the <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> million acres of land in. the Hagen Valley which the Government gave tow. R. Carpenter and Co. Ltd on .which to grow lea. What are they getting out of it? W. R. Carpenter and Co. Ltd is getting all the profits. </para>
          <para>Has anything been done to see that the indigenous people have a rightful share in the mineral deposits on the Fly River? What about the land ownership problem which is causing all the trouble on the Gazelle Peninsula among the Mataungan people? What is the Government doing to settle that dispute among -the people. Who holds all the timber reservations in the territory? They are not held by the indigenous people, but by outsiders, the bloody pirates as they are called. They own half the assets of Papua and New Guinea; that is Burns Philp &amp; Co. Ltd. No-one can gainsay that. In any case, the timber concessions are capable of being given to the indigenous people by a special Act of Parliament. Under the present legislation loans were supposed to be made io the indigenous people to enable them to set up on the spot sawmills to handle the timber. Under the Act about 4 loans have been made. Anyway, the amount to be lent under the Act was a miserable £5,000. How could a mill be set up with a capital of £5,000- $10,000? Supporters of the Government should have a look at this sort of thing again and see Why the Government is trying to conserve the Territory in its present position. Honourable senators opposite say that they want to give the indigenous people self-determination when they want it of their own free will; but they will not give them an opportunity to express their own free will. Honourable senators opposite object to the Australian Labor Party setting times. They will not come to the party and say. '1972 is too early for self-government. We think it might be 1975. 1976 is too early for independence. Perhaps we could grant it in 1 980.' No, honourable senators opposite just sit back and say it will be when., the people there want to have self determination. But honourable senators opposite do. not take one step to give the people an opportunity to say whether they want self determination. </para>
          <para>The Government flew 2 delegates to the United Nations in 1968 to tell the United Nations that the people of Papua and' New Guinea were quite satisfied with the efforts which the Australian Government was putting into the development of Papua and New Guinea, lt sent 2 people to convince the United Nations that its own policy was the correct policy. A lot has been said about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> being the big bad boy in the Territory; New Guinea is probably the best sugar cane growing area in the' world. Deliberately the Government has an Australian Country Party member as Minister for External Territories. He is the Minister for External Territories for one' purpose, and that is to prevent the people of Papua and New Guinea from growing sugar cane. The day that Papua and' New Guinea starts . to grow sugar cane the Queensland sugar industry will collapse. </para>
          <para class="block">That is the very reason why <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Barnes,</inline> a Country Party member, is the Minister for External Territories, and not any other reason. In 1964 when I was in Papua and New Guinea I was told by the people that if the Australian Government would not let them grow sugar at that time, on the day that they obtained their independence they would start to put every acre they possibly could under sugar. That is one of the reasons they are not being granted their self-government and their independence - because of the vested interests of the bushwhackers in the corner. It is time this Government stood on its own feet, accepted its responsibility and told these people: 'Get yourselves ready. You are going to have self-government in a certain time and you are going to have independence in another time. We will not forget to help you but we are not going to continue to help you if you are not prepared to help yourselves.' I oppose the motion. </para>

            <para>-  Honourable senators have now heard 3 incredible speeches. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator- Cant's</inline> speech was irrelevant to the motion. It was a good Socialist speech full of envy and hate of all those who have succeeded and who have been prepared to risk their capital in development. I do not wish to refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cant's</inline> speech because . it was irrelevant. However he did ask this question not once but twice: 'What opportunity is there to find the will of the people?'. Then he suggested that we have given no opportunity to the people to express their will. This attitude' is - typical of the 3 speeches we have heard. It shows a complete and utter lack of knowledge- of the situation in New Guinea. The people have the machinery to express their will.  First of all, they can do so through the House, of  Assembly, the members of which are elected by the free vote of the people and which represents the people of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. They have a .second opportunity of expressing their' will through the Select Committee on Constitutional Development, which has been for many months visiting .every village and hamlet throughout the Territory of Papua and New Guinea to ascertain' the wishes and will of the people. At the moment- it intends to present a report . in-  March, I- believe. So there are these ?. ways in which the people can express their will. I will come back to this topic in a moment. </para>

          <para>I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> out of his kindness did the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> a disservice in moving that his time be extended to half an hour, because quite obviously he had the greatest difficulty in speaking for that time.  His  effort was pitiful, to put it in the most kindly way. He not only misquoted the United Nations but he also was forced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack to admit that one of the resolutions provided for consultation with the people to ascertain their freely expressed will. This is exactly the policy of the Australian Government. If the freely expressed will of the people is not for self-government in 1972. what will the Labor Party do? Will it ignore the freely expressed will of the people? I believe it would. In fact, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> has already indicated that he has no regard for the freely expressed will of the people. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack read out the charter of the United Nations. Article 76 clearly states: </para>

              <para>can never understand what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> is saying, but I, think I heard him correctly because he is always accusing people of racism and throwing, around allegations of this sort. I have a theory that those who charge others of being racist have a guilt complex. First of all, he said that Australia should have its own policies on the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. Obviously he was not listening to his Leader because his Leader clearly stated that Australia should not have a policy for the Territory of Papua and New Guinea but that it must accept without question the decisions of the United Nation. I interjected and said: Right or wrong?" He replied: 'Yes, right or wrong.' Although I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy's</inline> view is that of the Australian Labor Party - it is not the view of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> - it is that Australia must not have a policy with regard to the Territory of Papua and New Guinea; the policy we adopt should be the wish and the will of the United Nations. </para>

          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline>went on to say that Australia was inhibited at international conferences because of fear of criticism of our policies in regard to the Territory. I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> to give some instances of this and., after stumbling and bumbling for a few moments, he plucked one out of his hat and that was the conference on human rights. But, of course, he gave no evidence that Australia did not support resolutions moved because of its fear of being criticised over its policy on Papua and New Guinea, lt mav well he that Australia did not support these resolutions because it recognised the hypocrisy of them. I would like to know how many of the 100 nations attending the conference respect human rights. How many of the African countries respect human rights? Presumably the views expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> tonight are Labor Party policy, that Australia will no* have a will of its own but will bow down and accept the policies of the United Nations. I repudiate that. I am not prepared to accept the policies of the United Nations in relation to these matters. I believe that the freely stated policy of the Australian Government is that self-government will be granted to the Territory when the people there freely express their desire to have self-government. </para>
          <para>By opposing this resolution tonight the Labor Party clearly states that it does not believe in democracy, does not believe in the freely expressed will of the people. Indeed, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> started off by saying that the policies must be right, humane and Christian and that this resolution was a negation of all things that are democratic. T. must say that this view is very perverse. It may be a negation of all the things that are democratic to listen fo the freely expressed will of the people, in the view of the Labor Party. From what we have been reading about the Labor Party this is probably so. f would like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> to explain in simple terms, if he can, how the policy of the Australian Government of listening to the freely expressed will of the people is a negation of all things that are democratic. </para>

But, of course, the new colonialist is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam.</inline> He is acting like the old white colonialist. He does not believe that the people should have a freely expressed will. Indeed during his last visit to the Territory one of the indigenous leaders referred to him as' This Tourist'. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> is recorded as having said that a Labor government would not necessarily accept the findings of the Select Committee on Constitutional Development. This is in line, of course, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe's</inline> views. In other words, a Labor government is not necessarily prepared to accept a report which contains the freely expressed wish of the people of the Territory. But in a moment of great openheartedness <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> said that it would pay attention to its findings but would not necessarily give a blank cheque undertaking. </para>

              <para>-  That is a good comparison. But the point I want to make is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> accused the Australian Government of not allowing the people of Papua and New Guinea through the House of Assembly to freely decide their own policies. We were accused of some type of veto over them. We were accused of being colonialists. Yet here we have <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> saying that he is not necessarily prepared to accept the expressed wish of the people. What hypocrisy this is. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Paulus</inline>Arek, who is  Chairman  of the Select Committee on Constitutional Development, apparently has some fears, and very rightly so. I believe he is one of the best known of the indigenous leaders. He said that he told <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> that the Australian Labor Party should respect the wishes of the people on the question of self-government. This new colonialist and his colonialist supporters on the other side of the chamber are not prepared to accept the freely expressed wish of the people. They chatter about democracy. They do not even understand what democracy means. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack pointed out, a Socialist does not believe in democracy. He believes in a one party state. That is a fact. In fact, at the 1921 conference of the Australian Labor Party that was clearly stated. </para>
          <para>I am not quite sure whether members of the Australian Labor Party know where they are going. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> expressed the view that the Territory was ready for self government. But he was accompanied on the tour by that great genius, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cameron,</inline> who had a lot to say on industrial matters. Apparently <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cameron</inline> is not so sure that the Territory is ready for self government because, according to the Melbourne 'Age' of 15th January this year, he said that a Labor government would not hand over the area of industrial relations to the House of Assembly at Port Moresby when it granted self government in 1972 but would first make sure that proper wage standards were established. So he is not prepared to hand over all power at the time of self government. </para>

          <para>It is quite obvious that the Labor Party's Spokesmen on these affairs do not agree. One believes that the Territory should have self government immediately, and the other believes that it should not. One believes that the Labor Party should decide on wages, and the other believes that New Guineans should decide on wages. So I suggest that the embarrassment of members of the Labor Party tonight is well founded because they simply do not know where they are going. </para>

              <para>- No, I quoted the resolution. The Australian Government should not continue to tarnish our international reputation by having us branded as one of the last colonial powers on earth. Every other country in our region has fought for or has been granted independence over the past  25  or  30  years. Our nearest neighbour, Indonesia, was able to cast off the yolk of the colonialist Dutch but unfortunately we notice that the Dutch are now trying to creep back on the economic level. Recently I read of American motor car manufacturers returning to the area to exploit it, just as the oil companies are returning under the guise of making a new approach to development of the area. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para class="block">Nevertheless, the people of Indonesia did throw off the yolk of colonialism. Britain - this is what we intend to do to Papua and New Guinea - granted independence to the Indians, the Pakistanis and the Kashmiris. Britain granted independence to the people of Malaya but had to support them to ensure that the form of government she wanted to establish there was in fact established. Britain had to provide troops to maintain the status quo. Independence was granted to Burma but, to our everlasting shame, we are helping to deprive the people of Vietnam of their independence. We are obliged to justify our actions in the world forum. We have been called upon to set a timetable for the self-government and independence of Papua and New Guinea. We have been laggard in the creation of educational opportunities in the Territory and in the political education of its people. We have adopted the role of exploiters there, the people themselves participating in the wealth of their country only as second class citizens. The wages that are paid <inline font-style="italic">f</inline> them are a disgrace. Possibly they are a a low as those of any country in South East Asia. In this day and' age we are paying plantation workers wages ranging from  $3  to  $5  a week yet they have to pay the same prices for the necessaries of life as do these who are receiving  10, 20  or even  30  times their wage. </para>
          <para>We believe that full self-government could be given to and would be accepted by the people of Papua and New Guinea in  1972.  In the interim we have to give them true democratic government, all members of the Legislature being elected by the people for the people. We are playing the charade of having selected members in the Legislature of the Territory who in turn are answerable to ' and are dominated by Canberra. Everyone will admit that Canberra is holding the strings on Papua and New Guinea and does not want to release them. The Government has been loath to make any public statement about a timetable for independence for Papua and New Guinea. </para>
          <para>Would the Government accept a vote of the New Guinea House of Assembly if the officially nominated members were excluded and the locally elected members were permitted to decide for themselves? If such a vote  were  taken  now  it is likely that the House would vote along the lines of the target dates which- have been set down by Labor, namely, self-government  in  1972 and independence, in  1976? -. There  is  nothing wrong with the prescription of that timetable. The only criticism that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> was able to level" at the statemens made by the Leader of the Opposition  in  another -place-  was  in that regard. But Labor has- been honest enough to. set a target. If it is not possible to achieve self-governmen by 1972 and independence by 1976, that does not matter.. Self-govern- ' ment could be achieved in 1973, 1974 or 1975 and independence in 1976, 1977. 1978 or even 1980. But at least  we  are working towards a target. We are prepared to formulate a plan .fo bring about this desirable situation in the Territory but the Government has given the people of Aus. . thalia no information, about its policy in relation to Papua and New Gunea, and it certainly is keeping the indigenous people in the dark. </para>
          <para>The Government is part and parcel of the exploitation of the ind i genes by Australian expatriates. The native people 'have been exploited by the white people for 100 years. The Germans looked upon the Territory purely as a colony and the people have inherited from the Germans, and from those who followed, the - abomination of their language. This in itself will be to the everlasting shame of those who have administered the Territory over the years. We heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack say tonight that there are many in Papua and New Guinea who are engendering hatred of the white people and of those who would like to grant independence  to  the Territory simply to maintain the status quo. Their argument always is that the Territory is not ready  for  self-government, but that is an attitude typical of colonial powers and  it  smacks very much of racial superiority. </para>
          <para>We live in a region populated by .1,000 million Asians; most of whom have been under privileged for centuries. Every day that we stand astride Papua and New Guinea as a colonial power adds to the bank of ill will that is building up against us. To see this one has only to look  at  the way  in  which our nearest neighbours among whom are Japan, Indonesia, India and various others with whom we have to live and to whom we are geographically adjacent, &gt; have voted in the United Nations. I believe that the report of the United Nations Mission will again stress the world view that Australia is acting as a colonial power in Papua and New Guinea. Our reputation will again be blackened by an adverse report which will emphasise the fact that we have not yet specified a timetable for independence. The numerous coloured nations in the United Nations will note again our support for so many reactionary things like supplying arms to South Africa and participating in the war in Vietnam, and we will be labelled as a racist nation. We should be proving to the world that that is not true -yet. by our actions, we are giving substance to the belief that it is true. We should be relieving the- pressures that are building up because, if we do not act soon, there could be disintegration under those pressures with tribal groups breaking away. </para>

            <para>- The Senate has been debating for the last 2 or 3 hours a motion which has been drawn up most thoughtfully by my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> for the purpose of giving honourable senators an opportunity to affirm the Australian Government's policy for Papua and New Guinea. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood's</inline> motion contains these words:  - of not imposing upon the people of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea self government or independence contrary to the freely expressed wishes of the people through their parliamentary representatives. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">I have emphasised those words because the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> sought to amend them. Instead of affirming that we will not impose self government and independence upon the people of the Territory contrary to their freely expressed wishes through their parliamentary representatives, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> sought to introduce an amendment. It is now on the record as the expression of his opinion that independence and self government should be accorded to the peoples of Papua and New </para>

          <para>The Australian Labor Party has fallen into a fundamental trap of self-persuasion. In this instance it has lent itself to denigrating this country's achievements over the last 50 years. (Quorum formed) When the attention of the House was drawn to the numbers who had remained in the chamber for this debate, 7 members of the ALP were present. It was their Party Whip who drew attention to the fact. I was trying to examine a question of some importance without heat and without roar but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poke</inline> has intervened and sought to enforce his intervention by a continuous roaring. I was saying that the Labor Party had sought to emphasise its denigration of this country's remarkable achievements over the last half century in bringing the Territory to the stage of development that it has reached. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline>has moved his motion because of the untimely and most unwise intervention of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> in Papua and New Guinea, not only in the last parliamentary recess but also in the previous year. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cant</inline> has reminded us tonight that the Leader of the Opposition asserted that, if he were to become Leader of the Government of this country, Australia would ensure that there was self government in the Territory in 1972 and independence for the Territory in 1976. These are the issues that we ought to be debating in the most careful terms because, for good or ill, people in the Territory in increasing numbers are taking careful note of the opinions expressed in this Parliament. They do so because they still attribute some responsibility to those opinions. </para>
          <para>I believe that the statements of the Leader of the Opposition on Papua and New Guinea, supported today in this chamber, are an arrogant interference which shows contempt for the capacity and ability of the people of the Territory in their own time to develop to a situation where they will decide when they will take self government and independence, lt is greatly lobe regretted that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Whitlam's</inline> intervention cannot be divorced from the feeling that he sought a diversion from his troubles with the Victorian Labor Party </para>
          <para class="block">Executive and his futile intervention in the New South Wales Branch of his Party. It seems that be sought to get an audience who would provide more plaudits for him than he receives at the average Labor Executive or community meeting. </para>
          <para>It is greatly to be deplored that the Leader of the alternative government should go to the Territory to debate his divisive policies and that he should not endeavour, for Australia's prestige and the advancement of the Territory, to follow the tradition in which mcn <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> public life in this country give expression to viewpoints in respect of the Territory with as much bipartisanship as possible. It was made quite clear by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton),</inline> when he visited the Territory in July last year, that the very plain policy of the Australian Government is to fall in with any requests that come from the Territory to give its people self-government or independence when those people freely express their wish to have either stage of development; neither before that time, at the insistence of a militant minority, nor later, in accordance with the accusation that there is interest in Australia's deferring those opportunities for the people of the Territory. That is our policy. In the light of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam's</inline> intervention <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> wishes that we clear the matter and affirm that policy. Tonight the Opposition has said that it will vote against affirmation of that policy. I therefore propose to ask the Senate to allow sufficient time in this debate for a vote to be t;i ken. 1 want to examine our position as trustee of the Territory. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack has most emphatically drawn the Senate's attention to the terms of our trusteeship. They exist in Article 76 of the Charter of the United Nations, and are: </para>
          <list type="loweralpha">
            <item label="(b)">
              <para>To promote the political, economic, social and educational advancement of the inhabitants of the trust territories, and their progressive development towards self-government or independence as may be appropriate to the particular circumstances of each territory and its peoples and the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned. . . . </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">In respect of Australia's appointment to the trusteeship by the United Nations <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> fell into a very deep hole of misunderstanding and said that we are therefore trustees of the United Nations. We were appointed by the United Nations but we are trustees of the people of the Territory, for their advancement in a cultural and educational manner and their progressive development towards self-government and independence. We are bound to exercise that trust in accordance with the agreement of the trusteeship. Under that agreement the Government is designated as the sole authority which will exercise the administration of the Territory. The agreement says that Australia shall apply such of its laws to the Tet.ri. tory as it thinks appropriate and, specifically, Article 8 of the agreement says that Australia will, in accordance with established policy, promote, as may be appropriate to the circumstances of the Territory, the educational arid- cultural advancement of the inhabitants; assure to the. inhabitants of the Territory, as may be appropriate to the particular circumstances of the Territory and its people, a progressively increasing share in the ' administration and other services of the Territory; and guarantee to the inhabitants of the Territory, subject only to the requirements of public order, freedom of speech, of the Press, of assembly and of. petition freedom of conscience, freedom- of worship and- freedom of religious teaching. That is the trust that we accepted. </para>
          <para>How have we exercised that trust? The steps by which' Australia has given to the people of the Territory over the years advancing opportunities for self expression in the administration of their affairs and legislation for their government is clearly to be seen from ' the first step that was taken some 12 or 14 years ago to establish representative  government.' The next step was to enlarge the area of representation. The House of Assembly now consists of 84 elected representatives and 10 nominated representatives.- Last July the Prime Minister made a significant' statement in which he- said that legislative authority having been exercised with such credit to the local Assembly, we had come to the conclusion that the responsibilities and authority of the local Administrator's Executive Council should bc extended and that it should be responsible only to the indigenous elected members of that - Assembly, that it should take sole responsibility for educational matters, public health, tourism, cooperatives, -business advisory services, workers compensation, industrial training, posts and telegraphs and other matters, reserving to Australia responsibility in matters of external security, enforcement of law and order, the judiciary, defence and matters of that sort, I do not wish to repeat the complete statement of the position. </para>
          <para>It has been said that we have done nothing to prosper the economic position of the Territory. The Senate was reminded by the impressive speech by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> of the prerequisites that most thinking people would require before independence was taken. He said that the responsibilities of economic viability were foremost. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cant</inline> asks what we have done, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> says that we have arrogated economic interests to ourselves. In this connection I shall refer to two instances only. The vote for Papua and New Guinea in the Australian Budget last year was a total of SI 26.1m. </para>

At Bougainville, which I refer to as a specific example, a project has been developed by a company which has found mineral wealth, erected a structure and begun mining in the area. At Bougainville that company will employ 4,000 ind i genes during the construction stage, and during the production stage in 1972-73 will employ 2,500 ind i genes, increasing to possibly 4,000 ind i genes by 1981. Tn Bougainville we have a situation where the Administration -will receive revenue from taxation, royalties and dividends in excess of $400m in 10 years and where the company taxation which will be payable will be not 471 .per cent as in Australia but 60 per cent of whatever net profit is left to the company. In Bougainville, that company has specifically undertaken a training programme for indigenous employees, the programme to cost $500,000 every year. Yet we hear the catch cry of old colonialism, imputing that we are not advancing the constitutional structure and the economic well-being of this area to the great advan.tage of the local inhabitants. </para>

          <para>Every effort that we have put forward has been towards giving local representatives ' in New Guinea and their Parliament the opportunity to make their own decisions in this respect. They have not been thoughtless in the matter. In fact we have all met personally and socially delegations to this Parliament, when they have been free to express their appreciation or disapproval, as they wished, of the efforts that were being offered by Australia to enable them to make a judgment on these matters. Never once have I heard from any member of those delegations anything but appreciation of the increasing experience that is enabling them to make their own judgments. Indeed, the  chairman  of the Select Committee on Constitutional Development made a report to the Parliament of New Guinea a few months ago to the effect that in the opinion of the Committee the majority of the peoples of Papua and New Guinea did not wish them to accept independence. The Parliament at Port Moresby carried a unanimous resolution that the Committee should again tour the whole Territory to ascertain beyond doubt, if possible, what the viewpoint was. At that time the House of Assembly affirmed that independence and self government would be taken by the Territory only upon a resolution of representatives in that Parliament. But then, to trump all that and to run counter to that resolution of the House of Assembly, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> said - - </para>

But now we have from behind the Leader of the Opposition an individual who comes in like a poodle and raises a point of order. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> relies upon a resolution from the United Nations of 14th December 1970 which he has misconstrued. He says that that- body called upon Australia to prescribe a specific timetable. lt did not. It said that Australia should prescribe, in consultation with the freely elected representatives of the people, a specific timetable. The freely elected representatives of the people have insisted that they are not yet ready to prescribe a specific timetable. They are engaged in a select committee at the present time and are going to make another investigation throughout the Territory early this year. They expect great things to come by the end of the year. But the Australian Government, keeping constantly in consultation with those people, will make the decision that they request as to independence and self government according to the freely expressed wishes of the people. </para>

              <para>- I  insist that the point of order  I  now raise is different from the one  I  raised previously. The Minister spoke for 20-odd minutes. Having put his case he then moved the gag in such a fashion as- to deny me the opportunity of speaking for 3 minutes.  I  say that if  I  had 3 minutes in which to speak I could demolish his- arguments. </para>

          <para class="block">Following representations from the Council of the Australian National University it has been decided to amend the Australian National. University Act to increase the size of the Council from 38 members to 41, by making the following changes: (a) adding the  President  of the Australian National University Students Association as an ex officio member; and (b) increasing the representation of the non professorial academic staff of the Institute of Advanced Studies and that of the School of General Studies from 1 member each to 2 members each. The University Council also recommended a further undergraduate representative, but the Government believes that, having regard to the nature and composition of the Council and its methods of operation, the measures it proposes will provide adequate representation for undergraduates. </para>
          <para>The qualifying conditions of Council membership are being varied by removing the requirements that the undergraduates' representative be a graduate of a university and that the research students' representative be a graduate of a university of at least 2 years standing. The Standing Committee of the Council is to be increased from 9 members to 12, with the Pro Chancellor as an ex officio member, and as Chairman in place of the Vice-Chancellor and the quorum will be increased from 5 members to 7. The office of Secretary of the University is to be listed in section 18a of the Act, along with those of Vice-Chancellor and Deputy Vice-Chancellor, as one to which the Council itself should appoint or elect incumbents. </para>
          <para>Finally the Bill provides that Bachelor graduates of the University should become members of Convocation on Graduation. At present Bachelors are excluded until they are of 3 years standing. The Government has also approved that changes be made to the ' Act to give the University more precise powers to control traffic. University controls for this purpose, however, have to be co-ordinated with the provisions of the Australian Capital Territory Motor Traffic Ordinance and it will be necessary to make the amendments to the Act relating to this matter in a separate Bill, to be introduced at some later stage. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

          </motion>
          <para class="block">This Bill will amend the provisions of the Bills of Exchange Act relating to cheques and bank drafts. The main purpose of the Bill is to do away with the necessity for indorsements on order cheques and bank drafts that are paid into the account of the payee. It will benefit the public and relieve bankers of much of the unproductive work at present involved in examining indorsements. The Bill will effect other incidental improvements in the law relating to cheques. Before proceeding to deal with the substance of the Bill, I should explain that the Bill will be an interim measure pending the introduction of a comprehensive Cheques Bill to codify the civil law relating to cheques of which the Governor-General made mention in opening the last Parliament. There were no incompatibility between the interim measure and the comprehensive measure as the provisions proposed in the Bill are among those the Government has in mind to include in the comprehensive Cheques Bill I have mentioned. </para>
          <para>I should tell honourable senators that difficulties have been encountered in the preparation of the comprehensive Bill and it was not possible to introduce it in the last Parliament. Indeed, its preparation is still not complete. The essential difficulty lies in translating into the second half of the 20th century a code that was devised in the second half of the 1 9th century - for our Bills of Exchange Act 1909-1958 is still essentially the British Act of 1882 - and, furthermore, a code that is primarily concerned with the elaborate ritual of the !.9th century merchant doing business with bills of exchange rather than with the modern business use of cheques. Today the cheque is used as a means of payment in vast numbers of everyday transactions of a non-commercial character as well, of course, as in ordinary commercial activities. Such a comprehensive review has not yet been attempted in any of the countries of the. British Commonwealth; their legislation is still based on the British Act of 1882. </para>
          <para>The Government has had the benefit of the report of the committee that it appointed to review the Bills of Exchange Act. Honourable senators will recall that that committee was chaired by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Manning of the Supreme Court of New South Wales and that its report was presented to Parliament on 12th October  1965.  The committee recommended that a new Act be passed dealing comprehensively with cheques. The comprehensive Cheques Bill I have mentioned will be broadly along the lines recommended by the committee. </para>
          <para>It is clear, however, that some of the recommendations made by the Manning Committee will require modification to take account of fundamental changes that are now taking place in banking procedures, particularly in the use of computers. Discussions were carried on throughout last year with bankers about the extent to which a modern code should take into account changes that have occurred or that are in prospect. Also, studies have been made of the various electronic processes that the banks have introduced or intend to introduce. By way of illustration, I mention that at least one of the trading banks is now redesigning its operations to provide for the storage of cheques at a central electronic processing centre. The old reality - basic to the present Act - of physical presentment of a cheque at the branch on which it is drawn will be gone. </para>
          <para>I am informed that the stage has been reached when further instruction can be given to the First Parliamentary Counsel upon most of the questions that have caused difficulty. But it is clear that it will be some little time before a comprehensive Bill can be introduced. . It is therefore, in my view, desirable to give effect now in a short Bill to a reform recommended by the Manning Committee - doing away with the unnecessary indorsement of cheques.This is a reform that has been widely sought with Che community and I consider it to be the most important of the reforms recommended by the Committee. T believe that its implementation will be of real benefit to members of the public, to the commercial community and to bankers. The Bill will give effect to a policy broadly similar to that of the United Kingdom Cheques Act 1957 but modified to take into account views expressed by the Manning Committee. </para>
          <para>I turn now to consider the main purpose of the Bill which is, as 1 have said, to do away with unnecessary indorsement of cheques. It may assist honourable senators if I give some figures that bear upon this matter. It has been estimated that over 800 million cheques are issued annually in Australia and that about one Quarter, or approximately 200 million, are order cheques. Cheques drawn on the Reserve Bank are invariably payable to order; these include cheques for social service payments, repatriation payments and income tax refunds. The Department of Social Services alone, I understand, issues some 2 million cheques each fortnight. In addition, cheques drawn by State governments and by companies are usually payable to order. At present, all these cheques have to be indorsed by the payees and examined by bankers. 1 understand that over 2 million order cheques are dishonoured annually for lack of indorsement or for irregular indorsement. I also understand that at least three-quarters of all cheques drawn are deposited to the credit of the payee, so in the great majority of cases where cheques are returned, for indorsement no question of title to the cheque is involved. The dishonour of a cheque in these cases does rios safeguard the drawer or true owner. It is a great inconvenience to the- private individual and to commercial firms and also involves the" banker in much unproductive work. </para>
          <para>In the United Kingdom a solution to the problem of unnecessary indorsement of cheques was attempted in the Cheques Act 1957. It is a different. solution to that proposed in this Bill and. I think that I should explain why a different, solution is proposed in this Bill. The .United Kingdom Cheques Act has had. a curious history. Its starting point is the 1,956 report of the Jocasta Committee on cheque indorsement: this Report recommended legislation substantially on the lines now proposed. Before action was taken by  the United Kingdom Government to introduce a Dill a private member's Bill, was introduced which, wilh minor changes, was subsequently adopted by the Government. That Bill, which is now the Cheques Act 1957, did not follow the Jocasta draft and proceeded on quite different lines. The relevant sections, sections..! ' and -4, may be construed as doing away with the necessity for indorsement of all cheques whether they are-cheques paid into the account of the payee or negotiated cheques, - that is, ' cheques that have been negotiated by the payee in favour of a third party. Support is provided for that construction by - the decision of the House of Lords in the case of Westminster Bank v. Zang (1966) 2 Weekly Law Reports, page 110. </para>
          <para>It is by no means clear that this result was intended by those who supported the Bill. Indeed during the debate in the House of Lords it was said, in answer to criticism by Lord Chorley of the departures from the Jocasta Committee's recommendations, that the advice received by the bankers was that negotiated cheques would still need to be indorsed. Alternatively, it was said that bankers would in practice insist on indorsement of negotiated cheques and order cheques paid over the counter to ensure that they and their customers were protected. It is significant that on 23rd September 1957, before the Act came into force, the Committee of London Clearing Bankers issued a memorandum to the public which stated that indorsement would continue to be necessary in the case of negotiated cheques and order cheques paid over the counter. The result in the United Kingdom is, therefore, that the law does not appear to require the indorsement of any cheques but, as a res u 1 1 of the memorandum I have mentioned, bankers require indorsement of negotiated cheques and order cheques paid over the counter. The position is the same in New Zealand, where a Cheques Act along the lines of the United Kingdom Act has been enacted and a banking practice similar to that in the United Kingdom has been adopted: </para>
          <para>The Manning Committee, having considered all these matters and having heard submissions from all interested parties, concluded- that the original recommendation of the Jocasta Committee should be followed, that is, that the necessity for indorsement should be done away with only - in the case of cheques paid into the account of the payee. The Government has accepted this recommendation. The matter that was decisive in its decision was that the examination by banks of the regularity of indorsements of negotiated cheques is a valuable protection to drawers and the true owners of cheques. I have ' dealt at some length with the reasons why this Bill provides a different solution from that which the United Kingdom Act provides, lt will, however, provide the same practical benefits as a matter of law as are provided in the United Kingdom by a combination of law and banking practice. </para>
          <para>In summary, the effect of the indorses men provisions of the Bill will be as follows: A customer of a banker will not need to indorse an order cheque paid into his account if he is the payee: only those cheques that have been negotiated, to third parlies will require indorsemen. A banker paying a cheque drawn on him by a customer will only have to examine a cheque for indorsement where he pays it over the counter. A banker with whom cheques are deposited by a customer will now only have to examine the face of each cheque to ascertain whether it is -to be paid into the account of the payee and, if so, he will no? have to turn over the cheque to look at the back and compare the indorsement wilh the names of the payee. The principal provisions that give effect to the proposed alteration of the law concerning indorsement are new sections 88b and 88n con.tained in clause 5 of the Bill. The former deals with the responsibility of a banker paying a cheque drawn on him by a customer, commonly called a paying banker, and the latter deals with a banker who receives payment for a customer, commonly called a collecting banker. These provisions will also extend to bank drafts, which include what are commonly called bank cheques. f shall now deal with the provisions of proposed new section 88B. Section 65 of the present Act protects a banker who pays a cheque bearing a forged indorsement or an indorsement made without authority if he acts in good faith and in the ordinary course of business Section 86 protects a banker against a common law claim for conversion in respect of a crossed cheque where he pays the cheque to another banker in good faith and without negligence. Failure to examine order cheques for indorsement would be contrary to the ordinary course of business under section 65 and would constitute evidence of negligence under section 86. Accordingly, to obtain the protection of sections 65 and 86 a paying banker must examine order cheques for indorsement. If the proposed alteration of the law concerning indorsements is made, a paying banker may not know whether a cheque has been paid into a payee's account with the collecting banker or into some other account. Proposed new section 88B will, therefore, relieve a paying banker of the responsibility for ensuring the regularity of indorsement of all order cheques paid to a collecting banker and leave that responsibility to be discharged by the collecting banker. alone. A paying banker will, however, continue to be responsible for ensuring the regularity of an indorsement on an order cheque that he pays over the counter. </para>
          <para>The purpose of new section &amp;8d is, firstly, to do away with the necessity for a collecting banker to examine for indorsement order' cheques that are paid into the account of the payee, and, secondly, to extend to uncrossed cheques the protection afforded by section 88 to a collecting banker in the case of crossed cheques. At present, under section 88 of the Act, a collecting banker who receives payment of a crossed cheque in good faith and without negligence is protected against the common law liability for conversion to which he is subject if his customer had no title or a defective title to the cheque. A banker, like anyone else who deals with property inconsistently with the rights of the true owner, is liable to the true owner in an action for conversion. To bring himself within the protection of the section, a collecting banker must examine an order cheque to verify the indorsement: to receive payment of a cheque bearing an irregular indorsement would be evidence of negligence on his part. Under the proposed provision, a collecting- banker must continue to examine negotiated order cheques lo bring himself within the protection of the provision. </para>
          <para>Much of the benefit of doing away with the necessity for indorsement on order cheques paid into a payee's account would be lost if collecting bankers were to insist on indorsement where there were minor discrepancies between the name of the payee appearing on the cheque and the name of the customer's account. The proposed section 88n provides, therefore, that where the name of the payee on the cheque is so similar to the name of the customer that it would be reasonable for the collecting banker to assume that the customer is the person intended by the drawer  to be the payee, .the banker need not concern himself with the absence of or irregularity in indorsement - lt is important that the proposed change in the law relating to indorsements should' be introduced without affecting the position of persons under other provisions of the Act -or under the common law. The Bill contains two proposed provisions directed: to that end: proposed new section 88c, which is intended to preserve the value of paid order cheques as evidence of receipt- of the amount of the cheque, and proposed new section 88e, which is intended to preserve the rights that a collecting banker now has as a holder for value under section 32 in respect of. indorsed order cheques. So far as evidence of receipt is concerned,- the drawer of an indorsed order cheque, under the existing law, can use it after payment by his banker as evidence, although - it is not conclusive evidence, of receipt by the payee of the amount of the cheque. In fact, a paid indorsed order cheque- is as good evidence of the payment of money as the simple receipt of the kind sometimes printed on the back of cheques. </para>
          <para>If the proposed change in the law concerning indorsements - is effected, there is no reason why a paid - uninformed order cheque would have any less value as evidence Of payment than a paid indorsed order cheque now has. Proposed new section 88c ensures that this will be so by providing that an order cheque that appears to have been paid by the banker on whom it is drawn is evidence of the receipt by the payee of the sum payable by the cheque. This provision will, I believe, be useful for auditors and others required to satisfy themselves that the payee has in fact received the amount of the cheque. This provision will extend to a bank draft. The purpose of new section 88e is to ensure that a collecting banker who at the present time has the rights of a holder for value, in respect of an indorsed cheque will not be prejudiced by the proposed change in the law to do away with the necessity for indorsement on cheques payable to order that are paid into the payee's account. </para>
          <para>The reason why a collecting banker now requires an indorsement on a cheque payable to order is to establish himself as a holder for value, thus enabling him to sue on the cheque in his own right. In order that a collecting banker will continue to have the rights of a holder for value in respect of cheques that will not in future be indorsed because they will be collected for the payee, new section 88e provides that the banker will have the rights of a holder that he would have had if the payee had indorsed it in blank. I believe that the proposed provisions that I have just described will provide a significant -measure of reform of the law relating to cheques and I commend the Bill to honourable senators, </para>

          <para class="block">The intention of this Bill, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> is. to update those portions of the Broadcasting and Television Act affecting financial operations of the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. It also aims to make changes to the existing provisions regarding the ownership and control of broadcasting and television stations. In addition, it extends broadcast listeners' and television viewers' licence concessions to several new small groups of pensioners and introduces measures to permit the service, by post, of summonses in relation to licensing offences under the Broadcasting and Television Act. The financial provisions, as drafted, represent a standard approach to statutory authority financial legislation. I will not therefore be dealing with these provisions in detail. The existing provisions in the Act are known to be inadequate, and both the Treasury and the Auditor-General's Office were consulted as to the desirable provisions in relation both to the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the </para>
          <para class="block">Australian Broadcasting Control Board. This Bill has, accordingly, been drafted to update the banking provisions, provide for proper keeping of accounts and records; and to amplify the audit provision in accordance with more modern legislation. Changes affecting the administration of the Australian Broadcasting Commission are introduced in the Bill. Because of the present section 40 of the Act, which provides that the Commission may delegate its powers, except that of delegation itself, only to a Commissioner or the General Manager, administrative difficulties have arisen. The Commission operates throughout the Commonwealth, and delegations; limited to a few persons in Sydney place obvious obstacles in the way of efficient administration. The Bill amends section 40 so that the Commission's powers may be delegated to any person in the employ of the Commission. This, however, does not affect the power to appoint permanent officers of the Commission, which still remains limited to a Commissioner or the General Manager. </para>
          <para>The Bill also proposes, through amendments to sections 61 and 62, to raise the limits involved in the purchase and disposal of property, or entry into any agreement or lease, involving expenditure by the Broadcasting Commission, without ministerial approval. At present the limit is $40,000 and the Act directs that no agreement or lease involving expenditure may be entered into for a, period exceeding 5 years. Values have changed and the Bill proposes that these changes be recognised by raising the limits to $100,000 and 10 years respectively. The existing section 71, providing that the Commission may not pay compensation to a member of the Commission or its officers or employees, in excess of $500 without ministerial approval, is repealed. The purpose of the existing provision, which has no counterpart in other legislation, is not known and, in any case, the Commonwealth Employees' Compensation legislation provides adequate cover. </para>
          <para>Honourable <inline font-style="italic">senators</inline> will be aware that the Act now places important restrictions on the number of television and broadcasting stations that may be controlled by any one person or company. A close connection, it will be agreed in this context, exists between company employee benefit funds and the companies with which such funds are associated. There is an increasing tendency for pension funds associated with companies already having extensive interests in broadcasting and television stations to invest in companies having interests in such stations. If permitted to continue unchecked, this could have a material influence on the control of television and broadcasting stations. This is considered to be contrary to the intentions of the ownership and control provisions of the Act and, in consequence, 2 new sections, 90aa and 91ab, are introduced in this Bill. If passed, their effect will be that interests in broadcasting and television licences acquired by funds maintained for the purpose of providing pensions and retiring allowances or other personal benefits for the employees of a company shall be deemed for the purposes of the ownership and control provisions to be beneficially held by the company concerned. These new provisions, honourable senators will note, will apply from 12th December 1969, the date on which the Postmaster-General announced the Government's intention to bring down this legislation. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline>this Bill also groups, m section 128, all pensions payable under the Repatriation Act and other Acts making provisions of a similar kind for the purpose of concessional broadcast listener's and television viewer's licences. In addition, it extends these concessions to several new pensioner groups. The new entitlement covers persons receiving a service pension under the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) legislation, and persons receiving service pensions and pensions in respect of total and permanent incapacity under the Native Members of the Forces legislation. Persons receiving pensions in respect of total and permanent incapacity under the Interim Forces Benefits legislation and the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act will also become eligible for the concessions. These concessions have been extended in the interests of giving equitable treatment to all persons in receipt of similar pensions. </para>
          <para>Finally, the Bill proposes the insertion of a new section 132a to permit the service, by means of registered post, of summonses for offences in relation to unlicensed broadcast and television receivers. </para>
          <para class="block">This will provide an additional means for the service of these summonses in most of the States. It will not do away with the availability of personal service in appropriate cases. Although it has been the practice to date to have summonses for offences relating to unlicensed broadcast and television receivers served on defendants by members of the State police forces, there have been indications for .some time that, in some States at least, this arrangement was not satisfactory. Some State Ministers in charge of police have taken the view that the service of. summonses is not a proper police function and that it diverts trained men from more responsible activities. They have therefore directed that police are not to be used for the service of certain summonses for offences under thei'r own State laws. More recently, with increasing demands on the police, it has been made clear to the Commonwealth that some of the States are no longer prepared to see members of the police used to serve summonses' for the more common Commonwealth statutory- offences. The Chief Secretary for Victoria has already informed the Commonwealth that the Victoria Police will no longer undertake the service of summonses - issued under the Broadcasting and Television Act. It has, therefore, become . necessary  to arrange immediately for some - other means - of effecting service of summonses in respect of the common minor &lt; offences under the Broadcasting and Television Act in relation to. unlicensed broadcast and television receivers. </para>
          <para>Until quite recently, the Jaws in force in all States and - Territories --required that there should be ' personal . service of all summonses for offences and this generally involved the delivery of a summons to the defendant himself or leaving a copy at the last known or usual place of abode or business of-, the defendant, with some other person who was -apparently, an inmate -of; or employed at, that place and apparently at least 1 6 years of age. The laws in force in most - States were - amended - between 1962 and 1970 to enable .summonses for relatively minor  offences ' to be served by post and the new procedures seem- to have worked satisfactorily in- the States. . It is desirable that, a ..similar procedure be authorised by Commonwealth law for the service of. summonses-, .in -relation .to offences concerning unlicensed broadcast and television receivers. The new provisions have been drawn to ensure, firstly, that there will be a high degree of probability that the defendant will in fact receive the summons that is posted to him and, secondly, that if a defendant does not receive a summons posted to him, there will be a simple procedure by which he or the prosecutor may proceed to have set aside any conviction that was recorded. This would apply in circumstances where the defendant was not in fact served with a summons or was not served soon enough to give him reasonable opportunity to answer the charge. </para>
          <para>In providing for service by registered post, a more secure means of delivery will be provided than is required by corresponding laws of the States. Moreover, the provisions of the new clause enabling convictions to be set aside are more favourable to defendants than the provisions of corresponding State legislation. I am satisfied, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> that the registered post will provide a satisfactory vehicle for the service of summonses under the Broadcasting and Television Act.  1  am also of the opinion that there will be adequate safeguards fo ensure that no person will be unjustly treated. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

            <para>-  I rise tonight to direct some remarks to the Minister for Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> who is represented in this chamber by the Minister for Housing <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Dame Annabelle Rankin).</inline> My remarks concern the rather inflexible attitude adopted by the Minister in relation to what is broadly termed 'deserted seamen'. On-4th January 1 was approached by spokesmen for the Lebanese community in Sydney on behalf of 2 Lebanese seamen named Jacob Kara and Elia Konzamee, who had been members of the crew of a Greek tanker. It was pointed out to me that these men had deserted their ship about 8 or 9 days previously. They were given sanctuary  by  the Lebanese community of Sydney who then came to me for advice. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In substance the story  appeared to be that these men had signed on to the Greek tanker 'Valiant Colocotronis' which is controlled by Greek Petrol Tankers Ltd. Their complaint was that, although it was then the year 1970, proper maritime conditions were virtually non-existent on the tanker. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh,</inline> with his trade union background, would appreciate that it is well known that the present Greek Government is concerned with the virtual extermination of trade unionism, particularly the Greek Seamen's Union. The resultant vacuum would create unjust working conditions without limit. </para>
          <para>These 2 Lebanese boys pointed out to me that they were forced to work virtually 16 hours in every 24 instead of on 8-hour watches. In addition, there was insufficient food and in the sleeping quarters there was very little air conditioning. Despite those things and rows with the captain, they felt that they had to put up with things until they reached their home port. I have here a document which is called 'Oil and Australia 1970- the Figures Behind the Facts' and which has a diagram showing the various routes followed by oil tankers. It was quite obvious that after the long trip lo Australia they were not prepared to go through a virtual industrial Gethsemane by putting up with this situation. </para>
          <para>I have said that this occurred on 4th January. I was faced with a personal dilemma, just like every other senator I suppose. We ali have taken an oath to uphold the Constitution. So I said to these boys: 'I cannot guarantee a lot. I would remind you that, mindful of the composition of the Greek Government, in a sense you are virtually seeking political sanctuary5, tt was on that basis that I wrote to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> on 4th January. As I do not want to delay the Senate unduly,, with the concurrence of honourable senators I incorporate in Hansard a copy of my letter to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch.</inline> 4th January. 1971. </para>

          <para class="block">I immediately phoned, the Department of Immigration and said that I had these 2 boys with me and that the members of the Lebanese community did not want to be breaking the law. The upshot was that I wrote the letter to the Minister on 4th January, which was very specific on the matters I. am mentioning now, and 1 told the boys that I was going away on a parliamentary delegation to Europe and that we would leave the matter to the Minister. </para>
          <para>When I returned to Australia on Sunday, there was a letter from the Minister dated 22nd January, which was a rather stereotyped reply. He said that the essential feature in these cases was that the illegal entry of seamen had to be discouraged in every way possible. In the interim, to ascertain whether or not these boys were exaggerating the situation, I discussed the conditions of Greek tanker crews with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions which, as honourable senators know, is the major world trade union body. I saw its officials in Brussels. They agreed that the conditions of Greek tanker crews are very bad and that this is a very difficult matter. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges,</inline>in his own direct fashion, has already explained what is happening under the present Greek Government. It is a twofold problem. With the extermination of trade unionism, the Government has introduced some form of incentive payments. But these Lebanese boys and any other non-Greeks do not share in the incentive payments.. The Government is adding insult to injury by using speed up methods and decreeing that non-Greeks do not even share in the incentive payments. I do not suppose that that is any satisfaction to the Greek nationals in the crews, either. This general feeling of intimidation and the application of ruthless Captain Bligh ism in 1971 are causing a high rate of desertions from Greek ships, whether by Greek nationals or non-Greeks. </para>
          <para>Let me show how this situation is gelling out of hand. I emphasise that these are facts that our Minister for Immigration should have realised, instead of treating this as just a simple desertion case and nothing else.. In the 19th October 1970 issue of 'Newsweek' there was a very illuminating article headed 'The Lush Era of the Tanker Tycoons'. One Greek shipping magnate is the husband of the widow of the late President Kennedy. Another one is a chap who has had some problem as to how he disposed of his wife. These are the sorts of men who have the destiny of thousands of seamen in their hands. The Newsweek' article agrees that their methods are ruthless and that they will do anything to bypass all the regular canons of trade unionism and the provision of reasonable conditions. That is one point I want to make. </para>
          <para>Secondly, there is the viewpoint of the ICFTU on these wholesale desertions. I want to make <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> point about the rather rigid attitude of our Minister for Immigration. I want to make a comparison between his attitude to the plea from the Lebanese community for sanctuary for these 2 boys and what happened when the Czech Consul-General rightly sought sanctuary from some manifestations of Stalinism in his country. He was given sanctuary. I did not object to that. In fact, 1 commended the Government on that action. But the point I have made repeatedly for years is that the Government will give san.cuary to the victim of the excesses of the left, but I have never yet seen the Minister give sanctuary io somebody who has some problem with the Greek, Portuguese or Spanish government. 1 took the opportunity to discuss cases of this nature with officials of the British </para>
          <para class="block">Home Office. They gave me chapter and verse of cases in which the Home Secretary, who has functions equivalent to our Minister for Immigration, exercises clemency. As a matter of fact, I can quote from the London 'Times' a case within the last fortnight of a Spanish student who was identified with the Basque freedom movement. He told the Home Office that he was frightened to go home because of his utterances in London. He was frightened of what the Franco police might do to him. He was given an extra couple of years in Britain in which to carry on his studies. 1 do not know of any case in Australia in which our Minister has exercised clemency towards people who have been the victims of right wing excesses. </para>

          <para>I do not believe that all the power should reside' in 'the 'Minister. In regard to the situation in Britain', I have with me a copy of the Report of the Committee on Immigrantnt- ti on. Appeals. For at least 4 years I have argued that these cases should be sieved by a' tribunal. I do 'not say for one minute that in every case we senators ventilate we arc right. 'But in situations such as this one. or in cases with political overtones,' if we had had a tribunal .it would have been able to vet the case and say whether these boys were victims of a 'tyrannical ship's master and whether they should be allowed to stay. Somebody might say 'They are riff raff from the ships', and adopt a nineteenth century attitude, f suppose that the best answer on the stock of sailors who have been allowed to remain in Australia is a contemporary of mine, the Honourable. Edna Roper, who is a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council.  Her  name is Edna Sirius Roper. 'Sinus' is- the name of the ship from which her father deserted in Adelaide. </para>
          <para>These are the sorts of  situations about which I am talking. No doubt <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> has not bothered to look closely at the situation, if he -has not time to look at these matters in- person, he should create an immigration appeals tribunal such as I suggest. I can anticipate the attitude of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> on this matter. I can look at him across the chamber and say that as against the Spanish boy who was given sanctuary there was the German student leader who was sent out of Britain. 1 am not suggesting a whitewashing of everybody. I believe that our Minister should adopt a procedure along the lines I have suggested. What is worrying me is that if I have another of these cases in the future I may have to do a Bernadette Devlin and encourage someone to break the law. I do not want to do that. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline> were here, he would verify that 2 days before we left Europe he said to me: 'You have a pensive look on your face'. I said to him: Yes.. I am wondering about those Lebanese boys who came to me and whether I have put them in bondage to the Greek maritime authorities'. The next time somebody comes to me - whether he is a Spanish seaman, a Greek seaman or a Portuguese seaman - should I as a parliamentarian say to him: 'Give yourself, up' to the law', knowing in my heart that he will be virtually thrown to the wolves? </para>
          <para>I should like it to be conveyed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch,</inline> the Minister for Immigration, that in my view sitting in Canberra and looking at this thing at long range is not good enough. I commend to him the conduct of a former Canadian Minister for Immigration. The father of a German migrant was dying in Hamburg and a document had to bc signed so that the migrant could fly back home. The Minister, after having driven 150 miles out of Montreal on a hunting expedition, heard the story on the radio and returned to Ottawa to sign the document. </para>
          <para>Probably our Minister has had his achievements too but in this situation T believe that he is not close enough. I discussed this matter in London with the former Home Secretary, Jim Callaghan, and with Maurice Foley, the former Minister for Commonwealth Affairs in the Wilson Cabinet- who is known to members of this Government. They said to me: 'The greatest fault in any Minister is to be inaccessible'. I have expressed a similar view to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch</inline> about certain Spanish migrants. In view of his ancestry the Minister should be a little kinder to people who want to buck injustice. I want him to know that. </para>
          <para>T should like a Minister who would telephone or in some other way convey to the Greek Government that we are sick of being imposed upon. Tonight <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> and others talked about whether we were worthy of Australian nationalism and whether we should keep apologising. 1 should like to believe that Australia was something like Britain in relation to the number of people to whom we give sanctuary. We would be a lot better off if we gave sanctuary to people who have suffered from excesses to the right. 1 agree that we have given it to those who have suffered at the hands of the left  -  I do not quarrel with that - but let us be honest with ourselves and say: 'Yes, we equate Portugal and Spain with some countries which are to the far left'. But we are not doing that at the present time. When the next case of a deserting seaman comes to me 1 can assure the Senate that unless there is a change of heart on the part of the Minister I will not lift a finger to ensure that the laws are obeyed when people will be prosecuted because of it. 1 have hammered this theme for the past 3 years. From my last experience of the situation in Britain I believe that it is not infra dig for the Minister to set up a tribunal such as exists there. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dame</inline> Annabelle Rankin who represents the Minister for Immigration can give me chapter and verse covering seamen and others who have been given sanctuary in Australia, <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> will say that the Minister is adopting a balanced attitude. I have had numerous stereotyped letters from him such as the one that I have received on this occasion. The more I travel the world the more I realise that we are losing the battle to adopt an equitable attitude in the matter of freedom. </para>
          <para>I will be seeing members of the Lebanese community this weekend. They have a proud record in Sydney by virtue of their identification with charitable organisations. I know that with other national groups in Sydney people disappear. There are always people who cannot be traced. The Department does not find every deserting seaman or every tourist who goes into smoke. They are not caught in the net. Let us be honest. Many of them make good citizens despite their different aims and objectives. I certainly would not be party to having a lot of police engaged trying to find them, but the point I want to emphasise is that when people want to do the right thing the Minister comes up with the same inflexible answer. He gave me a similar answer in a previous case in which he probably was right, but this case is different, ff he would only emulate the practice of the British Minister and set up an immigration appeal tribunal there would not be the miscarriages of justice that have occurred in the past. When I speak to the Lebanese people this weekend I will tell them that 1 will be happy to help the next fellow who is the victim of the autocratic military junta in Greece circumvent the law. </para>

            <para>-  [ rise to express my concern and the concern of a great number of people on the north coast of New South Wales at the manner in which an announcement has been made regarding the proposed merger of 2 large television stations on the north coast of New South Wales, and of the further projected concentration of this very powerful medium in the hands of a privileged few. I urge the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Alan Hulme)</inline> and the Australian Broadcasting Control Board to give very serious consideration to the implications of the application that has been made to them concerning the merger of television station RTN8 Lismore and NRN11 Coffs Harbour before they give their imprimatur to it. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Out of the blue on 15th January a news item appeared in the 'Sydney Morning Herald' and also in the Lismore "Northern Star' to the effect that in the first television industry merger in New South Wales Richmond Tweed Television Ltd and Northern Rivers Television Ltd would join forces. The 2 companies announced ' that they planned to form a holding company which would make offers for the whole' of the issued capital of each of the 2 licenced companies. The report went on to say that the 2 companies were awaiting, the. 'approval of the Postmaster-General and of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board and that they would give details o'f the proposal in due course. Why could not they have made their complete proposals available in the first instance for the benefit and edification of the public? I would have thought that in the interests of the towns and the areas that they serve under licences issued  by- the Commonwealth it would have been in the public interest for full and frank .details of the proposal to be disclosed. </para>
          <para>The statement went on to say that the proposed merger may have implications for the future operations of the operator on the east coast, namely, Channel ECN8 in Taree which went into receivership last August, and that if the new RichmondTweedNorthern Rivers group should be successful ,in gaining ECN8 as a translator station it naturally would enhance the operations of those, stations which would operate under the holding company. To say the least, a kite was being flown to learn public reaction to this proposal. I can assure the Senate, the Minister and ' the Control Board that a great number of people are concerned that the whole of the television coverage of the north coast of New South  Wales from Taree to the Queensland border will be virtually in the hands of 1 operator if approval is given for this merger. As has been put, this proposal could well be a breach of the Broadcasting and Television Act which, in relation to the limitation of interest in commercial television stations, provides that a person contravenes the Act if and so long as he has a prescribed interest in each of three or more licences. Other matters are elaborated. We see very powerful associations forming into 1 organisation thus tightening the hands of monopoly on this very important medium. The Minister and the Control Board should look very closely at this state of affairs. </para>
          <para>Naturally operating costs will be reduced. In the 21 st January edition of a magazine called 'Broadcasting and Television' it Was stated that rationalisation of operating costs and increased revenue potential would ensure a greater return to shareholders. The article also stated that the proposal was subject to the approval of the Postmaster-General and the Control Board but, according to a statement on page 1 of the magazine, it appears that the proposal is to be regarded by prospective advertisers as a fait accompli. An article appearing in the edition of 31st January of the same magazine refers to 'joint ad. rates for television stations'. Under the banner line of 'Coffs Harbour' the article states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Following the merger of RTN and NRN (relaying to ECN) the 3 markets will be sold on a single rate curd from Marsh 1st, with schedules and invoices handled by NRN. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The article then sets out details of the representatives for the group. 1 suggest that it is an insult to the people living in the north coast region, and could well be a breach of section 92 of the Broadcasting and Television Act. The Press statement to Which I have referred- mentions a greater return to shareholders, and states that the rationalisation of operating costs and increased revenue potential will ensure a greater return to shareholders than is possible under the existing structures. But the return last financial year did not appear- to be too bad at all. The Press statement of 15th January said that Richmond Tweed. TV Ltd returned an earning rate on . issued capital of 20.5 per cent after a 2.8 per cent increase in net profit from $70,139 to $72,098 in the year ended 30th June. last. </para>

              <para>- You go ahead and call a quorum. But I intend to talk on this matter which is vital to the people of this area. (Quorum formed) <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Acting Deputy President,</inline> 1 was referring to a statement that the  Chairman  of RTN-8, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mcintosh,</inline> had made. He said that full production and technical facilities will be maintained at RTN-8 Lismore. But one of the unions concerned - namely, the Professional Radio Employees Institute - has written to me indicating that it has received information that RTN-8 will cease ali operations from its studios at Goonellabah on 1st March 1971 and, after that date, will take programmes on relay from NRN-11. Prior to the merger, a total Of 24 people were employed in the production, technical, traffic, administrative and sales sections of RTN-8. At least 1 1 of these employees, whose ages range from 16 to 21 years, have received dismissal notices, it is known that some of the remaining senior staff have been offered positions at NRN- 11, but the general feeling of uncertainty is caused by the knowledge that all members of the staff cannot be absorbed. As I have mentioned already, the union points out to me that ECN-8 Taree has closed down its operations and its studio and now is taking its programmes on relay from NRN-11. </para>

              <para>- 1 feel that it is a breach of the Act. 1 might refer to a section of the Act about which there is some doubt. But if ECN-8 Taree is regarded as a third television station - it being operated by translator - certainly in my opinion this deal would be a breach of section 92 of the Broadcasting and Television Act. Station RTN-8 serves about 40,000 homes in the Lismore district and station .'NRN- 1 1 at Coffs Harbour serves about 35,000 homes. I suppose the Taree station would serve about 30,000 homes. One can see from that what a vast control over the minds of many people stations controlled by one operator would have. </para>

          <para>If we look at the appendixes to the last annual report of the Broadcasting Control Board we can see the interlocking association of the various shareholdings interested in the stations. We can see from those documents the vast interlocking association between many sections of the muss media of Australia which are grappling for more power and for greater profits, lt is true that the one station for this area would become probably the third largest provincial station in the Commonwealth and it might well be true that this would attract greater revenue from national advertisers. But that would serve only the interests of the shareholders of the company. Having regard to the unemployment that would be created and the inadequacy of news coverage in the main towns in that area, the best interests of the public would not be served. If this type of thing is allowed to develop the Broadcasting Control Board will, I suggest, become a mere paper tiger, powerless to do anything in the interests of television viewers. Rather than have a consolidation of stations, there should be a breaking up of their control. Licensees of commercial television stations must be made aware that licences that are given to them are for the primary purpose of catering for the commercial needs of the people in the areas involved and that the profit motive is secondary. </para>

            <para>(.10.43)  -  in reply - Tonight both honourable senators who have spoken in the debate on the adjournment motion have referred ' to matters concerning Ministers whom I represent in this place. I should like to explain to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> that- 1 could not answer him before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland</inline> spoke because had I done so I would have closed the debate. So my failure to answer <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> was not a neglect to do sp.. T have noted very carefully the .points raised by the honourable senator concerning the 2 persons, Kara and Kouzamee. Tn fairness I .think I. should have recorded exactly what the </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Minister said in his letter to the honourable senator because it puts on record a little more detail than is contained in the reference made by the honourable senator. Those 2 persons entered Australia illegally by deserting their vessel at Botany Bay in December 1970. The Minister for Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> very correctly said in his written reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill:</inline> - The essential feature in these cases is that illegal entry by deserting seamen is very frequent and must therefore bc discouraged in every way possible. The most effective means of doing this is to ensure that such illegal entrails are removed from the country unless exceptional circumstances exist. </para>
          <para>I have carefully considered the cases of Messrs  Kara  and  Gourami  in the light of your representations but I have decided that, in the absence of any special circumstances, their deportations are to proceed. You will appreciate that the shipboard conditions under which seamen serve is not a matter which can enter into my consideration of their cases, lt is presumed that seamen make themselves aware of these conditions prior to entering into employment contracts with shipping companies. </para>
          <para class="block">So the whole point on which this case was considered by the Minister was that they had illegally entered Australia by deserting from a vessel on the date which was named. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill,</inline> in bringing this matter before the Senate, expressed his concern for people who -desert for a. variety of reasons, and he asked that the Minister consider the establishment of an immigration appeals tribunal. In doing this he made a comment which I feel I must contradict, because he spoke as. though the Minister was inaccessible and as though the departmental officers . were inaccessible. I do not feel that this is so; I feel that this is a wrong assessment by the honourable senator. I have noted the points he. raised,' including the point concerning .an appeals ' tribunal, and T can assure him that I shall place these matters, in relation to which he has. expressed his concern for people in special circumstances, before the Minister for Immigration. </para>
          <para class="block"> The next matter to which I wish to reply is the matter- raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mcclelland.</inline> On this occasion I reply on behalf of the Postmaster-General. <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Alan Hulme). Senator McClelland</inline> put before the Senate tonight a. number of points concerning the. merging of 2 television stations. I say very, briefly to the honourable senator that I shall most certainly put his views, as expressed in the Senate tonight, before the Postmaster-General. But I think I should make 2 points concerning this matter. The matter would, of course, be subject to the Ministers approval notwithstanding the published particulars which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland</inline> has given us in the Senate tonight. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh,</inline> who is trying to interject, to let me continue because this matter is going to the Minister. I am not making a decision on it, but I am giving the points of fact. The whole substance of this matter will no doubt come before the Postmaster-General, and I will ensure that he will also have before him the points that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McClelland</inline> has raised. </para>
