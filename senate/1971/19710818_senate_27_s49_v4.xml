            <para>- Yesterday 1 asked the Minister for Air a question about a house in Morrison Street, Swan View, Perth, used by the Royal Australian Air Force. In reply he stated that the house was no longer required and was to be handed back to the State Mousing Commission. I now ask the Minister whether he can say that the house has been relinquished because all Air Force personnel have been suitably housed and this particular house represents an excess of available accommodation over demand. The Assistant Manager of the State Housing Commission in Perth, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Britton,</inline> was reported in the &#39;Daily News&#39; on 11th August as having said: </para>

            <para>- Yesterday the honourable senator asked me a question about this matter and I gave him information on the points he raised regarding an Aboriginal family living in the house next to 33 Morrison Street, Swan View. I told him they were incorrect. I said then that the Air Force had had this house available to rent for some time and had not used it. 1 made inquiries of the Air Commodore at Pearce RAAF Base and was told that he has one married man who is not drawing temporary accommodation allowance, and who had been mar tied only last Saturday, available to live rsl that house. Therefore, as I said yesterday, we have informed the Department of the Housing that we have no further use for the house. </para>

            <para>- My question, addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Customs and Excise, concerns the existing duty on wine. Is it a fact that clearances of wine for local consumption fell by 8.9 per cent in the September quarter of last year compared with the same quarter in 1969, by 8 per cent in the December quarter, by 10.5 per cent in the </para>

          <para class="block">March quarter and 17.2 per cent in the June quarter this year? Is it a fact that these percentage reductions constitute a setback of some 5 million gallons of wine sales? As the inexorable effect of this situation will be extreme hardship for thousands of grape growers throughout Australia, and in the light of the relevant statement in the Budget Speech that &#39;the problems currently affecting some growers in the industry are well recognised and will be kept under review by Commonwealth, State and industry authorities in conjunction with the Australian Agricultural Council&#39;, I ask: Will urgent consideration be given to the abolition of this crippling excise on wine? </para>

I read with extreme interest the comments in that Speech on the problems, referred to by the honourable senator, of the Australian wine industry and the grape growers associated therewith. I was interested to hear the various quarterly figures, as he expressed them. </para>

            <para>- Has the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Customs and Excise been drawn to an article in the Hobart &#39;Mercury&#39; of 17th August headed &#39; &#34; Savage &#34; fine for duty dodger&#39;? Is the Minister aware that a magistrate in the Hobart court allegedly said: &#39;Some penalties under the Customs Act were not only unduly severe, they were &#34; savage &#34; &#39;? Does the Minister agree with the magistrate that it was regrettable that he had no option but to impose the $50 fine which is provided under the Act? Will the Minister examine the Customs Act, as suggested by the police magistrate, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Solomon,</inline> and inform the Senate whether it is considered necessary to amend the Act. </para>

            <para>- I would not be able to agree or disagree with the magistrate. I would not know what he actually said. I might appear before him one day and he might become hostile. What I can do is to draw the attention of the responsible Minister to the comment in the Hobart Mercury&#39; and suggest that the penalties might be examined by the Department of Customs and Excise if it sees fit. </para>

          <para class="block">The procedures in relation to matters of this nature are denned quite clearly. The basic responsibility for all matters within the States rest with the States themselves. At Premiers&#39; Conferences and Australian Loan Council meetings financial assistance and ordinary revenues are provided for the States. In certain circumstances, such as where a State considers that some extraordinary injury has been done or that a calamity has occurred, there is a line of communication between the Premier of that State and the Prime Minister, seeking special assistance. As I indicated yesterday, in answer to a question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Byrne</inline> about unemployment in Tasmania, the situation is that normally such experiences would be the responsibilities of the States and would remain so but where a Premier of a State considers that a storm, tempest, calamity or disaster has caused a situation out of the ordinary the communication is from the Premier of that State to the Prime Minister, seeking the Commonwealth&#39;s intervention to provide assistance. Therefore the responsibility would be on the Premier of Queensland to do that very thing if he thought it appropriate. </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. I preface my remarks by indicating that I am concerned that the Government has been grievously at fault in not giving the Australian Parliament an opportunity to debate the implications to this country of Britain&#39;s entry into the European Common Market. To my knowledge, there has been no formal debate in either House of Parliament in recent years, although the moment of decision was at hand. On 13th May 1970 I asked whether the Government would prepare and present to . the Parliament a White Paper on the implications to Australia of Britain&#39;s entry into the Common Market. The reply I received was that the matter would be referred to the Minister for Trade and Industry. On 9th June 1970 I again asked whether the Government would present a White Paper. I was informed that the question would be referred to the Prime Minister. On 18th June I again raised the matter and was informed quite definitely that the Government did not intend to prepare a White Paper on the subject. On 23 rd February this year I asked whether the Government would provide the Parliament with an opportunity to debate the question and was informed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, that it was not considered that the moment was opportune for such a debate. In view of the statement attributed to the  Deputy  Prime Minister arid Minister for Trade and Industry on his return from recent discussions on the Common Market in Europe and in the United Kingdom that there does not seem to be very much reaction by way of consideration of Australia&#39;s circumstances either in the United Kingdom or Europe, does the Prime Minister or the Minister for Trade and Industry consider that Australia&#39;s position has been prejudiced by the failure to discover the views of the Parliament on this .matter of such critical importance? Will the Prime Minister now consider laying down a White Paper or otherwise giving an opportunity for Australia&#39;s views to be heard through the Parliament on a matter of such historical and profound significance to the nation? </para>

          <para class="block">That implies that I would dispute them if they were accurate and I am sure the honourable senator does not mean it that way. That is a fact of life. The truth remains that the United Kingdom Government itself is still in the grip of disputation which is taking place throughout the nation over the proposals for British entry into the European Economic Community and, if I understand the situation, will not take a definitive decision on it until some time in October this year when there will be a special line vote in the House of Commons. In the meantime, of course, Australia&#39;s point of view has been put to the United Kingdom by the Minister for Trade and Industry, and not so very long ago. </para>

I will put the questions on notice if that is to be the attitude. The fact of the matter is that we could have a debate here, if the Government wanted it, on the basis of a White Paper and 1 made representations before to the relevant Minister and got a reply. 1 am prepared, to do that again. I feel bound also to remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline> that if he wants to have a debate in this House, in his own right as a senator he can under the Standing Orders initiate a debate. </para>

            <para>- I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate whether he recalls a proposition being put in this Senate which suggested that the Government should immediately give consideration to varying the terms of eligibility for a social service pension so that certain primary producers who found themselves without income and without financial reserve could, on application, be included in such a scheme. Does the Minister recall that this matter was originally suggested to the Senate in relation to producers who had lost all, due to conditions which applied to certain producers of pears in the Goulburn Valley area of Victoria? I ask the Minister: Can it be accepted that the Government either did not look at this proposal or, if it did, decided against any action? Will the Government reconsider that original suggestion so that those who are at the present time being forced to leave their farms due to economic conditions may be assisted to remain on their properties, and so save the ever increasing drift to capital cities? </para>

          <para class="block">I say quite categorically that any proposal which is put in the Senate, from whichever honourable senator it comes and whatever the merit, quality or grey area which it involves, is processed and sent to the appropriate department for examination and evaluation. The points that the honourable senator raises in relation to some aspects of social services with particular relations to primary producers and to the pear industry would in the normal course of events have been examined. Because the proposal does not appear in the Budget which was brought down last night that is not to say that it has been completely abandoned or disregarded. There would be various areas in which it could be examined. I only say to the honourable senator that yes, the proposal would have been referred along with all other submissions by honourable senators and would have been examined. The Budget debate is due to start in this place next Tuesday or Wednesday. For the rest, I add the simple statement that the whole gamut of the problem of the primary producing industries of Australia is reflected in one way or another in the Budget and will be reflected in the speeches on the Budget when we have them in this place. </para>

            <para>The number of tranquillisers and sleep inducing drugs prescribed to some patients is perhaps one of the greatest factors in the increase of suicide in the State. Many doctors preferred to prescribe drugs in smaller quantities, but were forced to prescribe in lots of 23 so that their patients can get them on the free list. This left the person who had a tendency towards suicide with a means to carry out this urge. Perhaps it would be better if these drugs were taken off the free list. </para>

The statement in the context it was published appears to be inaccurate. Information supplied to me by the Department says that it would appear that the coroner&#39;s reported reference to the prescription of certain tablets in lots of 25 relates to the higher strength sleeping tablets for which 25 is the maximum quantity that can be prescribed as a pharmaceutical benefit. There are also lesser strengths of sleeping tablets available as pharmaceutical benefits as well as the tranquillisers which the coroner is also reported to have mentioned. The maximum quantity of these which can be prescribed at the one time as a benefit is higher than 25. Contrary to the statements by the coroner the maximum quantity of any item need not be prescribed in order that the drug may be provided as a benefit. That is completely contrary to the judgment made by the official in the coroner&#39;s court. The explanatory notes in the schedule of benefits which is circulated to all medical practitioners 3 times yearly state: </para>

            <para>The quantity of the prescription by a medical practitioner should be that which he believes is necessary for the proper treatment of his pal len provided the maximum quantity is not exceeded. Repeats may be in quantity up to the maximum. </para>

As the world monetary crisis seems a long way from any form of solution, with dealings in most nations&#39; currencies still not being permitted, and as this can have serious effects on Australia&#39;s external trade, especially if any nation decides to devalue its currency, can the Senate be assured that any possible repercussions likely to affect the value of the Australian dollar will be guarded against and that a full statement on Australia&#39;s position will be made to this Parliament without delay? </para>

              <para>- Yesterday i was asked a question which adverted to this matter and I was able to indicate that both the Treasurer and the Minister for Trade and Industry had made statements to the effect that at that stage i! was still premature and too early to give a definitive appreciation of the implications to the Australian economy with particular reference to primary industry. Inherent in that was a statement that when the position was clarified the Parliament would be informed. When the Parliament is informed, it will be by way of a statement which will be open to debate in this place. </para>

Did the Minister make a statement at the recent Port Moresby meeting of the Australian Tourist Council that he would convey to the Prime Minister a request from that Council for special Federal aid for the development of tourist resorts? Could he equate such a request with the plight of the Gold Coast City Council and shire councils on the north coast of New South Wales which need such urgent funds to enable them to combat serious beach erosion? Would such local government requests in tourist areas qualify for such aid? </para>

            <para>- The honourable senator directs his attention to the problem of beach erosion on the Gold Coast and in the northern part of New South Wales. I think those of us who know that part of New South Wales and Queensland will understand the problem about which he is talking. He suggests that there is a remedy for that by reference to a comment which apparently was made, although I have not seen it, in Port Moresby by the Australian Tourist Council and the agreement of the Commonwealth Minister-in-Charge of Tourist Activities to direct that request to the Australian Government. I am sure that the Minister will have done what he said he would do. He will have directed that request to the Government. What I will do is pass on to the responsible Minister the honourable senator&#39;s comments on the things he has asked about and my own views on them. </para>

I should think that the appointment would not be very far off now, but I have nothing more specific than that. 1 shall certainly find out for the honourable senator because I agree with him thai this is important. It was a good proposal and I am sure it received everybody&#39;s support. All I can do is find out for the honourable senator as fast as I can. </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Customs and Excise. Is the Minister aware of the enormous increase in the flow of acrylic tow crude materials into Australia in the last 10 years? Has the increase been from 1,827,817 lb in 1959-60 to 13,221,455 lb in 1970-71? Is it a fact that 1 lb of acrylic tow can be spun into the equivalent quantity of yarn that comes from 2 lb of greasy wool? As most acrylic tow is imported from the United States of America and is duty free, whilst the United States has a duty of 25 ic per lb on wool, will the Government give consideration to the imposition of protective duty against this strong competitor of our wool? </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Will the Minister explain why the duty on yarn manufactured from acrylic tow was reduced from 40 per cent to 20 per cent? What increases have occurred in the inflow of this yarn since the duty reduction? Why is the raw material allowed in free of duty whilst even the 20 per cent duty applies to the manufactured product? </para>

            <para>- That is a series of most interesting questions which I shall direct to the responsible Minister. Listening to the honourable senator with great care I could not help thinking to myself that the Australia-United States trade patterns are of great importance to this country and that the imbalance of trade between ourselves and the United States was quite a little bit worse in the last year than it was 10 years ago. I have an interest in the matter which the honourable senator mentions and I will see that his questions are directed to the Minister. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Ministry for Primary Industry. Is the Minister in a position to confirm that the problems of the Australian wool industry stem substantially not from overproduction but from a paucity of markets and that in effect there is not a surplus of wool? Can he further confirm that the current going price for wool in the Soviet Union is in the vicinity of 300c per lb? Is it not a fact that we are largely in the hands of one buyer who by reason of our own national attitude is able virtually to put his own price on our wool, a price which if continued would bankrupt every wool producer in the land? Do we still persist with the outmoded approach of requiring the buyer to come to us rather than going out and selling wool where countries like Union of Soviet Socialist Republics cannot produce alternatives to wool which they obviously need in substantial quantities and which they would buy if reasonable trading arrangements were negotiated? May we expect a change in wool selling attitudes which would free us from the present restrictions and fetters which are so seriously detrimental to our national interests? </para>

            <para>- What the honourable senator says in the main has been the problem of the wool industry for many years now but a large group of growers and others connected with the industry would not agree with all of what the honourable senator has said. For many years it has been the problem of the Government to get the sections of the industry together to look first of all at marketing and then at promotion of wool. I believe that over recent years the Government has been successful in its efforts to get the industry together in order to do something about the marketing of wool. Probably the ultimate in wool marketing is the acquisition of the clip but at the present time that is not suitable to all the growers in this country. However, I. shall have a further look at the long question that the honourable senator has put before me, and if I can get some further information I shall give it to him. </para>

It concerns the committee established by his colleague to review the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Can the Minister tell me who is represented on this committee and the terms of reference prescribed for this review? In view of the industrial unrest that is ravaging Australia, particularly South Australia, and the fact that an irresponsible militant minority group within the trade union movement has cost the wage earners something like S56m during the last 12 months, will the Minister ask his colleague to exert every effort to bring these deliberations to a speedy conclusion so that the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act can be strengthened and upgraded to give adequate protection to all parties and help to restore industrial peace to Australia? </para>

The terms of reference of the Committee are, in the general, terms of a review of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, a fairly comprehensive subject matter which will involve an examination in some depth seeing that oo really fundamental review of that legislation has been undertaken for about IS years. I will bear in mind what the honourable senator has said about the need for exposition, but having regard to the width of the subject matter I am not able to share any great optimism in that respect. </para>

            <para>- My question, which I direct to the Minister for Civil Aviation, relates to the future of Adelaide Airport. 1 ask: ls it a fact that in recent months proposals have been initiated by the Department of Civil Aviation to interested persons regarding some extensions of the Adelaide Airport which would interfere with trust lands under the control of the West Beach recreation trust body? Have there been petitions and complaints by organised residents in relation to the noise factor and also in respect of zoning proposals in the area which would affect city councils and those councils that have complained? ls the Minister able to state whether the proposals are in fact definite and are still to be pressed by the Department of Civil Aviation and the Minister? Will the Minister also consider at this stage stating the intentions of his Department and the Government in respect of a second airport outside the metropolitan area of Adelaide which will accommodate the increase in air traffic occurring in South Australia? </para>

            <para>- I shall try to answer the honourable senator&#39;s questions in the order he asked them. I am aware of his interest in this matter. I have arranged in the last month for senior officers of my Department to be in very close touch with the Minister assisting the Premier of South Australia in order to discuss the whole future of airports in Adelaide and throughout South Australia. Perhaps the honourable senator will be pleased to hear that there is very close co-operation between the Commonwealth Government and the South Australian Government on all these matters. The general comments that have been made for some time about Adelaide Airport really had their origin in a proposal made in Adelaide for the diversion of a road. This was first referred to by former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey</inline> when he was with us last session. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I had hoped to visit Adelaide myself to study some of the matters during the last recess, but I did not get there. However, I am still planning to do so at the earliest possible convenient time. The present state of knowledge of the matter is this: There is no proposal to extend Adelaide Airport. The airlines, in reaction to public demand, are assessing certain aircraft as possible additions to their fleets. Those assessments in turn may necessitate certain additional airport requirements at a selection of the major airports throughout Australia and Papua New Guinea. Adelaide Airport is one of them. </para>
          <para>In order that the airlines and the Government may properly assess the several alternatives it is necessary to make at least preliminary studies of relevant airport developments and appropriate costs. At present nothing more than that is involved in Adelaide. Should there be conclusive arguments in favour of extending the airport to the south-west - 1 am informed that at present this is very much in doubt - it would be necessary to acquire additional land in that direction. However, even at this preliminary stage it is evident that in the event of any additional land being required to the south-west, any loss of recreational reserves would be counterbalanced by land being made available from within the present boundaries of the airport. It is not proposed to provide a north-south runway. </para>
          <para>I think the honourable senator will understand that the second airport matter has to be thought about in the long term and in that respect we are in touch with the South Australian Government authorities. But this is a long way ahead and has to be considered in the light of the difficult terrain of the Adelaide plain and the concentration of population in the city of Adelaide requiring air services. Many senators from South Australia, from both sides of the chamber, have an interest in this matter. After I have been to Adelaide, if nothing else comes up before then - in which case I will inform the honourable senator accordingly - I will bring him up to date with what I and my Department know about these matters. </para>

            <para>- In addressing a question to the Minister for Health I refer to the patients&#39; contribution under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme which has been increased from 50c to $1 per prescription. Presumably the Government&#39;s justification for this is as a sanction against over-use or abuse of the scheme. Is it proposed to do anything for considerable groups of sufferers such as diabetics and those suffering from blood pressure and other ailments, where it is critical that they have the drugs in question and where there can be no suggestion of over-use or abuse of the scheme, but where, because of the necessity for constant treatment with drugs, there will be a heavy financial burden amounting in total to millions of dollars? </para>

          <para class="block">Insofar as it is proposed to increase the charge payable by patients under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme from 50c to $1, this is a Budget matter. It will be necessary to amend the Act to vary the charge; consequently, the increase will not become applicable until the Act has been amended by applying to it the normal processes of the Parliament and the amending Bill has received royal assent. Later today 1 will be issuing a statement to make it abundantly clear that this is a budgetary matter which will come under scrutiny and which will be debated in this place. At that time I will be a much wiser Minister and much more capable of discussing the subject. I feel bound to point out in the interim that the charge of 50c under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme was introduced as far back as 1960 and the same charge has continued since then. </para>
          <para>It is proper to point out also that about 60 million prescriptions are made up each year under the scheme. I remind the Senate that pensioners have been exempt from the charge and that the exemption will continue. Pharmaceutical benefits are free to persons in possession of a pensioner medical service entitlement card. I point out also that the charge of 50c, which subject to the Parliament&#39;s passing an amending Bill will be increased to Si, represents only the first part of the total cost of a prescription. 1 do not think any honourable senator would challenge that once we accept the concept that it is desirable that everyone other than pensioners should pay something towards the cost of each prescription that they receive- </para>

It is true - all of us recognise this - that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Rippon</inline> of Britain came to Australia and expressed views to the Australian Government, and that the Australian Government expressed its views to the United Kingdom Government. Indeed, the Minister for Trade and Industry was in England and Europe several months ago - perhaps less - and in the name of the Australian Government expressed Australia&#39;s views in relation to Britain&#39;s projected entry. I can only direct the question to the Minister for Trade and Industry for a more particularised reply. I repeat that the United Kingdom has not yet entered the European Economic Community. Such entry requires the approval of the parliament at West minister. The matter has been listed for debate in the House of Commons and it is my understanding that the final decision will not be made until some time in October this year.

            <para>- I think there is some merit in providing arrival and departure boards at Perth airport. It is a large airport. The volume of air traffic is expanding. I will have that matter taken up immediately. I am not aware of the poor quality of the public address system. I shall direct some inquiries about that. I expect to visit Perth in late September. If the situation has not been rectified by then, I will make a powerful speech against those responsible. </para>

            <para>- I have seen abbreviated Press reports of the report of the royal commission on the West Gate bridge disaster. It is true that Maunsell and Partners were associated with Freeman, Fox and Partners in the design and consultant engagements in that enterprise. I have had the great advantage of having been sent correspondence from Maunsell and Partners, some excerpts of the report and some definition of the contractual arrangements and the area of their responsibility. My present understanding is that very little of the culpability that was found by the royal commission is attributable to Maunsell and Partners. It is true that on a number of occasions the Commonwealth Department of Works has consulted that firm about important projects. As at present advised I see no reason to have any misgiving about the competence or integrity of that firm. </para>

            <para>- As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner</inline> indicated by the character of his question, advertisements seeking additional staff for the Office of Parliamentary Counsel were inserted in newspapers in the past 3 or 4 months. I regret to say that at present no appointments have been made as a. result of those advertisements although there is a possibility that one engagement may be able to be made. Of course, this problem is a worldwide problem and Australia is in no different position from other countries. It is very difficult to obtain legally qualified persons interested in applying for and undertaking work in parliamentary drafting. However, it is a matter to which I have given early attention. The matter is under consideration and I am hopeful that I will be able to take some steps, limited though they must be, to improve the position which at the present time, as I see it, does require improvement. </para>

            <para>- I ask the Attorney-General a question in somewhat similar vein to that which he was just asked. In view of the extreme importance of the filling of those offices to the efficient functioning of this Parliament as well as of the various departments of state, can the Minister indicate with a little more precision what really is the hold-up in this matter? As I understand it, before the Estimates Committee a few months ago it was indicated that only half of the positions were filled and some 14 out of 27 were vacant. The suggestion has been made that the trouble is that the. Public Service Board is declining to agree to salaries which would be sufficient to attract persons to this extremely important office. Will the Minister indicate whether there is some substance in the suggestion that the reason he cannot get proper applicants is not only because of a shortage of people wanting to do this work but also because there is not enough pay being offered? If that is the position, is any step being taken to offer salaries which, though they might not be as high as those given, apparently with alacrity, to Qantas pilots, nevertheless should be sufficiently high to attract people to carry out work which is essential to the operation of this Parliament? </para>

            <para>- The points which have been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> in his question are part of a very complex problem. As I understand it, the basic problem is that there is a volume of drafting work which must be performed but it is not able to be performed with the expedition which the Parliament in the past has required and which in the future I expect it would require because there are insufficient parliamentary draftsmen. 1 am unable to say precisely what number of the establishment remains unfilled but it is a significant number. Efforts have been made to obtain parliamentary draftsmen but, as I said in response to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Milliner&#39;s</inline> question, this Ls a problem which is not peculiar to Australia and it is not easy to get parliamentary draftsmen. Undoubtedly one may assume, though possibly it is speculation, that if persons were paid remuneration which was comparable with what legally trained people could obtain outside the Public Service that may have some effect on recruitment. This is an area in which I am giving consideration at the present time. The Public Service Board has been approached with regard to a reclassification of positions so that there would be higher paid positions available. At the present time I am not able to say what is the outcome of that approach to the Public Service Board. 1 can only repeat what I have said. I appreciate the interest that honourable senators are taking but it is a matter to which I am giving my personal attention. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I refer to an important petition which was presented yesterday by a Government senator. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> in relation to the necessity for banning the use in warfare of all chemical toxic substances thus bringing Australia into line with international opinion and the Geneva Protocol of 1925. Will the Government take note of the fact that a Government senator has presented a petition protesting against the weapons used by Australia and her allies in the Vietnam war? Will it accept this change of heart as further evidence of the far-reaching desire in Australia for us to sever immediately our connection with this inhuman method of warfare? Is it not true that such an amazing change of attitude by a Government senator who has, in the past, defended our involvement in this conflict effectively illustrates the majority attitude in Australia today? </para>

Would the Minister investigate whether closed circuit television screens will be installed in the Trans-Australiann Airline section of the Tullamarine terminal as have been installed in the Ansett section? Also, could a direction be given to ongoing passengers of where to find their departure lounge if there is a delay between the time of their coming off a plane and going on to another flight? Could the quality of the television screens be improved to project the flight numbers and times of departure in larger characters because at the moment they are very difficult to see? Further, pending the installation of closed circuit television screens in the TAA section, would the Minister ask the Department of Civil Aviation to provide an information officer who could be clearly identified so that people could ask their way, how to get out of the airport and how to find their departure lounges? </para>

Secondly, the Department of Civil Aviation is aided and assisted by senators and by members of the House of Representatives who draw to its attention operational problems and areas for improvement. Accordingly I am grateful to the honourable senator. I shall have the matter investigated as to why the Trans-Australiann Airlines end of the terminal does not have the same facility as the Ansett end in regard to closed circuit television screens. Also. I shall find out what is happening about directions for ongoing passengers who are to use the departure lounges. I shall see what I can find out about the quality of television screens and the size of lettering thereon. Also I shall see - and this would be a function of TAA and not the Department - whether, pending any closed circuit television proposal for information. TAA might think of providing an information officer. </para>

Will the Department of External Territories assist and advise this committee? Is there considerable dissatisfaction among residents of the island with Australia&#39;s relationship with the island? Has such dissatisfaction been caused through the Department&#39;s method of presentation of a company ordinance for the island and the Minister&#39;s unfortunate statement on radio that this ordinance would be enacted despite local opposition? </para>

            <para>- I think we all know with great regret the dimensions of the tragedy to which the honourable senator has referred. The Government has made available Sim for assistance and that, I believe, has received approval from the Government of India. The request for further assistance will be transmitted to the Minister for such consideration as he can give to it. </para>

          <para class="block">As I indicated earlier today, the position in relation to the British Government and the Common Market is still, to an extent, fairly hypothetical, although I feel bound to say that when it comes to a decision of the Parliament - and thai may be made in October - it no longer will be a hypothetical point that the honourable senator is raising. But, be that as it may, I indicated in answer to the honourable senator on 30th March this year that Australia&#39;s High Commissioner in London has been in touch with the British Home Secretary on the British Immigration Bill. The Government, of course, is keeping a close watch on developments, through our High Commissioner in London. But, as I said in that answer what the British Government decides to do in regard to persons entering the United Kingdom is really a matter for itself, that is its decision. Nevertheless, we are keeping ourselves informed on the situation. If any information becomes available to me 1 will be only too happy to make it available. So. if the honourable senator likes to pose another question sub sequently or to communicate with me, I will try to keep him informed of what I know of the position. </para>

            <para>- My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for External Territories. Is it a fact that the islanders of Pitcairn Island are virtually cut off from civilisation as ships are reluctant to call with supplies because of the French nuclear tests conducted in the Pacific area? Is it also a fact that their plight is becoming desperate and that the descendants of survivors of the Bounty&#39; mutiny who are living on Pitcairn Island will be forced to leave their homes permanently? Has the Norfolk Island Council invited these citizens to settle on that island? If so, will the Government give every possible assistance in helping the Pitcairn &#91;slanders to settle on Norfolk Island, if that offer is accepted? </para>

            <para>- Last night I was listening to the adjournment debate and I heard some complaint that this question had not been answered yesterday. That enabled me to anticipate the honourable senator, which 1 do with the usual good will. I wish to inform him that Pitcairn is British territory and the welfare of the Pitcairn Islanders is the responsibility of the British Government. The British High Commissioner in New Zealand is the Governor of Pitcairn. If the British authorities were to request us to give assistance, the honourable senator can be assured that any such request would meet with sympathetic consideration. I wish to add that the French bomb tests in the South Pacific, against which the Australian Government has protested repeatedly, interrupt shipping for only a short period during actual firing. I am not aware that shipping to Pitcairn has been affected by the bomb tests. Shipping to Pitcairn is a problem in the normal course of events because of the island&#39;s isolation. With regard to the suggested consideration to facilitate the passage of Pitcairn Islanders to Norfolk Island, I shall transmit that suggestion to the Minister. I am sure, for favourable consideration. </para>

              <para>and (2) Temporary deferment of call-up for national service is granted to students or trainees to enable them to pursue, and, if at all practicable, to complete the primary qualification being sought at the time of registration for national service, before they are called up. This deferment may be continued in respect of further studies or training they may undertake where it is a normal progression of the primary qualification and is necessary to their chosen career. Continued deferment is dependent upon the course being pursued without interruption and satisfactory progress at a rate which would in normal circumstances be expected of a diligent student. Reasonable allowance is made for some lack of success and if a student fails some or even all of the subjects attempted in one year his deferment is not necessarily cancelled; but, if progress with the planned course is generally unsatisfactory or the educational or other authority concerned does not permit the student to continue in the course, there is no alternative to discontinuation of the deferment and steps taken to proceed with call-up. The student deferment provisions cannot be isolated from the cardinal national service principles of universal liability and equity as between all registrants, both students and non-students, or from the firm policy of arranging call-up at the earliest practicable stage after registration. As at 30th June 1971, 14,140 registrants were either deferred or being considered for deferment on account of the studies or training they were undertaking. It is a measure of the attitude of these men that the great majority of them are expected to complete the primary or other qualification in respect of which deferment was granted before they are required to be called up. It should also be noted that post-discharge vocational training is available for national servicemen when desirable for effective resettlement. This includes financial assistance for the purpose of resumption of university or other studies. There is no provision for granting indefinite deferment or exemption to particular students or trainees because of the studies or training they are pursuing. No single group can be isolated as a special category having unique claims to the special consideration which would be involved. </para>

              <para>- The Minister for Immigration has provided the following answer to the honourable senator&#39;s question: </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <quote>
            <para>The honourable senator subsequently advised that his question referred to the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Theodore</inline> Williams who was admitted to Australia on 26th June 1969 to join the cast of the production &#39;Hair&#39;. </para>
            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Williams&#39;</inline>entry for temporary residence was approved in accordance with rules which require that persons seeking visas to enter Australia for periods of temporary residence to work in Australia as entertainers must be able to produce evidence of firm arrangements for their employment in this country for the period of stay sought. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>Invariably, such persons are sponsored by an Australian theatrical agency or an Australian entrepreneur and sponsors must guarantee to ensure that the entertainer is to be employed in accordance with the relevant Australian awards and that he will leave this country on the completion of his approved stay here. </para>
          <para>Such applications are usually the subject of consultations with the Department of Labour and National Service So that it may be established that the appropriate award conditions are to be met and that the admission of the entertainer concerned will not adversely affect employment opportunities of local entertainers. The views of the appropriate union are generally sought unless the application is one involving an entertainer of particular standing. </para>
          <para>Provided the arrangements are found to be satisfactory, approval may be granted for the issue of a visa authorising temporary entry for the period of stay sought, normally up to an initial maximum period of 6 months. Extensions of stay may be granted, where acceptable arrangements are made for further engagements, but normally the total period of temporary slay should not exceed 12 months. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Theodore</inline>Williams came to Australia on 26th June 1969 to join the cast of &#39;Hair&#39; and was granted a temporary entry permit for 8 months. Authority was later granted for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Williams</inline> to remain here for a period considerably in excess of the normal maximum period of 12 months. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Williams</inline>subsequently applied to stay for a further period to undertake other engagements, basically as an entertainer in clubs, hotels and similar venues, but also to perform elsewhere, including a period of week-end work with the New South Wales Division of the Arts Council of Australia. This application was not approved. Nevertheless <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Williams</inline> left the cast of &#39;Hair&#39; to accept alternative employment. He was therefore asked to make arrangements to leave Australia by the end of April 1971. </para>
          <para>Later it was decided that he could defer his departure until 30th June 1971 and he left Australia on 28th June 1971. </para>
          <para>The rules governing the entry of persons for periods of temporary residence are quite reasonable and their administration is no more stringent than in most other countries; and less severe than in many. This is evidenced by the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Williams</inline> who was permitted to stay for a considerable period of time beyond the period normally allowed. </para>
          <para>Because of the growth of licensed clubs, New South Wales has become one of the most attractive areas in the world for the employment of individual entertainers. Quite substantial numbers are admitted for periods of temporary residence in accordance with rules described above which provide for precautions to be taken to ensure that the entry of overseas entertainers does not adversely affect employment opportunities for local artists. The vast majority of overseas entertainers who perform in Australia willingly comply with the rules but some do seek to stay for extended periods. In such cases unless special factors are present it is considered that firm action is necessary if the rules are to be maintained. </para>

          <para>There has been an informal exchange of views, at a routine level, with the United States and this is what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McClosky</inline> was referring to in his remarks to the Press on 12th May 1971. However the United States has not objected to the sale by Australia of sugar cane harvesters to Cuba. It has been explained to the United States that the sale of sugar cane harvesters to Cuba was a normal commercial transaction which did not involve items of strategic significance. </para>

            <para>The Commonwealth&#39;s examination of the Refugee Seamen&#39;s Agreement with a view to possible future accession has virtually concluded and so far no objection is seen to Australian accession. The main difficulty concerns the application of the agreement to Australia&#39;s territories. The question has been referred to the Administration of Papua/New Guinea and I understand that the Administrator&#39;s Executive Council will consider it at its meeting scheduled for 2nd June 1971. I am sure that once we know the Council&#39;s decision the question of accession can be settled very quickly. </para>

Moreover, if Commonwealth bonds were to be made acceptable, this could pose administrative problems in respect of ownership at specific dates and current values. </para>

            <para>Yes. Advice was given to the Khmer (Cambodian) Government that aircraft could be available as foreign aid. This was part of the normal process of the management of a foreign aid programme and is in keeping with the established practice of making recipient Governments aware of the type of equipment and advice which Australia would be able to supply, should it be required. </para>

It is felt that it would not be appropriate to give the exact classification of the Departmental officers involved in the transaction apart from stating that they were experienced senior officers led by one of Second Division status. Similarly, it would not be appropriate to name the representatives of Jet air in the negotiations. These were initiated by Jetair&#39;s press advertisement to which Foreign Affairs responded and the discussions described in answer to Question No. 937 took place. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>Is the Minister aware that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alexander</inline> Downer, the Australian High Commissioner in London, also made a lengthy statement on Papua New Guinea in which he said that Britain&#39;s entry into the European Economic Community would eliminate the primary industry export markets for </para>
            <para class="block">Papua New Guinea? I ask the Minister: Can he inform the Parliament whether, in fact, the export market of Papua New Guinea for primary products will be lost in the event of Britain joining the European Economic Community? </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">This is a matter for the Minister for External Territories who has provided the following answer to the honourable senator&#39;s question: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I am aware that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alexander</inline> Downer, when opening a Papua New Guinea exhibition in London on 18th May 1971, emphasised that Papua New Guinea&#39;s economy would be dealt a serious blow if Britain entered the Common Market without some safeguards for the Territory. </para>
            <para>Britain&#39;s entry into the European Economic Community without appropriate arrangements for Papua New Guinea, would mean the loss of preferences in the United Kingdom market and in some cases would erect Community Tariff barriers in their place. In this situation some$1 6m worth of exports, i.e. about a quarter of Papua New Guinea&#39;s export trade would be at risk. This would be a grave situation. </para>
            <para>The position would be particularly marked in the case of palm products. The 15 per cent preference which coconut oil now enjoys over suppliers from non-Commonwealth sources would be transformed into a tariff barrier of from 9 per cent to 14 per cent and the 10 per cent preference for copra would be lost. The infant oil palm industry would lose the 10 per cent preference in the British market and would encounter Common Market tariffs of 4 per cent and 6 per cent. </para>
            <para>Because of the highly competitive nature of markets for tropical agricultural commodities, Papua New Guinea has only limited scope for diverting exports from its traditional market in Britain. </para>
            <para>The Commonwealth Government has sought at every appropriate opportunity to direct the attention of the authorities in Britain and of member Governments of the EEC to the serious damage to Papua New Guinea&#39;s trade likely to result from enlargement of the Community unless appropriate provisions are made to accommodate that trade. </para>
            <para>Following high level discussions by the  Deputy  Prime Minister with the United Kingdom and Common Market Governments earlier in 1970 the Commonwealth Government arranged for a special Papua New Guinea Delegation to visit London and the capitals of the EEC. The special delegation led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bilas,</inline> Papua New Guinea&#39;s Ministerial Member for Trade and Industry and advised by a senior officer of my Department, visited Europe during October and November 1970 to inform the Governments concerned in detail about the unique position of Papua New Guinea and problems the country would face if Britain entered the EEC without some special provision for Papua New Guinea&#39;s trade. </para>
            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Rippon,</inline>the British Minister in Charge of negotiations with the Community subsequently stressed the unique nature of the Papua New Guinea case in addressing the Council of Ministers in Brussels during February&#39; 1971. Following this meeting Australia presented a further comprehensive statement of the Papua New Guinea case to the member Governments of the Six and to the British authorities. The Papua New Guinea issue was again raised by the  Deputy  Prime Minister in the course of his visit to Britain and the capitals of the Six during June this year and was further discussed in detail with senior Government officials in London, Brussels and Paris by a small team of officers including Papua New Guinea&#39;s Director of Trade and Industry. </para>
            <para>We have some indication that the European Commission and the member Governments of the Six now fully understand the unique nature of the Papua New Guinea case and the gravity of the damage that could be inflicted on Papua New Guinea&#39;s trade in the absence of appropriate arrangements. Papua New Guinea&#39;s case is still being considered by the EEC. We are continuing with our efforts and are hopeful that it will prove possible to obtain provisions which will go some way towards safeguarding Papua New Guinea&#39;s future trade. </para>

            <para>The Commonwealth has pursued economic policies favourable to technological change through the maintenance of high levels of employment and of an effective national employment service to assist people changing jobs to find suitable alternative employment. In fact, the post-war period in this country has been characterised by extremely low levels of unemployment and rapid technological innovation and development. The appropriateness of severance payments can only be considered in respect of particular circumstances as they occur. </para>

          <para>(3), (4) and (5) The recognition of governments is a matter not of legal rule but wholly of political discretion. Though learned treatises have been written on the subject, it is not possible to reduce it to one criterion, or a short list of criteria, which governments take into account in exercising their discretion. In many cases moreover it may never become necessary to take any formal step either of recognition or of non-recognition of a new regime. In any event recognition may be accorded not by formal act but merely by implication from some intergovernmental dealing if and when the need for such a transaction arises. </para>

              <para>The Australian Government considers that recent events in Argentina were analagous to those which occurred in June last year when President Organic was removed from office. On that occasion the Government accepted the view that a change in the leadership of the government had taken place, not a change in the government itself. On both occasions, therefore, the question of recognition did not arise. Accordingly the Government promptly acknowledged the circular issued by the Argentine Foreign Ministry advising of the change which took place in March this year. </para>

Two safeguards inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency visited Australia from 15th to 23rd April 1971 to inspect safeguarded material supplied by the United States to Australia under the agreement for co-operation concerning the civil uses of atomic energy in force between Australia and the United States. </para>

The cost of exploratory boring, equipping the bore and reticulating cannot be given until the boring is completed.

          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(1)">
              <para>The Department maintains a constant surveillance of operating procedures and safety requirements. Operating standards are under continuing review and measures to increase safety are constantly being implemented. The number of accidents in Papua/New Guinea during the past year has caused some concern but I believe that the situation will respond to intensified pilot education and field supervision which has been undertaken by the Department. The overall accident rate in general aviation operations was slightly lower in 1970 than 1969 although the fatal accident rate was slightly higher. These circumstances do not give rise to the need for consideration of more stringent operating regulations in general aviation operations. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>The Australian Air Traffic Control service ranks amongst the most efficient in the world. Recent and projected improvements in radar coverage, although primarily intended to service traffic operating under the Instrument Flight Rules, will provide increased efficiency to the control of aircraft operating under Visual Flight Rules which incorporates a substantial number of general aviation operations. It will not be practicable within the foreseeable future to extend Air Traffic Control to cover all operations and there will continue to be a requirement for aircraft to maintain their own separation in areas where traffic density is comparatively low. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>Since 1966 the Department has pursued the policy of providing aids specifically to meet general aviation needs. In the period since July 1967, 42 non-directional beacons have been installed primarily for general aviation use and a further 17 are currently programmed for future installation. In addition, the provision of 62 new very high frequency omni ranges is planned and 11 of these will be sited primarily to serve general aviation. The Department continually reviews general aviation needs in this field in consultation with the industry and I do not doubt that sufficient funds will be available for the provision of aids to meet all reasonable general aviation requirements in the future. It is therefore apparent that the Air Traffic Control and navigational aids are continually being up-dated to keep pace with the safety requirements dictated by the growth of the industry. </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(3)">
              <para>There is no evidence to suggest that aircraft accidents can be attributed to a lack of uniformity in flight training methods. There has always been room for an individual approach to flight instruction and it would be undesirable for the Department to completely standardise instruction procedures in an attempt to enforce rigid methods on the industry. The Flight Instructors Manual, DCA Publication No. 45, is provided by the Department in order to standardise the general principles of safety in flying instruction. Flying training schools provide operations manuals relating to procedures for specific aircraft types and it is in this area where differences in operating details usually occur. These differences may cause some inconvenience to students transferring from one flying school to another during training but are not critical to safety. The main reason for the industry&#39;s desire to standardise this section of flying school operations manuals is to provide reduction of frustration which minor differences in this nature may cause to the student concerned. </para>

            <para>Selections are done very carefully and only a proportion of those who apply are taken. For example, in 1970, a total of 18,558 men and women enquired about service in the RAN as sailors and WRANS. Of that number 6,910 applied, and from this number of applicants, 1,973 selections were made. </para>
            <para>Selection procedures are closely watched and their predictive value followed up. They are considered satisfactory. Dismissal of any of those responsible for the selection of Naval Personnel is not contemplated. </para>

The Vincent Library is designed as a distribution and exhibition service for the films it holds and is the principal exhibition outlet of the Council&#39;s Experimental Fund. It will charge a rental fee for its services, part of which will be used to repay loans made from the Fund, and will actively seek to widen public interest in experimental films. It will promote the non-commercial screening of its films at schools, film societies and film festivals. It is expected to be a catalyst in the educational sphere and in the understanding of the art and technique of film-making. It is expected that consultation with the National Library in connection with distribution arrangements will avoid overlap in that area. The Vincent Library will also develop an active sales function and will aim to find outlets in commercial cinema and on television for the best of the experimental films. It is also hoped that the best of the films may be sold overseas. </para>

              <para>In December 1970 the Council of the National Library undertook a review of the adequacy of the resources available to conduct the Library&#39;s film archive activities. It was concluded that some increase in staff was necessary, but proposals for expansion are not being pursued at present having regard to current restrictions on Government spending.

            <para>The study conducted by Professor S. B. Harmony of the University of Melbourne into changes in attitude of a group of young people between 1957 and 1967 was partly financed by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. The Board&#39;s main interest in supporting the research was the study of the role of broadcasting and television in the lives of those included in the sample in relation to their other leisure activities. This portion of the research will be published by the Board. The continuation of the study, dealing with the effect of the 2 media on the vote of the sample in the 1969 Federal Election is peripheral to the Board&#39;s main interest and will not be published by the Board. </para>

            <para>More than thirty public telephones and copies of all Australian telephone directories are available at the G.P.O. Sydney, to the public until 11 p.m. on normal days and until 12 midnight on days during holiday periods when there is an increased demand for public telephone service. On a normal day the area containing all but two multi-coin public telephones and six Sydney telephone directories is blocked off by a security grille from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. During this period, callers are invited by means of notices in the two cabinets to dial0175 and obtain, without charge, information about required numbers not in the Sydney directories. </para>
            <para>A review of the existing arrangements has indicated that, while two public telephones are sufficient for the number of calls made, it would be more convenient for intending callers, when the security grille is closed, if copies of all Australian directories were made available to them. Action has therefore been taken to provide these directories at the nearby telegraph counter which is open continuously and a notice to this effect is now exhibited near the public telephones. The general position will be kept under notice and any further improvements in the arrangements which may be justified will be made. </para>

Despite that fact, for a long time it has been the university- with the lowest financial provision per student in Australia.

        <para>On the basis of the enrolments for the 1970-72 triennium that were anticipated when the grants for the triennium were&#39; fixed for all universities in 1969, the grants for the University of Queensland, if expressed in terms of grants per equivalent full time student, were comparable with those provided for other universities of similar size. However, if the grants are expressed in terms of a head count, those for the University of Queensland are lower than those for other large universities, firstly, because the University of Queensland has a high proportion of part-time students for whom the recurrent costs are approximately one-half of the recurrent costs for a full-time student, and secondly, because the University of Queensland, unlike the other large universities, imposes very little restriction on the admission of students with the result that the actual student numbers in 1970 and 1971 have exceeded the estimates for those years made in 1969. </para>

I refer to difficulties which are experienced by Canberra citizens in obtaining visas from the American Embassy and the representations which have been made by a number of community groups, including tourist agencies in Canberra, to the American Embassy. Will the Minister ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to make representations to the American Embassy to see whether it is possible for visas to be supplied in Canberra? At the present they are supplied in Sydney, a practice which occasions delays of up to a fortnight because of the correspondence and paper work involved. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- On 14th May 1971 <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson</inline> asked me a question on Conversion to the Metric System. The Minister for Education and Science has provided the following reply: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>The metric system in its totality is much more extensive than the decimal currency, system because it relates to all the measurements of physical quantities which we have need to use for technical, scientific and everyday purposes, such as measurements of length, volume, pressure, temperature and energy, whereas the decimal currency system involves only 2 units - the dollar and the cent. However because the metric system like our currency system is decimal based and has been devised in accordance with simple uniform rules, it is a very easy, system to learn, certainly very much easier than is the task newcomers to this country face when learning our present conglomeration of units of measurement which relate to one another in a complex and unsystematic manner. </para>
            <para>The change will extend over a much wider and more diversified field than decimal currency and most of the units will be of concern only to those needing to use them for professional, technical or industrial activities. Those that will affect most people in their daily lives are few in number principally those of length, mass and volume. </para>
            <para>Again the impact of the change will be much less intense than it was with the currency change because it will be spread over a much longer period during which gradual exposure of the general public - the consumer, the housewife, the motorist - to metric weights and measures will result in recognition and acceptance of the change without serious difficulties of comprehension. Experience in countries where the change has been completed recently, such as India and Japan, has confirmed that this is so. </para>
            <para>The Metric Conversion Board was established under the Metric Conversion Act to advise and make recommendations to me regarding the attainment of the object of the Act which is to bring about progressively the use of the metric system of measurements in Australia as the sole system of measurement of physical quantities. The Board has been charged with helping to plan, guide and facilitate the change. To assist it in doing this it has established an extensive system of committees, the members of which are leaders in their own fields to advise regarding the formulation of plans for conversion throughout the whole spectrum of activities in the community. </para>
            <para>Under the guidance of the Board these committees are preparing detailed and co-ordinated plans for orderly conversion to the metric system. This will ensure that the proposals for conversion in each sector are initiated by those who will be directly concerned in their implementation. Such a procedure is obviously desirable for a change which is to be effected predominantly on a voluntary basis. </para>
            <para>The decision to change to the metric system was made in recognition of the considerable benefits which will follow the change, that it was in any case inevitable having regard to the world situation in which the United States of America is now the only non-metric country, not committed to the change, and that the longer it is delayed the greater will be the costs. </para>
            <para>If the benefits of conversion are to become available as widely and as quickly as possible it should proceed simultaneously in all sectors of the community, each at its optimum rate and the Board&#39;s planning is on this basis. </para>
            <para>I understand the Board hopes to submit to me before the end of the year programs for conversion in a number of key sectors and that, if adopted, their implementation could commence in 1972 so that by 1973 active conversion would be proceeding in many sectors of the community. In addition it must be recognised that many industrial and other establishments are already, embarking on their own programmes so that during the next year the community will be increasingly exposed to metric units but not, I believe, in such a way as to disadvantage it or to cause significant inconvenience. </para>
            <para>There is in this operation not one &#39;M&#39; day, indeed in some sectors such as the pharmaceutical sector the change is already effectively completed. However as changes of interest or concern to the general public and to particular sectors of it are due to occur, special measures will be taken to ensure that those concerned are fully informed and if need be instructed through the use of special publications, technical and professional journals and news media and the professional and trade organisations which are themselves through their members even now involved in helping to plan the change. </para>
            <para>The Board has produced a brochure dealing with its initial proposals for metric conversion in this country which I expect to be issued very shortly and the Board will be following this with a regularly-issued news-sheet. </para>
            <para>Effective communication is recognised as a primary, requirement for the conversion operation and it will be a major aim of the Board to achieve this. </para>

            <para>Is it a fact that the Australian Industry Development Corporation has been engaging staff? If so, what is the total weekly wage bill for the Corporation? What are the salaries paid individually? What are the classifications of the people receiving those salaries? Has the Aid commenced the investigation of applications for funds? Has the Aid been given any economy direction by the Government in respect of the control of its expenses? </para>

          <quote>
            <para>The Australian Industry Development Corporation Act provides that the control and management of the Corporation are vested in a Board of Directors of the Corporation. In the exercise of its powers the Corporation is not subject to direction by or on behalf of the Commonwealth. No directions have been given to the Corporation other than those clearly set out in the Act. </para>
            <para>The Board of Directors consists of eminent persons, widely experienced in business and public service, who are of unquestionable integrity and probity. The Board is required to submit a report annually to the Minister on the operations of the Corporation during each year, together with properly audited statements in such form as the Treasurer approves. The annual report and financial statements are required to be laid before each House of the Parliament by the Minister and this will be done. </para>

            <para>- On 17th May <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buttfield</inline> addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Industry, the following question without notice: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Industry and has particular reference to those honourable senators who claim that Taiwan-Australia interests should be submerged for those of Red China and Australia in the recognition of Red China. Is it a fact that the United States Ambassador in Taiwan has publicly predicted that Taiwan&#39;s international trade volume may be equal &#39; to or in excess of that of Mainland China in 2 or 3 years&#39; time? Is it a fact that, taking 1968 as a base year, Taiwan increased its international trade 33 per cent last year and by 23.9 per cent in 1969 while Mainland China increased its trade by 6.3 per cent in 1969 and S.8 per cent last year? Can the Minister give similar figures for the volumes and growth rates of trade between Taiwan and Australia and Red China and Australia? </para>
          </quote>
          <para>The Minister for Trade and Industry has provided the following answers to the questions: </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(1)">
              <para>I understand that die United States Ambassador to the Republic of China said, when addressing the American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei, that the Republic of China&#39;s total trade volume may be equal to, or larger than, that of the People&#39;s Republic of China within 2 or 3 years. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>The Republic of China&#39;s international trade increased by 34 per cent (exports by 33 per cent, imports by 35 per cent) from 1968 to 1969. I understand that figures for 1970 have not yet been received by the Department of Trade and Industry. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(3)">
              <para>Trade statistics are not published by the People&#39;s Republic of China and can be obtained only on a derived basis from statistics reported by other countries. Some countries do not report trade statistics with the People&#39;s Republic of China and therefore total People&#39;s Republic of China trade can only be an estimate. However, allowing for these assumptions, it would appear that the People&#39;s Republic of China&#39;s total trade increased by approximately 7 .per cent in 1969 compared with 1968. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(4)">
              <para>Australia&#39;s trade with the Republic of China increased by 29 per cent in 1969 (exports by 26 per cent, imports by 37 per cent) and by 27 per cent in 1970 (exports by 24 per cent, imports by 33 per cent). Australia&#39;s trade with the People&#39;s Republic of China increased by 29 per cent in 1969 &#39;(exports by 34 per cent, imports by 14 per cent) and by 7 per cent in 1970 (exports by 8 per cent, imports by 3 per cent). </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(5)">
              <para>As requested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cant</inline> in a later question on 17th May, I asked the Minister for a list of goods on which trade is restricted with the People&#39;s Republic of China. On 31st May. the Acting Minister for Trade and Industry announced that the revised list of goods subject to strategic export controls would be available from Offices of the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department of Customs and Excise in Canberra and the capital cities on 1st June 1971. The products remaining under export control for the People&#39;s Republic of China will now be the same as those under export control for the European Communist countries, excluding Yugoslavia. Further, I have obtained the following trade statistics of Australia&#39;s trade with the Republic of China and the People&#39;s Republic of China for the interest of senators. </para>

            <para>When the six D.C.3 aircraft were purchased by the Government&#39; from Jet air Australia Ltd their respective Certificates of Airworthiness were valid to the dates indicated below subject to the aircraft being maintained in&#39; accordance with inspection and maintenance schedules approved by the Department of Civil Aviation: </para>

            <para class="block">The schedules approved for the D.C.3 aircraft operated by Jet air Australia Ltd required each aircraft to be maintained in accordance with an approved maintenance schedule which included specified inspections at the completion of every 100 hours of operation. The continued airworthiness of each aircraft is dependent upon the aircraft being operated to the approved operations manual and maintained to the approved maintenance manual. When such maintenance as is found necessary to maintain the airworthiness of the aircraft concerned is completed, a Maintenance Release is issued certifying that the aircraft is considered airworthy for a further period. </para>
            <para>These aircraft are now no longer being operated or maintained under the Jet air approved manuals and therefore have not been subjected to the maintenance release certifying process described. Since the aircraft were purchased by the Government the Department of Civil Aviation has not been involved in assessing the maintenance status of the aircraft and therefore the unexpired periods of the Certificates of Airworthiness are only book entries and do not in themselves reflect the airworthiness or otherwise of the aircraft. The aircraft are currently being overhauled prior to delivery. </para>

              <para>Yes. However the figures published by the Australian Road Research Board convey the impression of a relationship between Commonwealth grants for road works and amounts collected from fuel taxes. </para>
            </item>

          <para>There is no such association. The Government takes the view that it is unsound practice to allocate the proceeds of any one tax to a particular class of expenditure. To do so would cut across the fundamental budgetary principle that all government receipts should be paid into a common account. From this account particular expenditures can be met only with the approval of Parliament under the annual votes or special appropriations. </para>

              <para>- In moving this motion I feel it is important at the outset to clarify its terms and intention. It is equally important to clarify beyond all doubt those areas of trade union activities which lie outside the purpose of this motion. The motion refers to industrial trade union organisations. This description, in the view of the Australian Democratic Labor Party, applies to trade unions, their role and proper purposes. No-one who has studied the history of their formation and growth can deny the vital role that trade unions have played in improving the conditions and status of working people. </para>

              <para>-  I was saying that the trade unions had within a century achieved a transformation no less dramatic than that which resulted from the Industrial Revolution. At the time of the foundation of the unions in England and Australia the founders had a very important choice to make. They could use the growing strength and organisation of these bodies to create dissent, violent agitation and revolution against the state or they could proceed within the framework of the British parliamentary system. At the time of which I am speaking the British parliamentary system was far from perfect. The Parliament was elected by restrictive franchise and it was not fully democratic in the modern sense. The wealthy and economically privileged were firmly entrenched in office and representation of the nation as a whole was far from adequate. Our parliamentary system through its gradual evolution has become a tribute to the Anglo-Saxon genius for compromise and gradual progress. </para>

I was saying that the founders of Anglo-Australian trade unionism had two choices. The first was to agitate and to protest, the end result of which would have been revolution, and the alternative was to operate through the parliament. They chose to operate through the parliament. There can be no doubt that these men possessed a thirst for justice and progress, but with progress and the growth of industrial power came great responsibility. They recognised in the Parliament, imperfect though it was, the nation&#39;s highest forum for debate, decision and authority. </para>

If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> reads the history of the time of the collapse of the great strike in 1890 he will learn that at a meeting in the Sydney Trades Hall the Trades Hall Council, as it was - or Labour Council - took a decision to form what was until about IS years ago the Labor Party. </para>

              <para>- 1 think the resolution of the Trades Hall Council at that time went something like this: The trumpet notes at which the barriers will fall are essentially political. It said that they must set about the work of reform in the place where reforms can be won, that is, in the Houses of Parliament. Undoubtedly the leaders of the trade union movement at that time formed the Labor Party. For <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cant&#39;s</inline> information I point out that it was not called the Australian Labour Party. At that time it was referred to as political labour leagues. It was a recognition by leaders in the trade union movement that the use of their collective industrial power was limited strictly to industrial issues. Strikes and bans were confined to questions of wages and conditions related directly to their members and their working welfare. The role of Parliament was recognised and respected. It was accepted that, issues affecting the nation as a whole were for Parliament to debate and decide, if the Parliament failed in its task the growing franchise, which by this time had been extended to every citizen, could be used to censure and, indeed, to remove a government. </para>

          <para>Unions today are highly industrialised in a country such as Australia and they have enormous power for influence on the national economy and the lives and living standards of all our citizens. Irresponsibly used, strikes and stoppages on whatever pretext can inflict great economic wounds on the whole nation in terms of irreplaceable lost production, lost wages and rising costs and prices. I remind the Senate that in the first 5 months of 1971 workers alone were estimated to have lost $18m in wages. At this rate the loss for the 12 months will amount to $43m. </para>

              <para>- The honourable senator should hold his horses for a moment. If this rate of loss continues they will have lost $43m by the end of this year. I do not mention the cost in loss of production because <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> want to stress the losses suffered by workers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> who is trying to interrupt was probably never a worker. Perhaps I could add that the by-election for the State seat of Maryborough, with which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> is no doubt familiar, showed very clearly what the workers thought of this misuse of political power. I remind my friend that the seat of Maryborough was held by Labor for 70 years, except for the 3 years when the Moore Government was in office, and that at the by-election there was a swing of 14 per cent against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges&#39;</inline> Party. I emphasise the loss in wages because 1 want to emphasise the loss to wage earners. Lost wages affect not the bosses but the very men, their wives and families, whom the trade unions claim to defend. </para>

          <para>How often in strike decisions such as these are the rank and file members of the union consulted? All too frequently the union bureaucracy calls a strike and relies on the union&#39;s solidarity and coercive power to give it effect. I have spent almost a lifetime in the Labor movement and in the unions, and nobody appreciates mont than I the necessity for the unionist to have the right to strike in order to better his working conditions and improve his wage earnings. But the use of political strikes is outside the role of trade unions. I am sure I will upset some of my Senate colleagues on the Opposition side at a later stage in my speech when I quote what their very eminent leader at one time said about strikes. I refer to the late <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Evatt.</inline> If they want to get excited I suggest that they hold their horses until I reach that stage in my address. </para>
          <para>I now take the opportunity to mention some of the political strikes. I say that they were not designed to improve working conditions or to get higher wages. They were simply and purely political strikes aimed at the very power and authority of government. I will now cite some recent examples. On 4th September 1970 the Waterside Workers Federation struck over the case of &#39;Bunna&#39; Walsh. It will be recalled that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Walsh</inline> was prevented from taking his seat in the Victorian State Parliament because of his failure to reveal a conviction for an offence committed some years earlier. It is worth recalling that his exclusion subsequently was upheld in the courts. On 18th September 1970 the maritime and building groups of unions ceased work in support of the Victorian moratorium. On 2nd February 1971 the Australian Builders Labourers Federation struck over the arrest of Norman Gallagher, a Communist union official who was arrested on a charge of physical assault. On 14th February 1971 and again on 25th March 1971 the seam ens and waterside workers unions held stoppages of various types to protest against the Greek Government. </para>

              <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> obviously does not understand what is meant by trade unionism. On 21st July 1971 the Queensland Trades and Labour Council called a State-wide 24- hour stoppage in protest against the State Government&#39;s declaration of a state of emergency over the visit of the Springboks. I remind my Senate colleagues from Queensland that the by-elections held at that time clearly revealed the attitude of the Australian people towards this wrongful use of union power. In 1970 there were also union bans designed to prevent the export from Australia of merino rams. Every one of the incidents in the list I have - it is far from exhausted - represents a polit cal stoppage. In no case did the stoppage involve an economic issue with any employer. In fact, in each case the so-called dispute was incapable of being solved by consultation between the unions and the employers. </para>

          <para>The Democratic Labor Party submits that such political strikes cause not only economic damage, loss of wages and public inconvenience but, more seriously, they pervert the real role of trade unionism. They go further still; they amount, in fact, to a usurpation of powers specifically entrusted by the Commonwealth Constitution to the Commonwealth Parliament, and to it alone. Section 51 (i) of the Constitution reserves to this Parliament the power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to trade and commerce&#39;. Section 51 (xxix) of the Constitution deals with the external affairs power in a similar way. Clearly, then, political stoppages and bans of the kind I mentioned amount to trade unions and their officials attempting to usurp or impede the constitutional powers of this Parliament. Clearly, then, in the view of the Democratic Labor Party, the Government should act quite firmly against this illegal presumption. By doing so it will not only protect the authority of this Parliament but also defend our democratic system against those determined to destroy it. </para>
          <para>It might be asked: What can the Government do? All that the Government needs to do is what <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Evatt</inline> did in 1947. There exists already on our statute book an Act of Parliament designed to prevent union usurpation of the Commonwealth defence powers. I refer to an Act providing for &#39;the protection of the approved Defence Projects&#39; - I am sure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> will know something about this - &#39;and for other purposes&#39;. It was passed in 1947 by the Chifley Labor Government when the late <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Evatt</inline> was Attorney-General. </para>

            <para>The developing practice of using industrial Trade Union organisations to effect purposes of a political character, not designed to or. having the effect of improving the industrial conditions of the members of these organisations and not directly and immediately related to industrial issues but for the purpose of affecting political decisions. . . . </para>

          <para class="block">The trade union movement is part of the political process of this community. Not only in Australia but all over the world trade unions take part in the political decisions which are made, including those which are not related immediate.ly to wages and conditions. That is part of our history. I am astonished to learn that anything to the contrary would be suggested. One should remember the Tolpuddle martyrs and also that in ancient times the associations of workers were concerned not only with wages and conditions but also with political matters. </para>
          <para>This matter has been dealt with in depth in Australia in recent years. The right of the trade unions to engage in political decision making and to pursue political purposes was the subject of challenge in this community not so long ago. That challenge was resolved in the High Court. In a case in which one of our colleagues figured very prominently, the High Court decided that trade unions had the right to pursue political purposes and to impose political levies on their members in order to pursue those political purposes. That was the great case of Hurley and Williams. I suggest that those members who heard the suggestions that the trade unions cannot and should not do this refer to the case of Williams and Hurley, which&#39; is reported in 103 Commonwealth Law Reports. If one reads especially the passages at page 58 and 59 one sees that the High Court rejected the proposition that the trade union movement should not be permitted to pursue political purposes. The quotations from the judgment show, for example, that the writers of legitimate trade union history, one of whom was Hancock, said that an original development of trade unionism in Australia was its decision in the 80s of last century to play a direct part in politics. Further quotations from writers show that the decade 1880-1890 was a decade of industrial conflicts, often culminating in strikes, in all the Australian colonies. Out of that arose the decision of the trade union movement to establish political parties, lt is right that they were called by various names, but they eventually became the great Australian Labor Party. </para>
          <para>The trade union movement still is an integral part of the Australian Labor Party. Delegates are sent by the trade unions to the Australian Labor Party conferences. Those delegations form part of its various councils and bodies. </para>

              <para>-  The question almost answers itself.. The delegates are sent by the trade unions to the Australian Labor Party conferences. They take part in the formation of decisions on social and economic matters. They leave there, as do the other delegates who come from branches and leagues, and endeavour in every manner possible to see that the decisions are carried out. That is part of the duty of the trade unions which help to formulate the social and economic policies. What would they be doing in the Australian Labor Party if it was not part of their function not only to participate in the making of decisions but also to see that those decisions were carried out? That is the role of the trade unions in Australia. It is an accepted role, it is a proper role and it is a lawful role, as has been declared by the High Court of Australia. The High Court rejected the proposition that for trade unions to engage in these political activities was in some way illegal. It is absurd to suggest that it is. It has been suggested here that in some way the trade unions must retreat and be concerned only with wages and conditions. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Not only do the trade unions affiliate with the Australian Labor Party but - and it may well still be so - there was a very small number of trade unions actually affiliated with the Democratic Labor Party. In Victoria for some time the Victorian branch of the Federated Clerks Union of Australia and the Victorian branch of the Federated Ironworkers Association of Australia - and there may be others - were affiliated with the Democratic Labor Party. I do not know the present position. It is clear that it is par i of the traditional role of the trade unions to be concerned with political matters, even those unassociated with wages and conditions. Is this not reasonable? We have great associations of workers which under the laws of the Commonwealth are conducted in an extremely democratic manner, in which the members must have control of their committees of management, and in which there are all sorts of provisions for secret ballots and election of members. It is reasonable and natural that in this community they should take part in the democratic process. </para>
          <para>Yet here we have a proposition which points to the developing practice of using industrial trade union organisations to effect purposes of a political character. Of course they should be used for that purpose and it is recognised that they should be used for that purpose. I notice that it is not said in the motion that there should be any complaint about the employers organisations being used for political purposes even though there is available from the Parliamentary Library the text of articles written by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Trevor</inline> Matthews, entitled </para>
          <para class="block">The Political Activities of Australia&#39;s Employer Federations&#39;. He sets out how the various federations of employers engage in political activities. On page 6 he says that the Victorian Employers Federation proudly regarded itself as the first body in Australia to openly proclaim its determination to fight Socialism as the one issue before Australia. There is various other matter in the articles showing the extent to which employer federations and other bodies engage in politics. But the mover does not mention anything about that. The myth is that in some way the various bodies in Australia which are associated for purposes of religion or social action of some kind are non-political. The reality is that bodies such as the churches, the Returned Servicemen&#39;s League and great companies formed for profit all are engaging in political activity. No one says that they should not engage in that political activity, except the mover of the motion. He says that associations of workers should not engage in political activity; they should not use the industrial trade union organisations to effect purposes of a political character. What nonsense. </para>
          <para>There are books written on the lobbies, the interest groups of the 4 continents, edited by Professor Ehrmann, setting out the lobbies which are operating in this community, and there are- some very heavy lobbies indeed. They are all entitled to do it but somehow the trade unions are not, that this is unthinkable and there should be some limitation upon them. The trade unions have found that very often they have to engage in these political drives. In some States, of course, it is in practice impossible for them to get the desired social and economic changes through the parliamentary institutions because the parliamentary institutions are not democratic. How can one describe Queensland as being a democratic State when there is a gerrymander which makes it practically impossible for the political party associated with the trade unions to win government? How can one regard as democratic the other States which have upper chambers stacked in a fashion which makes it impossible for the Australian Labor Party to win government there? When one has, as in South Australia, a situation that can only be described as democratic, then one has bodies going out and properly seeking to effect political change by persuasion of the whole community and, if necessary, engaging where they consider it proper in strikes and stoppages. </para>
          <para>The debate here is not introduced merely in order to say that unions are not to engage in stoppages and strikes. There is no word about that in the motion. This is a motion designed to encourage the Government to somehow bring in legislation or to invoke legislation which will prevent the trade unions from carrying out a part of the great democratic political process, and it should not be accepted by the Senate. What are the kinds of things that have been complained about? It is true that in recent times the trade unions have complained about the failure of governments to provide properly for social services in this community. There have been stoppages over that. In addition there has been a tremendous amount of propaganda of a political type directed by the trade unions against the Federal Government for its failure to do what is rightly conceived to be social justice. Are they not entitled to do that? The trade union movement has been in the forefront of the great struggle against the war in Vietnam. It is not entitled to do that? ls it wrong that trade unions should join with the other groups in the community, the churches - not all the churches but a number of them - to protest against something which is against their social conscience and which is important enough for them to say to their members: &#39;We ask you to stop work, to lose wages and to show how much you disapprove of this evil war, this genocide being committed against the Vietnamese people&#39;. Has the time come when it is said that the trade union movement is not allowed to do that? </para>
          <para>It is said that the trade unions ask their members to protest in various ways against the Springbok tour here. Why are they not entitled to do so? I was at the conference on human rights in Teheran and I well recall the motions which were passed there by the delegations from most of the world. Those delegations through the decision to which there was no opposition pointed out that despite requests there were still some countries and some sporting bodies which were allowing South Africa to engage in international sport and they called upon the governments to use their influence with their national sporting bodies to exclude South </para>
          <para class="block">Africa from international sport: In another resolution the conference called upon not only governments but peoples everywhere to protest against what was being done by the South African Government in pursuing its abominable policy of apartheid. In innumerable resolutions the United Nations has called upon governments and people to cut off cultural, social and sporting exchanges with the Government of South Africa while that policy of apartheid continues. When that call comes from the United Nations why are not the trade unions, as representatives of their members, entitled to respond to that call and do what the Government of Australia has failed to do - that is, to heed the international call? Why are they not entitled to say: &#39;As citizens of the world we respond to what the United Nations is asking us to do. We will do it. We will protest in every way we can. If necessary we will suspend our labour. We will spend our money. We will do everything we can in order to ensure that the wishes of the United Nations are carried out in this country&#39;? Whether the attitude of the trade union movement happens to be correct, whether I am right on the issue or somebody else is right on the issue, surely it is within the function of the trade union movement to enter into the political process and do what it can on these issues. Or is it to be said that only the employer oranisations an go on - as is said in that body - and mostly operate by methods of secrecy in order to achieve their political purposes? It is very rarely that they come out into the open. Very often secret activity is carried out by those organisations. The writer of the article refers to what was said by the Employers&#39; Federation in New South Wales in the annual report. The statement is: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>As is customary in the management of all such institutions it is found judicious in the interests of those concerned not to give immediate publicity to the action taken by the committee in connection with some questions which have frequently to be dealt with privately. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The employer organisations are to be free to pursue political purposes, to take whatever action they might in relation to governments, to do it in private and to pursue political purposes in all sorts of devious ways. Is the trade union movement in this country to be told in some way what it must or must not do or to be subjected to legislation which will prevent it from enter ing into the democratic political processes of this country? The trade union movement all through its history has insisted upon its right, as representative of the working class movement of the various countries, to take social and economic action which in some cases is associated and in other cases is not associated with the immediate improvement of wages and conditions. The trade union movement will insist upon doing this. I do not care what might be said by the Australian Democratic Labor Party or this Government. This is a matter of free speech and the right to pursue democratic ends. The trade union movement will not be deprived of this right. No legislation is going to deprive us of the right of free speech. No legislation is going to prevent the trade union movement striking if it feels the issue is important enough. The right to strike distinguishes the free man from the slave, and the trade union movement of this country will not be enslaved by any legislation. </para>
          <para>The issues for which the trade union movement has stood are right. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon</inline> has told me, if, during the war, the trade union movement of Holland had not refused to co-operate with the Nazis in shipping the Jews out of Holland the Jews of Holland would have perished. It was through the efforts of the trade union movement that many - not all - of the Jews in Holland were saved from that fate. That action was inconsistent with this motion. If this motion were carried and if the trade union movement could be reduced to impotence and could be castrated, as the mover of this motion would have it, how long would it be before some other body would next be told: &#39;It is not your right to enter into the political processes in this way. You stick to what you are set up to do.&#39; Companies will be told to stick to making profits. Other individuals will be told to keep to their work and not to be concerned with political activities. The Australian Labor Party will vote against this motion in order to indicate its disapproval of the statement which is included in the motion as the reason for its being dealt with urgently by the Senate. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- The argument which we have heard from the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> is false.  It is  based upon the utmost confusion, as a mere reading of the proposition put before us by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kane</inline> will demonstrate. I think that nobody in this country would deny the right of any individual member of a trade union or the trade union itself to free and unfettered participation in the democratic, lawful processes of this country. That is not the issue. To show how thoroughly biased and distorted is the argument which we have heard from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> from the start I shall take time quietly to refer to the High Court decision to which the honourable senator made reference. It was a case in which I had the honour to take part. The Waterside Workers Federation had imposed a levy for a political fund which the Surveys refused to pay. The High Court held that it was lawful for the union to impose such a levy and that on non-payment the Surveys ceased to hold membership. That aspect of the decision is explained by the Justices at pages  58  and  59.  But the gravamen of the decision was that thereafter when the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority called upon registered waterside workers to work the Surveys went along to take part in the work and members of the union took part in picketing by forming human barricades of members and supporters. The Surveys were subjected to assaults, threats and insults from individuals in the picket line. After the picketing ceased members of the Waterside Workers Federation walked off the job and by a combination of numbers and those unlawful acts prevented the Surveys from gaining employment. That was the cause of action which the High Court held to be valid, saying that the Surveys had a cause of action for conspiracy based upon acts done pursuant to a combination to prevent them by unlawful means from presenting themselves for employment in stevedoring operations. That was the reason why each Hurley recovered  &#163;1,000  for the infringement of that civil right. There we have a suppression on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> of any reference to the unlawfulness of the trade union action and the citation of  2  pages which are of a sound historical introductory nature which point up where we really find the reason for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy&#39;s</inline> fire. It is this: We know that the workmen of England were repressed throughout last century for a century and more. It was by reason of an alleviation of the legislative position that in Australia one of the first acts of the Federal Parliament was to create a system of compulsory arbitration in order to ensure that workmen&#39;s organisations would not have to battle it out against the superior weight of capital without an independent arbiter between them. That arbiter was established in the form of the arbitration court. That was in  1904,  when this country, through its legislature, established the means of industrial justice for industrial organisations whether they were employer or employee. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In conformity with the Constitution that court was established to deal only with industrial disputes. Political disputes, disputes against the civil law, or disputes against international law are quite beyond the range of the constitutional power of this Parliament or the arbitration court and quite beyond the range of any purpose for which industrial organisations were set up. Because the Constitution has limited the power of this Parliament to legislating for conciliation and arbitration in industrial disputes extending beyond the borders of any one State, it is quite obvious that the court is limited to industrial disputes. When that legislation made provisions as one of its objects to register organisations of labour so that men would not have access to it as individuals but could combine in their organisations so as to present their case before the court, quite obviously the purposes of those organisations were limited to the purposes of the court - purposes defined by the Constitution, namely, industrial purposes. </para>
          <para>The reason why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> has resorted to such vehemence and fire instead of a little dispassionate analysis of the position is that in that day and age the workmen&#39;s organisations thought they would find their fulfilment through the political party that they themselves created and which later became the Australian Labor Party. It is to the shame of that Party that now having been in Opposition for nearly  22  years the workmen find it unavailing in giving assistance in the Parliament. Therefore it is not unnatural that the organisations should be disposed to resort to unparliamentary and industrial means to create their purposes outside. It is those excesses which make <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kane&#39;s</inline> motion timely - we are reminded to take note of them. I sympathise with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> and those sitting behind him because they have been nourishing themselves on Dead Sea fruit for such a long time. I have no doubt that it is a bitter and unpalatable process. They cannot afford in this place much encouragement to the organisations which they would wish to represent. But I counsel them very strongly in that despair not to encourage combinations of whatever character outside the Parliament to undertake by their own exertions the achievement of things which should be done only within the Parliament. 1 counsel organisations in this country not to think that they can use their industrial strength for the direct coercion of other people in the community in order to get their way or to implement a decision they would wish to gain in the political field, unless they can persuade the franchised people of the country, through the medium qf .the ballot box, to send to this Parliament in sufficient numbers representatives and here, by law, change any injustice that they feel they have, because organisations are constituted for the purpose of dealing with industrial issues. </para>
          <para>I always feel greatly heartened when 1 remind myself how at the end of the last century great industrial agitation took place when the unions finally achieved representation in Parliament and a political party which represented their general purposes became a political unit in the country. At that time Parliament was acknowledged as the place in which all sections of the community should have such representatives as the franchise entitled them according to their policies. But now. in the last 2 or 3 years, goaded and incited by frustrated political figures such as the Leader of the Opposition and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr J.</inline> F. Cairns, we have the idea that is illustrated by a few incidents that I shall mention. Some were mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kane.</inline></para>
          <para>Not only do we have these gentlemen striking but we have a tendency in the builders&#39; labourers activities in Sydney not to go on peaceful striking and picketing processes but actually to assault those who wish to work on the job. pull part of the job down and indulge in that form of activity. Coming closer to home, let me mention the Springboks visit. We heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> refer to his visit to Teheran, the Declaration of Human Rights and non-racial discrimination. Time out of number we have asserted our abhorrence of any doctrine of apartheid. But time out of number we have insisted upon the fact that if a sporting team comes here its members are entitled to play their game and to be treated as visitors in accordance with the law. For the Post Office gentry to refuse to deliver their mail or to pass on their messages and for other sections of organised labour to threaten to ground air services and rail services just because these 20-odd people who are vis ting us for the purpose of playing sport come from a country where the government exercises a policy of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> disapprove- </para>

          <para>However, the purpose pf my reference to this matter is to show that when the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the supreme industrial organisation conference in the country, passes a resolution inviting coercion by organised labour, that is the point where we deny that the ACTU is still acting within the ambit of its proper purposes. When it goes on to urge a vendetta, resistance to entrance to a ground, the throwing of bombs and invasion of the field why, even members of the Labor Party in the person of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dunstan</inline> and the Premier of Western Australia have come out strongly to deny that these matters are within the ambit of trade union purposes. </para>

              <para>- When the sitting was suspended we were considering a subject that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kane</inline> brought to our attention, warning of the abuses that could occur if there was a persistence in the present attitude of industrial organisations of using their efforts for political as distinct from industrial purposes. I address the Senate for a few minutes on the resumption of the sitting because I believe that this subject raises a very fundamental issue which it is timely to discuss in the present situation. The Australian trade unions, apparently having lost faith in the party which claims that it espouses their cause - that is to say, the Australian Labor Party - are resorting more and more to direct and unlawful action which, I believe, will be a great detriment to industrial organisations if they persist in it. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I remind the Senate that industrial organisations had their being and were created under Australian law for the purpose of facilitating their audience before the arbitration commission in order to give them industrial justice. In addition to that, in this century the civil law has given them many immunities so as to enable them to organise their affairs, in the hope that industrial equity will be more available. There have been legislative measures that have given them particular advantages: But they use the principle of solidarity in their organisation for the purpose of compelling the rank and file of the organisation to follow the decision that is made by the organisation. This decision is appropriate if it is made on industrial issues, but they cannot expect to have a cohesive organisation following their decisions if those decisions are made for purposes for which they are not constituted, namely, political, racial, religious or other purposes that are foreign to industrial issues. </para>
          <para>Lel me cite just a few of the instances in which I believe the trade union movement has been exercising this power to the abuse of its real purposes. In Vietnam Moratorium Campaigns we have had 3 occasions on which there have been widespread stoppages of work, involving terrific loss, in support of a matter which is purely a political one and which, by its nature, should be left for decision by the nation&#39;s Parliament. Let me take the case of the embargo on the export of merino rams. That is purely a trade question upon which trade organisations in the wool industry have spoken and on which the government of the day has made a decision. Yet we have the Australian Council of Trade Unions organising its forces to prevent the facilities of trade from being made available for the export of merino rams. Then we had a case in which the Court of Disputed Returns in Melbourne adjudicated upon the qualification of a waterside worker in that city to be a member of the Victorian Legislative Council. It would rarely be thought appropriate, I suggest - and then only by very few people - for a labour stoppage to occur in protest against a court decision. Yet that occurred in September last year in the circumstances I have mentioned. </para>
          <para>Next we had a stoppage because the secretary of a trade union was arrested and subsequently convicted of assault in the course of a political scrimmage. What immunity has a secretary of a trade union organisation from the courts of law? What has it to do with the union by way of a stoppage of work? Then in February this year the Seamen&#39;s Union banned service to United States vessels as a demonstration of support for the anti-war congress held in Sydney in that month. We even had a strike called because this Government saw fit to introduce legislation for the protection of law and order in this country, which legislation was passed through the Parliament with the approval of the majority of the elected representatives. Also we have had bans on Greek vessels in protest against actions of the present Greek Government. Seamen&#39;s, waterside workers and firemen&#39;s unions have restricted the operation in Australian waters of Greek vessels. Vessels of the Greek passenger line, Chan dr is Lines, have been a particular victim. They have been delayed no fewer than 16 times between May 1970 and August this year. Between July 1970 and July this year 35 ships of Greek ownership were delayed for periods ranging from 1 day ;o several days. Last July we even had a stoppage of work and a protest by waterside workers in Sydney against taxation rates. Then the ACTU - I think it was actually its  president  - approved of a stoppage on the basis of social services. </para>
          <para>Of course, we are all familiar with the misguided attempt that the. ACTU made in relation to the Springboks&#39; tour. I would have thought that, so far from espousing this line of operation, those who had any solicitude for the existence and welfare of the trade union movement would see in this course of conduct a most divisive factor which, if persisted in, cannot be tolerated by any democratic community that puts its faith in a parliament elected by the majority of the people. With regard to the Springboks&#39; tour, although the trade union organisations were effective in creating dismay, engendering international ill will and creating a. good deal of resentment on the part of the members of our Australian community who desired to afford the ordinary Australian hospitality to visiting sportsmen, we have seen a divisiveness on the part of the Australian trade union movement that ought to be quite obvious to those who have the goodwill of that movement at heart. </para>
          <para>Is it surprising then that as a result of this and other ill considered actions the man days lost by stoppages rose from about 750,000 in 1966 to nearly 2,500,000 last year? One has only to state those causes and those results to see the damage that the exertion of this industrial organisation power does to the men who are working bona fide in their industry and wish to use their organisation for the betterment of their industry. One has only to see the damage that it can do to the economic fabric of this country and to make mere mention of the Glasgow dockyards, the collapses that have taken place in big manufacturing concerns in America and the general economic situation in that country, which has industrial unrest to a greater degree than we have in this country, to see that the economic welfare of the trade unionist is at risk. Finally, it makes a challenge to the fundamental basis upon which we Australians wish to have our political government conducted, that is, after free elections at which trade unionists and others exercise their franchise. In this Parliament and in the other parliaments of Australia, those who are elected make the decisions by which this country should be governed. It is because of that fundamental principle that I believe the proposition that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kane</inline> put forward tonight is most appropriate for debate. I hope that as the debate continues this Senate will show in no uncertain way that it stands for the principle that Parliament, and not any section of this community, should be the dominant influence with regard to the laws under which Australians shall be governed. </para>

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> in concluding his address made a very important statement which I direct to the attention of honourable senators. He said that the United States of America had a record of industrial unrest much greater than that in Australia. The facts are, of course, that, in Australia our level of industrial unrest compares more than favourably with that of. any similar developed country. Any similar industrialised country generally has more stoppages of work than has Australia. So the only case which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> and the Australian Democratic Labour Party have made is that some of the strikes may be unnecessary. The Democratic Labour Party makes the point that a lot of the stoppages are occasioned by political motives and that that should not bc the role of the trade unions. </para>

              <para>- No, it is not industrial. Let me read something which was published as far back as 1964. Everybody is attacking poor old <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> who can look after himself, but I want to say a word in support of him. I refer to something which was done in 1964 when the late Albert Monk was  president  of the ACTU. This is something which government supporters say is politically motivated action, that is, the condemnation of discrimination on racial grounds. I am referring to the apartheid question, the Springboks* campaign in Australia. The December 1964 issue of &#39;The ACTU Bulletin&#39; carried a statement from the executive of the ACTU. The chief of the ACTU then was Albert Monk and the secretary was Harold Souter. He still holds that position. What is suggested in this statement could not be done with the sort of policies advocated by the DLP and which the Government wants to put into operation. The statement reads: </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <quote>
            <para>That the ACTU make representations by deputation to the Commonwealth Government to initiate and support, in the United Nations Assembly, world-wide sanctions, including diplomatic, economic and an arms embargo on South Africa, and the Australian Government to implement such decision in Australia in accordance with the United Nations Assembly deliberations. </para>
            <para>The ACTU also to request the ICFTU- </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is the Inter nation Confederation of Free Trade Unions, an international body which finds acceptance by both right and left of the trade union movement -  to re-examine the question as to whether a world boycott could be instituted by all Trade Unions throughout the world, to boycott the handling of South African goods. </para>
          <para class="block">Today the Government supports the DLP. It is very significant that if the Government which wants to take the old dog collar Acts out of their secret places and place them on the trade union movement in 1971, is not prepared to apply them today because of troubles in its own Party. For many months it has been probing the Australian electorates to see what support it may have for an attack on the arbitration system and its relationships with the ACTU. This Government has been very lucky over the years. It has had a trade union movement which has, in fact, directed its political aims to the Government, on occasions making industrial activity around it, but generally speaking, it has been trotting up to the Government for years what were in fact not just industrial aims but political aims. To change the Conciliation and Arbitration Act is obviously not just an industrial aim: it is a political aim. </para>
          <para>Finally, the Government by political action has to agree to something. May I mention the penal provisions of the Act? For years we in the Senate and in the other place have been debating the right to impose the penal provisions. They are in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, but in the years subsequent to their introduction the Government, because of the case put up by the unions and also because of militant action by the union - action in the workshops, in the factories and on the waterfront - conceded that some alteration should be made. The alteration was made because the Government was satisfied that it had to give way on the penal provisions. Apparently it wanted to re-impose them, but after negotiations with the ACTU under the leadership of Albert Monk and Bob Hawke, it decided to let them go by. But, of course, there are warnings in the air. There have been warnings by the new Prime Minister. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McMahon,</inline> who has his own great problems of changes in the Cabinet. </para>
          <para>If the coalition Government had been secure and stable, and if it felt that it had the electors behind it, it and not the Democratic Labor Party would have brought this matter before the Parliament. It would have decided to bring into the Parliament today fresh laws to hamstring the trade union movement. What was its excuse? It was the Springboks&#39; tour. Whose responsibility was it? In the eyes of the world the South African Government is condemned. The Ministers in this Government say that the South African Government carries out a policy which is wrong. All the international sporting organisations have condemned the South African Government, but ours is the only government which has invited into Australia a team- </para>

          <para>As I have said, since 1964 the Government has been warned by decisions which have been made known to it by the trade union movement, that such a policy is wrong. Tonight the Democratic Labor Party says: &#39;Look, we are independent. We will vote for whomever is right&#39;. But we know from experience and from the statements made by Democratic Labor Party leaders that their purpose is to keep the Australian Labor Party out of office. The Government talks about this new technique of the trade unions. It is not a new technique. These political aims have always been part of the history of the trade union movement and of the Australian Labor Party. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kane,</inline> of course, used only part of the story. Some of the information he quoted is accurate. </para>
          <para>The Trades and Labour Council was formed in my State in 1883. It laid down policies which were, not just industrial; they were political policies as well. One of them has not yet been achieved, that is one vote one value. As recently as the time of the last Hall Government in South Australia the trade union movement went on to the streets and to the parks and demonstrated at stop work meetings against this discrimination against the rights of electors. </para>

              <para>- Of course it is gerrymandering. How can anybody properly say that when a union seeks political justice, the right of political assembly, freedom for individuals, action against discrimination on the grounds of colour, race or creed, it is chasing political aims which are . not really a task of the trade union movement? History shows clearly that they are part and parcel of the trade unions&#39; task. Many unions are registered today under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. One of them is the Australian Workers Union, a representative, of which we have here with us. Other unions also have political aims written into their rule books which are accepted and registered under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. I am a former secretary of a Trades and Labour Council. If . you look at the rule books of Trades and Labour Councils and that of the Australian Council of Trade Unions you will see that one of their objectives is to assist, kindred organisations both inside and outside Australia. The socialisation objective has been partly achieved. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The trade union movement has such aims because it is not possible otherwise to get all sorts of freedom from industry. Every negotiation which takes place between the trade union movement in Australia and the Government is a political consultation. If there is a confrontation, it becomes a confrontation on political grounds,- but it has its origin in the relationship between the employers and labour. So the trade union movement has not become sick of the Labor Party. It has become sick of the dilly-dallying of the Government. The Labor Party has offered a challenge, and so has the trade union movement. If the Government does not accept the proposition, let us go to the electorate and find out who was right about the Springboks. What is the Government&#39;s case on the Greek ships? </para>

              <para>- Oh yes,, we issued the challenge but you would, not dare. The reason why no Government supporter has introduced this motion is because they, all know that the people are disgusted with them and with the influence of the great newspaper monopolies on the Government. Let us get on to the other question of what the Government has done for the working class and the trade unions. In every major industrial case in this country the Government has sent a representative before the Arbitration Commission and has declared its opposition to the trade union claims. Is it surprising that the trade union movement is calling for price control? Of course, the Liberal Government says that it does not believe in price control, or says that it cannot apply price control as it lacks the constitutional power. The Labor Party and the ACTU have asked the Government to convene a conference of the State governments to apply a form of price control. </para>

In addition there is scope for proper wage increases and control over profits and prices. </para>

              <para>- Perhaps you do. The surprising thing about the Democratic Labor Party is that it does not get behind the Labor Party to help to chuck out the Government. That is the only way to* solve our present problems. Let us go to an election. 1 want to refer to another 2 matters. In the United Kingdom today a. great campaign is being waged to maintain some shipyards. The DLP and the Liberal Government say. that the workers should not take over the shipyards. In the United Kingdom a group of workers, has taken political action to maintain shipyards. The British Trade Union Congress 2 days ago met the Northern Ireland Federation of Trade Unions to try to establish a peace arrangement and to keep the union movement together. That is a political purpose. </para>

              <para>- Of course it is a political purpose. I leave the observation to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kane</inline> as to the stand of the DLP in this matter. Is it not a proper aim to seek peace? Is it different from the matter of the Greek ships? The trade union movement in Australia has tried to form an affiliation with people in Greece who have been penalised and victimised. It is no different from the struggle against the Fascists during World War II. </para>

Broadly speaking, the union movement gave support to the Government&#39;s in many countries through a no strike policy. I wish to make a final point, because my time is running out. The great trade unions of the world, including the German Confederation of Trade Unions, did what they could, as did the Scandinavian trade union movement and the International Federation of Transport Unions. They tried to act together in a political matter and in respect of war aims. They helped the war effort and the struggle against tyranny and aggression. If the trade union movement in Australia today cannot seek support for its colleagues in Greece and those who are in gaol with no trade union rights, there is something wrong with society. Until this Government acts on the advice of the Labor Party and the trade union movement- </para>

Tt is a fact that recently the New Zealand Government placed on the statute book legislation which attempts to contain the inflationary position existing in that country, just as it exists here.

Now it is proposed by the same people, or at least the militants among them, and the Communist dominated trade unions to circumvent the political weapon they forged and to circumvent even this Parliament.

Very few people in this country would agree with their action. In supporting his contention that it was legitimate for a trade union to do that, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> mentioned employer organisations and said that they expressed opinions, as of course they do.

              <para>- It has been mooted that primary producer organisations be so organised as to be able to say to the rest of the community: &#39;Unless you do this, that and the other we will cut off your food supplies.&#39; I have heard that subject discussed. If this is to be the pattern, why should not any organisation go on the rampage and give expression to its political views in the same fashion as some trade unions are doing today? Along that way lies the path of anarchy - nothing more or less than that. Some months ago there was an illegal strike by the Federated Marine Stewards and Pantrymen&#39;s Association of Australasia, the members of which individually recoup, I suppose, 3 times as much as the average dairy farmer. I heard a reference to that effect only yesterday. The action by the union was inimical to the whole Commonwealth, but because of Tasmania&#39;s vulnerable position the strike amounted to a blockade of that State. There was a buildup of goods to be exported from Tasmania and for several weeks after that the shipping which was available was not able to catch up with the movement of goods that had piled up during the course of that strike. Not long after that, because the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia decided in Melbourne that it did not believe in the Springbok tour of Australia, it was decided that there should be a fresh sabotage of Tasmania. Good God! Who could go along with such a proposition? </para>

              <para>- The reason is that production was so intermittent and, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Marriott</inline> said, so irregular that Japan moved in and people who had previously bought from Tasmania began buying paper from Japan. That situation is the result of the imbecilic proposition that ships trading to Tasmania and around the Australian coast should he tied up because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bull</inline> was not in favour of the Springbok tour. Several hundred people in Tasmania have been put out of work as a result of this action and the manager of App has said that it will be some months before the industry is fully productive again. </para>

              <para>- I give him all the credit in the world for the stand he has taken. I am one who does not believe in my own State being sabotaged in that fashion for a reason that has nothing whatever to do with terms and conditions of employment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> referred to the Clyde shipbuilding yards. Let me remind the Senate of what happened in that industry. Britain lost that mighty industry, the greatest shipbuilding industry in the world, because no-one could be certain as to when a ship would be delivered; it might be next year or the year after. Because of industrial chaos, strikes and similar action no-one who lodged an order with that shipyard could be certain that the ship would be delivered. As a result they placed their orders elsewhere, in most cases with shipyards in Japan. I wonder whether those same people who are trying to reconstitute those shipyards look back and think about the wonderful job they have done in sabotaging that big industry in Britain. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline>referred to the number of working days lost in this country - I think he said because of political strikes. </para>
          <para class="block">The unions went on strike because they did not agree with the Budget, particularly with the pension increases. The way to demonstrate, according to them, was to increase costs by means of a strike and make it harder than ever before on the old age pensioners. Those same lost working days are the major cause, or one of the major causes, of inflation and increased costs in Australia. I agree entirely that until some positive direct action is taken, as indicated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kane</inline> - whatever the action may be - we just cannot afford to allow the situation to continue. It is little comfort to say that the position in Australia is not as bad as it is somewhere else. The economy of the United States is threatened, and one would be moderate in saying that the economy of the United Kingdom is staggering. Wilson, the Labor Prime Minister, was bedevilled by this when he was in office. I support absolutely the motion proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kane.</inline></para>

            <para>- I would have thought that this vital subject would have justified a longer period than is permitted to speakers under the Standing Orders relating to urgency motions. The position I face is that I am restricted to IS minutes. Some attempt is to be made in the future to restrict us even further. It is unfortunate that I must waste some of the time allotted to me. in order to address a few remarks to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> about the behaviour of some senators during the course of this debate. We have heard much about what brings credit to the Parliament, but I think that we must look at those who observe the laws of the Parliament and the laws of the land. This Parliament is the highest court in Australia and we should take cognisance of the reaction of senators to it. During your absence this afternoon, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> and when the Chair was occupied by the <inline font-weight="bold">Deputy President Senator Cant</inline> raised the matter of whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kane</inline> who moved this motion was acting within the Standing Orders because he appeared to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cant</inline> to he reading all of his speech. As you well know, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> that is a breach of the Standing Orders. Honourable senators who were here last session know that throughout the session <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kane</inline> read from documents far beyond his capability to prepare. We had to sit and listen. It was decided by my Party that as such action is a breach of the Standing Orders- </para>

              <para>-  The same thing that is wrong with the honourable senator. My point of order, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> is that a ruling was made that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kane</inline> was not reading his speech; he was referring to copious notes. I understand that doubt has now been raised about that ruling. This is an insult to the honourable senator who occupied the Chair at that time.- The point <inline font-style="italic">of. order</inline> is that the matter was ruled on and a reflection is now being cast on the occupant of the Chair at that time.  </para>

              <para>- I wish to speak to the point of order. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Little</inline> has said, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> is now purporting to canvass a ruling from the Chair. He purports to reflect on the decision of the Chair on that occasion. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cant</inline> disagreed with the ruling of the Chair at that time, a procedure was available to him. The honourable senator was invited to use it and it was indicated that that course would be followed. The Chair indicated at the time that a course was open to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cant</inline> if he wished to follow it. No objection was taken and no form of registration was used to indicate objection to the ruling. Therefore the ruling stood and has been unchallenged. I do not think it can be challenged now. It certainly cannot be challenged in the context of a reflection on the occupant of the Chair at that time. </para>

              <para>- Thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President.</inline> The ruling of the  Deputy President  was that a precedent has been set in this chamber for the use of copious notes. Therefore he reminded the honourable senator that if he stuck to that precedent there was no breach of the Standing Orders. He did not permit the reading of a speech but he permitted the use of copious notes. The honourable senator who was then speaking continued reading his copious notes. Therefore, we understood that they were copious notes and that he was not reading a document. After he completed his speech I acted within my rights under the Standing Orders and asked for the documents to be tabled in the Senate. The Senate, obviously aware of my suspicion that there may have been some contempt of the  Deputy  President&#39;s ruling on that occasion, decided to examine them and, by resolution, agreed that the documents be tabled. Upon the instruction of the Senate the documents were tabled. They now are the property of the Senate and are available to any honourable senator. Whether the honourable senator was in contempt of the  Deputy  President&#39;s ruling at that time can be proved, far better than by anything I can say, by reading Hansard tomorrow and comparing his speech with the notes which are now the property of the Senate. We have brilliant Hansard reporters who, it will be found, can report identically the copious notes which the honourable senator was using in breach of a decision that he was not allowed to read a speech. The mover of this motion, who wants to condemn some trade unions for what he calls illegal acts, in my opinion defied the highest of the judicial tribunals of Australia. I am referring to the upholder of the law who wants to condemn workers for something they did. Rather than misquote the honourable senator I shall read from the copious&#39; notes. The pages are numbered - there are 16, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President</inline> - and we find- </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy,</inline>in his contribution to. the debate, gave the history of the trade union movement. He went back as far as the Tolpuddle martyrs, who were not followers of the industrial revolution. They were agricultural workers in England who were deported to Australia because they were found guilty, under British law, and convicted on a charge of conspiracy. They had the audacity to band together to improve their conditions.

The initiation of the trade union movement in Great Britain brought about a revolution against the British system of justice at that time.

          <para class="block">I submit that before any unionist takes action in a dispute he considers this loss. It is a deprivation to his wife and family. No-one acts capriciously to deprive his family of income, for this very reason. Therefore, any call for workers to down tools, which would mean that they would lose income, would have to be for. a just cause. Time will not permit me to go into these copious notes in detail. On page 11 of these copious notes he told us of the penalties imposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Evatt&#39;s</inline> Approved Defence Projects Protection Act. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hannan</inline> tried to interject and asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kane</inline> to repeat the penalties. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kane</inline> suggested that that Act was all we needed to correct the present situation. That Act contains provisions more severe than the penal provisions of any other Act. That is Fascism in its extreme. This man, who was once said to be left wing, who was once thought of as a Com and who is now in the Democratic Labor Party, wants to gaol people. That would impoverish families. The families would have to make sacrifices. He wants to do that so that we can live under a better system. That is the type of individual that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kane</inline> is. He ignored the ruling of the  Deputy President.  What does law and order mean to him? What did law and order mean to him when he was trying to unseat the officials of the Transport Workers Union in New South Wales in the 1940s? Now he is the champion of this system of law and order because a section of the community, which is fighting for. justice, does not vote DLP. </para>

            <para>- The Senate should be indebted to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kane</inline> for two reasons. The first is that he has prompted a debate on this matter of urgency, namely: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>The developing practice of using industrial Trade Union organisations to effect purposes of a political character, not designed to or having the effect of improving the industrial conditions of the members of these organisations and not directly and immediately related to industrial issues but for the purpose of effecting political decisions, properly resting within the Constitutional power of the Commonwealth through its elected Parliament and its instrumentalities and thus usurping the functions of Government. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The second reason why the Senate should be indebted to him is because this debate has provided the people of Australia with a remarkable revelation of where the Australian Labor Party stands on this issue. At election time its members go through the pretence of asking the people to vote for them, giving electors the misguided idea that in the Parliament and through the Government they would determine the political decisions to be made. In fact that is but a pretence. They know - and all the Labor Party senators know - that the decisions which they make will be the decisions which are dictated by the union organisations which control the Labor Party of which they are members and, through the Labor Party, control every decision which they have to make. I think the revelation that has been made tonight is that in this chamber - and speaking to the people of Australia - the Labor Party senators will confess to the use of industrial power to achieve decisions. That is a negation of all that our democracy and our parliamentary system stand for. </para>
          <para>We have had given to us instances of political strikes in recent years. We will forget the political strikes of the Chifley era, when the Chifley Labor Government was prepared to introduce legislation to deal with the unions which intended to use their industrial power politically. This is a chapter in Labor history which the present Labor Party senators will conveniently forget. We will deal with the present position. We have heard from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kane</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> the many instances of political strikes&#39;, of the trade unions which would call stoppages because they disagreed with a decision of a court that a person was not eligible, because of a criminal conviction, to sit in the Legislative Council of Victoria. We have heard of the political strikes because there was an objection io a decision of the Government to engage our forces in Vietnam, notwithstanding that the people had confirmed that decision in two successive elections. We have heard of the political strikes over social service issues and because the Australian Council of Trade Unions did not like what was in the Budget. We have had a political strike because, while liking the Russian ballet and liking the Moscow Dynamos and liking everything that comes from leftist countries, it does not like what comes from South Africa and therefore that must be banned. We have had the constant sight of Greek vessels being denied the services which ought to be given to them because they are trading with Australia and bringing Australian citizens back from overseas. But no, some unions in Australia will do nothing whatever to facilitate the movement of overseas Australians back to Australia. </para>
          <para>We have not heard from the Australian Labor Party over the last 5 or 6 years any condemnation of the use of industrial power for political purposes and I challenge any one. of the Labor senators here tonight to give me one example of the Labor Party having said that it disapproves of the use of industrial power for political purposes. Honourable senators opposite cannot do so because they are wedded to a system which will permit the use of industrial power to thwart the wishes of the Government elected by the people of Australia and claiming the electoral authority which comes from having a mandate given at ah election. In short the Australian Labor Party is not concerned to respect the wishes of the people. It prefers to acknowledge the mandates and dictates of a few union bosses who through the solidarity concept can bring a number of unions behind them. That is a fact which should be exposed and reiterated constantly because it is one of the facts of life that should be made known to the electors of Australia.  </para>
          <para>If we must have chapter and verse, which sometimes the Labor Party is interested in having, there is the decision made at the last conference of the Australian Labor Party. Lauded in the Press by journalists who are inclined at the present time to put a favourable interpretation on everything the Labor Party does irrespective of its intrinsic demerits and who denigrate everything the Government does and ignore the positive record of achievement which is there for everyone who wants to look at it, there is contained in the Press . coverage of the Launceston conference a decision which highlights the point I am making. The conference accepted a policy statement, made I might say by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam,</inline> the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Australian Labor Party. The conference decided on his recommendation that the embargo on the export of merino rams should not be lifted until the majority of persons affected had decided by referendum or other fair means in favour of removing or relaxing the embargo. The lifting of the so-called ban on the export of merino rams was a decision made in accordance with the law of this land by the Executive under a power which was  granted by an Act to which the Australian Labor Party was not objecting at the time it was introduced in  1929.  The ban on the export of merino rams was imposed by the union movement in this country. It was an arbitrary, naked exercise of political power  by an industrial organisation. And what does the Australian Labor Party do,&#39; the supposed political arm of this organisation which is committed to democratic parliamentary leadership? It backs the decision of the industrial organisation. </para>
          <para>I have detected with some difficulty because of the constant interjections that some honourable senator has been asking: What has the Parliament decided? 1 will tell him what the Parliament has decided. The Parliament decided back in 1929, and honourable senators opposite know which government was in power then, that this particular decision was to be exercised by proclamation, and the Parliament has never denied that or contravened it or made any decision to the contrary. If anyone suggests to the contrary I say bluntly that he is being dishonest. I appreciate with some sympathy the difficulties honourable senators opposite are experiencing because when one speaks the truth it hurts and the Australian Labor Party knows that on this issue it is cornered because it is using extra-parliamentary tactics to achieve its purposes. One has only to refer to statements which have been made by some members of this Party over the years. Only last year we had <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> - I wonder whether any Labor Party senator is going to disavow <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns</inline> on this occasion - saying, and it is recorded in Hansard: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The weaknesses of Parliament have been widely recognised. They will not be cured by accusations of anarchy and mob rule whenever anyone decides to do something about it. Democracy is government by the people, and government by the people demands action by the people, lt demands effective ways of showing what the interests and needs of the people really are. It demands action in public places all around the land. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">He said other things too and those things were related to democracy being expressed in the factories, in the streets and in public places wherever people are to be found. He was advocating a course of civil disobedience. This is part of the Labor Party&#39;s tactic at the moment to exercise power in all the places where it can exercise industrial power. 1 believe and reiterate that this is something which ought constantly to be made known so that the people of Australia realise it. What is implicit in it? It is not that the people of Australia through their elected government must determine what are the laws, what are the limits of action, what are. the freedoms to be ascribed to the. Australian people. It is not that at ail. It is that some unrepresentative bosses, representative of and responsible to nobody, should decide who ought to make these decisions and that, of course, is a negation of democracy. It is the path of a dictator. The decision simply to impose a black ban here, to call a strike there, to refuse services to somebody in one area, to say to one individual that he will not be able to market his wool or he will not be able to market his products, is an unrepresentative type of decision because the person who makes it is answerable to no-one. Or perhaps I should say he is answerable to members of the unions, and members of the unions are not representative of the people of Australia. &#39; </para>
          <para>Decreasingly over the last few years the numbers of the Australian work force who are members of unions have diminished so that we have at the present time approximately only 50 per cent of the total work force who are members of the unions. What about the rest of Australia and the other electors? They have no voice at all. The Australian Labor Party says that it does not matter about them, if the unions say what is to be in their interests and for their benefit that is the final determination. We can see this attitude in what was decided with regard to the tour of Australia by the South African rugby players because if anybody has the right to say who should come into Australia or who should not come into Australia 1 should hope that the people of Australia would believe that that right ought to be vested in the Government having the electoral authority given to it by the people of Australia. Of course, the Australian government said there was no reason for refusing entry to the South Africans, just as there was no reason for refusing entry to any other group. But what did an unrepresentative group of people headed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> and the Australian Council of Trade Unions executive say? It said (hat it does not matter what the Australian Government wants, lt said: &#39;We shall say that these people shall not have the freedom of movement throughout Australia which is the entitlement and right of any person in Australia.&#39; So we had black bans. We had the imposition of bans on people who ordinarily would give services to the South Africans. If they did give services they were to be denied their livelihood. It did not matter about the employees of those people. They could be denied their livelihood also. </para>
          <para>What is implicit in that type of attitude? It is that a small group of persons can dictate to the people of Australia what the Australian Government has said is not to be dictated. I reiterate that they are an irresponsible group because they are answerable to nobody for their decisions. If such action can be taken in respect of the South African rugby players maybe it can be taken in the case of the South African cricket players. Maybe they will be as successful as the South African rugby players and the people of Australia will derive the same satisfaction from their visit, but the point I make is that if that can be done to anybody from overseas it can be done to people in Australia. A remarkable statement was made by a gentleman called <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Slater,</inline> the Federal  President  of the Amalgamated Postal Workers Union, which should have received more publicity than it did.

            <para>- I feel a certain sympathy with the last <inline font-weight="bold">speaker, Senator Greenwood,</inline> an ambitious man who has recently been raised to the purple. He fears that the chill political winds may rip his new robes from him almost before he has become used to wearing them. Therefore he has reverted to the tired old. smears which have been the stock-in-trade of his political party for so many years. The supporters of this shoddy little propaganda exercise have strayed so far from the point that it may be appropriate to remind the Senate what we are debating. We are not here to debate whether the Australian Labor Party supports strikers going on to building sites, tearing down the work and assaulting the men on the site. We are not here to discuss whether the Labor Party approves of violence by demonstrators. We are here to discuss a subject matter which has been framed presumably with some thought and with plenty of care by its movers. The terms are as follows: </para>
          </talk.start>

            <para>The developing practice of using industrial Trade Union organisations to effect purposes of a political character, not designed to or having the effect of improving the industrial conditions of the members of these organisations . . . Ant&#39; so on. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">One would have thought that the first thing we would have had from the supporters of this proposition would have been a definition of terms. I think it would have been enlightening to be told of the precise line of demarcation between an industrial and a political matter. But we have waited, in vain for any such definition.. The reason is perfectly obvious. It is because no such line can be drawn. Every now and then we read in the editorial columns of the daily papers pious exhortations to the unions to develop from their old-fashioned basis of merely being concerned with the wages and conditions of their members and to advance into the 70s with new ideas and a more broadly based programme for their members. When an attempt is made by the unions to act on this advice we get this sort of reaction: Get back to your old simple narrow operations of concerning yourselves merely with wages and conditions. </para>
          <para>Let us look at some of the things which the unions not only here but in other countries have been concerning themselves with in recent years. Let us decide whether the unions are stepping outside their legitimate sphere of interesting themselves in these matters. Is it not permissible for. a union to be interested in the matter of housing for its members? Is that an industrial matter within the terms of this resolution? Is it not permissible for unions to be interested in the matter of credit banking and co-operative societies? But would not that step outside what is acceptable according to the terms of this proposition? Is it not permissible for unions to be interested in matters of transport? But that also would surely be outside the unions&#39; sphere of interest. One could go 7 n Consumer protection is another such iter. According to the framers of this subject for discussion that would be&#39; an impermissible activity for a trade union. Yet as we all know it was the activities of the much maligned <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke,</inline> the beta noire of the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator&#39; Greenwood)</inline> and his like, on the question of resale price maintenance which prodded this laggard Government into finally doing something about the matter. But according to the framers of this proposition that is something which the unions are not permitted to do. Are not the unions permitted to be interested in the subject of environment? I cite an example. When a drill was set up on the Great Barrier Reef and unionists refused to man it the authorities were so ashamed that drilling operations ceased and a royal commission was set up to investigate whether any drilling should take place on the Barrier Reef at all. As yet drilling has not been resumed. Have the Australian people anything to blame unionists for in taking that action? Should they not rather praise unionists for saving this priceless national heritage. But according to the words of this submission that is something with which unions should not concern themselves. </para>
          <para>The same remarks apply to the agitation which is engaged in by unions and others over the iniquitous and scandalous Cloth development, which was approved of by the Attorney-General&#39;s associates in New South Wales. Are not the unionists who live in that area concerned both for themselves and their children with the environment in which they live and in which these children grow? Is this something about which unionists should not be concerned merely because the matter does not concern wages and conditions? Are not unionists interested in matters of health, or in tariffs which might affect their employment, or with education and pensions? After all, unionists do grow old. But if we listen to the framers and supporters of this proposition these things are beyond the charter of trade unions. Where do we draw the line? Of course, much has been made of the actions of unionists over the recent apartheid business. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> was incautious enough to state that the actions of the anti-apartheid demonstrators in Australia had involved Australia in international ill will. If the honourable senator had any familiarity with what has been written in overseas papers in recent months he would know that the only ill will which has attached to Australia over the Springboks tour has been the ill will caused by the Government in flouting all the international agreements - which were referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> - in allow- ing the Springboks to come here at all. Ill will attaches to Australia throughout Asia because we are branded as a bastion of racism for allowing the Springboks into Australia. This is far more harmful than anything the demonstrators may have done. </para>
          <para>We are constantly told by the present Government that our future lies in Asia. Whether we like it or not we are almost a part of Asia. We will have to live wilh the Asians. Does it help our future and does it help us to live with the Asians if the only thing they know about Australia is that we hang on to America&#39;s coat tails by sending troops to Vietnam and that we are one of the few countries which will allow Springbok sporting teams to come to Australia? Do the unions do Australia any ill by taking a stand against this sort of thing? We should at least be thankful that they and those who support them do something to counter the evil name which Australia gets throughout Asia by allowing . these teams into the country. </para>

No wonder <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> does not mind the Springboks coming to Australia. But as I was about to say, there is also an element of sour grapes in this motion that comes from the Democratic Labor Party.

              <para>-  That is right. They are proud of the fact that they have one or two small unions affiliated to them. They would obviously like to have more unions affiliated to them. If they did one could imagine <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair, Senator Little</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kane</inline> coming into this chamber and boasting about the great groundswell of feeling fir certain issues instanced by demonstrations and perhaps even strikes by unions that were affiliated to them. One can imagine them boasting about some demonstration by one of their unions against the recognition of China; for the continuation of the Vietnam war; or in favour of the Springbok tour or if we believe the sentiments of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair,</inline> in favour of apartheid itself. One can also imagine them boasting about demonstrations in favour of more or harsher censorship or against the visits of the Russian ballet, a Chinese ping-pong team or perhaps even in favour of the Greek colonels regime. But, of course, they cannot boast about these things because, except for a. tiny few unions affiliated to them, they do not have unions. They do not have any causes with which to fire the enthusiasm that makes people demonstrate. </para>

          <para>What are they suggesting? They are suggesting that the democratic process is exhausted by electors going to the polls every 3 years and then lapsing into inactivity until they get the opportunity to go again. In the meantime, presumably, they are to resile from all political action. I suggest to the supporters of this motion that life is not like that and only a negative reactionary party would have us believe that it is or that it should be. </para>

          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>The developing practice of using industrial trade union organisations to effect purposes of a political character thus usurping the functions of government. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The debate has been quite interesting because we have had the opportunity of listening to two sides of considered opinion in this chamber. Government speakers have sided with the comments made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kane.</inline> They have said that they see some danger, and some disadvantage to the Australian community, arising from political strikes. On the other hand, a series of Opposition senators - not all Opposition senators - have rushed forward to place their names on the list of speakers. Generally, I would suggest, a group of senators within the Australian Labor Party, except perhaps for one, would be considered to be of the left wing of that Party.  1  hope they will reflect on the comments that they made this evening. If they ever seriously hope to take the reins of office in this federal Parliament, as they so aptly proclaim across the chamber every day or so, they will have put to them the points that they have argued for this evening, namely, that unions should have the right to take political action and so force a government into taking actions which the elected majority of individuals would not desire. </para>
          <para>This view was expressed by the last  speaker.  I think his comments, naive as they are in questioning what may be considered political strikes as against those which are seeking some industrial benefit for members of a union, illustrate the very simplicity of his colleagues who have spoken. There is no doubt about what the Senate is debating and that many of us are concerned about strikes in the community. I refer to the great incidence of strikes that are being generated in the community. I wonder whether members of the Opposition are as concerned as the Government is about the great harm that is being done in our community. I refer to the comments made by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden)</inline> in his Budget Speech when he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In the last 3 y,ears the annual loss of working days has been 1.1m, 2m and 2.4m. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">This is very serious for our community and I imagine that responsible members of the Opposition feel likewise. As I see the position, strikes generally not only have an effect on commercial enterprises, thus creating what we see today as an inflationary trend - a trend which I attribute greatly to the general labour situation and the incidence of strikes - but also cause a loss of wages to individuals. . </para>
          <para>If one were to calculate the value of the millions of days lost through strikes surely the result would be of concern to those members of the Opposition. But not one of them has come forward and said that this is a matter which should in some way be suppressed. I believe that there should be a right to. strike but the benefit that a strike is likely to bring should be carefully considered and calculated. In the political area we find unions have held strikes relating to the moratorium, the merino ram exports ban, the results of civil and criminal actions, the exclusion of brothers from </para>
          <para class="block">Parliament, anti-war meetings, law and order, pensions, compulsory unionism and the Springbok tour. As is well known, the threatened strikes are perhaps&#39; the greatest problem that we face. I refer to the power of one man, not necessarily with the support of the individual members of a union, who say: &#39;We will force this business enterprise of that commercial undertaking to take steps to force employees to join  a  union*. These are the matters which  1  believe the Government and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kane</inline> see as objectionable in our society and objectionable they certainly are. </para>
          <para>It would be most interesting to take each point, debate it at length and discuss what are the very serious implications that they have in our community. I suggest that some of the actions which have occurred within the last 2 years are no more than potentially criminal in our society.  1  believe the actions of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> in many instances and the power that an individual in his position can take over the whole community, or sections of the community, can wreak havoc within this society. If, indeed, in another country &#39; an individual had power to demand that employees of a business join an industrial organisation and pay dues to it so that he could act in a political way, many of us would regard it as one of the worst things that could happen in that community. I do not exaggerate the situation when I suggest that it is a Mafia-like action. I realise the significance of that comment, but I do not doubt that that will be the position in years to come if this situation is allowed to continue. </para>
          <para>The position is that there has not been one comment by any member of the Opposition, no matter from which unions they may claim to come and no matter which sections of the working class they may suggest they support, against he actions of lying down in the street or prohibiting other individuals from going about their duties. </para>

              <para>- Inane comments.  I  am attempting to put to the Senate the fact that wc do not hear from the once wonderful Labor Party a proposition in support of even some of those leaders of unions who have opposed this deprivation of the freedom of the individual which occurs by forcing strikes. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline>is very vocal in his references to human rights and what should be permitted. But he does not stop in one instance to take apart and look into  the situation of how some of these strikes have denied the very right of the individual to go about his business as# he would wish.  His  comments in this regard will go down as perhaps the worst of any leader of the Labor Party, a party which should be reflective of the views of the whole of the union movement - indeed, of the whole of the labouring force in this community.  His  views were completely one-sided and towards those of the left wing. </para>

              <para>- We get an instant reaction. The amazing fact is that if there is a big union which is led by the Democratic Labor Party the members of the Australian Labor Party in this chamber want to disown it; but if it is a union led by Communist Party officials it seems to be greatly beloved by them and not only is it accepted but its policies are slavishly supported. I can understand the disappointment that a big union should be led by members of the Democratic Labor Party. But I cannot understand why members of the Australian Labor Party do not exhibit exactly the same disappointment when they realise that a great many of the most powerful unions which were once led by Labor men are now led by members of the Communist Party. They show no concern at all. That may be one of the fundamental reasons why we are discussing the proposition that we are discussing here tonight. lt is a very clear cut proposition, namely, the misuse of the tremendous economic power that has developed in the great trade union movement of this country for purposes that are not industrial. If members of the community, trade unionist and others are prepared to continue to permit the development of this trend, then the day must come, of course, when there will be retaliation, when others in the community must have the same right to break the laws and to try to force the hand of Parliament in order to have their wishes imposed upon the community as a whole. We can see the day coming perhaps when employer organisations or other organisations will promote lockouts because the Russian Circus is coming to Australia or because some friends of the Labor Party are coming to Australia from some other country. </para>

          <para>If a person uses the argument here to justify the strike of industrial power for some cause in which somebody believes then he must of course, if he is a democrat, support the right of others to do exactly the same thing for a cause which is near and dear to his heart. But, no, one has to be right in one&#39;s causes. A person has to bc sure that he is right. He has to be as sure as Hitler was that only he has the right to misuse the power that is tied up in the organised strength of the trade union movement and in the organised strength of other sections of the community - religious if you like, friendly society if you like, employer organisations if you like. Trade unionists do not believe that they have special rights. It is a new trend in trade unionism for a trade union official to feel that he is superior to the law, that he can use violence in the streets and defy the normal processes of law in this country, that he can call on industrial stoppages to impoverish the economy of the nation and the workers in particular. They are the ones who suffer most and they have no say. </para>
          <para>In spite of the airy-fairy nonsense talked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> let us face how the trade union movement today really functions. I am not one of those people who object to paying political levies. I pay them. I pay money to the Australian Labor Party because I am a member of a trade union organisation that has made a decision to pay money to the Australian Labor Party. Because it was a majority decision of my colleagues in my union I make no protest that part of my subscription to the union goes to the Australian Labor Party. That is a decision of the union. Although it is being used for a political purpose, that is not using the power that we are talking about here tonight, namely, the power to order the workers out on strike over the issue of the Springbok rugby tour. Who are the people standing around the ground cheering the players on? Were they all bosses? We should use our common sense. They were trade unionists who wanted to ge there and watch the football. </para>
          <para>I smiled at the purity of the Labor Party here tonight on &#39; this - matter of racial discrimination. It is going to show the world that this country is pure on racial discrimination. It is going to stop work. It is going to show the sincerity of the Labor movement and the trade union movement 1 have in front of me the headlines of the newspapers of 21st June 1971. That is. not so very long ago, is it? The headline reads: </para>

          <para class="block">The new purists who have suddenly discovered on 21st June 1971 that apartheid is wrong are calling on the industrial organisations of this country to strike because a football team dares to come from a country that supports the same apartheid policy as they were supporting up to 21 st lune. If the trade union officials who support this sort of thing are foolish enough to do so, if the Labor Party senators here who support this sort of thing are foolish enough to do so, do not tell me that the trade unionists who work in the boot factories where I worked and in the transport jobs where <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kane</inline> worked, the clerical workers with whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gair</inline> once worked, and the school teachers with whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McManus</inline> once worked are as silly as those people who believe that this sort of purity is going to clean their slate. When I was in the Labor Party- I moved for the abandonment of the White Australia policy at Labor Party conferences . in Victoria. I could get a seconder, or I would second his proposal; I am referring to Albert Monk. We could not get anyone- else to even support the proposal. Today the members of the Australian Labor Party want to go out as the great purists on a question in relation to which our own house is not entirely in order. Whatever may be our individual ideas on this question, if anybody can lay claim to being a purist over the last quarter of a century at least I can. </para>

              <para>- My views are such that there are in this country today at least 5 young Chinese families who regard me as their Australian parent, and 1 am proud of the fact. My record on this question - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> can put his record alongside mine if he wants to - has been that of a purist for 25 years. If the honourable senator&#39;s record is as good he should look around amongst his colleagues to see whether they can equal it. If his record is as good as mine I will be pleased to know that I have a fellow Australian who is broad on this question, because it is a question dear to my heart and in relation to which we should all be broad. </para>

          <para>But whatever may be our point of view on this matter, the question before the Senate is whether there should be industrial action to force the Government, the rest of the community or anybody else who may not agree with us on this matter. Is this a matter to be decided in the factories, in the workshops, in the trade unions, on the streets, at the football matches or at the cricket, or is Australian policy to be decided by the elected members of Parliament? If we disagree with those policies are they to be resisted? Nobody is suggesting this. It was not suggested by the mover of the proposition that the rights of the trade union movement be interfered with, except in the misuse of power. </para>
          <para>I would like to read some extracts from a document which gets very close to the heart of this question. It begins in this way: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Australia must not become an imperialist armed camp like Palestine. If Australia&#39;s policy was one of peace, of friendship with all peaceful nations, of loyalty to the United Nations Charter, we would have disarmament, lower taxes, higher living standards. Workers and farmers of the dry north must fight for peace. They must demand that the rocket range be scrapped and that the extension of the pipeline must be made to their own towns for their own peaceful needs. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Do honourable senators agree with that? I hear no voices. They are suddenly lost in a sea of uncertainty. I will let the mystery out of the bag. I know that everybody mistakenly thought that that quotation was Labor policy, because that is Labor policy today. But that is a quotation by the late H. V. Evatt from a Communist Party publication.

But he is right when he says that it was never enforced, it never had to be enforced because the terms brought down by a Labor Government conscious of its responsibility to this nation were so severe that nobody dared to whisper about a black ban on the rocket range. It never had to be enforced because the penalty was a fine of over $1,000 or 6 months to 12 months gaol or both, depending on the circumstances under which one was indicted. So the problem was cured. </para>

          <para>I come now to the excellent contribution to the debate by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> He enumerated all the industrial political mistakes that have been made over the last couple of years. He told us about the Springboks. He told us about the trade union official who was charged with violence, and he told us about many other things. But with all due respect, let me say this to the Minister and to his Government. These things have all happened. The workers of this country have been denied their fundamental right to work on those days. The economy of the nation has been torn asunder. What has the Government done about it? That also is implied in the proposition that the DLP has brought before the Senate. It is all right for the Government to outline its position, but it was challenged to do something about the situation and has not. That is why the DLP has been forced to offer its advice to the Government and tell it what a Labor Government did when it was challenged in a similar manner. That we are opposed by Labor senators on a matter such as this is beyond my understanding. </para>
          <para>We are speaking here tonight for the people who are being hurt the most. I refer to the working people of this country who are harmed when they are ordered to stop work. They mutter and murmur, but out of loyalty to their industrial organisations they comply. They are terrified that cries of &#39;scabbery&#39; would be hurled at them if they did what they want to do - go to work in order to provide for their families the standard of living they desire. It is in order to help and protect those people that we have raised this question. Those people suffer again as economic circumstances in this country force inflation to spiral upwards still further. Is it common sense for the industrial movement of this country to say in respect of social service legislation that its members will strike for a day? Even the pensioner organisations pleaded with them not to do it because pensioners on fixed incomes understand the effect of a one-day stoppage on the price spiral. They understand that they are the ones who pay for the luxury of trade union officials&#39; exhibiting their tremendous industrial strength in the positions they hold. They are able to order a stoppage of work throughout this country for a day as part of a political demonstration. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill,</inline> who is interjecting, is too well versed in trade union affairs to claim that the unionists are willingly stopping work for such purposes. </para>

              <para>- My colleague the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden)</inline> has referred in his Budget Speech to new postal and telephone charges which are to be introduced during the financial year 1971-72. The legislation relating to these will be introduced during this session. For the benefit of honourable senators the proposed adjustments are set out in some detail in the schedules now available to them. The increases in the charges for telecommunications and postal services are proposed to be effective in the main from 1st October 1971. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>As recorded in the White Paper on Post Office Prospects and Capital Programme 1971-72 at the beginning of the financial year 1970-71 the overall Post Office trading profit was estimated at $30m; by the end of the year this had changed to a trading loss of $2m with a loss on postal operations of $25m and a profit on telecommunications operations of $23m. The long-term forecast for the financial year 1971-72 was a modest profit. Without an adjustment in charges the current forecast is a loss of $36m - $35m in postal and $lm in the telecommunications side. The deterioration in the financial position is due largely to new wage awards. During 1970- 71 some 50 new awards affecting Post Office staff were granted and these will add $77m to Post Office expenditure in 1971-72, compared with a 5 year average increase of $40m. </para>
          <para>In addition, arbitration awards to industry generally have had an effect on prices of materials and services used by the Post Office and increased prices will add about a further $10m to expenditure during 1971- 72. In the face of the abnormal increase in labour and other costs which must be met in 1971-72, the continued demand for services and the excessive pressure this places on available resources, and the serious deterioration in financial prospects for the future, the Government has decided to increase certain charges for postal and telecommunication services. The proposals which I will later present to the Senate are expected to provide $50m. in 1971-72 and $90m in a full year. The estimated overall trading position for 1971-72 will then be $36m profit with a $53m profit in telecommunications and a $17m loss in postal. </para>

        <type>miscellaneous</type>
      </debateinfo>
      <para class="block">When introducing a Bill to the House at this time last year proposing certain increases in telephone charges, I mentioned that the rental structure that was then in force did not nearly cover the recurring annual expenses borne by the Post Office in relation to the facilities provided. Accordingly, each of the three rental categories was increased, as well as the service connection fee and the rental for some other miscellaneous telecommunications facilities. The new charges were based on the economic situation of the Post Office at the time. </para>
      <para>However, since the new tariff structure came into operation on 1st October 1970. the very substantial salary increases awarded throughout have added to Post Office operating costs and dramatically altered the 1971-72 financial results forecast last year. As a consequence, there is no alternative other than to make further adjustments to the telephone tariff structure and it is now proposed that the present rental charges in each of three classes be further increased. The present annual rentals for a basic telephone service, depending on its location, is $47, $31 or $23. It is proposed that these charges be increased by $8, $6 and $4 respectively which will mean that subscribers in State capital cities, Canberra and Newcastle will pay $55 per annum for a basic telephone service, and those in provincial areas will pay either $37 or $27 per annum depending on the number of subscribers they can call for a local call fee and on whether they have continuous service or not. The one-third reduction in rentals which is given to blind persons and certain classes of pensioners will be maintained. </para>
      <para>It is proposed also to increase the service connection fee by $10, making the fee $50. Telephone call charges have not been increased since 1967, despite rising costs, and the Post Office, as a business undertaking, has no alternative but to increase these charges. It is proposed to increase local call charges from 4c to 4.75c with a corresponding increase in trunk charges. The fees for particular- person, reversed charge and fixed time calls are also to be increased. The Telex call fee of 5c per meter registration has not been altered since the automatic Telex system was introduced in 1966. It is proposed to increase this fee to 6c. Fixed fees for installing, altering or removing miscellaneous equipment (as distinct from the installation of a new or removal of an existing service to a new address) are to be increased. Present charges which have not been altered since 1964, do not cover costs. It is estimated that the variations will bring in additional revenue of $35m iri 1971-72 and $69m in 1972-73. </para>

      <para>With estimated postal losses of $25m in 1970-71 and $35m in 1971-72 at current tariffs, a general increase in rates is unavoidable if rising costs are to be recovered. It is expected that the increased charges will bring in $15m in 1971-72 and $21m in a full year and reduce the estimated postal loss to $17m in 1971-72. Although there was an increase in the basic postal rate last year the wage rates payable to postal staff have been increased since then by an average of 16 per cent. These have had a particularly adverse affect on the postal services because some 70 per cent of its costs are associated with labour. In the last 3 years postal wage rates have risen by about 40 per cent. </para>

      <para>The existing general rate for registered Australian books, newspapers and periodicals of 6c for the first 6 ounces and 5c for each additional 6 ounces will become 7c for the first 6 ounces and 6c for each additional 6 ounces. These concession rates represent, in effect, a substantial subsidy to the publishing and printing industry and to many organisations, ranging from religious, charitable and welfare organisations to social and recreational clubs. It is debatable whether this subsidy is an appropriate charge on the Post Office&#39;s finances. It is necessary, therefore, to continue the action taken in recent years, to reduce the extent of the postal loss from this concession. </para>
      <para>The rate for Category &#39;A&#39; publications will be increased to 7c for each 12 ounces on the total weight of the consignment, subject to a minimum per article charge of He This means that most country newspapers and periodicals, and the publications of religious, charitable and welfare organisations, and of educational, scientific, technical and agricultural bodies have the dissemination of knowledge as their principal object, will still be paying only He postage per article compared with 7c at normal printed matter rates. Each item must be handled a number of times between posting and delivery. </para>
      <para>Registered newspapers and periodicals in Category B, including those published by professional, business, union, commercial, social, recreational and motoring organisations, will pay the following rates: </para>
      <para>For delivery from the office of posting: 2c first 2 ounces.  ic each additional ounce. </para>
      <para>For delivery elsewhere: <inline font-style="italic">2ic</inline> first 2 ounces. lc each additional ounce up to 8 ounces. ic each additional ounce thereafter. </para>
      <para class="block">The registered publications will still enjoy a substantial concession. </para>
      <para>These increases on bulk postings of Category A and Category B publications will operate from 1st March 1972 to give publishers and organisations time to adjust subscription rates. Category A publications will continue to be registered, at least for the time being. However, because of the need to contain increases in the loss from this concession area no further registrations in Category B will be allowed after 31st December 1971. Existing Category B publications will retain their registration as long as they comply with the eligibility conditions. </para>
      <para>A new Category Cat economic postage rates and requiring compliance with conditions to reduce postal costs, will be introduced. Controlled circulation publications, sent on request by publishers to defined customer groups, and not previously eligible for registration will be eligible for the new Category C. These publications, mainly heavy business magazines, are at a great disadvantage compared with comparable registered publications. In addition, newspapers and periodicals which would otherwise have been eligible for Category B will, after 31st December 1971, be eligible for registration in the new Category C. Conditions for page inscriptions, format, and supplementary material in respect of registered newspapers and periodicals will be varied bo meet more satisfactorily present day needs of publishers. </para>

      <para>Adjustments are being made to the postage rates for letters, other articles and registered books posted under the bulk pre-sorted mail service. Many customers are taking advantage of these lower rates and the Post Office is benefiting from the economies of higher mail volumes and compliance with mandatory presort ing and other conditions. Rates for heavier weights have been converted to a 2 ounce basis. In the Householder Service a reduction of up to 25 per cent for postings over 100,000 is proposed in order to meet competition from private delivery contractors and retain existing business. This service will continue to pay its way because no sorting is required, the articles being addressed simply to &#39;The Householder&#39; and delivery is spread over se veal days. </para>

      </debateinfo>
      <para class="block">The rates for parcels will be increased, averaging 10 per cent for domestic and 20 per cent for overseas. The fees for many labour intensive special services, which fail to cover costs by a big margin, such as registered post, certified mail, and messenger delivery services will also be increased. However, the maximum compensation payable on registered mail will be increased to $150 and compensation of up to $20 for loss or damage in respect of certified mail will be introduced. Regarding overseas mail, airmail letter rates will be increased by 5c per half ounce, 2c per half ounce in the case of New Zealand, and aero grammes by 2c, because of cost increases in the handling component and the need to  cover processing costs on incoming mail which is nearly twice the outgoing volume, despite a 25 per cent reduction in conveyance rates. </para>
      <para>British Commonwealth preference rates for overseas surface letters will be abolished; few Commonwealth countries have this now and Canada has just eliminated it. As far as the general public is concerned, this will have relatively little effect as their most common form of surface communication overseas is greeting cards which may be sent at the 7c printed papers rate proposed. A new rate category for all registered newspapers and periodicals, posted in bulk to overseas will also be introduced, the charge being the same as for Category C in the domestic service. Other changes include a sliding scale of fees relating to volume, for business reply items, and an allowance of lc in the postage on grouped articles. I will elaborate further on the reasons for the increases when introducing the proposed legislation later in the session. </para>
      <para>I now turn to the new fees for broadcasting and television licences. These were referred to by the Treasurer in his Budget Speech. There will be no increase in the pensioner rate in either broadcasting or television licences fees. As to other areas, the broadcast listeners, hirers and lodging house licence fee for zone 1 will be increased from $6.50 to $8.00, and zone 2 from $3.30 to $4.25. The television viewers licence fee will increase from $14 to $19 and the combined receiving licence, to cover both broadcasting and television, will increase from $20 to $26.50, and a new combined lodging house licence will be included with a fee at $26.50. All the proposed adjustments are detailed in tables, copies of which are available to honourable senators. With the concurrence of honourable senators, I incorporate those tables in Hansard. </para>

          </motion>
          <para class="block">I suggest that the  2  propositions embodied in this motion are undeniable. If you accept that the Government is unstable and subservient to outside influence, then you must come to the conclusion that that ds injurious to our nation. The parliamentary system under which we operate is known as the Westminster system as distinct from that practised in the United States of America and some of the newly emerging countries. Our system provides for the appointment of Ministers by the Prime Minister, under the Liberal Government. In addition, he allocates the portfolios. The job of the Minister is to present policy and provide drive to his department. It is not the job of the department to make policy. The department has to follow the lead and drive of the Minister and provide such things as the technical knowhow, the routine, the expertise and the continuity for which our country has become very famous. A Minister is something more than a politician and something more than a parliamentarian. He has to become an administrator. Statesmanship has the opportunity to blossom, provided there is fertile soil, in persons elevated to these positions. It is essential that they rise above the pettiness and personalities which unfortunately are found in the lower echelons of politics. </para>
          <para>When one sees the situation today - the tremendously unfavourable publicity that the Government has been getting, not only in Australia but overseas - one wonders where all this started. If we examine the situation, this started with the deterioration of the Liberal Party. It started at the time of the unfortunate disappearance of the late Harold Holt. The Liberal Party was put in the unenviable and sad position of having lost its leader and of having to elect another leader overnight. If at that stage the Party had taken a statesmanlike view and examined very carefully not from a point of view of personalities and not from a point of view of some kind of imaginary charisma that would enable it to be able better to do battle with the Labor Party or to enable it to gain or to maintain government, but from the point ot view of looking at the statesmanlike qualities and experience of the people who were offering themselves as candidates, a lot of the mistakes that have followed would not have taken place. Possibly all the mistakes that followed would not have taken place. Everybody in this building absorbs the atmosphere and the atmosphere always seems to leak out from this building to the Press. The whole of the atmosphere was one of personalities and of a clash between one man and the senior member of the other Party in the coalition. I refer to the Country Party. The senior member of that Party intervened. That is the type of approach to which I refer. I believe that if we examine this situation - and all of us should examine it because it is one which should not continue if the influence is not to continue and do injury to the nation to which all of us owe so much allegiance - we will find that there is no doubt that the wrong approach was taken at that stage. </para>
          <para>Since then there has been a playing of politics. The Government has forgotten the job of governing. Party factions, petty factions and personalities have crept in. Appointments have been made not on sheer ability and not on administrative ability but on whether this man would advance the cause of that faction, whether he was a friend of the person making the appointment or whether his appointment would please some outside body, Possibly appointments were made in gratitude of favours done in the past. Appointments were governed not by the ability or the statesmanlike qualities of the candidates but by all the things which I have mentioned. This should never have been allowed to move into the top echelon of government. Obviously the moving of Ministers from one portfolio to another - not because they had expertise in a particular folio but because the change might get them out of the country or because it might move them away from certain discussions which might take place - culminated in excluding senior Ministers from meetings at which they had every right to be present. A government cannot operate under that kind of system. It is bad administration, and the business of government is administration. </para>
          <para>Politics is just the tip of government. If one had been watching the events of the past 2 or 3 years one would have thought that politics was the whole iceberg and not one-eighth of it. There is a vast civil service in the other seven-eighths of the iceberg. It is waiting for a lead. The frequent changes cannot do anything but confuse the civil service. The job of Ministers is to lead and to control a department, not to be controlled by it or to confuse it. The vast Public Service has a set of politics of its own. These politics will feed on weak Ministers, on quick changes of Ministers and on Ministers who are inexperienced and who start to lean too much on their departments. There is an art and a skill in the relationship between both sides - between the permanent head of the particular section of the Public Service which a Minister is governing and the Minister. It is when those 2 are welded and fused that we get good administration and progress in the community. </para>
          <para>When one looks at the changes - and let me be fair and say immediately that there must be changes, that people must grow old, that people must want to retire and that from time to time junior Ministers must be moved up to senior portfolios; all this is accepted and ail this has taken place - one sees the effect of the changes. I start by mentioning what I might term the junior portfolios, with no offence to those Ministers. At least one change in the last year has taken place in the Ministries of Housing, Navy, Interior, Trade and Industry, Primary Industry, Shipping and Transport, Supply, Immigration, Labour and </para>
          <para class="block">National Service, Treasury, Aboriginal Affairs and Tourist Activities. This is not a new government. This is not a government that is finding its feet. This is a government which, I think I am right in saying, has had a record term of continuous government in Australia. It did not have teething troubles. This would not be normal in a government with such experience. I suggest that the changes were made because of the reasons that I have mentioned already. </para>
          <para>The effect of the changes is more important in the sensitive portfolios - those which have a very great bearing not only on internal policies but also on external policies. It seems that the changes are taking place when great pressures are being exerted from overseas both in trade and in the political side of government. These changes have taken place because of political and personal manoeuvres. Some of the senior portfolios have been used as administrative Siberias. I ask this question: Do honourable senators opposite or does anybody listening tonight believe that the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McMahon</inline> as Minister for Foreign Affairs, the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bury</inline> as Minister for Foreign Affairs and the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gorton</inline> as Minister for Defence were for administrative reasons, or were the appointments made for personal reasons? </para>
          <para>One of the greatest problems that have faced governments and nations over the years is the question of Vietnam. It is possibly the most divisive issue that has hit not only Australia but the world. The situation is dangerous and exasperating, lt is going through tremendous changes and tremendous pressures are being exerted. During this time we have had 3 Ministers for Defence who have had a tremendous responsibility not only in this sensitive area but also in co-operating with the Minister for Foreign Affairs in dealing with other nations that are involved also. We have had 3 Ministers for Foreign Affairs in 6 months. This is at a time when the United States of America is making very radical moves in Asia. Do not underrate the situation in Pakistan and India. It could produce a world war if something is not done particularly quickly. Our nearest neighbour, Indonesia, is getting over 25 years of a lost weekend and is making valiant strides to rehabilitate itself from all the traumas or the problems which it has. We have a vested interest in assisting that nation, knowing that we have to live with it for as long as the world spins. The withdrawal of the United States and Great Britain from the area is in turn causing the Asian nations to look even more to the continent of Australia for assistance. Meetings of the Asian and Pacific Council and the South East Asia Treaty Organisation are continuing. Those organisations are under some pressures and some criticism. Yet in 6 months we have had 3 Ministers for Foreign Affairs. </para>
          <para>We should dwell for a moment on the situation with other Foreign Ministers, particularly Asian Foreign Ministers, who are trying to establish a rapport and unofficial meetings which are so important. They are important because of the state of flux in the area at the moment. Throughout the whole of Asia today - and when I speak of Asia I include Australia and New Zealand - there is no problem in the political field that is not related in some way to the Chinese problem. There is no problem in the economic field which is not related in some way to the Japanese problem. Japan is on the verge of making another great leap forward. When it does get under way with the huge amount of capital that it is going to export it will have a tremendous influence not only on the Asian countries but also on Australia and New Zealand. The whole of our mineral development will be affected by it because it must be realised that Japan today is no longer a cheap manufacturing country. It can manufacture just as cheaply in Australia. It can manufacture much more cheaply in the Asian countries, and the Japanese are very anxious at the moment to export their pollution. They really mean pollution and not just a word we talk about from day to day. Although it only came about in the last few days it has been mooted for at least 12 months that there would be a de facto devaluation of the American dollar and this could very well be one of the most frightening things that could happen to the world and to this area because it is aimed directly at Japan. It is aimed deliberately at Japan to make Japanese exports on to the American market more expensive. Because these manufactured goods of iron and of textiles are based on the original ingredients that come from Australia - the iron, the steel and the wool come from Australia - it follows almost automatically that if Japan is unable to export and sell its manufactured goods, that will affect Australia which is supplying it. </para>
          <para>The relationship with Ministers and the continuity of policy is so essential in this area because the emerging countries above all want to be able to look ahead for at least the 5-year plans which most of them are moving towards, and many want to look beyond that. While Australia is doing that the Government is changing Foreign Ministers at the rate of one every 2 months. In the field of health, which is be devil ling the Government, unless the Government can get on top of it and give to the Australian people the health programme they want, the question of the quality of life becomes a mere empty expression. The new Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson)</inline> has inherited this portfolio and he has inherited also, as I pointed out to him today, 72 questions on the notice paper - more than any other Minister has to contend with. This shows some of the problems and the interest of all members in both Houses of this Parliament. </para>
          <para>I do not think a day goes by when a senator does not ask a question on education. This is a great field about which the Australian people are worrying and talking. I do not know whether they have the answers. If they do have the answers, certainly we have not supplied them with what they need up to this time. Surely this is a portfolio which needs intense and continuous effort. It cannot be just picked up from day to day. Yet we have had 3 Ministers in half of this scholastic year. We have had 3 Attorneys-General this year even though law and order has been the gimmick that the Government has been trying to use from time to time over the last 2 years. We have been hearing all sorts of things about the inadequacies of our industrial relations. We hear them from both sides. We have both the trade union movement and the employers federations anxious to get together because they realise we cannot continue with the situation we have where we are automatically fining people $1,000 and defying every law that has been written. At a time when the whole of Australia wants to do something about it the Government is not settling down to deal with this very sensitive area. </para>
          <para>We also have inflation to which no answer has been found. We have a rural crisis which is getting worse every day. And while this goes one we have these petty jealousies and these petty squabbles becoming worse every hour of the day. There is no doubt, unfortunately, that politics in this Parliament where they should be at their zenith are now at their nadir. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gorton</inline> revealed in his articles that while he was Prime Minister the Cabinet was unworkable. It was so because of all the things he mentioned. I do not want to go into them because we have talked enough and have read enough about them. But there was the Prime Minister of the day saying that the Cabinet could not work. There is no doubt that the Government has taken its eyes off the business of government. All the weaknesses of men, the hate, the envy, the spite and the ambitions, have taken over from the jobs the Ministers were appointed to do. This is demonstrated by the leaks that have been coming from the Cabinet, particularly over the last few months. </para>
          <para>I do not pretend that leaks are not a part of government. They are a great way of conditioning the public and this Government uses that method always with a Budget. Always before a Budget it frightens the living daylights out of us with what it is going to do. The Budget is never as bad as it is expected to be. This one is bad enough but not as bad as we expected. It is a good trick. I have no qualms about letting the Government use it. This is what is called the controlled leak. But when there are leaks of this sort, whenever the Press is trying to get leaks of this sort from the Government or from the Public Service we will find a fair amount of inaccuracy. The point is that over the last few months these leaks have been completely accurate. The dismissal of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bury</inline> was headlined in the Press 2 days before it took place. This Budget shows the accuracy of the leaks. I know enough about politics to know that one side leaks out to the Press what it thinks the other faction does not like. I make no denial that I have lived in an atmosphere of this in a party other than the Liberal Party. Thank God it is getting over it. It was interesting when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr</inline></para>
          <para class="block">Bury was making a statement to the Press and he summed this up. He said that the place leaks like a sieve and this must break down trust. It was also interesting when he was asked why it developed and he said: &#39;I do not think it was cause and effect. It was a decline in standards, standards of honesty and decent behaviour.&#39; ls it any wonder that instability is inevitable in this situation? </para>
          <para>I turn to the second point mentioned in the Opposition&#39;s motion, that of the subservience of the Government to outside &#39; bodies. This is always an arguable case and because of that I will quote only from the defence and not from the attack. I quote from an article in the &#39;Daily Telegraph&#39; entitled &#39;The Telegraph and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gorton.</inline> Setting the record straight&#39;. The article said: </para>

          <para class="block">Under the system which is worked by the Liberal Party it is the complete right of the Prime Minister to make what portfolio adjustments he feels fit. Yet in defence of this proposition <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frank</inline> Packer made statements when he was obviously putting undue pressure on to the Government. Let us be quite clear about this matter. Everybody tries to put pressure on the Government. This is the right of citizens. Every day every honourable senator has somebody in his office. Ministers have people coming to see them. Departmental officers have people coming to see them. Before Budget time the Government has big business and all sorts of people putting pressure on it. Nothing is wrong with this in a democracy, provided that the decencies are not overstepped. The crunch comes when the government ceases to govern and starts to be dominated by those people. This is what I suggest the Australian people are taking exception to today. I think the limit is passed when a newspaper leader says that it is time that the Prime Minister pushed a senior Minister out - namely, the then  Deputy  Leader of the Liberal Party - and put him onto a back bench, The acme of good political manoeuvring is careful timing. The Prime Minister did not use that. He did it almost immediately. At least the decency of proper timing could have been observed. 1 repeat that a government must govern. It must not be pushed around by pressure groups however powerful those pressure groups might be. </para>
          <para>What would be the result if a man, interviewed on television, could say: &#39;This is what has to be done by the Government.&#39;? Where would it end? Why not get another big industrialist and threaten the Government with overt action if it does not do the very opposite? Of course this would show up the whole farce. If this kind of action took place it would show the rest of. the iceberg. I shall relate very briefly to honourable senators something which 1 know happened many years ago. 1 suggest that if the Prime Ministers of this year had done what Curtin did when he was Prime Minister there would have been a very different end to this situation. During the war, not long after Curtin became Prime Minister he was approached by a big newspaperman who congratulated him and said that everybody had to put his shoulder to the wheel. Curtin agreed with that proposition. He said: &#39;After a few minutes I noticed creeping into the conversation phrases such as &#34;If you do this <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Prime</inline> Minister then we will do that&#34;. Curtin said: 1 want you to understand that you possess nothing which I desire. I want your help the same as I want everybody&#39;s help in the war effort. You have your job to do and I have mine, but I make it clear that you possess nothing which I desire.&#39; Does it not strike the weapon out of the hand of anybody who is threatening or anybody who is trying to cajole to be told that he possesses nothing that you want? </para>
          <para>It is getting towards the time for the normal adjournment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Kenneth</inline> Anderson ought to have a chance to talk about this matter on behalf of the Government, because it is of tremendous public interest. I think the Government should have an opportunity to state its case. In a debate such as this there is a tremendous temptation to harangue, to abuse and to take the temporary political advantage which obviously we could do. I have tried to refrain from doing this. I hope I have succeeded. If I were to do this it would be a shadow, because I would be doing the very thing of which I am accusing the Government. I suggest that it is quite unarguable that the situation which exists in the Liberal-Country Party coalition, supported by the Australian Democratic Labor Party and, to date, the 3 independent honourable senators, is injurious to our nation. </para>

            <para>(10.44)  -  This motion, which was put down by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Murphy)</inline> and to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> spoke on behalf of the Opposition, is the reflection of a motion which was put down on 17th August in another place by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> there. Some of the phraseology in this motion follows the phraseology of the motion which was put down by the Leader of the Opposition in the other place. I think that is about where it ended. Quite obviously the Australian Labor Party held a Caucus meeting and decided that the motion would be put down in both places. I say this in fairness to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee,</inline> who has led for the Opposition in this chamber. That is about where the similarity ended, because whatever I am going to say about what happened in the other place 1 go on record here as saying that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> has argued his case - though I do not agree with it - with dignity and respect for the parliamentary system. He has not employed the unfortunate element of personalities which permeated the case which was put by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> in the other place. Of course inevitably we are in a situation where the main game is played early and the reserve game is played at the time when the main game is normally played. In other words we are having this motion in the after effects of the clash which happened in the other place when the motion was put down and a vote was taken. The vote was defeated without any variation in normal party affiliations. The great prospects of what was going to happen as a consequence of the great motion put down by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> proved to be completely misjudged, misguided and, in fact, completely inaccurate. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I am going to follow the pattern of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee,</inline> who is the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, and respond, I hope, in a dignified and proper way which I trust usually becomes me although sometimes I become a little anxious. But the fact is that we must look at the issue as it was put down by the recognised Leader of the Opposition. I read in this morning&#39;s Sydney Morning Herald&#39; a heading &#39;Political humbug&#39;. I am not suggesting that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> used this phraseology, but his leader did and Hansard is here for all to read. The article states: </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">And so on. In the event, that did not happen. In the event, it is being debated here. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> bases his argument on 2 heads. He says that these various changes have created a state of instability. Then he referred to various portfolios which changed and I think he referred to the portfolio of Minister for Health which I have assumed. He mentioned that 1 am confronted with 72 outstanding questions upon notice. If the resolving and the answering of those 72 outstanding questions were the limit of my problems I would be far more relieved because health - let us face it - is a most difficult and complex portfolio. But after all it is proper to say that I am a very senior Minister in the Cabinet. It is proper to say that I have been a Minister for <inline font-style="italic">7i</inline> years. It is proper to say that I have had a lifetime experience in some of the side issues of health at any rate, and if Health is a difficult portfolio - and all of us on both sides recognise it is - I think I have a responsibility as a senior Minister to accept the challenge and do what I believe to be right in the interests of government and the people of Australia. Since there was a reference to me and the Health portfolio all I say is that I am not unaware of the problems or the challenge which the acceptance of it will be both physically and mentally. But because I hold a senior position in the government and on the Executive, if I am to sit here I have to be prepared to accept that sort of situation. </para>
          <para>Equally this is true of the Foreign Affairs portfolio. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr N.</inline> H. Bowen, who is the Minister for Foreign Affairs, is a former Attorney-General and a member of the Cabinet. He has not had as long political experience as I have but it is equally true to say that he- has held responsible portfolios. He is a lawyer of great eminence. Before he entered politics he was probably one of the leading equity lawyers of the Commonwealth. With his experience he is admirably suited to assuming responsibility for the high office of Minister for Foreign Affairs. The same is to be said of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fairbairn,</inline> who is now the Minister for Defence and who has held the portfolios of Air, National Development and Education and Science. I do not think that it is arguable - and this is on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee&#39;s</inline> own say so - that our Government is based on ministerial responsibility backed up by a Public Service which has been trained, which is experienced and indeed which does not have any political affiliations - although there are some that try to make members of the Public Service have political affiliations. As  1  say, the Public Service is geared, trained, experienced and competent to give the service of government. </para>
          <para>I want to make the observation to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> that the Wets minster system to which he referred does provide that the right to make changes in the composition of his Cabinet is one of a Prime Minister&#39;s prerogatives. This has never been argued before. 1 am surprised that it is being argued now that the Prime Minister should not have that prerogative. I could go further. T could say that we on our side of politics do not attempt to tell the Australian Labor Party what it should do in its own domestic affairs. We sit on the side and say: &#39;If you make some changes it might be more advantageous to us politically&#39;. We might criticise them in that sense. But  Her  Majesty&#39;s Opposition has a responsibility just as the Government has and the affairs of the Labor Party should not be made the occasion, as they were yesterday in another place for an attempt to blackguard the character of people because a change has been made. I could easily embark upon a heated argument as to whether it was wise to make a comment about what happened to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Daly</inline> when he was removed from the shadow cabinet. I could reflect upon the position of the spokesman for the Australian Labor Party on immigration matters. I do not want to go into those things. </para>

          <para class="block">Let us take another one. I could talk of the man who was the shadow minister on primary industry matters. I could ask whether it was <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Patterson</inline> or someone else. But it does not matter, because that is not the way in which we debate such matters here. All I am saying is that ever since there has been a Parliament - and this would have begun in the mother of parliaments - the Prime Minister has had an inherent right to re-arrange his Cabinet. Equally, the Opposition has this right in respect of its own affairs; it has responsibilities in a democracy as we have. Since members of the Opposition constitute the official Opposition they have the right to move their various members from office to office as they see fit according to their own procedures and by their vote. </para>
          <para>I want to talk about only one other matter and I shall do so very quickly. I refer to the question of injurious influences. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> did not make a case in relation to that matter.  His  remarks were directed at one newspaper. I do not intend to bite the bullet on that. Suffice it is to say that I have cuttings, as he has, not only from the paper to which he has referred - and in passing this was the &#39;Daily Telegraph&#39; - but also from the Age&#39;, and from the leading article of the Herald&#39; of Wednesday, 11th August, which I think was the day before the changes were made. I have one from the Melbourne &#39;Age&#39; of 11th August and one from the &#39;West Australian&#39; dated 12th August. In fact, I think that the &#39;Daily Telegraph&#39; re quoted some of the other papers all of which, as they have the right to do, expressed views as to what they thought should be done. I thought that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee</inline> was perilously close to advocating that these papers should not be able to do that. Whilst a government, or an opposition too, does not necessarily let newspapers call the tune on what it is going to do the papers will still write about it. They still think they have the best political judges in the world; they still think they have the best economic writers in the world. They will always continue to write and the people like to read what has been written. But the final decision is a decision of a government; it is a decision of an executive. </para>
          <para>In the minute and a half which I have left I would say that it has been demonstrated by the vote in the other place yesterday that the Government has solidarity. AH its supporters voted with it against the motion that was proposed by the Opposition. They did so because they believe, and they know, that the Government has the capacity to give the people of Australia the form of government that they need and want. This Government has been able to give the people security. I was listening to the previous debate and heard some very stern words about national security and the industrial wing. I say that the people have confidence in this Government. The people believe that this Government is acting in the best interests of the whole nation. When the happy day comes and there is an election, the people will reaffirm what they have reaffirmed every time since 1949, namely, that our way of government in a democracy is a better way than the system advocated by the Opposition, and it will give stability to the people of Australia. </para>

            <para>- I will not detain the Senate for very long. I wish to raise a matter of urgency and in doing so I direct my remarks to the Minister representing the Minister-in-Charge of Tourist Activities. The matter relates to a company known as Aust Asian Cruises Ltd, which operated in my home town area of Townsville some months ago. To help the Minister, I am quite prepared to give him what documentation I have. I intend to quote a couple of cases but I shall not give the proper names of individuals lest they be disturbed in some way although I have been told that I may use the information given to me in any way that is necessary in an effort to recover money owed to them. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>This company probably started off on an honest basis but somewhere along the line it certainly went very much wide of its original intentions. Tens of thousands of dollars have been paid in deposits on cruises; in some cases full fares have been paid. 1 have one case which I propose to place before the Senate this evening. There is no chance today of the recovery of any of this money. </para>
          <para>The reason I raise this matter in this place is that I believe that tourism is one of the most important industries today. If there is not some law which protects people in these circumstances, there ought to be one. At some subsequent date some sort of legislation may be needed to bring this about. </para>
          <para>I also want to know whether it is within the powers of the Federal Minister to assist in the tracing of the people who have disappeared with the money owing to the large number of customers who in some instances have lost the whole of their life savings. The company, as I mentioned a moment ago, is Aust-Asian Cruises Ltd. The principals of the firm are: <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ian</inline> Calder Malcolm Little, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr S.</inline> Shirley, his brother <inline font-weight="bold">Mr L.</inline> Shirley, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr S.</inline> Soonjarotaai and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Albert</inline> Sidney Heaton. I understand that some of these people have left this country and are in Bangkok, Djakarta or some other foreign area. I believe that, in view of the fact that there is some responsibility on the Federal Government to encourage the development of tourism, equally there ought to be a responsibility on it to help people who are involved in circumstances such as these. </para>
          <para>The case that I quote is one of a gentleman who saved up all his life to go on a cruise. He was told that a deposit of $200 was required. The total fare was to be $2,400.50. Subsequently he paid the total amount of money. But some weeks ago he was told that the cruise had to be shortened considerably because the ship that was to take the tourists had a propeller that needed repairs. Originally the cruise was to take in Hong Kong. The company contacted this gentleman to see whether he was prepared to take the shorter tour. He assured the company that he was and wrote to it to that effect. The company then replied to him stating that $680 would be returned. He did not see his S680; nor did he hear anything more from the company. When he endeavoured to ring the firm he discovered that the telephone had been disconnected and that the birds had flown. </para>
          <para>The police have done a tremendous job in trying to trace the principals of the firm. They really have worked hard on it. Because of certain difficulties it is possible that the money that has been paid in by all these people will not be recovered. There are some people who are not prepared either to go to the police or to come to me with an official complaint saying that they have lost their deposit of $200. Although they feel rather sad about it, they probably do not want to be embarrassed by their neighbours finding out that they have been taken for a ride - which, of course, never eventuated. I suggest that one way in which this matter could be looked at is by the Federal Minister ascertaining whether there is any fund from which or any way at all by which these people can have all or part of their money returned, or whether there is any action which can be taken at the Federal level to endeavour to trace the principals of the firm if they have left this country and make them face up to their responsibilities. </para>
          <para>I do this solely with the long term thought that tourism, being one of the major industries of this country, must be encouraged, and if this is the sort of thing that is to happen there ought to be protection for people who, as I mentioned a moment ago, desire to spend $2,000, $3,000 or $4,000, which they have probably spent a lifetime in accumulating, on a decent overseas tour or maybe even  a  round the world tour. I leave the matter in the Minister&#39;s hands. </para>

            <para>-  I should like to have the material from which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> has quoted and anything else which he can let me have and which could help in this case.I will direct to the Minister-in-Charge of Tourist Activities <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howson)</inline> the honourable senator&#39;s remarks as reported in Hansard and any other material he has, together with the recommendations he has made. I can add little to this matter, except my own comments. To some extent, the work that I do is involved with the tourist area and very often 1 am concerned when I see advertisements encouraging people to subscribe to or to make application to join various clubs and to pay deposits when I know from my own experience that there are cases such as the honourable senator has mentioned. I have a lot of sympathy with the people who are so placed. I will do what I can to see that at least the matter is thoroughly taken up. It may well be that the Commonwealth has some problems here. It may well be that this is a State responsibility. But that does not necessarily mean that there is not something that can be done in an effort to help. I shall do as I have indicated. </para>
