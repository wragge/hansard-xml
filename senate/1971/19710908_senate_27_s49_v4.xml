            <para>- My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate.I refer to
              a recently published American book in which it was stated that Pine Gap was part of
              the American chain of communications directing America&#39;s nuclear weapons system.
              Will the Minister tell us whether this is correct? Does this mean that Pine Gap,
              perhaps Alice Springs or even Adelaide, will be early targets for nuclear attacks in
              the event of a major war? Does the Government agree that Australians, whose future may
              be jeopardised by these installations, deserve to be told frankly the true position?

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir KENNETH</inline>ANDERSONI can react to the
            question asked by the Leader of the Opposition only by saying that the joint defence
            research facility at Pine Gap is an agreed facility under the Australian, New Zealand
            and United States defence pact - ANZUS. Such research activity is secret. Since the
            original announcement by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Allen</inline> Fairhall on 11th
            December 1966 a number of references have been made to this matter in Parliament. I do
            not wish to react to speculation. The work of the facility is defensive in nature. No
            launching or firing operations are conducted at the site. </para>

            <para>- In the statement by the Minister for Civil Aviation on 31st August concerning
              extensions to the Perth Airport it was proposed that 1,700 acres of land on the
              eastern side of the airport should be acquired. Can the Minister name the final dale
              by which it is expected to acquire all this land? Are there some sections of the land

              be required in total for quite a long time. There are certain cases where the land
              will need to be acquired earlier than that date, but these are for reasons of personal
              hardship. They have been taken separately and investigated quite thoroughly with every
              intention of trying to help as much as possible. </para>

            <para>- I ask a question of the Minister representing the Minister for Education and
              Science. I refer to the Minister&#39;s statement, when the Senate was debating the
              States Grants (Science Laboratories) Bill on 19th May last, that a decision had been
              taken to adopt an expenditure of $2,200 per square on the construction of science
              laboratories. As this standard will, no doubt, be applied to laboratories in
              metropolitan areas where building costs are lowest, can the Minister inform the Senate
              what extra expenditure over the amount of $2,200 per square is to be allowed in areas
              outside metropolitan areas and in the more remote areas to compensate for the extra
              building costs, so that the same standards of construction will apply to science
              laboratories built anywhere in Australia? </para>

              $2,200 per square represented what the Department on experience considered was an
              average cost to allow for and to make reasonable science laboratories during the 4
              years programme. The Department realises that the costs of laboratories vary according
              to location. Location will always be taken into account. Honourable senators are
              assured that the Minister in deciding the variables in relation to the prima facie

            <para>- I ask a question of the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration. In
              view of the large number of university graduates who cannot find suitable employment
              in their home countries of Canada and the United States of America and in view of the
              possibility of this trend developing here, will the Minister ensure that the entry of
              graduates into Australia from North America and other countries will not bc to the
              detriment of Tasmanian and other Australian graduates who have yet to qualify? If
              necessary, will the Government control the entry of such people? </para>

            <para>- It is a fact that in the United States of America and in most advanced Western
              countries persons with general professional qualifications or with technical
              qualifications of some description are finding it difficult to obtain employment. No
              graduate is encouraged to come to Australia unless there is an unsatisfied demand in
              Australia which would be filled by the encouragement of graduates to come here.
              Obviously that is in the interests both of Australia and of the prospective
              immigrants. However, if a graduate is aware of the competitive situation in Australia
              and if he desires to come to Australia, it would seem improper to deny him entry to
              Australia because he is a university graduate. I cannot give the assurance for which
              the honourable senator asked, certainly not in the terms in which he sought it. The
              overall position is that, where people make inquiries before coming to Australia as to
              the likely prospects of employment, the Department of Immigration takes steps to
              inform them to the best of its ability as to what the situation is in this country.

              a book which deals in some form of allegory. However, if the assumptions which the

              redounds to the credit of the honourable senator or of the Senate that he should seek
              to give publicity to a scandal or a libel, as he suggested, when the author was not
              prepared to do that and thus expose himself to the ordinary civil remedies in the

            <para>- My understanding is that Qantas has no plans of any kind to dispose of any
              Boeing 707s at present because it has acquired Boeing 747s. I believe that Qantas will
              use the Boeing 747s in regular airline operations and where appropriate on charter and
              package tours. I also believe that Qantas is likely to use its Boeing 707s
              increasingly in charter operations. </para>

              the Parliament. I have in mind particularly young people and members of school parties

            <para>- 1 have seen the report to which the honourable senator refers; but in reading it
              I noted that it said that the information was not official and it alleged that the
              information had come via North Atlantic Treaty Organisation intelligence. As far as 1
              know, there is no official Russian confirmation that such an aircraft does exist.
              However, the Air Force authorities in Australia do know that the Russians already have
              2 types of swing-wing aircraft in existence. This one would make a third. I might also
              point out that an aircraft which was referred to in the Senate last session - the
              multi-role combat aircraft being produced by Pan a via in Europe - is also a swing-wing
              type of aircraft. So we can now see the swing-wing concept developing throughout the
              world in the supersonic bomber system. Quite obviously, this supports the choice of
              the Fill made by Australia in years gone by. On my recent visit to France to see the
              air display there, I saw nothing flying at that display which T believe could compare
              with the Fill. </para>

              teachers who were committed for trial yesterday by a magistrate at Newcastle. New
              South Wales, on a charge of conspiring to defraud a stock broking firm by placing
              orders with that firm to sell 4.000 shares in Jasmine and 4.000 shares in Westralian
              Nickel which, it is alleged, they did not in fact own at the time but which they hoped
              to buy, subsequent to the sale, on a falling market in order that they might complete
              the transaction and thereby make a profit? Does the Minister see any real difference

              others in the short selling operations in connection with shares in Antimony Nickel,

            <para>- Yes, I am. I have some information which I obtained after the recent incident in
              Sydney so that if somebody was interested in asking me a question I could give it to
              him. In Australia, and indeed throughout the world, civil parachuting is regarded as a
              sport and, I might say, a sport with a potential for danger if not properly conducted.
              Those people who engage in it should realise this. For this reason the Department of
              Civil Aviation developed rules, but it looks to the parachuting organisations to apply
              those rules in practice. Because it is regarded as a sport, many countries do not
              exercise any control whatsoever over parachuting. The Department of Civil Aviation in
              Australia does lay down basic safety requirements on parachuting, and those rules are
              among the most comprehensive of any in the world. They cover such factors as medical
              standards, age, experience requirements, training under supervision, the type of
              equipment that should be used, the packing of parachutes, their repair and other
              similar items. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>These requirements must be observed by all those individuals and clubs engaged in
            the sport; otherwise they are liable to prosecution. The Department does not go out into
            the field and exercise detailed supervision of parachute jumping. However, whenever a
            serious accident occurs it is investigated by the Department. Whenever the Department
            finds that parachuting is not being carried out within the safety rules it takes
            corrective action through the appropriate organisations. The Department&#39;s
            parachuting requirements are designed to avoid death and injury, but the potential
            hazards of this sport should be understood quite clearly, particularly by those who
            choose to take it up. This particular parachute drop was approved by the Department
            subject to compliance with an air navigation order and the Australian Parachute
            Federation Regulations. The Department&#39;s New South Wales air safety investigation
            branch is conducting an inquiry. I do not want to take up the time of the Senate and my
            colleagues on this matter, but I do have a rather detailed accident report which came to
            me within a little while of the accident. I can show this report to the honourable
            senator to give him more information which I think might interest him. </para>

                has been asked, lt is true, as the honourable senator now indicates, that the
                National Fitness Act was brought in in 1941. Therefore his comment that it was a
                wartime measure is valid. The Commonwealth Council for National Fitness has been
                established, it being composed of 9 members appointed by the Governor-General. The
                Council advises the Minister for Health with respect to the promotion of national
                fitness and, in particular, in relation to, firstly, measures to be adopted to
                develop an appreciation of the need for physical fitness; secondly, the provision of
                facilities for instruction in the principles of physical education; thirdly, the
                organisation of movements and the provision of. facilities for attaining or
                maintaining personal physical fitness; and fourthly, the training of teachers and
                classes and of leaders of movements or groups formed for the purpose of promoting
                physical fitness. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </interjection>
          <para>The amount of money included in the estimates this year for national fitness is
            $418,000. That allocation will be dealt with in the Budget context. This amount is made
            up of $350,000 as an operational grant and $68,000 for capital assistance, which is made
            available on a matching basis with State governments, the contribution being $1 by the
            Commonwealth for each $2 by the States. The National Fitness Act authorises the Minister
            to use this money for the purpose of providing assistance, firstly, to encourage the
            development of national fitness in each State under the direction of a national fitness
            council appointed by the government of each State; secondly, to promote physical
            education in schools, universities and other instrumentalities; and thirdly, for such
            other purposes as are consistent with the Act as the Minister determines. I have also a
            statement, which I shall hand to the honourable senator, giving figures to show how the
            money is allocated. </para>
          <para>The bulk of Commonwealth assistance has been directed to State national fitness
            councils which are responsible for conducting the broadly based fitness programmes in
            each State and to universities and State Departments of Education to assist in the
            training of teachers engaged in physical fitness. There is no separate body as such
            responsible for keep fit campaigns in Australia. The Commonwealth Council for National
            Fitness, in conjunction with the State councils, promotes national fitness activities in
            accordance with the powers given to it under the Act, with the limited funds that it has
            at its disposal. The supplementary question asked by the honourable senator suggests
            that in this day and age certain medical groups should in some way be married into the
            Council, the point being that whilst in 1941 the terms of reference might have been
            appropriate, it may well be that now the terms should be much wider. I shall look at
            that aspect and report on it to the honourable senator in due course. </para>

              Tasmania has reached a critical stage and that a decision on this general question is
              engaging the attention of representatives of the Church and of the Government at the
              present time. It is well known that this . Government was the pioneer many years ago
              in the provision of state aid for independent schools. That support has spread
              throughout the country. I will refer to the Minister the honourable senator&#39;s
              suggestion as to its sufficiency at the present time on the basis of a nationwide
              survey and ascertain whether, if a survey has not been done already - I believe that
              it has been done - it would be appropriate to up-date it to this time. </para>

              Australia? The statement which appeared in the &#39;Australian&#39; of today was to
              the effect that recent cases of meningitis in Queensland were caused by a minute
              species of worms which were contained in lettuce. The worms came from rats, which were
              the primary hosts, and when eaten they attacked the brain and spinal cord. Has the
              Minister any facts to present to the Senate with regard to research being undertaken

            and heard part of a very fine address by Professor Nossal relating to the matter which
            the honourable senator has raised. As indicated in the Press cutting which I saw a few
            moments ago, rats are regarded as being the carriers. Therefore it would seem to me that
            the complete responsibility in this matter rests with the State health authorities. It
            would be a tragic day for all of us, would it not, if we reached the situation in which
            we could not have our nice iced lettuce? I am sure there must be some reason for the
            outbreak of the disease&#39; which has been mentioned. It may be a matter of lack of
            hygiene somewhere, but I do not know. As I have said, primarily the responsibility rests
            with the State authorities but I will seek some further information from my Department.

              the Minister for Customs and Excise, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chipp,</inline>
              publicly endorsed smoking as a dangerous health hazard? Did he not also link tobacco
              with other dangerous addictive drugs which are causing damage in Western society? As
              this is the first time a State or Federal Minister has condemned smoking in such
              unequivocal terms, will the Minister for Health urgently consult his Cabinet
              colleagues about imposing a ban on the television advertising of a product which is
              now recognised even by a Liberal Minister as a great health hazard? </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir KENNETH</inline>ANDERSONit is not quite accurate
            to say that this is the first occasion on which a Minister has made a fairly positive
            statement in relation to the possibility of smoking being a health hazard. In 1965 the
            then Minister for Health, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Swartz,</inline> made a
            statement outlining the medical evidence linking smoking and lung cancer. He said at the
            time that all responsible public health authorities in Australia were agreed that there
            was a proven relationship between cigarette smoking and lung cancer and that the problem
            was how a reduction in the incidence of the disease could be achieved without resorting
            to autocratic methods. I have quoted almost exactly what the Minister said as far back
            as 1965. Our colleague in the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator
              Greenwood,</inline> who was my predecessor as Minister for Health, issued a Press
            release in May of this year which stated that the Government regarded smoking as .a
            major public health problem, that strong evidence supported this view but the
            Government&#39;s aim was towards educating the public on smoking rather than advocating
            a complete banning of cigarette advertising. As I read the Press report this morning the
            Minister for Customs and Excise in the other place, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr
              Chipp,</inline> was very careful to express a personal view m reply to a question
            yesterday. </para>

          <para class="block">Yes. The National Health and Medical Research Council has recommended
            that health education is probably the most effective way of attacking the smoking
            problem; warning labels should be included on cigarette packs, tar and nicotine content
            should be indicated and there should be restriction of advertising of cigarettes. The
            Council has also recommended that health education programmes in schools on the hazards
            associated with smoking should be extended. I answered a question here the week before
            last in direct relation to this question of advertising on television. While I do not
            want to over occupy the rostrum in replying to questions, it is such an important matter
            that I would like to go on to say that the Commonwealth has responsibilities for health
            education programmes in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory and
            these have been intensified in the A.C.T. following the formation of a separate health
            education section in the A.C.T. health services. </para>
          <para>As far as labelling of cigarette packs with a warning is concerned, the Commonwealth
            has already indicated that when all States have introduced legislation in this regard
            the Commonwealth will enact complementary legislation in the A.C.T. and the Northern
            Territory. I think all honourable senators would agree that it would be absurd if we had
            to cross the border because of some enactment in relation to this matter. It is a
            complex matter. I repeat a promise that I made last week, that I will use my best
            endeavours to get a uniform decision on this matter with the States. My Department has
            negotiated revision of the voluntary code of cigarette advertising on television, and
            the new code is to come into effect on 1st October this year. Briefly, it will extend
            the restrictions to radio; it will restrict advertising times so that no advertisements
            are shown in proximity to programmes for children or when young people are likely to be
            a large part of the audience; it will limit the style and type of advertisements; and in
            particular no advertisements will be televised between 4 p.m. and 7.30 p.m. from Monday
            to Saturday or before 7.30 p.m. on Sunday. Finally, the Commonwealth will continue to
            keep all aspects, including the voluntary code, under close review. </para>

            <para>- It is a fact that a complete development proposal for Brisbane Airport is being
              studied in quite some detail with the very helpful co-operation of the Queensland
              State Government. The best indication one can get is that the total terminal complex
              will in due course be erected on a different site. The fire which occurred on Sunday
              at the Trans-Australian Airlines terminal was extensive and damaged that terminal
              substantially. Part of the terminal has been gutted and for safety reasons this part
              will have to be demolished quickly. However, the ticketing and baggage handling
              annexes on each side of the main building are virtually undamaged and will continue to
              be used. I am to go to Brisbane on Friday and I shall spend some time during that
              afternoon and on Saturday morning having a look at the damage. This is about as -much
              as I can usefully say at the moment. </para>

            <para>- I desire to ask a question of the Minister representing the Minister for Primary
              Industry, although the question could well be directed to the Minister representing
              the Minister for Shipping and Transport. I ask: Did the steamship &#39;Welly&#39;,
              chartered by Eddie Steamship Company, arrive at Port Lincoln, South Australia, on 26th
              August 1971 to load barley for Taiwan? Has loading of the boat been refused by the
              Barley Board as the master lacks a letter of credit for barley to nationalist China?
              Has the master of the ship been informed that loading would be permitted in another
              State of the Commonwealth? Has the presence of the ship at Port Lincoln prevented the
              waterside labour force being transferred to another port where work is available and
              resulted in them being unemployed? In view of the urgency of this matter to local
              waterside workers, Eyre Peninsula barley growers and silo operators, will the Minister
              see that this matter receives urgent attention? </para>

            <para>- Yes, I certainly will. I shall refer the honourable senators question to the
              Minister for Shipping and Transport this afternoon. I understand what the honourable
              senator has put to me. However, 1 find it hard to understand how a lack or a letter of
              credit said to be for a transaction in South Australia would not prevent the loading
              of barley in some other State. Such an arrangement would not be consistent with my
              understanding of what letters of credit do for exporters. Equally, there are quite
              substantial facilities for credit arrangements for exporters of grain. Therefore, I
              imagine there may be other reasons besides that mentioned by the honourable senator.
              However, I will find out the answer to the honourable senator&#39;s question as fast
              as I can. </para>

              <para>- I have read the report in part; I would not say that I have read the whole of
                it However, the report is definitely under study and the recommendations will come
                before me in my new capacity of Minister for Health. A related question was asked
                earlier and it arose out of what was said by the Minister for Customs and Excise in
                another place. Perhaps the honourable senator had that statement in his mind.

          <para>The suggestion was made that some of the funds allocated by the Commonwealth for the
            campaign against drug abuse should be applied to anti-smoking propaganda in the context
            of a health problem. I do not subscribe to that. It would not be consistent with my
            views and I would not agree with it in that sense. 1 want to make this abundantly clear.
            I say this because the Government has made $500,000 available in the year 1971-72 to a
            Commonwealth sub-committee and this amount is subject to annual review. Each </para>
          <para class="block">State and Territory has received a proportion of the grant to develop
            and coordinate its own drug educational programme in line with the views of the
            subcommittee. During 1971-72 a total of $275,000 has been allocated to the States,
            leaving $225,000 available for Commonwealth use. The Commonwealth&#39;s share of the
            grant has made possible the preparation of projects for Australia-wide application in
            relation to this drug use prevention proposal, seminars and training courses for State
            and Territory personnel undertaking leadership roles and so on. If we were to encroach
            on that allocation we may help one aspect but we may take away the impact or impetus of
            what the Government wants to do and what the Senate Committee wants to do in relation to
            drug education. I would not support that proposition. </para>

            <para>- I can inform my colleague from Hobart that I was fortunate enough to receive a
              report this morning on this subject and I visited the location of the building in
              Hobart last week. The contract is to be completed early in 1973. The contract was for
              some $4.2m, now $4.3m. The core of the building is up to the third floor stage. There
              was a slippage of several weeks in the time programme due to unexpected foundational
              difficulties and water. However the contractor, in recent conference, rearranged the
              programme so that that time slippage is expected to be overtaken by the end of the
              year. The contract is expected to be completed on time. Its progress to date is
              according to the financial schedule. I am not aware specifically that the conditions
              lay down the use of Tasmanian materials but I would think that in the circumstances of
              the contractor and the Commonwealth it would be in the major part economical to employ
              Tasmanian materials. </para>

            <para>- Like the honourable senator I read in the Press the report that the Victorian
              Government had imposed a 10 per cent bed tax on accommodation in the State. I am asked
              whether I consider this tax to be detrimental to tourism. My answer is that I do not
              believe that it will necessarily be so, but, on the other hand, it is not for me to
              say. It is for the Minister responsible for tourism to say. I shall direct the
              question to him. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister for Civil Aviation. I refer to what is
              generally regarded as the extreme inconvenience caused to the public by the practice
              of simultaneous departure of aircraft. For example, a week or so ago, I think, 2
              aircraft left&#39; Sydney for Canberra at about 8.30 a.m. and the next aircraft
              departed at about 11.30 a.m. Can the Minister tell me whether it is in his power to do
              something about remedying this practice? If it is within, his power, is he prepared to
              do something about it? </para>

            <para>- What the honourable senator is referring to is called in the industry parallel
              scheduling. It is something which attracts a great deal of attention and a great deal
              of unfavourable comment from people and, equally, from time to time from myself. On
              this matter I have talked to the Department and to the 2 airlines both separately and
              together. When one looks at it one finds that one of the reasons why aircraft depart
              at the same time is because of the loads which they are called upon to carry from
              Sydney to Canberra to Melbourne and from Melbourne to Canberra to Sydney. This is
              because of the concentration of people requiring to depart at given times. In many
              cases this makes it necessary to operate on a simultaneous departure time..
              Nonetheless I am not entirely happy about the position. I have great reservations
              about the power of myself and the Department to enforce any change, but the honourable
              senator has my assurance that we are doing our best to find whether we can effectively
              make any changes. </para>

            in its present form? When will the Federal Government acknowledge the inequity of the
            present subsidy scheme and, in view of the current crisis, review the present system of
            subsidies and stockpiling which has shaken buyer confidence, wrecked the rural
            reconstruction scheme and wrongly allocated our nation&#39;s resources? </para>

            <para>- It is quite obvious that the honourable senator has not given very much thought
              to his question because the deficiency payment which he called a subsidy came into
              force only last week. That was the first of the sales at which it operated. He asked
              when the Government intended to introduce one of the many possible acquisition
              schemes. I have not heard of the many possible acquisition schemes to which he
              referred. One federal organisation - namely, the Australian Wool and Meat Producers
              Federation - has said that the Government should have an acquisition scheme. I remind
              honourable senators that the other federal wool body has had no say on the matter to
              date. Until the wool industry decides that it wants an acquisition scheme, the
              Government is in no position to do anything about introducing one. I remind honourable
              senators that if the Commonwealth Government were to introduce an acquisition scheme
              along the lines of the acquisition scheme operated by the Australian Wheat Board, as
              some people say it should, there would have to be complementary State legislation. If
              any honourable senator believes that he can get all his State colleagues to vote for
              an acquisition scheme which will affect the electorate of each member, I think the
              time would then be ripe for an acquisition scheme. But 1 do not believe that any
              honourable senator can get his colleagues to do that at present. </para>

              <para>- It was a reserve floor price scheme. At that time the industry had a
                considerable amount of money which the Government was holding. That referendum was
                not carried. At present the industry has no money for financing an acquisition
                scheme. I believe that the industry would have to get Commonwealth money to assist
                in such a scheme. The honourable senator&#39;s question was a lot of balderdash.

              activities of State governments is to be opened up on the justification that in some
              specious way those activities affect the environment, then obviously in accordance
              with prudence, the limitations of question time and legitimate areas of interest there

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister for Works. I refer to the extensions to
              the Sydney international airport runway for the use of jumbo jets. How far does this
              runway project into Botany Bay? Has the Department of Works studied the hydrological
              effects of this runway on the natural currents in that area? What does the Department
              intend to do to prevent possible foreshore excavation due to the interruption of the
              wave pattern? </para>

            <para>- As I told the Senate yesterday, the full length of the runway when completed
              will be 13,000 feet. From the shoreline it projects into the bay some 8,000 feet. The
              effect of this structure on the currents has a very intense history. The original
              dredging for the original pier was done by the Department with the agreement of the
              Maritime Services Board of New South Wales and on the advice of the world experts, the
              Walling ford Hydraulic Research Station in England. However, the structure did affect
              the wave pattern, and subsequent attempts to reshape that pattern were undertaken when
              we made the last extension. The wave action on the beach was restored. The
              Commonwealth, in undertaking the present projection to 13,000 feet, took further
              advice from the Walling ford Hydraulic Research Station and was in close co-operation
              with the State Government and the research, section of the Maritime Services Board. We
              agreed to take about two-thirds of the 9 million cubic yards of sand required from the
              mouth of the bay instead of the area near the pier projection. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The honourable senator will be interested to know that the Maritime Services Board
            itself has erected a large structure, which is a model of Botany Bay, for the purpose of
            simulating the wave pattern there and checking the calculations that have been made by
            physical demonstration so as finally to establish the shape of the dredged areas and
            their appropriateness to the waves on the beach. The Senate can be assured that the
            Department of Works is keeping the condition of the foreshore under constant review. I
            believe that the efforts we have made to restore the storm damage that occurred about 3
            years ago have met with general appreciation. At the present time we are laying about
            300,000 cubic yards of sand along the beach to restore it to its original condition and,
            insofar as further work is agreed by the Department of Works to be necessary, it will
            have our usual prompt attention. </para>

                  <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drury&#39;s</inline> question, he is saying
                that all sufferers who went to Germany for treatment have returned and the
                implication is, although this might not have been the exact words, that all have
                been cured. This is a medical question which I shall be happy to have examined. I
                was not aware, until the honourable senator mentioned it, of the number who made the
                pilgrimage to Germany for treatment. I shall have the matter investigated and

              Medical Benefit Fund of Australia Ltd membership premiums, hospital costs coverage is

              charged the full $12 per day, a charge which is not covered by the hospital benefit
              funds? What action does the Minister contemplate to aid the parents of such inmates
              who will suffer severe financial impositions if the New South Wales Hospitals
              Commission policy direction is continued in its present form? </para>

              <para>- I reaffirm what I said before, that the hospital benefits scheme does provide
                a satisfactory level of insurance against the costs which it is intended to cover,
                namely, charges made for treatment in approved hospitals. In the past it has been
                customary for no charges to be made for treatment in State mental health
                institutions. This reflects the&#39; fact that the care of the mentally ill is
                primarily a </para>
            </talk.start>
          </interjection>
          <para class="block">State responsibility. Consequently the Commonwealth hospital benefits
            scheme does not extend to treatment in such institutions. I think the honourable senator
            recognises that to be a fact of life. I understand from the implication in the question
            that the New South Wales Government now intends to raise charges for treatment in State
            psychiatric centres. As the authority responsible for the provision of mental health
            services the State Government is entitled to make such a decision. If it chooses to make
            that decision it may do so, and the consequences of that decision rest entirely with the
            State. I reiterate that it is a decision which must be taken by the State. I think it is
            proper to add that under the Commonwealth and State financial arrangements New South
            Wales, along with other States, will receive considerably increased revenues for the
            purpose of financing State services such as those caring for the mentally ill. Therefore
            I come back to the point that this is clearly a matter within the responsibility of the
            States concerned. </para>

            <para>- My question is addressed to the Minister for Civil Aviation. Am I to take it
              from the Minister&#39;s earlier reply that he has been persuaded by the argument of
              the airlines to accept that the scheduling of air services has been on the basis of
              public demand and not, as I had thought to be the case, to suit the convenience of a
              particular airline? Would it not be true to say that for that argument to be valid and
              acceptable, one would expect all people in the various centres around Australia to
              wish to travel at the one time? For instance, if there should be a demand in Hobart
              for a service at 8 a.m., a demand in Launceston for a service at 9 a.m. and a demand
              at Devonport for a service at 12 o&#39;clock, would the airline, companies go to the
              trouble of scheduling their services to meet the convenience of the public in this
              respect? </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- In his interest in this matter the honourable senator has taken a rather
              over-simplified view. Firstly, I am not persuaded by anybody, other than in what I
              call the total public interest. When one investigates this matter one finds in certain
              places that the concentration of demand - by people who wish to travel - is occurring
              very much at the same time. The second problem is that aircraft have a long pattern of
              flying. They do not just fly from Melbourne to Sydney and return; they go on to other
              places. This is a matter of where an aircraft starts and finishes a flight and a
              question of balancing the load factor in the general situation. My general view is the
              one that I tried to express to the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, that the
              Department and I have taken and are taking a continuing interest in this matter to see
              whether we can improve the situation. However, the total public interest is one matter
              yet to be clearly established. Is it best served by having aircraft departing at
              half-hourly intervals or is it best served by the present pattern? The airlines argue
              that it is best served by the present pattern in many areas. That has yet to be proved
              to be certain. One can do no more than that except to assure the Senate that the
              Department tries to measure the total public interest and to serve it </para>

            <para>Forrester Stephens Pty Ltd is a subsidiary of H. C. Sleigh Ltd and has been in
              operation several years. The Company is an agent for an overseas aircraft manufacturer
              and is widely experienced in charter work. During the past 5 years the Company has
              been awarded 46 contracts arranged by the Department of Supply of a total value of
              approximately $500,000. Public tenders closing on 20th July 1971 were invited by the
              Department of Supply in all States for the ferrying of these 6 DC-3 aircraft. Ten
              tenders were received, the lowest being from Forrester Stephens Pty Ltd for a total of
              $34,838, with adjustment clauses if there are delays during the period of the ferry
              flights from causes outside the control of the contractor. Delivery of 2 aircraft to
              Nepal was completed on 18th August 1971. It was planned to commence delivery of 2 to
              Laos on 28th August 1971 and 1 to Laos and 1 to the Khmer Republic in mid September.
              However, reports have been received that because of flooding, Vientiane airport in
              Laos may be closed until mid September. Arrangements have been made to bring forward
              the delivery of the one aircraft to the Khmer Republic. </para>

          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(1)">
              <para>The Auto cephalic Greek Orthodox Church of America and Australia made

                section 26 of the Marriage Act 1961-1966 as a recognised denomination for the
                purposes of the Act. By letter dated 30th July 1971 my predecessor informed the
                Secretary of the Church that he was not disposed at this stage to recommend
                proclamation of the Church, because he was not satisfied as to the long-term
                stability of the Church. My predecessor indicated that the then existing situation

                purpose of facilitating the appointment of ministers of the church as marriage
                celebrants, and it in no way follows from non-recognition that ministers of the
                Auto cephalic Church will encounter any difficulty in being appointed as marriage
                celebrants under other provisions of the Act. </para>

            <para>- by leave - This is a statement on indigenous oil policy made on behalf of the
              Minister for Customs and Excise <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Chipp)</inline> who
              presented it in the House of Representatives yesterday. I wish to inform the Senate of
              certain decisions that have been taken by the Government concerning its . policy
              regarding the use of . crude oil .found in Australia. The Government&#39;s policy was
              stated by the then Prime Minister, the right honourable member for Higgins <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton),</inline> in the House of Representatives on 10th
              October 1968. In brief, this policy sought to ensure that indigenous crude oil would
              be refined and used in Australia. For this reason, it was determined that, for a
              period of 10 years from September 1970, an obligation. was placed on refiners, to use
              Australian crude, oil to the maximum possible extent to provide the requirements of
              the Australian market for refined petroleum products. The policy also provided a
              guaranteed price to the producers for the first 5 years of this period - a price
              equivalent to the weighted average import parity price on 10th October 1968 with an
              allowance, among other things, for the special quality of this oil. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>To assist honourable senators in understanding the terminology in this statement,
            may I briefly - in general terms - define the parties involved. &#39;Producers&#39; are
            those companies which own and extract the raw material from the oil fields.
            &#39;Refiners&#39; are those companies which refine Australian and imported crude oil
            into petroleum products and market these products. &#39;Marketers&#39; are those
            companies which do not engage in refining crude oil themselves, but which purchase .
            petroleum products from refiners in Australia and/or overseas and market the refined
            products in Australia. </para>
          <para>There is no restriction on the importation of refined petroleum products by either
            refiners or marketers. However, consistent with its policy, the Government determined
            that marketers of imported petrol should accept the same obligation as refiners and take
            a proportion of indigenous crude. To that end Australian crude oil is allocated amongst
            both refiners and marketers according to a formula based on the relative sales of
            certain refined products. As the import parity price was a weighted average, it
            necessarily followed that it was a higher price, to some companies, than the price of
            the crude they had been importing. At the present time, of course, because of
            significant increases in crude oil prices overseas, the determined price for indigenous
            crude is less than- if similar oil were purchased overseas. </para>
          <para>Since October 1968, the production of indigenous crude has increased to the point
            where it now supplies approximately 65 per cent of Australia&#39;s crude oil
            requirements. This represents an immediate saving to Australia in the current year of
            approximately $230m in foreign exchange payments. However, because of difficulties being
            encountered by some refiners in using crude oil for which their refineries were not
            originally designed, the Government, at the request of the industry, agreed that some
            exports pf crude oil may be permitted to meet short term problems of individual refiners
            provided: (a) Refiners have in existence capacity to process crude oil up to their
            normal marketing requirements, or firm plans to install such capacity; (b) refiners
            ensure a reasonable balance between exports of indigenous crude and imports of crude
            oil, with no reduction in the company&#39;s refinery activities in Australia; and (c)
            they are willing to disclose the terms upon which such exports will be made. </para>
          <para>The industry has been informed that exports in general would be restricted to 20 per
            cent of the allocation of crude oil required to be taken up by either refiners or
            marketers. Provision was also made that in exceptional circumstances, the Government
            would be prepared to consider an approach by any company to have this limit varied.
            Consistent with this policy 5 companies have been permitted to export a proportion of
            their allocation. The exports to date amount to approximately 2 per cent of total
            indigenous production. In each of these cases, the Government had accepted that the
            companies concerned were having difficulties because of the different type of oil
            normally used pending a realignment of their refining facilities. Refiners are investing
            significant amounts of money to readjust their re fie ries to cope with Australian oil. </para>
          <para>Recently 2 marketers of petrol, who do not have refinery facilities in Australia,
            sought permission of the Government to export the whole of their allocation of
            indigenous crude oil. They were again informed of the Government&#39;s policy, as
            outlined above, and were asked to negotiate with local refiners to have their allocation
            of indigenous crude oil refined in Australia. However, they were also informed that, if
            either existing or proposed refining arrangements were not mutually acceptable, the
            Government would again reconsider the applications. To this end, the Government
            indicated that it was prepared to call upon an independent arbiter to determine whether
            the arrangements proposed by the refining companies were equitable. In the event,
            agreement has not been reached and, at the request of the Government, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Leslie</inline> Melville, K.B.E., has undertaken to advise the
            Government as an arbiter. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Leslie</inline> will be
            assisted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr T.</inline> A. Webb, a consulting engineer,
            who has had long and varied- experience in the oil refining industry. On the receipt of
            the arbiter&#39;s advice, the Government will reconsider these applications. </para>
          <para>I turn now to the subject of dumping. Recently, several oil companies approached the
            Government alleging that petroleum products from some countries &#39; were being dumped
            in Australia in contravention of the Customs Tariff (Dumping and Subsidies) Act. It is a
            fact that in some countries refiners produce petroleum products in excess of those
            countries&#39; requirements. Consequently to dispose of this surplus there is a
            compulsion to seek export markets and if necessary to supply them at low prices. I point
            out that the Government&#39;s policy is that no Australian industry should suffer
            because of unfair trading practices by overseas exporters. In accordance with normal
            procedures, these allegations have been examined and, on the best information available
            to .the Department of Customs and Excise, it would appear that dumping has taken&#39;
            place to an extent which may be causing not insubstantial injury - and I use here the
            precise terms of the Act - to the refiners of petroleum products in Australia.
            Consequently, the industry has now been informed that, if petrol is exported on or after
            31st August 1971, from certain countries, at a price lower than the normal values that
            have been assessed, dumping cash securities will be collected. However, companies have
            been invited to submit any evidence they may have if they consider the normal values
            assessed are not accurate with a view to a re-examination of this aspect. </para>
          <para>In- accordance with the normal procedure, if petroleum products are imported at
            lower than the normal value, the question will be examined by the Tariff Board in
            accordance with the terms of the Dumping and Subsidies Act. The Government is conscious
            of the complex nature of this industry with its many component parts and conflicting
            interests. The ind i geo us oil policy has been of great advantage to Australia. It has
            resulted in massive quantities of crude oil and natural gas being found in Australia. It
            has encouraged further research and exploration into finding new fields. It has ensured
            that Australia will not simply be a &#39;quarry* from which the raw material is mined
            and taken out of Australia for processing. On the contrary it has stimulated significant
            investment and created much employment for Australians. It has insulated motorists
            against dramatic increases in oil prices which have taken place overseas. At the same
            time it has allowed free competition to function, in that persons other than established
            oil companies can import petroleum products and sell them on the Australian market. </para>
          <para>The Government is conscious that its policy in this area not only affects the oil
            companies per se, but thousands of smaller business men and employees engaged in
            marketing and distribution. It would be unthinkable if the Government did not act in
            accordance with the law and its declared policies when alleged unfair practices are
            brought to its notice. The Government has done this in invoking the Customs Tariff
            (Dumping and Subsidies) Act. However, as I have said, every opportunity will be given to
            importers if they wish the matter to be further reviewed. In the last resort the final
            decision can only be made after a report by the Tariff Board. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- When the Senate adjourned last evening I was expressing the view that extreme
              wage rises in Australia were not in the interests of the community and were in actual
              fact the main basis of the inflationary trend. Honourable senators may recall that at
              that point I was interrupted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline>
              who said that it was the profit factor which was creating the inflationary trend. I
              believe this not to be the case and indeed I think that in the system which we have in
              Australia we have found that industry generally has acted in a proper fashion and that
              profit ratios are not extreme compared with those in other countries.I believe that
              the unions generally, and particularly the activities of the leader of the Australian
              Council of Trade Unions enforcing his views and the views of some of those who support
              him in respect of industrial matters, have certainly been of disadvantage to the
              community. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I refer particularly to the activity which has taken place in the blackmailing of
            the Dunlop organisation. While this was described as being in support of a proposition
            that resale price maintenance was something which was harmful, in truth that is far from
            the case. The reason for this action was that the ACTU store wanted to get line leaders
            from the Dunlop organisation so that it would be able to rank in respect of stocking
            quality goods with like stores. </para>
          <para>Another factor which is against the interests of the community is the demand by
            unions that the employees of certain firms shall become members of unions. Here we saw
            the action that was taken against the Myer organisation. This organisation was given an
            indication that unless every employee was a member of one of the unions the ACTU would
            in actual fact stop all goods going in or out of its stores. Of course, no company can
            stand up to this type of blackmail. We saw the employees of one company who had
            experienced this type of control in other countries abhorrring the fact they should be
            forced against their will to join a particular organisation and, moreover, be forced to
            pay a due to a political party. I suggest that this is the type of activity about which
            the public should be very aware. It may be their turn to come under the thumb of the
            ACTU in the not too distant future. </para>
          <para>I want to put one point which was raised yesterday. On the 2 days during which I was
            not in the Australian capital last week, I made a note of prices of goods which were
            being offered for sale by the ACTU-Bourke&#39;s store and compared them with prices of
            similar goods in some other stores nearby. I do not give these figures to express any
            dissatisfaction regarding the prices which are offered or to say that the store is not a
            good one. I believe that the general proposition which has been put forward by the
            unions is that they believe they should get into the retail business and they hope -
            this was indicated at a recent conference&#34; - to extent into the areas of insurance,
            finance and house building. I believe that these activities should be encouraged if they
            are to bring competition into the community. However, one should bear in mind the
            thought - and this is a point that I expressed last night - that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> had originally said that 22* per cent was the
            maximum mark-up that should be permitted by a store. I - have been waiting for
            Bourke&#39;s store to give the figures of the level of profit which it made from trading
            up to 30th June 1971. Indeed, the interests of the public are not served in this respect
            because this is one store which is not likely to announce its turnover, level of profit
            or any other related matter. I suggest that the store should note what I have just said
            and perhaps meet that public interest. </para>
          <para>The concern I have in the matter is that the ACTU has announced that it intends to
            buy this store within 3 years from profits made. Certainly, this would not be in the
            interests of the public if the profits are to be of such an extent that this can be
            achieved. I have here a table which, I think, it would be to the advantage of honourable
            senators if they were to read it. I do not wish to read it at the moment and with the
            concurrence of honourable senators I incorporate it in Hansard. </para>
          <para class="block">
            <graphic href="049232197109082_25_5.jpg" />
          </para>
          <para>In short, the table indicates that in respect of half a dozen normal household items
            there is no cheap buying at the ACTU store. I suggest that many simple people have been
            tricked into feeling that the lowest mark-up will be found at this union controlled
            store. Let me take some items which I noted on 2nd and 3rd September. My information
            would probably be verified by a call to the stores that I shall mention. The first item
            is a Singer sewing machine 427. This machine was noted in Myers, of 275 Lonsdale Street,
            at $99.90 and in Bourke&#39;s store at SI 19.50. A Kreisler stereogram 3 piece 11/140
            was marked at $305 in Bourke&#39;s, $285 in Myers and 5289 in Maxwells Radio. Another
            item was a Ken wood Chef food mixer. At Bourke&#39;s this item was marked at $63, at
            Myers $59 at Maxwells $60 and at John Bruce Electrics it was marked at $66.50 but was
            offered to me for $57.95. At James McEwen Ltd this article was offered at $59. The table
            I have incorporated will indicate - the point to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator
              Georges.</inline></para>

          <para>There are several points about the Budget which 1 think are of particular
            importance. Firstly, I note with great interest what has been said on a matter about
            which 1 have spoken in this House on a number of occasions - that is, that some type of
            budgeting in Commonwealth expenditure over the period should be introduced. No-one has
            mentioned this matter in this place but I note on page 4 of the Budget papers the
            following statement: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>To assist in controlling the growth of expenditures, we have arranged that, in
              future, all Commonwealth Departments will prepare for the Government&#39;s
              consideration expenditure estimates for a further 2 years beyond each budget year.
              This will clarify the longer-term implications of individual proposals in the context
              of the emerging overall expenditure situation and will enable the Government to act
              earlier in relation to developing trends. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I compliment the Government on that step. It is the first sensible
            approach I have noted in relation to future expenditures of the Commonwealth.
            Departments will be required to set forth not merely an annual table of expenditure but
            will have to set out what they hope to achieve in tha future. I think we will be well
            served by this step. </para>
          <para>Another matter which caught my attention in the Budget is one which Ministers will
            know I have been emphasising over a period of years. I refer to the growth of the
            Commonwealth in relation to its total employment and its total expenditure. This has
            been completely out of key with what we should expect where inflation is likely to
            occur. Throughout the Budget Speech the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr
              Snedden)</inline> emphasised that inflation is a Commonwealth responsibility. This
            Budget indicates that the Commonwealth intends to take some action to control inflation.
            I noted that the Treasurer, speaking about general growth, said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>After adjustment to remove the estimated effects of the transfer of pay-roll tax
              to the States, our outlays in Australia are estimated to increase by 11.7 per cent
              compared with the actual increase of 14.9 per cent last year. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I still think that the growth rate of 11.7 per cent in the total
            expenditure of the Commonwealth is in excess of what we should have at the present time.
            If the Commonwealth can achieve the 3.1 per cent increase in employment only that is
            proposed that certainly will be a sound achievement. </para>
          <para>Total expenditure on the part of the Commonwealth is expected to be $8,900m. If we
            look at page 13 of the Budget papers we find that approximately $99 5m of the net income
            this year will be lent back to various authorities and an interest rate charged. That is
            what I believe to be the case. I suggest to the Senate that our budgeting is entirely
            incorrect when the Budget sets out the net taxable income to the Commonwealth from
            various sources and then sets out the expenditure of that money as a total outlay of the
            Common wealth when a large percentage of lt is to be lent to the States for various
            works such as housing, and loans to the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority, to the
            airlines, for war service homes and for other work. The Commonwealth will be collecting
            interest on that money and it should not be included in the Commonwealth&#39;s total
            expenditure. </para>
          <para>I suggest that the problem arising out of this relates directly to the
            Postmaster-General&#39;s Department. If I recall correctly this was mentioned yesterday
            by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Willesee.</inline> He indicated that $140m odd
            would be required by the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department purely to serve interest
            charges. The Commonwealth Government at this stage is saying that it wishes to see
            business control its growth and that it wishes to see it competitive. With the
            concurrence of honourable senators I incorporate 2 tables in Hansard. The first relates
            to charges for selected postal and telephone service and facilities in Australia over a
            10-year period. The sec and relates to prices charged by one other monopoly, a private
            enterprise monopoly. It deals with steel prices in Australia from 1960 to 1971. </para>

          </para>
          <para class="block">I will refer to a few items coming within the management of the
            Postmaster-General&#39;s Department. In local calls there has been a 43 per cent
            increase in that 10-year period. There has been a 150 per cent increase in the telephone
            connection fee. As for rental charges, in Sydney and Melbourne there has been a 54 per
            cent increase for business telephones and an 88 per cent increase for telephones in
            residences. The Senate will be interested to know of this general level of increase in
            charges levied by an authority managed by the Commonwealth over that 10-year period. For
            your information, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President,</inline> I mention
            that in country areas where there are more than 2,000 lines there has been a 116 per
            cent increase in rentals for telephones in residences. </para>
          <para>I turn now to the achievement of private enterprise in this 10-year period. 1 know
            that the Labor Party greatly criticised the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd for its
            price rises recently but over a 10-year period, including 1971, there has been a 27.6
            per cent -increase in heavy structural steel, a 29.9 per cent increase in merchant bar
            steel, a 27 per cent increase in heavy steel rails and a 7.8 per cent increase in
            electrolytic tin plate. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President,</inline> the
            Commonwealth must look to its own efficiency in many areas before it looks to private
            enterprise and says that there must be greater efficiency by business in the Australian
            community. </para>
          <para>There are many things I would like to refer to in relation to our social services.
            The Commonwealth at present is meeting enormous expenditure in this field. Of its total
            expenditure of $8, 833m over $2,095m is related to social services and various
            repatriation payments. This is extremely good but 1 suggest to the Commonwealth that it
            will need to give greater attention to areas which affect young people at the present
            time. We will have to face an enormous problem in the future if we do not give attention
            to these young people who have been deprived of some of their rights because of the
            attitude we take in our society. This problem is developing in our cities at present.
            Greater assistance - more than that which State governments can provide - will have to
            be given to church institutions and other bodies which are looking after unmarried
            mothers, homeless men, and children who have been displaced as a result of the break up
            of marriages in our community. I recommend to the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth)</inline> that these areas should be his constant
            interest in this coming year. </para>
          <para>I want to refer now to primary industry. The greatest problem in our community at
            the moment is in this field. Honourable senators have spoken at length in this place
            about rural reconstruction. I reiterate the questions 1 posed when the Bill dealing with
            that matter was before the House. I said that the Government will have to pay close
            attention to the interest rate being charged in the community at present, to the term of
            loans being granted under the rural reconstruction scheme and to the total amount of
            money being made available by the Commonwealth. Several State governments have indicated
            to the Commonwealth that they are at variance with the general terms of the Bill so far
            as those 3 matters are concerned. This criticism is general and there is a great need
            for some reassessment of the situation. Let me take one particular point. I am rather
            afraid that the Commonwealth is being encouraged to take the line that long term low
            interest rate loans should be made available. This is just what a viable farmer wants.
            If you are a successful farmer and you are going well it is a good thing for you to have
            access to cheap money at a low interest rate and for a long term. But that is not what
            is wanted by the farmer who is in difficulty now. What he wants is access to overdraft
            at a lower rate than is available at the moment. Every farmer in business is anxious to
            repay his loan just as quickly as possible. He does not want loans for long terms. At
            the present time the greatest problem which is facing us in various areas is the
            proposed entry pf Britain into the European Economic Community. I suggest that the long
            term interests of Australia regarding food production are quite sound. </para>

              <para>- It has been very disappointing that farmers, some of their associations and,
                indeed, many people have been crying poor mouth for all primary industries. This is
                not the case. Many primary producers and primary industries are doing reasonably
                well at the present time, but the threat to them is quite severe. The future in
                regard to food production must surely give encouragement to the Australian producer
                who is efficient. I noticed an article in the Melbourne Herald&#39; the other day
                regarding a comment from Vienna which makes my heart bleed when I see the action
                which we take in this country in relation to food. The article stated: </para>

          <para class="block">This is a crime. Indeed, the crime relates back to ourselves because

            That is a complete crime of our society. This Government needs to provide facilities
            whereby we can store food for a longer period in this country. Perhaps instead of paying
            $250,000 for aircraft to be given to some near neighbouring country we should pay more
            consideration to giving away food because, at the present time, people are starving in

            <para>- Firstly, I deem it an honour to be a representative of the people of Victoria in
              this chamber. I am deeply conscious of the debt that I owe both to the Australian
              Labor Party - the party I represent - to its workers and the thousands of voters who
              have given me this right to represent them in this chamber. I only trust that over the
              years that I may be here I shall not betray that trust. I shall now speak on a lighter
              note. This afternoon questions were asked and answers given relating to the Fill
              aircraft. My attempts to gain this office parallel the history, in the time factor, of
              the Fill aircraft in that I made my first attempt to be elected to this place in 1963.
              Were I not a very modest type of gentleman I would believe that where the Labor Party
              has been successful the Government has not. Although it may have taken the Labor Party
              8 years to get me here, as yet the Government has nor succeeded in obtaining the Fill
              aircraft. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>But in a more serious vein 1 say that because of my lifelong association with
            primary industry 1 hope in the future to maintain most of my political activity on
            matters pertaining to primary industry and to people who live in rural areas. However,
            since entering this chamber I have listened with great attention to many debates. I feel
            that I cannot let pass without some comment a matter which was raised 2 or 3 weeks ago.
            In this chamber a spokesman for the Australian Democratic Labor Party used the term
            natural justice. I do not think that I have ever in my lifetime heard the term natural
            justice used so extensively. While this debate was going on my mind went back to the
            previous week when a spokesman for the same party, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator
              Kane</inline> - I regret that he is not in the chamber - in a debate centering on the
            trade union movement had this to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I now take the opportunity to mention some of the political strikes. I say that
              they were not designed to improve working conditions or to get higher wages. They were
              simply and purely political strikes aimed at the very power and authority of
              government 1 will now cite some recent examples. On 4th September 1970 the Waterside
              Workers Federation struck over the case of Bunna&#39; Walsh. It will be recalled that
                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Walsh</inline> was prevented from taking his seat in
              the Victorian &#39; State - Parliament because of. his failure to reveal a conviction
              for an offence committed some years earlier. It is worth recalling that his exclusion
              subsequently was upheld in the courts. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">At no time while that debate was on do I recall any spokesman for the
            Democratic Labor Party appealing for natural justice on behalf of Ronald Walsh. It may
            well be argued that, strictly speaking, the term natural justice does not apply. But I
            am of the opinion that men of goodwill would have extended the term natural justice to
            the Ronald Walsh case. In that case I frankly believe that the law was an ass. If members
            of the Waterside Workers Federation withdrew their labour in support of a friend, a mate
            or a co-worker then I believe that that union was only carrying out its traditional role
            - a role which has ever been the role of the trade union movement wherever injustice has
            been done. Were this not the case then I fear we would still be slaves. I am quite sure
            that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kane</inline> in his heart of hearts believes
            just that. In conclusion on this matter, I say that my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> and myself, who were at that time closely
            associated with the <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Walsh</inline> referred to, admired
            the dignity with which that man conducted himself. At no time did he seek to vilify,
            castigate or make any rash statement about any person irrespective of whether that
            person persecuted him from this chamber or other places of privilege or through the news
            media. In that case <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ronald</inline> Walsh proved himself
            to be a man among men. </para>
          <para>I shall now return to the subject of the land. I was very pleased to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> in the final part of his speech make the
            comment that in some areas of primary production there is some hope or some sign of
            improvement. One could mention the dairy industry, although the improvement may be only
            momentary. One could mention the fact that wheat quotas are on the up and up and that
            quite good sales of wheat have been made. However, one must admit that in many other
            areas, particularly wool, the situation is very bleak. I was rather interested to read a
            statement, on reconstruction and finance for primary producers, made by the Minister for
            Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> 2 or 3 weeks ago. He
            said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Indeed the whole question of credit is of increasing importance to the rural
              industries and there are clear indications of a need to reexamine the demand for, and
              supply of, credit in the rural sector. In these circumstances I have asked for the
              advice of the BAE on the adequacy of existing credit facilities. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Not before time, may I say. Although I have been established in my
            office in Warrnambool in south western Victoria for a short time only, I have received
            certain correspondence. I have in my hand a photostat of a letter that was received by a
            farmer who had traded with the Bank of New South Wales for 16 years. The man&#39;s case
            history is that after the drought of 1967 he was forced out of the dairy industry, not
            solely because of the drought but because at that stage the dairy industry was going
            through the process of changing over the method of collection of milk from cans to bulk
            and because his dairy required extensive improvements to bring it up to the new
            requirements. Because that man was in his middle fifties he decided to opt out of the
            dairy industry and to ease his way into the beef industry. His 130- acre property is
            entirely free of encumbrances. A letter that he received from the bank reads: </para>

          <title>Dear Mr Ayres,</title>
          <page.no>540</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>Debt in your account is presently $450.35. </para>
        <para>As we are obliged to explain your current position to the Bank we should be pleased if
          you would kindly call to advise when and by what source of income this debt will be
          cleared. </para>
        <para class="block">This man decided to opt out of one industry and to go into another. He
          made no call on any government or taxpayers money. This is the type of letter that he
          received from his bank. He was a miserable $450.35 in arrears. His property was entirely
          free of debt. That is what the private banks are prepared to do. I take heart from the
          statement that the Minister for Primary Industry is having discussions on finance for
          people in rural areas. I agree with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator
            Webster</inline> has said already that long term loans at low rates of interest are
          needed desperately to rehabilitate farmers. Such loans would help not only farmers but
          also thousands of people who today are being bled white by high interest rates. I believe
          that a great deal of government money that will be and has been expended on rehabilitation
          in rural areas will finish up in the hands of the money lenders of this country. In
          postwar years Australia has become a money lenders paradise. Unfortunately this situation
          has been aided and abetted by various governments which have hamstrung the Commonwealth
          Bank until it has become a tame cat version of the free enterprise banks. Little wonder
          that organisations such as the Australian Council of Trade Unions are looking at the
          possibility of entering the field of banking and are hoping to provide some much needed
          competition. </para>
        <para>I cannot let my maiden speech go without making some comment relative to the industry
          in which I have spent a lifetime, that industry being the dairy industry. I believe there
          has been a great deal of mismanagement by governments in recent years. The way that
          successive Ministers over the past 2 years have used the threat of decreased subsidy to
          pull the industry into line or to make it toe the Government line is to be condemned. In
          May last year the Government panicked because mountains of butter and other milk products
          were being held in the European Economic Community. The Australian industry was asked to
          take a voluntary cut of 3.5 per cent. It was told that if Australian production of butter
          rose above 220,000 tons and if the production of cheese rose above 70,000 tons the
          Government underwriting would drop from 34c a pound butter fat to 29c a pound. The cut was
          not a voluntary one. It was blackmail. That was in May. In September, 4 months later, the
          brakes were taken off. Many thousand of farmers had done what they believed to be the
          right thing for themselves, their industry and the country and in some cases they had
          ruined very good cows. The huge surpluses in the EEC, about which we were told, had
          disappeared. To my knowledge no-one has given a very satisfactory explanation as to how
          these mountains of butter and other commodities disappeared. </para>
        <para>World markets were starting to clamour for more production. Australia&#39;s chances of
          filling its butter quota in the United Kingdom were becoming doubtful. In the meantime, at
          the Minister&#39;s insistence, the local industry had been looking at proposals for a
          long-term plan for the dairy industry. This 8-point plan, as it subsequently turned out to
          be, was submitted to the industry earlier this year. At a conference, which I attended, in
          Melbourne in May of this year the delegates present on the first day carried 7 of the 8
          points of that plan. The eighth point, which dealt with a 2-price scheme to be implemented
          if necessary, was not voted on by the delegates. They cast it aside. Strangely enough </para>
        <para class="block">
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nixon,</inline>the honourable member for Gippsland, who was
          then resident in Canberra, got to hear of that revolt. The following day the conference
          was told that unless the plan were accepted in toto the subsidy could be jeopardised. That
          ended the revolt. So 1 say that in the last 2 years the Government has used the threat of
          decreased subsidy to make that industry toe the line. </para>
        <para>Over that period so short of dairy produce had this country become that at that
          conference a motion was carried calling on the Australian Dairy Produce Board to give
          serious and urgent consideration to the sending of a delegation to China to explore the
          possibility of sales of dairy produce to that country. After it was carried a spokesman
          for the Board said that there was no point in going to China as we had nothing to sell.
          According to the latest Australian Dairy Produce Board report, butter stocks in Australia
          a few weeks ago were down to their lowest level for years. A great deal has been said by
          people in various places about the inefficiency of the dairy industry. In the case I
          mentioned I believe that it was not the industry which was inefficient but rather the
          forecasters, the tipsters, the agricultural economists and others who all too often have
          espoused their theses from ivory towers. </para>
        <para>The dairy industry in Australia will, I believe, continue to be the economic backbone
          of considerable areas. It provides employment in areas that otherwise would die because of
          lack of facility for any other employment. It could be described as one of Australia&#39;s
          truly decentralised activities. In the main its activities are carried on in areas remote
          from our capital cities. The great pity I see - and I was pleased to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> mention this point - is that because
          production has been curtailed this protein rich food which is so vitally needed by people
          in other countries is denied to these people. It is a sorry spectacle for me as a
          humanist, knowing that I have curtailed dairy production, to sit in front of a television
          set at night and see the emaciated people, particularly children, in this world. Huge
          losses of lives, huge expenditures on bombs and bullets in countries such as Vietnam,
          Cambodia and Laos have done nothing to win us friends or influence people. An equivalent
          amount spent on food produced on Australian farms would have been, I feel sure, of greater
          benefit to future generations all over the world. </para>
        <para>I wish now to refer to another matter pertaining to the dairy industry in Victoria. A
          problem has existed for a long time and perhaps it has not been properly faced up to by
          the industry. Latterly pressures have been brought to bear on the industry and currently
          it is studying the problem of overcoming the 2-price structure within the industry. The
          situation is that one price is paid for milk for manufacture and another price for milk
          for liquid consumption. The price to manufacturers is 24c or 25c a gallon, while a price
          of 40c or 42c a gallon is paid for milk fed into the liquid milk market. The tragedy of it
          all is that this situation is not conducive to unity within the industry and until a
          positive step is taken I believe that the dairy industry in Victoria will be divided. lt
          has been my unfortunate experience of people in high places that they much prefer to
          maintain the status quo. Throughout the rural areas of Australia wool has probably been a
          more discussed subject than even Vietnam. I have attended public meetings, committee
          meetings and goodness knows what in the last 7 or 8 years at which wool has been the main
          topic of discussion. I am fully aware of the frustrations felt by Australian wool growers.
          In respect to this industry our national birth right has been sold down the drain. In my
          view the governments of this country have not acted out their role as well as they should
          have done. I have felt for years that the only long term solution to the problems of the
          wool industry would be for the government of the day to take the bull by the horns and act
          positively. It is all very well for Government spokesmen to say that nothing can be done
          because the industry has not made up its mind. I suggest that if the Government waits for
          everybody in every situation to be 100 per cent behind a proposal, nothing will ever be
          done. </para>
        <para>When the Australian motor car industry was in dire straits a couple of years ago, the
          government of the day acted virtually overnight to increase tariffs and face the threat to
          the industry. I believe that was the correct action to take, but the Government has not
          been prepared to take definite action for wool growers. Its policy has been to
          procrastinate. There may be pie in the sky at some time in the far distant future, but no
          move has been made against the rings, pies, speculators and the like who are the ticks and
          parasites who have battened on the wool industry since its establishment. It has also been
          unfortunate for the wool industry that it has been headed by a man who has behaved like a
          prima donna. </para>
        <para>A public meeting was called in the western district of Victoria a few years ago to
          which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Gunn was invited. The organisers of
          the meeting asked a spokesman for the Australian Labor Party to appear on the platform. My
          colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poyser</inline> was elected to attend the
          meeting. When <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> heard that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poyser</inline> was to attend, like a true prima donna of the
          theatre he declined to appear on the same platform. Unfortunately the organisers bowed to
          his dictates instead of doing what I would have dons; that is, telling him to jump off the
          deep end. The organisers sent a telegram to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator
            Poyser</inline> and asked him not to attend the meeting. Because only one side of the
          case has been put not much has been done for the wool industry. 1 believe that the
          Australian Wool Board has been far too busy over the years promoting exclusive gowns and
          champagne, while I have had the experience in the western district of .Victoria - one of
          the centres of the great wool growing areas - of not being able to buy a pair of woollen
          socks. I believe that the feelings of a large section of the wool growing community have
          been expressed in a booklet copies of which, I understand, have been forwarded to all
          members of this Parliament. The booklet was produced by the Ivanhoe Wool growers Survival
          Committee. At page 3 appears an open letter to the Prime Minister. After the usual
          formalities it states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>It was also resolved at thai meeting, that the members of that Wool growers Survival
            Committee are not prepared to tolerate any longer, the incredible reluctance of the

            economy of the nation from exploitation by the representatives of the wool textile
            industries and the speculators trading on the Australian wool industry. </para>
          <para>The &#39;wool price support&#39; proposal adopted by the Federal Cabinet last month
            as published &#39;by the mass medias, is as synthetic as the various versions
            distributed publicly, as being the reason for the complete collapse of the economy of
            Australia&#39;s most important export industry almost 18 months ago. </para>

            the economy of the Australian wool industry, even though it has the blessing of the so

            to the industry or one iota of equity in the wool producers properties or capital
            investment, or any additional overseas exchange earnings for the nation. </para>
          <para>The Federal Government&#39;s inertia in dealing responsibly and effectively, with
            the economic crisis in that major rural industry, or &#39;National disaster&#39;, is a

          <para>The only practical commonsense solution to the problem of the Australian wool

          <para>The reason for the Federal Government not taking any action, to embargo by

            Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister, is that the world wool textile industries might

            the Australian wool industry - with forward selling on firm contracts - who have been
            handling up to more than 80 per cent of the Australian wool clip and who have a
            financial interest in seeing the market price for wool progressively decline, would have

            scheme for the Australian wool industry, as adopted by the Ivanhoe Wool growers Survival

            Parliament resumes tomorrow. </para>
          <para>I am deeply perturbed by what 1 see going on around me in the world today. I am
            disturbed by the great imbalance between the haves and the have notes. For all man&#39;s

            one side is a world full of material gadgets for which so many of us strive in order to
            keep up with the Jones&#39;s, while neglecting some of man&#39;s finer qualities in
            doing so. On the other side is destitution and poverty. The very technical achievements
            which have enabled some of us to obtain these material goods have also produced such
            massive weapons of destruction, both military and ecological, that we all must now look
            out beyond our tribal enclaves and see this universe as belonging to and inhabited by
            one people, irrespective of colour or creed. Whilst unfortunately this appears to be
            difficult for and perhaps beyond some of the older generation, the spark of hope that I
            see for mankind lies in the all too often much maligned youth of all nations. </para>

            <para>- As a newcomer to the Australian Parliament 1 want, firstly, to thank you,
                <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> all honourable senators and in
              particular the officers and staff of the Senate for the very great courtesies and
              practical help you all have given to me in recent weeks. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Over my lifetime I have had an abiding faith in the parliamentary institution. I
            believe that it is the most effective mechanism yet invented by man to express man&#39;s
            hopes, to ensure his security and to create the free society which, as his servant and
            not as his master, enables him to fulfil himself both spiritually and materially. </para>
          <para>I therefore find myself a particularly willing servant of the Parliament and,
            through it, of the Parliament&#39;s mainspring, the people of Australia. I have equally
            a deep consciousness of the great traditions and achievements of the Australian Senate.
            1 am interested, indeed fascinated, by the new developments in this chamber,
            particularly the committee system. 1 believe that, if we approach this new venture with
            restraint, with wisdom and with a true sense of the purpose of these committees, they
            can do much to bring the Parliament to the people and also to bring the Parliament into
            the twentieth century and to make it, as it can be and as it must be, a very flexible
            institution of man. </para>
          <para>This is a Budget debate. It relates to the discussion of the Budget of this
            financial year, the raising and spending of money and the structuring and mechanics of
            that, but more importantly of the philosophy of the Budget; For what is it intended,
            socially and economically? 1 would like to direct some of my remarks to these aspects,
            but 1 would like also to direct my remarks later to certain attitudes which unhappily
            are ingrained in this community and which 1 believe, more than any fiscal instruments
            and more than any Budgets, unhappily shape conditions in this country today. 1 refer
            particularly to attitudes relating to the industrial scene, attitudes relating to
            industry and its profitability and attitudes relating to rural industries. </para>
          <para>This Budget concerns the raising and spending of about S8,900m. That amount defies
            the ordinary comprehension. Let me reduce it to this concept: It concerns the raising
            and spending of, for every one of the 12,800,000 Australian people, a sum of $695; or,
            for a family of 5 - a man, his wife and 3 children - an impressive sum of $3,500. So it
            is no mean instrument, both quantitatively and qualitatively. lt has been the practice
            in the past to regard the Federal Budget as the predominant fiscal and social instrument
            of our political calendar. Without denigrating it as an instrument, let me suggest that
            many factors are now coalescing to weaken that predominance. 1 would like very quickly
            to express them, because I believe that the Budget must not be looked at in a vacuum. </para>
          <para>Firstly, 1 refer to the States and the 6 State Parliaments. There is a tendency to
            look at them as some small and unimportant factor in the economy and as an unimportant
            instrument, fiscally or economically. I say that the facts deny that. The States today,
            of their own accord, as taxing authorities - this is rarely thought of - raise and spend
            13 or 14 per cent of the total revenue raised by all authorities in Australia. With
            payroll tax, that percentage will probably be higher. But, if we transpose to them the
            amount of $2, 930m which is in the Federal - Budge- as payments to or for the States and
            regard the Commonwealth, quite properly, as merely the agent in raising that money, then
            we have the interesting situation that the States raise or have raised for them and
            spend 41 per cent or more of the total revenue raised in Australia. They are therefore
            almost as significant a fiscal instrument as the Commonwealth, because with that
            adjustment the Commonwealth raises 49 per cent - less than half - of the total revenue
            raised in this country. Therefore I pose the States to the Senate not as mendicants and
            not as insignificant instruments but as real economic and social insruments, as indeed
            they should be. And I say that as a confirmed federalist. </para>
          <para>As the second of 8 main factors 1 refer to local government, which again is
            regarded, quite wrongly, as insignificant. I refer to the 901 municipal and shire
            councils in this country and to the semi governmental authorities. The 901 local
            government bodies raise the best part of $500m or $600m of the national revenue. They
            raise and spend about 5.5 per cent of all revenue. . If people regard that as
            insignificant, I hope they will not tell the farmer, the pensioner or the person on a
            fixed income that municipal and shire rates are insignificant. The semi-governmental
            authorities raise and spend $400m or $500m a year. As a third factor there is the
            Australian Loan Council - the parliament of the States and the Commonwealth on public
            works and debt servicing. That instrument currently is coping with &#167;2, 086m of
            expenditure. </para>
          <para>There is another very flexible factor, but one which makes an enormous impact upon
            the state of the Australian economy. I refer to the inflow of private investment capital
            from overseas. Last year this amounted to $1, 500m. So flexible is it that that amount
            was S400m to $500m higher than the amount in the year before. So significant is it that,
            if it did not exist, instead of having a favourable balance of payments and a strong
            currency Australia would have the reverse. It must therefore take its place as one of
            the great fiscal instruments that we have to put into the symphony orchestra, as it
            were, that we are now studying. </para>
          <para>I refer, as a fifth factor, to the economic parliament of Australia - the
            Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. This is a system which I infinitely respect and
            one which, by its decisions in wage fixing, by its decisions in fixing margins for skill
            and by the results of flow-ons and over-award payments, has a profound effect both in
            the redistribution of income in Australia - and I respect that - and upon the price and
            cost structure of the whole of our economy. I refer next to the central banking system
            which has such an enormous quantitative and qualitative control of credit within the
            community. May I refer also to the merchant banking system which is much misunderstood
            in its significance. Some 20 years ago the trading banks of this community handled
            94 per cent of all commercial credit; today the merchant banking system handles more
            than 50 per cent. The significance of that in terms of fiscal and social policies in
            this country should not be lost. T add as an eighth factor the Tariff Board and the very
            great significance of its policies. </para>
          <para>IT they were not enough, we have impacting upon us year by year the changing level
            of overseas interest rates, a factor which has brought this country out of isolation
            into a world in which we are subject to the effects of rising world costs. May I add
            that the present crisis in world currency exchange rates was caused by America&#39;s
            natural desire to adjust its very adverse balance of trade. </para>
          <para>In particular may I add the great crisis in Australia in the rural industries, the
            great and unpredictable fluctuations in rural prices and rural earnings. </para>
          <para>To make the symphony orchestra complete we add the challenge of the European
            Economic Community and its effect on our trade. I must say that I personally have great
            hopes for England and its future in Europe. I look forward to a strong EEC as one of the
            great hopes of stability in this world. Nevertheless I recognise the difficulties for
            our trade. </para>
          <para>With all these factors tending and contending, I think it fair, without platitude,
            to pay tribute to the Cabinets of the day, to the Treasury officers of the day, to the
            central banking officials of the day, for the fact that over the last few decades
            Australia has had a stability, of employment and of prices and costs, which is the envy
            of the free world. Although inflation is real and must be contended against,
            nevertheless ours is one of the lowest price or cost rising countries of all industrial
            countries. </para>
          <para>Although there is now a growing rigidity in Federal Budgets, there is in this Budget
            a particular flexibility. This is one factor that must be noted because there has been
            talk that, this being a deflationary Budget, it can and will cause massive unemployment.
            There is no need whatever for Australia to be talked into, scared into or led into
            massive unemployment. The fact is that there is S630m of domestic surplus in the Budget
            to be called upon at any point of time to maintain full employment in this country. I
            believe that we have shown that we can cope and that we will show again our ability to
            do so. </para>
          <para>The techniques in the structuring of a Budget can be regarded, depending upon the
            colour of your political spectacles, as being those of a modern day Fagin, a sort of
            legalised pickpocket, or if life is more rosy something of a crusading Robin Hood.
            Honourable senators may take that as they wish. The technique is to take from the people
            in one way and to give it back in another. Whether we meddle too much or whether we
            intervene too little is, of course, the clash of philosophy and, indeed, the very nub
            and hub of the argument that should be the Budget debate. </para>
          <para>Let me examine very quickly the Fagin or Robin Hood technique of taking, because
            there has been much talk in this chamber in recent days of the rich getting richer and
            the poor getting poorer. 1 remind the Senate that 60 per cent of the revenue to be
            raised by this Budget comes from direct taxes; 41.5 per cent is from personal income tax
            and 18.2 per cent is from company tax, as such. In a moment I shall examine how that is
            taken. The second and therefore remaining field is indirect taxation - customs, excise,
            sales tax - which takes something in excess of 27 per cent. It is in those 2 fields,
            with the addition of probate, gift duty and stamp duties, that the largest amount of
            revenue is raised. </para>
          <para>For those among us who happen to be motorists with a taste for beer or cigarette
            smoking, it is instructive to note that ou of every SI raised as revenue in this Budget,
            4.5c is raised from beer, 3.5c is raised from tobacco and 4.2c from motor spirit. So the
            poor motorist with a taste, however modest, for beer and smoking pays in addition to his
            other taxation 12.2c in every $1 raised and spend by the Government. </para>
          <para>If we are to examine whether we have a Robin Hood or Fagin technique, or whether we
            are ogres who are interested only in big business, perhaps we had better look at the tax
            schedules of direct taxation. 1 have done so for the latest that are available. </para>
          <para>In the 1969-70 tax year, which differs little in structure from the present one,
            75.91 per cent or three-quarters of all taxpayers, they being those who receive $4,000 a
            year or less, contributed 37.13 per cent of the taxes, so the three-quarters who were
            the lower paid contributed one-third or a little more of the taxes. In the centre, 21 per
            cent of taxpayers who had incomes between $4,000 and $8,000 a year paid 37.03 per cent
            of the taxation, so the 21 per cent in the middle incomes paid the same as the 75 per
            cent in the lower incomes. So much for the rich getting richer and the poor getting
            poorer. </para>
          <para>But if we can add to that, it is instructive to note that the remaining taxpayers
            comprise 3 per cent or 160,000 - not very many - and they receive an income of more than
            $8,000 a year. I suggest that $8,000 a year is a reasonably modest income and as such is
            not real wealth, in the usual sense. But Robin Hood is in existence here because this 3
            per cent of people paid 25.84 per cent of the direct taxation. For those who worry
            whether in some concessional allowance or in other ways someone in the higher bracket is
            receiving a benefit, I suggest that the way to achieve an equality in direct taxation is
            to look at the scale of direct taxation and to ask: Are we taking from those who have
            and giving to those who have not? The answer in the Government publication is clearly
            yes. </para>
          <para>On the expenditure side 70.6 per cent of all expenditure by this Government is on 3
            items: Firstly, payments to or for the States; secondly, the social welfare items of
            health, social services and repatriation; and thirdly, defence. If I may express the
            expenditure in cents in every dollar of revenue spent, the Commonwealth spends 33.2c in
            every $1 in payments to or for the States. One-third of the Budget - a figure which is
            rising - goes in payments to or for. the states. In addition, 23.2c in every $1 of
            expenditure goes to health, social services and repatriation, and 14.2c in every $1 goes
            to defence. The remainder, which is small, comprises 7.1c in the $1 for departmental
            running; 9.6c in the $1 for capital works and services; 4.1c in the $1 for payments to
            industry - a relatively small amount, as such - and 3.1c in the $1 to external aid and
            the Territories. That comprises the spending side. This is too superficial an approach
            because it fails to itemise these things, but this is not to suggest that there is not
            more to do. </para>
          <para>Arising out of that somewhat quant*tive survey there are 3 main levels of inquiry
            that I would recommend. Firstly, I believe that the time has come for the Commonwealth
            to initiate a comprehensive inquiry into the whole taxation system and its incidence on
            the incomes of the people. I believe too that the system of concessional deductions
            could do with a thorough re-examination. We stand for progressive taxation, and we
            should set up an instrument to translate that theory into practice. </para>
          <para>Secondly, I believe it imperative that we should do more than we have done already -
            we have done a lot - to strengthen the federal system. It is not enough merely to do as
            we have done in the Loan Council field. It is imperative that we should seek to
            establish a growth tax or growth taxes of a sufficient amount to eliminate the
            Commonwealth&#39;s reimbursement formula. There can be no federalism when there is a
            Commonwealth reimbursement grant. While it remains, what I would call the Oliver Twist
            syndrome will bedevil federalism. The begging bowl syndrome - asking for more - will
            continue while the opportunity is there to ask for more. I urge that we in this
            Parliament direct our wits to giving back to the States the only sovereignty that
            matters - the sovereignty of raising their own revenue so that they can be accountable
            for spending it. The dilemma of the people of Australia is that they do not know on whom
            or on which government to lay the blame for the defects that exist and the
            responsibility for the jobs that need to be done and are not being done. </para>
          <para>Thirdly, I believe it imperative that there should be a convention or conference of
            the Commonwealth and the States to undertake a major demarcation of functions as between
            governments. The Concrete Pipes case is a landmark in legal and constitutional history,
            and I know that the lawyers will be fascinated to see how much more power the
            Commonwealth has. I should like to see a situation in this Parliament similar to that
            which exists in the House of Commons where the question is not how much power we have
            and, therefore, to what level we can use it but rather that we see, within the power
            that we have, how little power we need to use to do our job. We should not be seeking to
            see where we can get more power. We should be seeing how we can decentralise functions
            and power in the best interests of the people of Australia, and that ls not an exercise
            in the seeking of power. In areas such as education and, in particular, health the lack
            of demarcation and the lack of our ability to say to the people: &#39;This is a State
            responsibility but that is a Federal responsibility&#39;, is a defect. </para>
          <para>Let me refer now to attitudes of mind. I believe that they have been divisive in the
            community. They are ugly and are inhibiting our national growth and national character.
            I reject the concept that in industry management and worker must be in conflict with the
            one wanting sweating and the other wanting idleness. I have seen this, not in any
            starry-eyed idealistic way but in practice inside industrial law. 1 believe that only in
            terms of teamwork can we grow richer. I hope that I have demonstrated something of that
            in the progressive scale, but I have not the time to dilate upon it. </para>
          <para>I reject the idea that profit and profitability are ugly things and that we should
            try to raid profit all the time so that there will be less and less. Unless industry is
            profitable there can be no industry except in a Socialist state, and no Socialist state
            has living conditions as good as those in non Socialist states. We should be mindful of
            that. </para>
          <para>Unless there is profit there can be no company tax at the rate of 47.5c in the SI.
            Unless there is profit there can be no tax upon dividends. </para>
          <para>I wonder whether anyone in this House knows that, contrary to the propaganda being
            preached today, the true ownership of industry in this country is becoming increasingly
            that of the Australian people. It is not being centralised in the hands of fewer people
            and organisations. The last figures released in relation to this aspect cover the
            situation in 1969. They show that of private investment in Australia in that year not
            less than 60 per cent came from life offices, superannuation funds and pension funds. It
            is popular sport in parliaments today to knock Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, but I
            remind honourable senators that the bulk of BHPs subscribers comprises superannuation
            funds and pension funds. Every time profit and profitability are reduced the
            Consolidated Revenue Fund is robbed. If we abolish company tax and tax on dividends what
            will be put in its place? I believe that profitability is a sign of health and a sign of
            progress in this community. It is the one way in which this community, as an egalitarian
            community, can grow richer. </para>
          <para>I do not stand for any section of the community. The people I represent are not
            measured by size of pay packet, by colour of shirt collar or by the nature of their
            religious devotion. Divisiveness is the evil of politics and I hope to do something to
            reduce it. </para>
          <para>I reject the idea that there is a conflict between rural and city interests. 1
            reject the idea that the farmer is rich and we should not care a hang about him. The
            people of the cities depend for their employment and income upon our rural industries
            which still return some 50 per cent of our total overseas earnings, the money we need to
            service our secondary industries. If we reduce that, we create the unemployment that
            some seek. </para>
          <para>Those who deride the farmer and say: Let him sweat; let him be more efficient&#39;
            fail to realise the significant fact that between 70 per cent and 80 per cent of all
            rural costs are not incurred on the farm. They are incurred off the farm. They are
            incurred in the purchase of machinery and vehicles, in income tax, land and municipal
            taxes, probate duty and - this is the highest cost of all - in freight. I would like to
            see a national inquiry into the matter of freight which constitutes some 35 per cent of
            the cost of all goods. </para>
          <para>I reject the concept that we -should be divisive as between city and country. It is
            the vital co-operative interest of the people of this community to ensure that this
            country&#39;s productivity is increased so that we all, including the farmer, will be
            better off. </para>
          <para>There is much 1 would have liked to have said. The challenges that are before us in
            the 1970s and 1980s are vastly different from those that faced us in the past. We talk
            about ecology and the quality of life. I do not see ecology as being the relationship of
            man to his environment. I recognise its importance but not its preeminence. The one
            challenge confronting this Parliament, the people of this country and the world
            generally is the challenge of the ecology of the relationship of man to man. How can we
            reduce conflict on an international level? How can we reduce conflict on a national
            level whether it be in industry, on the streets or in delinquency? The challenge is to
            be co-operative, not divisive. </para>
          <para>I have one great hope. I believe that in the vision of the future to meet the
            challenges of the future, the great solutions and the great motivations not being
            created by economic instruments will be created by a new philosophy of education. I
            believe that in rethinking our education, in rethinking our education research, in
            studying as our main subject not material science but man, we will come some way towards
            the solutions. It is high time man was less preoccupied with material science and more
            preoccupied with the only study that matters - man. I hope before I leave this
            Parliament to see in Australia an academy of human sciences which draws together the
            disciplines relating to the human being. I believe that then and then only will we get
            some help in the great task that lies before us. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President,</inline> 1 thank the electors of
              New South Wales for the confidence they have reposed in me. I thank my family and
              members of my Party for the support that they have given me over the years. Also, I
              thank members of this chamber for the encouragement they have given me in the few
              weeks in which I have been a senator. However, as previous speakers have indicated,
              this is Budget time and therefore I want to say a few words about the Budget. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In my view this Budget represents yet another major error of policy by the
            Government which is moving from mistake to mistake towards its early dissolution. Not
            only does this forlorn document chart the downward trend of this Government - it marks
            only too clearly the unfortunate future facing most Australians as a result of incorrect
            policies. The Australian Labor Party is not alone in condemning this Budget. It has been
            condemned by most editorial writers in the land - by spokesmen from employer, employee,
            consumer, rural, pensioner, ex-service and many other community groups. Only the
            Government parties are the reluctant supporters of this totally inadequate, unplanned,
            inept and sectional Budget. The Budget is not a routine affair. It should be the
            blueprint for the social and economic well-being of the nation. It should determine the
            guidelines for the ensuing year, for national development and set the pace for the
            sovereign States, for semi and local government agencies. </para>
          <para>The Budget will not halt inflation. It will exacerbate the position. Its failure to
            provide adequate funds for the other arms of government has already forced State
            governments to increase charges and raise new taxes and costs generally. It worsens
            living standards for the average person. It fails to provide funds for the myriad of
            community needs. The Budget perpetuates the regressive policies of the Government. For
            22 weary years the Government has deliberately encouraged expansion of the private
            sector while restricting expenditure in the public sector - the area where the needs
            &#39;of the people have to be satisfied by the States, local and semi-government bodies.
            The Government continues to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on a so-called defence
            policy basing such expenditure on outdated policies of fear and a misguided
            understanding of the evolutionary developments taking place in Asia. </para>
          <para>The Budget will not help the one million people who are in and around the poverty
            belt in Australia. Economists estimate that Australia will gain $3,500m in exports from
            the new mineral fields within the next 10 years. How will this mineral bonanza help
            pensioners, low income groups or those on superannuation or fixed incomes? The Budget
            fails because it does not re-direct this great new wealth of our country to the areas
            where personal and community needs are greatest. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr
              Justice</inline> Jimmy and Professor Downing of Melbourne University have estimated
            that 8 per cent of our people are financially insecure. Justice Jimmy went further and
            said there were 250,000 low income families in a self-perpetuating poverty belt. The
            gross inequalities in taxation not only persist, but grow worse. The Government refuses
            to levy a capital gain tax - a tax which would enable pensions and child endowment rates
            . to be substantially increased. </para>
          <para>The promises made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gorton</inline> in the 1969
            federal election for alleviating taxes on low and middle income groups have faded like
            tired memories. The parsimonious and blatantly partisan attitude of the Commonwealth to
            the States has already made a mockery of our medical and hospital scheme. Only in one
            State now - and there at the expense of other public needs - is free hospitalisation
            with us. lt is one of the casualties of the postwar years, i suggest that Government
            members and Ministers in particular converse with officials from welfare organisations
            like the Smith Family and the Red Cross and other charities. They would be amazed to see
            the unhappiness, the hopelessness, the loneliness and the hardships facing so many of
            our population - the absolute poverty that exists under all the superficial glitter of
            our society. They would find little to be proud of. </para>
          <para>On the other hand the newspapers&#39; financial columns tell another story - the
            massive increase in profits by the credit corporations, BHP and countless other major
            companies - the takeovers, the speculation on the stock exchange. As it has been for 20
            years, it is a case of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. Foreign
            companies take over our indigenous industries while the government, like </para>
          <para class="block">Nelson, turns a blind eye to the multimillion dollar corporations
            enriching themselves on our vital natural resources. The Budget provides no relief to
            the serious problems of land prices which rise faster than any young couple can save.
            Even in the perimeter areas of Sydney - the new developing areas - land prices have
            doubled in the past 4 years. </para>
          <para>The Australian people are weary of the struggle against rampant inflation. They are
            becoming aware of the tremendous social implication and consequences of the inflationary
            hurricane which is ripping away the savings of thrifty people, destroying family life
            and imposing hardships on all those who use their mental or physical skills to create
            the wealth of this country. It has been said - some reference was made to this by a
            previous speaker and I understand the words are those of Abraham Lincoln - &#39;A
            government should do only those things as a government which the people cannot do as
            well for themselves&#39;. It was these sentiments that gave impetus to the establishment
            of parliamentary democracy. Can we be confident that these objectives are being
            followed? Governments all over the world are setting themselves up above the people,
            abrogating the right to interpret what is best for the public interest. </para>
          <para>In many cases those in authority govern either by arrogance of power or by default.
            There are growing numbers of people in this country who believe this twin evil exists
            here. 1 believe there cannot be genuine democracy as long as parliament and the public
            are unable to obtain genuine, detailed and reliable information concerning every aspect
            of our national life. This information is not freely available. While governments rule
            instead of parliament, while a bureaucracy operates in place of an informed public
            opinion, there will be even more alienation of the people from the parliamentary
            processes. I think the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Daniel</inline> Ellsberg in
            the United States underlines the point that I wish to make. He was an established man; a
            hawk; an advocate of US involvement in Vietnam. Yet he like many other US government
            officials after a proper analysis of the Vietnam war, found that his government was not
            telling the American people the real facts of that war. It was a classic example of the
            result of a government not telling the real, story, of the people being not properly
            informed, of the government usurping for itself the right to interpret the public
            interest. Similarly, in our country, the truth is that neither Parliament nor the
            Australian people have been told the truth about the problems facing our nation. In many
            ways the art of politics has become the art of deception. People unfortunately are
            becoming disillusioned with the Parliamentary processes. More and more informed people,
            more and more young people are questioning the value of parliament. </para>
          <para>Let me say that I am a believer in the democratic processes - action by the
            parliament - action by the people - but I doubt the efficacy of the sham democracy - the
            superficial democracy that is claimed to be the foundation stone of our society.
            Democracy demands that a substantial proportion of the electors shall be informed,
            educated and actively involved in matters of public importance. They should be imbued
            with a sense of active and significant participation in the political life of the
            country. However, it is encouraging to see some growth in citizen involvement. In the
            field of conservation, preservation, pollution, environment, war and peace, and many
            other new social issues, growing numbers of people are not only concerned but also
            involved. Yet when people become concerned and involved on matters of conscience, the
            conservatives in our community, whether in government or in the media, cry out in the
            name of law and order. To hear them talk, involvement almost equals anarchy. They ignore
            the fact that change and conflict are as much an integral feature of human society as
            are stability and order. </para>
          <para>Today we can no longer claim that the predominant factor in our society should be
            stability and order. The world is changing so rapidly that yesterday&#39;s values do not
            necessarily apply today. For example, prewar the slogan was &#39;populate or
            perish&#39;. Today it has changed to &#39;populate AND perish&#39;. Demographers, social
            planners, men of learning generally never cease to warn us of the acceleration of change
            and the social consequences. Our scientists are constantly in the forefront of these
            warnings. One scientist went so far as to say that civilisation, fearful of effects of
            the nuclear bomb, would never use that weapon. He was more afraid of the grave
            deterioration in our environment, pollution and the destruction of resources. The
            sciences to which most of us looked to help mankind, might well bring destruction in
            their wake if people, and governments in particular, do not heed the effects of
            unrestricted, unplanned development and production. </para>
          <para>Many people today are overwhelmed by change. This thrust for change is having
            personal, psychological and sociological consequences. Unless the growth rate of change
            is controlled, society runs the risk of a nervous breakdown. The avalanche must be
            stopped or at least curbed. Planning is becoming almost as important as the air we
            breathe. Firstly we must learn to safeguard our human resources. This leads to the
            urgent need to plan , to conserve our national resources. Then there is the need to
            examine our spiritual and social values. </para>
          <para>As I see it, we live in times when all progress is measured in terms of the gross
            national product. Our GNP is our new god. We worship at its shrine. Development and
            production is more important than people. Everything has to be bigger and better than
            before. Every country aims at greater production, greater development, greater
            profitability - and in so many cases human values are forgotten. We have to recognise
            that the world is in the midst of its second major ecological upheaval. The whole of
            humanity, in one way or another, is switching from an agrarian to a highly urbanised
            society. This revolutionary change is taking place right before our eyes. Man no longer
            relies on the natural landscape to exist as he did for thousands of years. Now he
            employs technology to meet his needs. We have become an interdependent world community
            as a result of this evolution. However, our minds and our institutions are not yet
            adjusted to the new situation. Hence the conflict within our society. </para>
          <para>Population densities, in the East and West, are rising rapidly. For instance, in
            Manhattan 77,000 people occupy one square mile of territory. While we in Australia lag
            behind this volume, high density living is well on the way in many of our capital
            cities. </para>
          <para>The Budget, while making large sums of money available for subsidies to rural and
            secondary industries- and the wool subsidy seems certain to reach SI 80m - earmarks not
            one cent to study, control, appease or improve the urban complex. </para>
          <para>Urbanisation is the new phenomenon. It is radical, different, dramatic and fearful
            in its consequences. Urbanisation is the new ecological process. It determines the
            environment in which the major proportion of our population lives, changes all our
            previous human relationships and highlights the problems of individuals, communities and
            nations. On present trends, using New South Wales as an example, by the year 2000 the
            number of people living outside the major cities will be approximately 10 per cent of
            the population. This is in spite of all the talk and decisions about decentralisation.
            We are faced with the inescapable fact that tremendous city complexes are a permanent
            feature of our society. It is our obligation to ensure that cities therefore become an
            ecological success. To achieve this, however, there needs to be a recognition that
            massive public funds must be directed to build new urban technologies. In addition we
            must recognise that only a different approach to human relationships can solve the new
            technology needed to integrate man in the new densities within our cities. </para>
          <para>This requires a better educated, a less prejudiced, a less inhibited collective
            human mind to create the new technologies and institutions adequate to meet our
            population needs. In Sydney there are some 67 government agencies administering the
            affairs of State within that city. Every time a new problem develops - pollution, to
            give one example - a new government agency is set up to deal with it. This highlights
            the need for us to give greater consideration to what is taking place within our
            community. </para>
          <para>In our country there are scientists, planners and other public figures who are
            asking the inarticulate, unorganised and uninformed mass to be concerned. Professor

          <para>Our society is following the world wide pattern of western civilisation. Inflation,
            profiteering, the growth of monopoly, mergers foreign takeover of many Australian
            industries, all combine to worsen the living standards of the average Australian. As our
            rural income falls, people flock to the cities. Land prices skyrocket still further,
            accommodation is priced beyond the reach of young people and family life is seriously
            undermined. </para>
          <para>What is taking place under our very eyes is the silent demise of the family unit.
            Despite the great mineral wealth and the tremendous postwar boom in our exports, those
            that actually produce the wealth are substantially worse off. I say that after having
            regard to what has been said in previous debates in this chamber. A worker can no longer
            live on a single income. He must have 2 jobs, or be content to live on the poverty line.
            Hundreds of thousands solve their immediate economic problem by encouraging their wives
            to continue working. This in its turn contributes to pressures and tensions not
            experienced by previous generations. Yet the Liberal Government, impervious to what is
            taking place, carries on without a thought or a care. </para>
          <para>I believe it is our responsibility to study overseas countries&#39; experience so
            that we may learn from their tragedies. The postwar years have seen the acceleration of
            progress. Everywhere man is changing the environment. Until recent times his influence
            on the environment was not serious. Today, because he is now so numerous and
            technologically adept he not only endangers the environment but also he imperils
            civilisation. It is true that it is in the United States that the problem is most
            serious. There poverty, racism, congestion, war, crime and a rising incidence of dissent
            are shaking the very foundations of that society. It would be premature to suggest that
            the same perils now confront us in Australia. However, certain trends that should
            concern all governments are already evident in this country. I refer to the population
            decline in the rural areas, the growing congestion in the cities and the failure of
            governments to recognise the sociological problems accruing at a rapid rate as a result
            of urbanisation. Crises exist - whether or not this Government is prepared to recognise
            them - in education generally, housing, hospitals, sewerage, social welfare,
            accommodation, human relations and the decline in value of money. </para>
          <para>In the few minutes left at my disposal 1 shall deal specifically with the
            responsibilities of local government in respect of the environment. The people of
            Australia are probably unaware that the national government accepts little
            responsibility for environment. To an extent this is also true of a State government; it
            delegates the responsibility to local government. Local government is perfectly able to
            handle environmental matters providing it is given the financial resources. I am
            encouraged to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lawrie</inline> and other
            honourable senators speak about the problems of local government. I propose to
            specialise in these matters in this chamber. The Budget fails to provide any sort of
            meaningful help to local government to carry out its commitments. Right throughout
            Australia as, indeed, in all modern societies, the role of local government is
            increasing. Few aspects of our environment, our culture, our welfare, our way of life
            can be adequately tackled without involving local government. Yet the Federal Government
            continues to refuse to give local government adequate help either in the form of grants
            or sufficient loan moneys. Our society cannot properly function until the Federal
            Government recognises that it has to make grants to local authorities and to
            semi-government agencies. </para>
          <para>For 20 years the Federal Government has followed a deliberate policy of encouraging
            private sector expansion and restricting the public sector. The States and local and
            semi-government agencies have been affected by this policy. People have suffered as a
            result of the policy. In a Press release made on 29th April 1971 Warden L. J. Mooney,
            who is the President of the Australian Council of Local Government Associations, said: </para>
          <quote>

              and a better environment. They are looking to their local councils. But so far,
              councils have not been financially equipped to grapple with all that is required of
              them. </para>

            conference between the 3 arms of government in Australia so that a better financial
            arrangement could be organised. Twenty-two years later local government is still

            little or no regard to the ability of the property owner to pay rates. General hardship

            <para>It is with very deep and mixed emotions that I participate in the debates of
              this Parliament for the first time. I feel overawed by the obvious education of
              honourable senators within this august chamber. I assure honourable senators that I
              have not attended a university or a high school and, for that matter, I do not know
              that I can say that I have spent very much time at a primary school. But this does not
              mean that as a Senator from Queensland I am not
              able to cope. I have graduated through the university of hard knocks. My teacher was
              experience. However, I shall play the role which my State of Queensland, my race, my
              background, my political beliefs, my knowledge of men and circumstances dictate. This
              I shall do, through the grace of God, to the benefit of all Australians. For more than
              20,000 years my people have loved this country. They have appreciated its beauty and
              its capacity to provide for human needs. Throughout that long period my race developed
              many traditions and one generation has passed on to another a respect for these
              traditions. Traditions are preserved and honoured in the Australian Parliament also.
              The awareness of these traditions and the long and illustrious line of people who have
              upheld them in the interests of freedom and democracy makes me humble because I
              realise the privilege and the double responsibility which has been bestowed upon me.
              At the same time I am sure that honourable senators will agree that I could hardly be
              blamed if I confessed to a feeling of pride at this time. </para>
          <para>First and foremost I participate here as an Australian citizen. Through the valour
            of its fighting men in two world wars and by the vigour and skill of its leaders
            Australia has earned an honoured place in the world. As an Australian, I am concerned
            for the future of my country, for the welfare of its people and for the quality of life
            that they enjoy. However I am conscious of the fact that I am the first member of my
            race to participate in parliamentary proceedings. I am proud that, however long it has
            taken, this form of participation has been achieved. To those who took the decisions
            which resulted in my being here today, I proffer my thanks. I am very conscious of the
            fact that the opportunities which are now mine to share in the representation of
            Queensland would not have been mine if it were to for the resignation of Senator Dame Annabelle Rankin, D.B.E. Since 1947 she well
            and worthily upheld Queensland Liberal Party principles in this place, first as a
            senator and committee member and more recently as Minister for Housing. I am sure that,
            as Australian High Commissioner to New Zealand, she will further enhance her illustrious
            career.</para>
            <para>I turn now to the business before the Senate, which is, in part, consideration
            of the Government&#39;s Budget proposals for the 1971-72 financial year. As I understand
            it, the Budget is the most important business to come before the Parliament each year.
            It involves huge sums of money and has far reaching effects on every Australian - from
            the pensioner hoping for an increase in his or her fortnightly cheque to the
            manufacturer worrying about the impact of the budget on his undertaking. The
            Auditor-General and the Public Accounts Committee watch over accounting and expending,
            but in the final analysis electorates and States must rely on their Commonwealth
            parliamentary representatives to ensure that the economy runs as smoothly as possible,
            particularly at times such as these when inflationary pressures within and uncertainty
            without make long range predictions extremely difficult. I have no doubt that honourable
            senators have been able to devote much of their attention to this task, particularly
            since they adopted the practice of referring the annual Estimates to separate committees
            at which Ministers and their departmental officers can answer questions relating to the
            items of proposed expenditure. I have no doubt that in the course of this my short term,
            or an additional term according to the will of the citizens of Queensland, it will be my
            privilege to serve on these committees and in this way participate fully in the
            important discussions on proposed expenditure. </para>
          <para>There must be many ordinary Australians like myself who have struggled with the
            problems of feeding, clothing and educating a family and with trying to balance a
            domestic budget. Their minds must boggle at a national budget which has a total
            estimated expenditure of $8,833m, a sum which the Treasurer
            (Mr Snedden) told us is about $728m or 9 per cent greater than the Budget
            last year. The staggering size of the national Budget indicates the rapid rate of
            development of Australia. I am sure all honourable senators will agree with me when I
            say that I regret that there are problems presently facing rural industries, but I find,
            looking through the Budget, that the Government has recognised these and has provided
            for them by including payments to rural industries amounting to at least $275m. It is
            hoped that these problems will be overcome. Past growths suggest an even better and more
            prosperous future for this country in the days ahead. Having lived and worked in the
            western sections of Queensland, particularly on cattle and sheep stations, I am not
            unaware of or unsympathetic to the problems and heartaches faced by men on the land at
            this time. I assure the Senate that it is my determination that, during my tenure of
            office, I will be moving constantly through this area to enable me, by personal contact,
            to give aid wherever it is necessary. </para>
          <para>At some other time, either in this chamber or at committee meetings, I shall comment
            about several items in the Budget. At this stage I comment briefly about 3 items of
            expenditure set out in Statement No. 4 attached to the Treasurer&#39;s Budget Speech.
            Item No. 3 refers to the National Welfare Fund, the expenditure from which increased in
            this Budget by $217m to $ 1,694m. This figure includes increased welfare services in
            the form of pensions, maternity allowances, child endowment, unemployment and sickness
            benefits, rehabilitation services, sheltered employment allowances, funeral benefits,
            deserted wives benefits, personal care subsidy, national health services, nursing home
            benefits, handicapped children&#39;s benefits, payments to public hospitals for
            pensioners, homes savings grants and matters such as these. The Commonwealth
            Government&#39;s commitment for these expenditures is an acknowledgement of the right of
            every citizen to share in the prosperity of this nation. I relate the commitment to a
            portion of the most important speech of my career to date. I claimed that my experience
            of this world showed that 2 qualities are always in need - understanding and compassion.
            I stress that these attributes must not change because, if they do, the solution to the
            problems that we as a people face with regard to
            social services and particularly with regard to aged pensioners, the fruits of whose
            labours we enjoy today, will be all the more difficult to obtain. I believe that social
            services are not a charity to a less worthy section of the community. They are the means
            by which persons who have special handicaps or who are unable to join the work force
            because of age, domestic responsibilities or handicaps have a claim on the nation&#39;s
            resources. I believe that no longer is there any stigma or condescension about the
            receiving or disbursement of payments from the National Welfare Fund. </para>
          <para>Item No. 7 refers to the expenditure on Territories, excluding Papua New Guinea, and
            shows an increase of $40m. Item No. 10 shows an increase of $41m for Other Expenditures.
            Both items are of special interest to me because they include considerable sums for
            Aboriginal advancement, mainly for special programmes of housing, health and education.
            These 3 items are of supreme importance to the welfare and quality of life of all
            Australians, none more so than Aboriginals. Mr
            President, I crave your indulgence and the indulgence of honourable senators
            in that for a very short time all within me that is Aboriginal yearns to be heard as the
            voice of the indigenous people of Australia. For far too long we have been crying out
            and far too few have heard us. I stand humbly in the presence of honourable senators to
            bring to their attention what I believe to be the lot of those of my race in 1971. It
            would be an understatement to say that the lot of fellow Aboriginals is not a
            particularly happy one. We bear emotional scars - the young no less than the older. By
            and large we are unskilled with, here and there, a breakthrough. In early days we were a
            very simple people. My people had simple needs. We saw no need for agriculture or
            industry because nature provided our needs for over 20,000 years. </para>
          <para>Less than 200 years ago the white man came, I say now in all sincerity that my
            people were shot, poisoned, hanged and broken in spirit until they became refugees in
            their own land. But that is history and we take care now of the present while, I should
            hope, we look to the future. Following the advent of the white man came a transitional
            period which still exists today. Then began to appear the emotional scars; the
            psychological wounds became a torment from which by and large we have still not
            recovered. The Aborigines today find themselves drifting between 2 worlds, accepting
            some of the white man&#39;s virtues, but alas, also many of his vices, subconsciously
            retaining to some extent the intricate pattern of relationship, the wonderful gift of
            sharing one with the other to such an extent that it infringes on the laws of white
            society, or Australian society as we know it today. </para>
          <para>Whilst I commend the Government for its awareness of the need for improved
            programmes of housing, health and education, I want to take this opportunity to point
            out that in common with all citizens, Aborigines of Australia are most certainly not
            looking for handouts. They have suffered enough from the stigma of paternalism, however
            well intentioned it may have been. I am sure that they will respond to efforts being
            made to enhance their self-esteem, particularly through the programmes of social
            development and vocational and general education. </para>
          <para>I want to emphasise the urgency of greater Aboriginal participation particularly in
            the areas of social development and vocational and general education. I believe there is
            need for a programme wherein Aborigines, and not necessarily academically qualified or
            young Aborigines, but armed with understanding and compassion plus the ability to
            communicate, can be fielded to liaise with Aborigines and all relevant government
            departments and organisations working in the field today. </para>
          <para>I wish to make only 2 more points. Firstly I express my appreciation of what the
            Government is already doing to make pre-school education facilities available for my
            people. I appeal for even greater efforts to be made in this area, particularly by State
            governments as well as the Commonwealth Government. In case I appear to be biased on
            this subject I shall quote from a recent book by Mrs
            Lorna Lippmann. She wrote: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>One normally expects a deprived minority, living in poverty in a degraded physical
              environment to have a low educational standard. Obligingly, Aborigines live up to that
              expectation in every part of Australia. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>Professor D. W. McElwain, whose research into the cognitive ability or
            intelligence of Aborigines in Queensland is well known, has concluded as a result of a
            study of 1,000 subjects: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>There are no inborn or genetic limitations on the basic intelligence of
              Aborigines.</para>
          </quote>
          <para>Mrs Lip pm an also wrote: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Pre-schools are all important to ensure that Aboriginal children do not begin
              school impoverished as to language and background. Instruction within the school needs
              to be individualised and ungraded (so that the child will go at his own pace in each
              subject). Extra curricular activities should be encouraged so that the student can
              excel in some field of his own choosing and know the joy of learning, of creativity
              and of success. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>I turn now to consider Aboriginal enterprises. As Mrs Lippmann has pointed out, every able bodied person
            wants to succeed in some field of his own choosing and to know the satisfactions which
            come from creativity and success. Economically viable Aboriginal enterprises offer just
            these satisfactions. I congratulate the Government on the policy decision to further
            these enterprises and I appeal to those who are responsible for developing further
            policies and implementing them to use every means available to help them along.
            Australians are noted for their willingness to take a risk. I ask for a greater degree
            of gambling on Australia&#39;s indigenous population who, since the arrival of the white
            man, have to a degree gambled just on existing.</para>
           <para>It is to be regretted that art i facts
            which have been identified with Aborigines should now be mass produced overseas and
            imported into Australia at such prices and in such quantities that the indigenous
            manufacture of such artifacts as boomerangs is no longer economically feasible. I wonder
            whether it would be possible for some sort of tariff protection to be applied to
            boomerangs at least, so that cheap imitations from overseas would not undercut the
            authentic Aboriginal article in such a way that, as has occurred, it would be difficult
            to find anything but an imported imitation in retail stores and shops which cater for
            tourists.</para>
           <para>It may also be possible to bring down legislation to restrict the manufacture
            of boomerangs within Australia to those people who own it as their special heritage -
            the Aboriginal race. I have made inquiries about the possibilities of a patent over the
            boomerang and have been advised that as it is by no means a recent scientific invention
            it would not be possible for anyone to take out a patent for it. Likewise, I understand,
            the law of copyright would apply only to individual designs on a art i fact. I have been
            told that the word &#39;boomerang&#39; cannot even be registered as a trade mark as the
            term is probably too deeply entrenched in the English language to be legally registered
            now as distinguishing the goods of particular manufacturers or traders. If some solution
            to this problem can be found it may be one small way of fostering an Aboriginal
            enterprise which I know surely has considerable potential. </para>
          <para>Mr President and honourable senators, although my
            entering the Senate was a unique event in Australian history in that apart from being a
            senator for Queensland I am also an Australian Aborigine, I was not at all surprised to
            find that there is absolute equality. I thank you, Sir,
            and honourable senators for this, not on my own behalf but as a
            representative of the indigenous people throughout Australia. In conclusion I desire to
            clarify one point. From this year onwards who are to be termed the indigenous people of
            Australia? In my experienced opinion, all persons who desire to be so classified,
            regardless of hue of skin, and who have flowing in their veins any portion, however
            small, of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Island blood, are indigenous people. It does not
            necessarily follow that the degree of one&#39;s emotional scars matches the darkness of
            personal pigmentation or that the lightness of one&#39;s skin necessarily indicates a
            lessening of knowledge of and belief in Aboriginal or Torres Strait Island culture and
            tradition. </para>
          <para>I have listened earnestly to the debate on the Budget. I have heard criticism of the
            Government and I have heard favourable comment. I say sincerely that I am proud to have
            an opportunity to stand in the Senate. Perhaps it is a little too early for me to really
            play a very great part in the debate on the Budget. But I am proud to be here and I am
            proud of the fact that I have been accepted in the Senate as an equal by all other
            senators. That is what I want to see achieved in our wonderful country. We live in a
            wonderful country. Recently I gave an address, the title of which was &#39;This is a
            Grand Country&#39;. It will be a grand country only while those who sit in this chamber
            and in another place really and truly believe in this aim and work towards achieving it.
            I believe that we should forget our petty differences and really work for those who have
            put us here and have entrusted the nation to our hands. I thank you, Mr President, for the courtesy with which you have
            listened to me. I look forward to my association with my fellow senators. I trust that
            our deliberations will be, in fact, for the true welfare of all Australians. </para>

            <para>- I take this opportunity to congratulate all the new senators who have
              contributed to this Budget debate, and particularly <inline font-weight="bold">Senator
                Bonner</inline> who has just resumed his seat. I am sure that most of us realise
              that we have just witnessed an historic occasion. I am sure, too, that none of us have
              forgotten those few moments before we made our own maiden speeches. To be quite
              truthful, I was looking at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> when
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> was speaking, and 1 thought
              then: &#39;Here is a man who has a job to do, a unique job in the history of this
              Parliament&#39;. I think we all will agree that he has done it well; that in his
              maiden speech he has discharged his obligations to the people who put him here. Let me
              make this quick observation to him: I say in all humility that he has no need to feel
              humble in this place because many people who came from humble beginnings have made
              worthwhile contributions in this Parliament, and if he keeps in mind the 2 very
              important qualities to which he referred - understanding and compassion for the people
              in the community who need them - I am sure that he also will make a worthwhile
              contribution. </para>

          <para>The purpose of a Budget debate is to consider what the Government intends to do in
            the ensuing 12 months and also what in fact it should do in that period. Any government
            has only so much money to spend on the various aspects of the nation&#39;s economy.
            Because its resources are limited, it is necessary to determine its priorities in as
            rational and equitable a manner as possible. Notwithstanding the fact that our country
            is known as the Commonwealth of Australia, we find inequities in our income levels which
            bring comfort and plenty to some but hardship and privation to others. We members of the
            Australian Labor Party are conscious of the need to rectify these anomalies. We have, on
            repeated occasions, put before the Australian people proposals to remove the injustices
            that have been built into the Australian economic system during 22 years of Liberal
            government. We will continue to put those proposals to the Australian people, and we
            will implement them at the first opportunity in order to bring justice, both social and
            economic, to the Australian people. </para>
          <para>A Budget normally provides for an adjustment of the taxation levels or for taxation
            deductions. But are the adjustments made in this Budget equitable? Who will be the
            people who will gain, for example, by the increase in the allowable deduction for
            education expenses from $300 to $400 a year? I notice that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr
              Hudson,</inline> the South Australian Minister for Education, made a statement on this
            very point just recently. He called it a national scandal - and quite rightly. He showed
            the scales of deductions which would apply on various levels of income. A person with an
            income of $2,500 a year would receive a deduction worth $92; that is if he could
            possibly spend $400 a year on educating one of his children. For a person with an income
            of $5,000 a year, the deduction is worth $145. But for a person with an income of
            $10,000 a year, the deduction is worth $212. </para>
          <para>How could one possibly regard that as an equitable deduction? Despite the fact that
            education is crying out for more Commonwealth money, allowances of this nature are made
            to people on high incomes who, in fact, do not deserve them or are not in need of them.
            There are all sorts of demands by pensioners and low income earners of all descriptions
            who are far more in need of the sorts of things about which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> talked and to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator
              Bonner</inline> referred in his maiden speech; yet this is the sort of handout that is
            being made. It reminds me of the Budget of 1967 in which the maximum deduction in
            respect of life assurance premiums was raised from $800 to $1,200. Having knowledge of
            that field, I can remember who were the people one could get to increase their life
            assurance premiums to $1,200 a year - only people on very high incomes. </para>

              <para>- As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poyser</inline> says, that is not for
                the workers; in fact, it is not for the people who represent probably 80 per cent of
                the wage and salary earners in Australia. After all these years of Liberal
                government these inequities are not being removed.; they are being further built
                into the taxation system. Of course, it is up to the Australian people to make the
                decision at the next federal election. I instance that matter because it is a
                glaring example which shows that the present Government is not concerned with people
                on the lower incomes or with providing the compassion and understanding which have
                been referred to here tonight. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>The principle of the taxation system is simple enough. A government largely may
            determine how much it is prepared to spend in the public sector, in such areas as
            health, education, public works and defence, by the amount of the national income it is
            prepared to collect in taxation, either direct or indirect. There are 2 matters to
            consider here: Do we as a community pay enough, and is the money taken from those who
            can best afford to pay it? lt may seem strange to some people, but Australia is not a
            heavily taxed country on the basis of comparison with countries of comparable economic
            development. We pay taxes totalling 23 per cent of our gross national product; New
            Zealand pays 25 per cent: the United States and Canada pay 30 per cent; the United
            Kingdom and the Common Market countries pay 33 per cent; and Sweden pays 38 per cent.
            But, as a result of that, all those countries are able to pay better social services and
            to provide more of their national income for education, health and hospitals than we
            are. So the matter again is one of priorities. </para>
          <para>We have a crisis in education. Only just recently we were told by an authoritative
            body that an additional $l,400m will need to be found over the next 3 years for the
            education system in Australia. That, of course, is over and above what the Commonwealth
            and the States intend to spend in that period. Unless we are prepared to accept the fact
            that this money must be directed, at the Federal level, into further financial
            assistance for education, the education system must continue to decline. By contrast, we
            spend the enormous amount of $2,500m every year on buying and running our motor cars. In
            fact, that is not the total bill; that is what it costs us to buy them and to put petrol
            and oil into them. </para>

              <para>- What we are concerned about is not the tax on those things but looking at the
                priorities for investment of the moneys that are available in the community. The
                sort of question we have to consider is whether our cars are more important than our
                children. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Little</inline> wants us to invest
                more money In our motor cars than in our children, that may be acceptable to him but
                I assure him that it is not acceptable to the Opposition. What we are endeavouring
                to do is to provide assistance for those sections of our community which, in fact,
                need it most. Professor Downing, the Ritchie Professor of Research in Economics at
                Melbourne University, in a paper that he wrote for the &#39;Australian Economic
                Review&#39; for the first quarter of this year, discussed some of these aspects of
                income tax. Much of his paper is the result of a great deal of work in this field.

          </continue>
          <para>Professor Downing would be one of the authorities on public accounting and taxation
            in Australia. He makes reference to the fact that certain salary incomes are being
            raised all the time, that these are not salaries in the low income bracket but in the
            higher income brackets. He comments that the unions which represent mostly the lower
            income people in the community are compelled, as a result of this pattern, to seek
            increased wages through the arbitration system. One of the arguments used is that people
            in the middle income bracket cannot be taxed any more and it is necessary to give them a
            greater increase tn salaries all the time to compensate for the taxation level. It is
            interesting to look at some of the figures referred to by Professor Downing. A table
            which appeared in the Australian Economic Review&#39; for the third quarter of last year
            shows that the average pre-tax middle income was 35 per cent above the national average
            in 1967-68 and retained the same differential after taxes had been deducted. If we go
            back to 1962-63 we find that the comparable pretax average income was 31 per cent above
            the national average, but that after tax it fell to 27 per cent above. In 1955-56 the
            pre-tax average income was 23 per cent above the national average and after tax it fell
            to 20 per cent above. These figures suggest that the average middle income is not being
            unduly squeezed by inflation or by the tax burden. Professor Downing goes on to make
            this point. </para>

              <para>- Obviously the trend <inline font-style="italic">k</inline> in the wrong
                direction and this is the point that Professor Downing is making. 1 have heard
                honourable senators opposite during this Budget debate making comments about people
                in the trade unions. I am not defending trade unionists all the time; they make
                their mistakes, just as we all do. Sufficient to say that this is the very point
                made by Professor Downing, that this trend forces the unions to make increased
                demands for wages. This is the point thai Professor Downing is getting at when he
                says: . . the tax system . . . relies loo much on indirect taxes which bear
                particularly heavily on lower income groups who have to spend all or most of their
                incomes. The personal income tax system provides wide opportunities for avoidance
                through deductions, income-splitting, income deferment, and the transformation of
                taxable income into tax-free capital gains. Union leaders, and workers generally if
                they think about it, know very well that these opportunities for avoidance are
                virtually confined to those with property and who enjoy incomes from sources other
                than wages and salaries. </para>

          <para class="block">I am pleased to see <inline font-weight="bold">Senator
              Webster</inline> nodding his head in agreement. It is quite true that the lower income
            earner is compelled to use a greater part of his income on goods which incur sales tax,
            so in fact he is not able to benefit from the escape clauses which exist through the
            whole of the taxation system for higher income people and for companies. For people in
            that category all sorts of lurks are available, as we who are members of the Senate
            Select Committee on Securities and Exchange have seen exposed, one after the other, over
            the past 12 months. I am not criticising the Government specifically on that point
            because nobody else knew what was going on. Sufficient to say that these inbuilt means
            of escaping taxation have been allowed to continue under this Government for ali these
            years, and this has been at the expense of the lower income earners. </para>
          <para>I should like to refer briefly to just one comment that was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> during his maiden speech. It is not my
            intention to be critical of that speech, especially as it was a maiden speech. In fact I
            think the speech was extremely well constructed and extremely well presented. However, I
            certainly disagreed with the philosophy underlying what he said and I take particular
            issue with his comment that an income of S 8,000 a year is in fact only a moderate
            income. I wonder whether the honourable senator realises just what $8,000 a year means
            to the ordinary Australian. To the average Australian it is by no means a moderate
            income; to him it is an enormous income. In the last 3 years sections of the Public
            Service on higher incomes have had increases from $175 a week to $230 a week - an
            increase of $55 a week. Compare that with the situation of a fitter whose wage in 1968
            was $51 a week and whose wage today is $65 a week - an increase of $14. These are the
            sorts of factors that are the realities of life for the great majority of wage earners. </para>
          <para>When we think in terms of $8,000 a year and all the problems of inflation that we
            have in Australia, we would probably be better off if we imposed a moratorium on all
            incomes over $8,000 a year. People earning in excess of this amount are simply not in
            need of increases of this nature. The people on lower incomes are far more deserving of
            increases, right through the whole spectrum of social services. This is where we come to
            the crunch. We talk about increases in social service pensions, education payments and
            child endowment, but if we take note of the sort of thing that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Ehrlich</inline> was talking about a week or so ago it seems
            that somewhere someone must say: This far and no farther&#39;. Right through the whole
            company structure we see these injustices built into our system. For example, the
            Australian Guarantee Corporation has been paying a dividend of 15 per cent for the past
            20 years or so and so many other organisations are earning interest rates which have the
            effect of pushing up the cost structure all the time. </para>

              <para>- If I have time I shall come back to that interjection, but at the moment I
                want to deal with another matter. During the debate there has been reference to
                Commonwealth and State relations. In my speech last year I dealt with matters
                concerning departmental spending in the various States, with particular reference
                to Tasmania. Again I want to draw to the attention of the Government the fact that
                the levels of departmental spending in the various States are inequitable. There
                appears to be no machinery whereby the Commonwealth can look at the whole picture of
                Commonwealth departmental spending in the various States, the level of private
                investment in secondary industry, that is, private spending in the various States,
                and interest repayments of the various States. In the financial year 1969-70 the 2
                main States. New South Wales and Victoria, with 64 per cent of. the Australian
                population, attracted 60 per cent of Commonwealth departmental spending. That
                expenditure was roughly comparable with the population of those States. By contrast,
                South Australia with 9.3 per cent of the population, received only 6.5 per cent of
                Commonwealth departmental spending. Tasmania with 3.13 per cent of the population
                received only 2.21 per cent of Commonwealth departmental spending. Taken in
                isolation, these factors may not add up to very much but they have application when
                compared with the level of building activity in secondary industry. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>For the 9 months ended 3 1 st March this year 73 per cent of building approvals for
            factories - this is the real indicator of secondary industry in Australia - went to New
            South Wales and Victoria. In other words, 73 per cent of the money being spent on the
            building of factories in Australia will be spent in New South Wales and Victoria.
            Despite the fact that South Australia has 9.3 per cent of the population, that State
            will receive only 5 per cent of that expenditure. Tasmania will be lowest with only 1.5
            per cent of that expenditure. I have been unable to ascertain, because no-one seems to
            know, whether there is any machinery whereby the Commonwealth looks at the situation as
            a whole and sees that certain moneys are being spent in certain directions. Obviously
            New South Wales and Victoria are doing extremely well at present despite what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Askin</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline>
            Bolte may say. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bethune</inline> in Tasmania and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dunstan</inline> in South Australia obviously have a very good
            case for a more equitable distribution of Commonwealth expenditure. </para>
          <para>Looking at the annual interest payable per head of population on Government
            securities on issue as at 30th June 1969 we find the same situation. In New South Wales
            the amount owed to the Commonwealth per head of population was $32. In Victoria it was
            $31, in Queensland $32, in South Australia $48, in Western Australia $43 and in Tasmania
            $77, the average for the 6 States being $36. If, for example, Tasmania was paying the
            average, the $30m it is paying would be halved to $15m. No effort appears to be made to
            even out expenditure. I believe that that is a responsibility of the Commonwealth.
            Individual departments cannot do it nor should they be expected to do it. There should
            be some machinery by which the Commonwealth would look at this matter. I think it was
              <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> who referred to this aspect during
            the course of his speech. I agree with him. From memory, he advanced some very good
            reasons why the Commonwealth should act. Suffice to say that there is no overall picture
            of what the Government and private interests are doing to maintain a reasonably
            equitable level of development in the various States. </para>
          <para>I refer now to child endowment. A <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Derek</inline> Stone
            of Hobart wrote a letter to the Hobart &#39;Mercury&#39;, and I think that the facts
            contained in his letter should be written into the records of the Parliament in the hope
            that possibly the Minister at some later time may be able to clarify the situation.
              <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Stone</inline> claimed that he had checked with the
            Department of Social Services and had been assured that the situation he raised was
            correct. He referred to the case of a family with 8 wholly supported children. Under the
            new child endowment rates, when the eldest school child turns 16 the endowment cheque of
            that family drops by $7. However, with a family of 2 wholly supported children the
            endowment cheque rises by $2 when the eldest school child turns 16. That situation seems
            to be totally inexplicable. It further illustrates the kinds of anomalies which have
            crept into the social services structure. I believe the situation as outlined by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Stone</inline> to be true. It is evident that the Government has
            not given proper consideration to the aspect he has raised, and 1 hope that during the
            course of this Budget debate one of the Ministers in this chamber will give an
            explanation of how this kind of situation has arisen. </para>
          <para>The Budget that we are discussing is typical of those which have gone before it. It
            is the last - possibly the second last - Budget that this Government will bring down.
            Thereafter the Budget will be brought down by a different government. Then the kinds of
            anomalies and inequities to which we have become accustomed will be removed from the
            Australian scene. </para>

              high office of President of the Senate. I am sure that he will uphold the dignity of
              his predecessors and will enhance the reputation of the Senate. To you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President,</inline> 1 offer my congratulations on your
              elevation. Knowing you personally, I know that you will provide the President with
              very valuable assistance. I pay tribute to the officers of the Senate who have given
              me a considerable amount of help in the short time that 1 have been here. They give us
              so much help that we sometimes take it for granted. I am pleased to return to Canberra
              after an absence of 18 months. It is like returning home even though I have changed
              residence and will have to become accustomed to the furnishings which are of a
              different colour. However, I feel honoured to represent my State in the Senate and
              will do all that I can to promote the interests of South Australia during my term in
              office. </para>

          <para>The Senate has undergone a significant change following the introduction of the
            committee system. It is to the credit of all senators that this change has occurred, and
            I congratulate all concerned in it. I know that the Government has been encouraged in
            this move by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator
              Murphy)</inline> and by the Leader of the Australian Democratic Labor Party <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Gair).</inline> No doubt the new system will enable the
            Senate to fulfil more efficiently its role in disseminating information to the people of
            Australia on departmental functioning and the areas of concern that are referred to the
            committees by the Senate from time to time. However, knowing the additional burden that
            this system placed upon the shoulders of my South Australian colleagues during the last
            recess - I refer to Senators Buttfield, Davidson, Laucke and Young - I believe that we
            should watch the situation carefully to ensure that a proper balance is preserved
            between our function as a House of the Parliament, our newly found standing committee
            role and our responsibility to the electorate because, however important those former
            activities may be, we must realise that sufficient time has to be allowed us to service
            the electorate. </para>
          <para>I have listened tonight with great interest to 2 maiden speeches. One in particular
            impressed me greatly. I refer to that of my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner.</inline> The sincerity he displayed should give his own people
            confidence and certainly will enable him to represent not only his own people but also
            the people of Queensland generally with sincerity and dedication of purpose. I do not
            think I have ever heard such an incisive and thoughtful treatment of a Budget than I
            heard from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> tonight. 1 pay tribute to
            him. If rn now to the Budget that is before the Senate. Budgets have been subjected to
            adverse criticism from time immemorial. This Budget has suffered a similar fate. It has
            been said that this Budget adversely affects the average person but, of course, all
            Budgets affect the average person, either for good or ill, because most people in
            Australia are average people. I believe that this Budget is a responsible one, bearing
            in mind the delicate economic situation prevalent in Australia, today. Budgets are never
            framed lightheartedly and this one has been presented only after a great deal of thought
            and consideration by the various departments concerned in co-operation with the
            Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden)</inline> whose difficult task it has
            been to allocate priorities. This is a task that I find extremely unenviable. However,
            there are several areas to which </para>
          <para class="block">I feel the Government must give more attention, and I will briefly
            comment on some of these. </para>
          <para>In the field of social services I believe that the Government can be proud of what
            it has tried to do over the last 22 years. There has been a progressive increase in the
            basic rate pension during that time. The married pension rate was increased by $1 a week
            per person to give a combined maximum pension of $30.50. The single pension rate was
            increased by $1.25 to bring this pension to $17.25 a week. These increases, with the
            supplementary provision made soon after <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McMahon</inline>
            became Prime Minister, clearly indicate that the Government is paying some regard to the
            welfare of the older people and the needy in our community. Other provisions under the
            heading of social welfare also have shown a welcome advance. Despite all this I am of
            the opinion that the Government should and must recognise the urgent need for a complete
            reassessment of our attitude to all areas of social welfare in the light of the
            requirements of the 1970s. I realise that this is a costly aspect of government
            consideration and I can understand any government approaching the subject with caution. </para>
          <para>I was pleased that the Minister for Social Services, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr
              Wentworth,</inline> submitted a plan for a national superannuation scheme to the
            Cabinet for consideration. There are obviously good reasons why the Cabinet was
            unwilling to accede to his proposal at this stage. Although the details of his
            recommendations are not known to me I wholeheartedly support this idea in principle as I
            believe that this Government has the expertise to work out some satisfactory scheme in
            co-operation with private enterprise insurance companies that would present the people
            of Australia with a basic superannuation scheme that would guarantee them a reasonable
            retiring allowance. Some weeks ago I was asked to join the Pension Reform Campaign
            Committee. This is a non-political organisation. I was approached by a Reverend
            Hollingworth of the Brotherhood of St Laurence, and I agreed to join this Committee
            because I support the main objective of this organisation. It requests the Federal
            Government to establish an independent inquiry into the rationale of all our social
            security systems, covering the methods of payment of pensions and other forms of benefit
            for the aged, widowed, sick, deserted wives and unemployed, with terms of reference wide
            enough to permit all interested parties to put forward constructive ideas for new
            approaches. It would include an examination of the adequacy or otherwise of existing
            pensions, and of possible alternative methods of both fixing and financing them. </para>
          <para>This inquiry should be independent of departmental and government influence. There
            have been other such committees formed in the past. We have seen evidence of the
            Government taking notice of the recommendations of such committees and implementing some
            of the recommendations, particularly with regard to national health. I am sure that the
            establishment of such a committee would bring forward many worthwhile suggestions that
            could be implemented by the Government. I respectfully ask the Prime Minister and the
            Minister for Social Services to implement this idea as I feel it would provide a sound
            basis for government planning for future advances in this important field. </para>
          <para>I would like to congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Negus</inline> on
            his maiden speech. He obviously is a strong advocate of the abolition of the estate and
            succession duties. But I think it would interest him to know that he is not the only one
            who has advocated such a move. In South Australia a month ago the Liberal and Country
            League at its conference passed several motions relating to this subject. These motions
            were that special rural rebate from succession duties be granted irrespective of the
            form of ownership of such rural land; that we move for the total abolition of succession
            duties; that the matrimonial home be excluded from all calculations for succession and
            estate duties; that we call on the Federal Government to abolish Federal estate duties
            and request the LCL to find alternative sources of revenue to reduce the burden of State
            succession duties and report back at a later date. These are some of the motions which
            indicate that there is a lot of support on this side of the chamber for the measures
            proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Negus.</inline></para>

          <para class="block">With regard to estate duties, it is not as though we are dealing with
            a large amount of money. In fact, in a Budget of some $8,000m to $9,000m, we are looking
            at a figure of about $5m. The figures that I was looking at a while ago relate to the
            1968- 69 financial year. I think this will suffice for the purposes of this
            illustration. In that year there were 4,999,423 taxpayers in Australia and the amount
            collected by the Government from 1,061 estates was $5,996,000 or an average of $5,651.
            My worry at the present time is the tremendous burden that this places on the
            comparatively few rural estates that can quite easily run into 6 figures. In view of the
            depressed state of the rural industries I believe that the Government could well afford
            to abolish this duty. It is rather extraordinary, when one works it out, that if this
            duty were abolished and a measure were introduced in the form of direct taxation it
            would mean that only something like $1.20 would be paid by each taxpayer per year. I do
            not think this is a very considerable sum when lt is taken in the general context of the
            Budget. </para>
          <para>I was pleased to note that the Budget allowed for an increase in the operational
            subsidy paid to the Royal Flying Doctor Service. An additional $135,000 per annum is
            being made available. This brings the new allocation for the next 3 years to $315,000.
            This would seem to be a fairly generous increase if it were not for the fact that the
            capital grant of $170,000 per annum that has applied for the past 3 years is to be
            continued at the same level for the 1971-74 period. This is clearly inadequate because
            the immediate requirement for capital projects, including aircraft, is $3.25m for the
            current triennium. As an example I would like to draw the attention of the Senate to the
            need of the Northern Territory section of the Royal </para>
          <para class="block">Flying Doctor Service for the immediate replacement of 2 twin engine
            aircraft, which are over 10 years old, to service this vast area. These aircraft would
            cost in the vicinity of $200,000 each. This seems to dwarf what would at first sight
            appear to be a generous Commonwealth Government contribution to this most important
            medical service for the people living in the outback areas of Australia. </para>
          <para>I do not think a lot of us realise just how important this service is. Mining
            operations are carried on in the remote areas. Stations employ many people. There are
            thousands of tourists who travel through the Northern Territory. There are thousands of
            people who travel on the transcontinental and the north-south railway line. All of these
            people are afforded the protection and the mantle of safety that is provided by the
            Royal Flying Doctor Service. At present the Royal Flying Doctor base at Port Augusta in
            South Australia is planning to employ an additional medical officer to serve an area of
            over 300,000 square miles. At present the service is in the unique position that it
            relies on the local medical practice to guarantee the present doctor&#39;s salary. This
            situation cannot be allowed to persist and I am convinced that the Commonwealth and
            State governments must take a more intensive interest in providing sufficient money to
            ensure that adequate salaries, aircraft and other technical aids be provided so that
            this organisation can continue to function efficiently. </para>
          <para>Another aspect concerns medical centres located throughout the remote areas of
            Australia which are currently run by organisations such as the Australian Inland
            Mission, the Bush Church Aid and the District Bush Nursing Society. All of these
            organisations have dedicated personnel and are constantly meeting the frustration of
            finding money to provide the services necessary for this important medical facility. The
            calls on this service in Australia have increased to the extent where it is virtually
            impossible for community organisations to raise voluntarily this sort of money.
            Certainly they are in a position to raise funds to provide for additional am entities for
            the outback hospitals run by this service. I would not suggest for one moment that this
            aspect of their operations should not continue. I know that my wife and friends work in
            a dedicated fashion to support the fund raising projects of this organisation. The South
            Australian section at present is in the financial position of having liquid assets of
            $49,000 and liabilities of $38,000 leaving $11,000 as working capital. This would enable
            that section of the organisation to meet expenditure necessary to keep the service
            running for just over 1 month. The service relies on the efforts of the Royal Flying
            Doctor Auxiliary which raised $16,000 in South Australia during last year. The South
            Australian section is hopeful of benefiting from legacies to this dedicated cause. It
            seems to me that as the Flying Doctor Service extends throughout South Australia, the
            Northern Territory, Western Australia, New South Wales and Queensland, the Commonwealth
            Government should assume the major responsibility for providing additional finance. </para>

                responsibility for providing the additional finance and if possible assist in the
                medical staffing of the various bases throughout Australia. For this reason I ask
                the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Sir Kenneth
                  Anderson)</inline> to give this matter his serious consideration. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I would like to touch now on a matter that is of very great significance to South
            Australia, that is, the excise payable on wine. I am sure that the Government did not
            fully realise the penalty that would be placed upon the grape growers in South Australia
            when it introduced this measure last year. 1 believe that the Department&#39;s advice on
            this matter was not fully considered and that the Department did not realise the full
            implications of this impost that has caused considerable damage to one of the few viable
            rural industries in South Australia. It must be remembered that South Australia produces
            about 70 per cent of the wine produced in Australia and 90 per cent of the brandy.
            Consequently this industry is relatively unimportant to other <inline font-style="italic">States but</inline> is of vital significance to South Australia.
            Although I was not in the Parliament at the time when this measure was introduced I
            wrote to the Minister for Customs and Excise and objected to this measure stating that I
            believed that the grape growers would suffer as a result and requested that he consider
            the introduction of an ad valorem sales tax on wine which would impose a greater penalty
            on the more expensive bottled still wines and sparkling wines and would relieve the
            pressure being placed on the bulk wines which form the greater volume of sales. The
            grape growers are the ones who will suffer most of all as a result of the imposition of
            this measure. I have some facts which demonstrate how serious this measure has proved to
            be, or will prove to be, to almost 3,000 growers in the River Murray area. </para>
          <para>The following is an actual example of a grower delivering 110 tons of grapes
            annually to a co-operative winery. In 1970, from June to December, he received $2,690.
            Since the impost, for the period June to December 1971 he will receive $1,579 which is a
            reduction of $1,100 in this grower&#39;s receipts for the 6 months period and this could
            conceivably grow to well over $2,000, probably nearer $3,000, if the present decline in
            sales should continue. The problem is more serious still in this case, which is similar
            to many others, because the co-operative takes an average of 6 years to complete payment
            for each vintage. Payments are made to the growers as the wine is sold. From figures
            available to me the total sales for 1970-71 will be down by about 2 million gallons
            compared with 1969-70 and it would appear that this will grow to a 4 million gallon
            deficit on projected sales for this year. It is obvious that a large surplus of wine
            will be created if the Government does not do something to arrest this trend. The
            position could best be relieved by removing or drastically reducing the tax on wines,
            particularly in the bulk area. </para>
          <para>A similar situation developed during 1964-65 in South Australia. At that time the
            State Government under <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Playford lent the
            industry $750,000 to set up a separate pool at McLaren Vale to process surplus grapes.
            The present State Government maintains - and I believe that it is quite reasonable for
            it to adopt this attitude - that the present situation has been directly created by the
            action of the Commonwealth in introducing this excise. It is understandable that the
            South Australian Government should not accept the responsibility for this situation.
            Another area that must receive some urgent consideration by the Commonwealth is the
            matter of imported wines and brandies. 1 was surprised to learn that 22.6 per cent of
            the brandy sold in Australia is imported. Therefore, I am sure that we should afford
            some protection against overseas interests which are jeopardising the sale of our local
            product. I understand that this matter may be referred to the Special Advisory Authority
            and 1 urge the Minister to take positive steps to see that the intrusion of imported
            wines and brandies does not continue to add to the problems of the grape growers of
            Australia. </para>
          <para>I would like to pay a tribute to the efforts being made by the honourable member for
            Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Giles)</inline> in regard to this matter as he has
            worked strenuously to protect the interests of grape growers in his electorate and is
            continuing to make vigorous representations to the Government in an attempt to correct
            the position. Also, I would like to compliment <inline font-weight="bold">Senator
              Laucke</inline> for the support he has given the honourable member for Angas on this
            matter. 1 assure him of my full support in his endeavours to bring relief to the
            industry. I am of the opinion that unless the Government takes some action this tax will
            bring about the economic downfall of <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> formerly
            viable industry and subject the grape growers to a fate similar to that suffered by
            other sections of primary industry, necessitating future costly government subsidy. I
            notice that the Treasurer in his Budget Speech made reference to the report of the
            inter-departmental committee which was established to inquire into the facts of this
            impost, as a result of which he has decided not to alter the existing duty on wine.
            Although 1 have not seen this report 1 find it incredible that the inter-departmental
            committee did not advise some reduction in the excise. The Treasurer also has undertaken
            to keep this matter under review as he has admitted that some growers in the industry
            are experiencing serious problems. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister received a deputation of South Australian Government senators in
            Adelaide last month. I was pleased that he gave an undertaking that he was prepared to
            review this matter if the grape growers continued to suffer as a result of the decline
            in sales, lt is comforting to know that he is prepared to have another look at this
            question. This indicates that the Government will not disregard tha plight of the
            industry. </para>
          <para>I have tried to be constructively critical about these matters which I consider are
            of extreme importance. I congratulate the Treasurer on the general responsibility of his
            Budget, which I am sure will stabilise the economy. I hope that when he presents his
            next Budget it will be possible to introduce many additional forward-looking measures
            for the benefit of the people of Australia. </para>

              Aboriginals desire to have done for their benefit is another matter. The honourable
              senator is a member of a conservative party which has been in government for 22 years
              but has not made any advances towards the enlightenment of the Aboriginal people. I

          <para>I congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> on his speech

            about it was that it was not made in 1900 because it contained all the conservative
            shibboleths that one could possibly collect. Every conservative thought that was present
            in the Australian community at the turn of the century was presented to the Senate again
            tonight. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> will listen
            with enlightenment to the debates in this place and that he will educate himself to the
            standard of the necessities of 1971. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline>said that he regretted that there had
            to be confrontation between employers and employees over industrial conditions. He
            belongs to a party that seeks to uphold arbitration and the very basis of arbitration is
            confrontation. The Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Aci provides that there
            must be disputation between the parties before the court can move. In the context of
            Australia today we find that the trade union movement moves out of the system of
            arbitration and into the system of direct negotiation simply because it does not have
            its reasonable demands satisfied by the arbitration system. Arbitration never was
            welcomed by employers until the post-war period when they learnt to use- it for their
            own benefit. Honourable senators will realise this if they trace through the history of
            industrial relations in Australia. They will find that the employers in industry never
            waited at any time for the evolution of conditions in order to satisfy themselves but
            went to legislation to suppress the workers. The whole history of arbitration proves
            that it has been an instrument to be used by the employers. I am not discounting the
            fact that when the first Conciliation and Arbitration Act was introduced it took away
            some of the oppression of the working classes, as it was designed to do, but very
            quickly it was used to oppress the workers - so much so that the employers sought to
            abolish in 1929 and so much so that the workers of today have abolished it by direct
            negotiation. </para>
          <para>Yet today we find that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr
              Snedden)</inline> places practically the whole blame for the inflationary spiral that
            exists in Australia today upon the demands by working people. I think it is safe to say
            that if honourable senators read the history of the Industrial Revolution they will find
            that the worker never has been accepted as a member of the community of the world. I
            have books available in my room, if honourable senators want to read them, about the
            coal mines in England 200 years ago and the evolution of the suppression of the working
            classes in the factories. Indeed, if honourable senators like to travel through the back
            blocks of Queensland and New South Wales they will find headstones marked on gum trees
            where workers were shot down by the police while fighting for ordinary decent
            conditions. Arbitration has not done a great deal for working class people other than to
            guarantee a minimum wage. </para>
          <para>It is quite useless for the Treasurer, who comes from a working class family, to
            stand in his place and say that the bulk of the fault for the inflationary spiral in
            Australia today lies with the activities of work ing class people. When an Australian
            Government has to blame the working class people for its economic ills, to denigrate
            their leaders as being un-Australian and say that it is they who seek to destroy this
            country, then it is time that the people of Australia had a look at the Government. </para>
          <para>This Government does nothing more than it is compelled to do to satisfy the
            legitimate demands of working people in this country. Does this Government attempt in
            any way to control the other excesses that exist in our community? How can a government
            get a balanced economy when it will tie only one end of it, and that is the wages end?
            Has there been any attempt to curb monopolies? Has there been any attempt to curb price
            inflation? Has there been any attempt to curb profit inflation? No; because these are
            the instruments of so called free enterprise. These are the instruments that this
            Government is dedicated to protect - the interests of capitalism and the interests of
            mono pol ism. Only last week the High Court of Australia threw out the Restrictive Trade
            Practices Act and told this Government what it could do if it had the will to do it
            Whether the Government will have the will to do it will be a matter for this Senate to
            examine at a later date. I deplore the fact that all that the Treasurer can think of to
            solve his troubles is to criticise the working class. The working class has given so
            much to this community. It has given much more than the people who sit on the front
            benches in this Government. Very few of those Government members have contributed
            anything to the advancement of Australia. Working class people have contributed greatly
            to Australia&#39;s economic life. I shall now deal with some parochial matters. </para>

              <para>- 1 would think that it is more than 30 per cent. I shall take the honourable
                senator&#39;s figure of 30 per cent. But I ask him this question: If BHP makes a
                profit of about $70m this year, what was the ratio of its profit at the beginning of
                the 10-year period when compared with the fact that there has been a 30 per cent
                spiral in inflation and a 27 per cent increase in prices? When people start to
                handle figures they should analyse them right through. 1 did not hear the table of
                prices which the honourable senator presented in relation to Bourke&#39;s Melbourne
                Pty Ltd. I do not know what it was but I gather from the way he spoke last night
                that he was setting out to prove that Bourke&#39;s store was no cheaper than any
                other store. He selected a given number of items to prove his case. That does not
                prove anything, because one can select anything and make a case out of that. Unless
                one takes the whole range of goods one cannot complete one&#39;s case. I know people
                in Western Australia who shop at Tom the Cheap Grocer. They say: &#39;Well, Tom the
                Cheap Grocer is no cheaper than any of the other grocers such as Charlie Carter Pty
                Ltd. Their goods are the same price&#39;. But. people fail to realise that the
                existence of Tom the Cheap Grocer forces the other commodity sellers to reduce their
                price to his price. He has not gone up to their price. This is probably the case in
                Victoria as far as Bourke&#39;s are concerned. I ask the honourable senator to
                remember these things when he starts to compare prices. </para>

          <para>At the present time there is an application before the Commonwealth Government for
            the entry of Trans-Australian Airlines into some of the intrastate routes in Western

            notice that Ansett Transport Industries Limited is not thereafter mentioned; it is
            MacRobertson Miller Airlines - deals with the application by Trans-Australiann Airlines
            for a licence to operate over the MacRobertson Miller Airlines network between Perth and
            Darwin. It claims to present a conclusive case for rejection of the application, based
            primarily on the public interest and the financial stability of the airline industry.
            The case deals exhaustively with the consequences of the intrusion by TAA, and its
            effect on the existing service, li de mon states that intrusion would be financially
            unjustifiable, damaging to the public interest, and industrially disruptive, lt
            discusses various implications and alternatives, and argues for complete rejection of
            the TAA application. </para>
          <para class="block">MacRobertson Miller is no longer a pioneering airline. It is part of
            the Australianise network of Ansett Transport Industries. The Government constantly
            tells the people of Australia that it believes in a 2- airline policy, lt believed in a
            2-airline policy when it gave Ansett Transport Industries the right to operate in
            competition with TAA between Brisbane and Darwin. This action immediately took from TAA
            &#163;200,000 of profit which it was making on that run. The Government believed in 2-
            airline competition on some of the internal routes in Queensland which were profitable
            to TAA. It allowed Ansett Transport Industries into those areas. The Government believed
            in a 2-airline policy when it allowed entry into the routes in Western Alice Springs and
            Alice Springs-Darwin routes. </para>
          <para class="block">What reason did Ansett give for wanting to enter these routes? When
            TAA pleaded that competition would only reduce the amount of income to the operator at
            that time Ansett&#39;s answer was: &#39;Competition will generate its own traffic&#39;.
            Now that TAA makes an application to enter the Perth-Darwin route, in this document
            Ansett Transport Industries - 1 refuse to say MMA - tells us what this proposed action
            will do to the services in Western Australia. The booklet has a name. It is called:
            &#39;Airline Policy and the Public Interest in Western Australia&#39;. There are some
            interesting figures in this booklet. I do not want to go into them. But I shall give an
            illustration of how this document is prepared in order to convince people that it would
            be bad for TAA to be allowed into this area. I shall read from page 14 of the document.
            I know that the Minister tor Civil Aviation <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator
              Cotton)</inline> has a copy. 1 find that on the Perth-Darwin run over an 18-month
            period ending 29th May 1971 Ansett Transport Industries carried a total of 4,606
            passengers, a weekly average of 57 and an average of 9.5 a flight. On the Perth-Derby
            run the total number of passengers over the 18-month period was 5,346, an average of 68
            a week or an average of 3.5 a flight. 1 do not know whether the legislation covering
            airlines requires them to present statistics to the Department of Civil Aviation, but I
            have a photostat copy of a page out of the statistics of Australian regular air
            transport services for the year ended 30th June 1970, which would include a considerable
            portion of this 18-month period with which the submission of Ansett Transport Industries
            dealt. I find that on the Perth-Darwin run the passenger load factor is 66.5 per cent or
            an average of 9.5 a flight. </para>

              <para>- I am talking about the Perth-Derby run. It has a weight load factor of 69 per
                cent. Before anyone can take any notice of the presentation of the so-called facts
                and figures in this booklet, there should be a proper examination of them. I say
                only that because I do not want to take too much of the time of the Senate. It is
                interesting to note that, in summing up, the submission of Ansett Transport
                Industries states: taa&#39;s current application should also be rejected on the

          <para class="block">One of the strong arguments used in this document is that the
            operations of Ansett Transport Industries in Western Australia no longer attract a
            subsidy from the Commonwealth Government, except on the station run in the Kimberley
            area, which is regarded as a developmental run. This is true. The simple facts are that
            Ansett Transport Industries moved out of the subsidised runs and continued with the runs
            that were not subsidised, leaving the subsidised or low profit runs to the commuter
            services. It diced them to someone else. The Commonwealth Government still pays
            subsidies to the commuter services. There was a transfer of subsidies from one operator
            to another, not any managerial expertise on the part of Ansett Transport Industries.

            chasing one another through the Australian skies. To protect Ansett Transport
            Industries, TAA must not be allowed to enter the PerthDarwin run, &#39;the essential
            matter being that there shall be competition only when this is demonstrably efficient
            and economical&#39;. Who decides this? The profits from MM A will be wrapped up in the
            commercial aspects of AT I. Ansett Transport Industries is not bound to disclose its
            profits to the Commonwealth Government unless it is using a Commonwealth guaranteed
            overseas loan for the purchase of equipment. Even then the Government will not demand
            from it an examination of its books. Under the relevant legislation, if AT I has a
            Commonwealth guaranteed loan, it must make its books available. I have yet to know when
            the Commonwealth has asked ATI to make its books available. </para>

                do likewise? The agreement expires on 30th September this year. Then the Government
                will have to make up its mind whether it will allow TAA to operate in Western
                Australia. It would certainly not be economic for the Commonwealth to incur
                significant unnecessary expenditure to expand many of the facilities provided by the
                Department of Civil Aviation. I agree that the provision of such facilities is very
                expensive for the Government, but I remind honourable senators that Ansett Transport
                Industries is still operating at some airfields in Western Australia where the

            intrusion by TAA would have serious industrial consequences including the displacement
            of 35 Western Australian pilots by pilots who have been recruited largely in the eastern
            States. What a lot of hogwash that is. Both Ansett Transport Industries and TAA will
            take their pilots and other staff from wherever they can get them providing they are
            competent to do the job required of them. It is not a matter of where they are employed
            in Australia. Where did they originate? How long have they been in Western Australia? Is
            it not time that someone examined these matters? They were probably imported into
            Western Australia to work for MacRobertson Miller Airlines before the takeover by Ansett
            Transport Industries. The same process could easily be repeated with TAA. How is this a
            reason for TAA not to be allowed to operate within the State? </para>
          <para>I urge the Minister to look very closely at the application by TAA so that that
            airline is given a fair go. There should not be a repetition of the situation in 1957.
            At that time TAA had completed an agreement with the Hawke Government of Western
            Australia. TAA was waiting only for the signatures to be put <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> the agreement when it was instructed by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Paltridge,</inline> who was then Minister for Civil
            Aviation, to break off negotiations. I do not want a repetition of that. If TAA has a
            good case to enter the Western Australian routes it should be judged fairly and
            impartially. </para>

              <para>- 1 would think so. When I first read the editorial I thought the bath had been

                disability, but I found out that it was not. I am not so concerned about that. These
                people will dig back into history as far as they can go in order to denigrate
                members of this Parliament. I have just about run out of time but I wish to
                illustrate the increases that have taken place at the Hotel Kurrajong. Members of
                Parliament requiring bed and breakfast there pay an increase of 30.7 per cent, while
                their daily and weekly rates have been increased by 24.4 per cent. Shared
                accommodation, for bed and breakfast, has been increased by 38 per cent: on a daily
                and weekly basis the increase is </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para class="block">
            <inline font-style="italic">Budget</inline>1971-72 28.4 per cent. The weekly rate for
            shared accommodation for members of Parliament is $48.50, while single accommodation is
            $54.75. The charge for single accommodation for a public servant has been increased by
            15 per cent to $29.40, while shared accommodation has been increased by 12 per cent to
            $26.90. 1 know that there are public servants who stay at the Hotel Kurrajong and who
            receive very much more in salary than I do. But these rats will continue to attack
            members of Parliament. I say quite confidently that they are rats. </para>
          <para>I want to go a little further because members of Parliament have not had an increase
            in salary since 1968 but these poor people who have had these charges imposed upon them
            have received increases since 1970 - the time of the previous increase in tariffs at the
            Hotel Kurrajong. Officers in the Third Division have received an increase in salary, on
            the average, of 16 per cent. The figures are as follows: For class 1, 16 per cent; for
            class 2, 16.3 per cent; for class 4, 16 per cent; and for class 10, 19.1 per cent. Yet
            these people talk about the inflationary spiral. 1 will be asking more questions about
            this matter during the consideration of the Estimates. My time has expired now. I would
            have liked to have had much more to say about it. 1 want to tell the people that members
            of Parliament who stay at the Hotel Kurrajong and those who stay at Brassey House do not
            receive any privileges. I have been staying at the Hotel Kurrajong for 12 years and I
            have never received one privilege. I am not complaining about the accommodation that 1
            have there. But I object when people say that the losses incurred by Commonwealth
            hostels are caused by members of Parliament staying in these hostels when they are not
            so caused and when the rates for public servants are very much lower than those for
            members of Parliament. It will not be long before there are not any members of
            Parliament staying at the Hotel Kurrajong. Then let us see how profitable it is at
            $29.40 a week. </para>

            <para>- lt is with a great sense of privilege and responsibility that I rise in this
              chamber this evening to deliver my first speech in the national Parliament, i am very
              pleased that I do so following my fellow Western Australian and old friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harry</inline> Cant. I must say that 1 have a greater
              affection and respect for the nineteenth century and many of its attitudes than he
              expressed tonight. Perhaps that is one reason why I enjoyed many aspects of his
              speech. I also am very pleased to have been present in this chamber this evening to
              hear the maiden speech of my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator
                Neville</inline> Bonner. I agree entirely with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator
                Wriedt,</inline> who followed him and who said that it was a most historic occasion,
              lt is one of great significance not only for this Parliament but also for the national
              life of Australia. I am very pleased that I have come into the Senate at the same time
              as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> and that I am sharing a room
              with him. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>For most of my adult life I have been preoccupied with the study and practice of law
            and politics. It is for that reason that I feel a great sense of opportunity and
            responsibility in being a member of the national Parliament. If one has not an
            overpowering desire to be loved or even respected by one&#39;s fellow men, an interest
            or life in the law and politics is one of great satisfaction. But I am sure that the
            satisfaction I will receive by pursuing that profession in the national Parliament will
            outstrip any satisfaction I have received previously. </para>
          <para>It has been my opportunity to serve for a short time in a State Parliament. It was
            in that experience that I developed some views on the role of Parliament and some
            reforms of Parliament on which I would like to speak briefly in commencing my speech
            this evening. I must say that already I have noted very great contrasts for the better
            between the short experience I have had of this Parliament, and particularly the Senate,
            and my experience as a backbencher in the State Parliament of Western Australia. That
            Parliament, in the time I served in it, had not come to terms in any way with the
            reforms that obviously 8 September 1971 are required in a parliament in this day and age
            in order to make it a meaningful institution and to enable it to perform the
            constitutional and historic role it has evolved. The Western Australian Parliament, in
            the time I served in it, had no standing committees whatsoever and had no liking even
            for select committees. lt is obvious - I do not wish to dwell on this - that the move of
            the Senate into the work of its committees, and particularly of the standing committees
            it is now setting up, is a momentous development for the institution of Parliament. I am
            looking forward with great interest to playing a part in this development. I am looking
            forward particularly to the experience of seeing the Estimates Committees in operation
            shortly. However, I believe that the reform of the role of Parliament extends much
            further than simply committee work, f believe that far too many people enter Parliament
            without having a proper conception of the duty and role of the parliamentarian himself
            or herself. They come into Parliament, perhaps, with too strong a desire to become
            Ministers. I believe that when one comes into Parliament that is one&#39;s essential
            responsibility and that even those members of Parliament who from time to time are
            serving as Ministers must still bear the essential role of a member of Parliament, even
            in that capacity. </para>
          <para>Another vital role which we must evolve and to which I propose to give great
            attention is the close scrutiny of Bills, as they are presented, to ensure that they
            meet the prime requisites of legislation in that they do not provide for wide
            discretions in the Executive and as far as possible they create specific obligations or
            confer specific benefits. In this way I believe that the Parliament can, even with the
            pressures of this age in which we live, go a long way towards performing its historic
            and fundamental role as the instrument to control the Executive Government. But apart
            from the role of Parliament, I believe that we need to evolve at least another
            institution to protect the rights of the individual in the community. </para>
          <para>I believe that it will be necessary in the future, much more than in the past, for
            Parliament to create administrative tribunals of a semi-judicial character - whatever
            one likes to call them - which will be available to provide rights of appeal for the
            citizen against decisions of the Executive Government, insofar as those decisions are
            concerned with private rights or obligations conferred by legislation. I refer
            particularly, so far as this Parliament is concerned, to rights under our social
            services legislation. This, I believe, is a classic case where Parliament is conferring
            individual rights, but under a very wide discretion. In cases of this kind I think the
            proper instrument to control the administration of the legislation, insofar as it
            affects the individual citizen, is some form of administrative appeal tribunal, rather
            than try to control it through the traditional forms of Parliament itself. </para>
          <para>I turn now to the subject of Western Australia which I have the honour to represent
            in this Senate. I believe that it is a tradition in a maiden speech to make some
            reference to one&#39;s electorate. This is an outstanding opportunity that is given to
            me in these circumstances because of the enormous impact, not only on Western Australia
            but also on the national life of Australia, which development in Western Australia has
            made in recent years. Until quite recently an old story about the industries of Western
            Australia told of the industries being 4 in number - wheat, wool, gold ?nd gold
            stealing. When one thinks of the incredible change which has taken place in the economy
            of Western Australia one realises that that story now has very little application. The
            development which has taken place in Western Australia is probably now accepted as a
            truism in this Parliament, or perhaps I should say even in this Parliament, because West
            Australians sometimes think that the development that has taken place in their State is
            not appreciated or understood throughout the rest of Australia. Nevertheless I make no
            apology for referring to it in this chamber, even though it must be well known to
            honourable senators. I do so because I believe that there are a number of important
            lessons that we should learn from it, lessons that we in this Senate may well apply to
            the growing need for development of this character throughout Australia. </para>
          <para>Unlike many other sentiments that have been expressed recently in this Parliament,
            and indeed in this chamber this evening, my belief is that we are only at the threshold
            of development in Western Australia and are only just embarking on a very great era of
            economic reconstruction. We hear a great deal about rural reconstruction today, but I
            think the matter goes further than that. We are undergoing a fundamental reconstruction
            of the whole economy of this nation. The West Australian experience in recent years has
            been really a microcosm of the development which we will see to a much greater degree in
            the years ahead and in which we in this Parliament will have to take much greater
            interest, providing a great deal more leadership as a national parliament and a national
            government than has been done hitherto. </para>
          <para>One of the outstanding features of this development is that it has been carried out
            essentially through private investment and by private enterprise. That is something
            which I believe, and I am sure everyone on this side of the House believes, is of great
            importance. However, the development has been carried out by these great private
            developers and investors under very strict government guidelines as to the public
            purpose of the development, its direction and the national goals and public interest to
            be achieved from it. I would commend to honourable senators a number of the West
            Australian Acts of Parliament which have given legislative force to the agreements
            entered into by that Government with these companies which are carrying out the
            development because they have been and are a great model for the type of guideline which
            should be laid down for this class of development. </para>
          <para>Another feature of the development is the fact that the agreements insist upon the
            development resulting ultimately in the creation of great regional centres of population
            and a steady increase in the processing of the minerals that are being extracted. A
            third notable feature of this development has been the contribution that it has made to
            decentralisation. We hear much these days about the need for decentralisation and I
            fully support the principle of decentralisation. However, I believe that
            decentralisation cannot be imposed artificially or by simple legislative fiat; it must
            be related to industrial opportunities for development as they have occurred in these
            great regional areas of Western Australia, firstly, in recent years in the Pilbara,
            which is the iron ore province; secondly, in an area where we are now just on the
            threshold of development, thats in the nickel belt which was the old eastern goldfields
            area centred on Kalgoorlie; and also in the other great regions of development. A
            notable one with which this Parliament will be very familiar because of the national
            contribution is the Ord River valley. I have mentioned already what is probably the most
            outstanding feature of all this development. It can be summed up as the enormous and
            fundamental impact that it is having and will have on the whole economy of this nation.
            I think it is timely that I should be saying this in the Parliament this year when our
            overseas earnings from the export of iron ore will almost certainly, in view of wool
            prices, exceed our overseas earnings from wool. In my view that too is a most historic
            occasion in the life of this nation. </para>
          <para>This development has brought wilh it, and will continue to bring with it, many
            social and political problems. It is to this area that we in this Parliament will have
            to address ourselves to an increasing degree. As I have said, following the
            decentralisation of people into the new towns that have arisen in these regions we
            already are faced with growing problems in the fields of health, education, town
            planning and so on. Attention should be directed immediately to the problems of health
            and education. Last week when I was in Kalgoorlie I learned that in the nickel belt in
            the eastern goldfields region there is now a population of more than 30,000 yet in that
            area of something like 40,000 or 50,000 square miles there are only 5 doctors, including
            those engaged by the Royal Flying Doctor Service. There is also a deficiency in the
            field of education. There is no high school north of Geraldton although the State
            Government is proposing to build one in that area. But one high school will be of very
            little use in that vast area of Australia which in fact represents more than two-thirds
            of the State of Western Australia. Scattered over that region are towns with populations
            of 4,000 or 5,000, and the communities are hundreds of miles apart. Those are some of
            the problems which it is impossible for the State Government to tackle alone. The
            Commonwealth Government which receives such enormous benefits from the development which
            has occurred, and which is in accordance with our basic national policy of
            decentralisation, will have to take a greater interest and make a higher contribution. </para>
          <para>I turn now to some of the aspects of national development to which 1 believe the
            Commonwealth Government should direct its attention. Like other honourable senators, I
            have heard it said constantly - in fact, it was said in this chamber this evening - that
            the issue of development is dead; it is old hat; it is 19th century stuff, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cant</inline> might call it. The problems facing us today
            are different from those which confronted us in the past. For example, we have the
            problems of overpopulation, pollution and so on. Although those problems might exist in
            the great urban conglomerations on the coastline of this nation, they seem to be rather
            strange and hollow when one moves around a State such as Western Australia. Surely those
            who are concerned with the problems of pollution and overcrowding in the cities, with
            all the undesirable features associated with them, should see in this great opportunity
            for national development in the regional areas of Australia the answer to those
            problems. The decentralisation of industry and industrial development as part and parcel
            of our mineral development indicate clearly a way of overcoming the problem of
            pollution, at least, although many other problems are dragged in which we have to
            tackle. </para>
          <para>What purpose is served by allowing the natural resources that exist in Australia - I
            am thinking now particularly of my own State of Western Australia - to remain in the
            ground unused? It may be that the rate of use of our resources has to be considered in
            the long term but that is an international problem and one that certainly does not seem
            to have application to us. It is no solution to the problem of world over-population to
            allow these resources to remain in the ground unused. </para>
          <para>In the future the Commonwealth Government must play a much more prominent role in
            the field of national development. In the past the Commonwealth seems to have confined
            itself largely to the provision of grants or loans for certain specific projects. I pay
            great tribute to the Commonwealth for what it has done in that regard. We in Western
            Australia have been the main beneficiaries of this policy. In saying that, </para>
          <para class="block">I have In mind particularly the standardisation of the rail gauge from
            Kalgoorlie to Kwinana, and the Ord River project. But the Commonwealth&#39;s actions in
            those fields have been the result largely of pressure from State governments. The
            Commonwealth has acted on an ad hoc basis. No national plan of development seems to have
            been followed and no national goals seem to have been set. </para>
          <para>It is time now that we took the lead in this field. The Commonwealth might well
            consider setting up a national development advisory council to draw upon the great
            wealth of talent and experience that exists in the men who have played a very prominent
            part in the development which already has taken place. Their views should be obtained
            regularly by a body such as an advisory council which then would look at long term goals
            in this field. The Commonwealth might well consider, too, setting up a national
            development fund into which an allocation of money could be made each year by the
            Budget. That money then would be available to finance not the great and glamorous
            schemes such as the standardisation of rail gauges and the Ord River project but the
            smaller schemes that arise from time to time. The money would be available also to
            overcome a shortage of funds on one scheme or another. I do not have in mind a project
            involving $40m or $50m; 1 have in mind a project requiring only a few hundred thousand
            dollars or perhaps Sim. A small outlay might mean the development of a tremendously
            profitable investment if made at the right time and in the right place. A fund of that
            kind would be of great advantage to people concerned with development projects. </para>
          <para>The time allotted to me is drawing to a close, and I must apologise for not having
            mentioned specifically any of the features of the Budget. However the great objectives
            of the Budget are undoubtedly to contain inflation, to provide better distribution of
            resources and to improve social services. I believe that in the long term there is only
            one way of meeting these great social demands that we have - the proper demands of this
            community for things such as improved social services, the abolition of poverty as far
            as we possibly can as a Parliament, the provision of better housing and better
            education, and so on. These things can better be provided by policies directed to
            increasing the total wealth of this community. The only way in which that can be done is
            for the Government and this Parliament to give the lead in the development of economic
            industries in the future - ones which will provide the best economic return as far as
            the growth and wealth of this nation, is concerned. </para>

            <para>- I rise to refer to a matter that was raised originally on 19th August when
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> asked a question of the newly
              appointed Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Greenwood)</inline> in
              relation to whether the law could be altered to provide that naturalised Australians
              shall be treated for all purposes as Australians and not be liable to deportation or
              cancellation of citizenship except, say, in cases of substantial fraud in the
              application for citizenship. In his reply <inline font-weight="bold">Senator
                Greenwood,</inline> after pointing out that he would look at the matter, said that
              his inquiries would be facilitated if some concrete examples could be given to him. I
              think it is significant that in addition to being the Commonwealth Attorney-General,
                <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> happens to represent in this
              chamber the Minister for Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr
              Forbes).</inline></para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>During the course of the very excellent maiden speeches delivered by the new
            senators tonight I heard the word egalitarian and others used in connection with our
            society. I think that the question to which I am referring comes under this civil
            liberties syndrome. In discussing this matter I will use as examples one or 2 leading
            trade union officials who were born out of Australia, relate that to past history and
            then refer to one or 2 utterances that were made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator
              Dame</inline> Annabelle Rankin when the 1969 Citizenship Bill was before the Senate. I
            wish to point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood,</inline> as a student
            of industrial history, that at the height of the serious maritime strike in the 1920s it
            so happened that the 2 maritime union leaders were of Scandinavian and Irish ancestry.
            The government of the day amended the Crimes Act to provide for deportation. 1 do not
            know of any cases of trade union officials being deported. However, I start off on that
            point. </para>
          <para>Most honourable senators have been to numerous naturalisation ceremonies where
            emphasis is placed on privileges and responsibilities. None of us disputes that point,
            but I am developing the argument that it was good enough in the 1950s for people to be
            guaranteed full employment and reasonable housing when they acquired citizenship. But
            when we take it a little further, whatever our degree of priorities in this society
            today, some people find civil liberties irksome and some people argue that when
            parliamentarians advocate a reform they are agitating and rocking the boat. I know that
              <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson</inline> has been to many citizenship
            conventions with me and he is fully aware that what new citizens want in society today
            is different to what they wanted in the 1950s. This is the age of the gall up poll, the
            spot check. </para>
          <para>Like everybody else, in the last 12 months I have made inquiries in relation to
            present day requirements for many people who were born out of Australia. I have
            consulted people in the trade union sector of the community such as Bill Nowak,
            Secretary of the Victorian Branch of the - Pastrycooks Union and Henry Pietracci, a
            senior official of the New South Wales Health and Research Union, the former being of
            Polish origin and the latter of Italian origin. They, like any other trade union
            official, were adamant that while nobody has any latent fears about standing up for what
            he believes in, there is a sort of second class standard as far as Australian
            citizenship is concerned. Maybe some fiery editor will, in the middle of a dispute,
            suddenly say: &#39;Of course, he could be deported.&#39; It may be that I am developing
            a synthetic approach. This is something that has not happened. A one-time very
            illustrious President of </para>
          <para class="block">Mexico said that it was preferable for people to die on their feet
            than to live on their knees. That is the point that I make in this regard. </para>
          <para>As far as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood,</inline> as Attorney-General,
            is concerned, this problem may involve only a small sector of the community. I am
            referring to trade union officials born out of Australia. The same situation could apply
            to somebody in the heart of a rural group, lt could apply to vegetable growers or
            poultry farmers who were not born in Australia. If they have Australian citizenship
            conferred on them there should not be that latent fear because of their backgrounds. I
            think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> would agree with me that the
            solution to this problem would require only a minor modification of the Crimes Act. This
            would be a practical gesture to the requirements or the attitudes of people in ethnic
            groups in Australia who have taken on Australian citizenship. If 1 took my argument a
            little further <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> may appreciate it
            better. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr John</inline>Ducker, a senior trade union official who has
            figured prominently in the Australian Council of Trade Unions Congress was born in Hull
            in Yorkshire. As 1 interpret the Crimes Act at the moment, if he was involved, as he is,
            in many industrial disputes and if the Attorney-General had a vicious streak - I do not
            refer to any particular Attorney-General - because be was born outside Australia he
            could be shipped back to Britain. To my way of thinking, if a person becomes an
            Australian citizen he does not expect privileges within the law but he wants to be
            treated like everybody else. I have heard interjections from prominent legal senators,
            such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> about equality within the
            law. I have heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> espouse that cause.
            We could test the sincerity of the Government by seeing whether it adopts a suitable
            approach to this matter. </para>
          <para>In speaking about civil liberties 1 have referred to 2 trade unionists. I might also
            mention a colleague of my leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy.</inline> I
            refer to Bill Jegerow, a prominent Sydney solicitor of Ukrainian origin. All of these
            people feel that a change is opportune. I feel that the significance of the question
            that was levelled at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> stemmed from a very important Federal Labor </para>
          <para class="block">Party conference held earlier this year in Launceston. At that
            conference item 24 of our law report was adopted unanimously. The proposal was that
            naturalised Australians should be treated for all purposes as Australians and not be
            liable for deportation or cancellation of citizenship except for substantial fraud in
            application for citizenship. 1 hearken back to the point that we all tell various people
            from Europe to participate in the mainstream of activity, whether it be a Parents and
            Citizens Association or one of these other groups that 1 speak about. 1 have instanced
            paid union officials. If we go beyond these people, it is amazing that when there is an
            industrial dispute we suddenly realise the responsibility of shop stewards. In relation
            to this reaction of people I could refer to people like Joe Bizjak, an Australian
            Workers Union rank and file activist, and Vince Martinak, an Australian Railways Union
            State councillor. These people are married and have children going to Australian
            schools. They feel, rightly, that what is requested is a simple reform. If they become
            involved in any fracas with the law, let the law give them a fair trial and impose
            whatever sentence is applicable. </para>
          <para>To go back into history, in 1969 this Senate adopted the 1969 Citizenship Bill. In
            speaking for the Opposition I said that by and large it was a step forward, but in doing
            so I quoted the criteria that was applied by the late President Kennedy when, as a
            senator who specialised in immigration matters in the United States Senate, he pointed
            out that any immigration policy should be one that is generous, fair and flexible. I
            would like to take this theme further and refer to the latter part of the debate on the
            Citizenship Bill which took place on 28th Mav 1969. During this debate I drew attention
            to people who had been refused naturalisation and 1 included a lengthy table of
            rejections. In reply the then Minister for Housing. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator
              Dame</inline> Annabelle Rankin, who represented the Minister for Immigration, said
            that of course citizenship is a matter of privilege. She went on to say that the
            Government believed it is properly a matter for ministerial discretion. The point I am
            making - and it meshes in with our policy - is that if citizenship has been conferred on
            a person we should be quite clear that there are not double standards. As far as the
            Crimes Act is concerned I believe that certain deletions should be made. 1 do not say
            that any trade unionist has been actually victimised as such but 1 think the Minister
            knows the feeling of people today. We do not want people to feel that there is a sword
            of Damocles hanging over their head because the Government says: &#39;Yes, you have
            citizenship, but . . .&#39; The point I put very clearly to the Attorney-General is
            this: If it was good enough when the 1969 Citizenship Bill was adopted and if it has
            been good enough at every citizenship convention to argue along the lines that everyone
            will be put on an egalitarian basis before the law, this should in fact be the case.
            This is what 1 am advocating tonight. I do not know <inline font-weight="bold">Senator
              Greenwood&#39;s</inline> attitude, outside of the Attorney-General&#39;s Department,
            in relation to monitoring of ethnic newspapers. But if he is looking at this matter from
            the immigration attitude as distinct from that of Attorney-General, he will agree that
            on numerous occasions we go to various functions and talk about Australia&#39;s virtues
            and vices. I do not think we adopt an ultra-nationalistic attitude when we do this. The
            plain fact of the matter is that this is a recurring theme. To me it is not a matter of
            abstract attitudes at all. I believe that with a minimum of legislative dislocation we
            could remove his stigma. 1 repeat that I have no doubt that when the Attorney-General
            confers, as he no doubt will, with the Minister for Immigration, the Minister for
            Immigration will tell him that this is something which has been raised persistently. On
            one occasion <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack drew
            attention to the evidence of threats. I do not want to issue any threats. But I put this
            to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood:</inline> Sometimes I have the
            opportunity of attending naturalisation ceremonies in the Prime Minister&#39;s
            electorate of Lowe. I have never believed in indulging in platitudes in the speeches I
            have made on these occasions. I might use the motto of the Amalgamated Engineering Union
            - and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> will appreciate this -
            &#39;Which is: &#39;Educate, organise, agitate&#39;. I will not argue about the priority
            that agitate&#39; takes. But I always believe in saying: &#39;Look, you have got
            citizenship. Everything in the garden isn&#39;t lovely. From here you go on and you
            agitate for some- thing that you believe is a grievance.&#39; If 1 was at such a
            ceremony together with the Prime Minister and someone asked me what was happening about
            the Crimes Act I would turn round to the Prime Minister and say: &#39;You answer it. I
            have endeavoured to convince <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood.&#39;</inline>
            I shall leave the matter at that point. </para>

            <para>- I have listened with interest to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator
                Mulvihill</inline> has said and I understand his remarks as being in the nature of a
              plea to have removed entirely from the statute book any laws which would discriminate
              against citizens who are not Australian born citizens. I think the points he made are
              well sustained. I think, however, before one examines what is involved in the
              proposition, that it is important to recognise that there is a period of time, between
              when a migrant comes into this country and when he is naturalised and therefore
              becomes an Australian citizen, when he is liable to deportation. That is a provision
              which is contained in the Migration Act. I think that section 13 of the Act indicates
              that a person who is in Australia, not yet naturalised and therefore not an Australian
              citizen, who commits certain specific offences which are set out in the legislation,
              is liable to deportation. </para>

          <para>The only provisions that I am aware of are certain provisions which are in the

            by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> on 19th August last was a question
            which in general terms asked me to look into whether the law can be altered to provide
            that naturalised Australians shall be treated for all purposes as Australians and not
            liable for deportation or cancellation of citizenship except, say, in cases of

            indicated that I would be helped in any inquiry I undertook if he could give some
            concrete examples of the matters about which he was complaining. I should say in passing
            that there are provisions contained in the Citizenship Act at present whereby
            citizenship can be taken away from a person who has been naturalised if there is fraud
            in the application which was made for the citizenship. There again, I do not understand

          <para class="block">Section 30j, section 30l and section 30q refer in similar terms, in
            respect of the offences which are there referred to, to the ability of the

            It is quite clear that whatever might have been the merit of those provisions in the
            1920s, whatever might have been the thinking in those days which regarded provisions of
            that character as having merit and whatever might have been the facilities of those days
            whereby the countries to which these persons might be deported would be prepared to
            receive them, I think in each of those areas our thinking these days has changed. I
            would believe that we are in a position where, if a person is an Australian citizen,
            whether he be an Australian citizen by the fact that he has been born in Australia or
            whether he is an Australian citizen by virtue of the fact that he has been naturalised,
            there ought to be an equality of treatment and these provisions do offend against that
            concept. </para>
          <para>I want also to say - and again I do not understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> to be disputing this - that there has not been to my
            knowledge any occasion on which any of these provisions has been used to have a person
            deported from this country. As I understand it there has never been any suggestion that
            these provisions are likely to be. used. </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Wright</inline>has made reference to Walsh and
                Johannsen. My recollection is that they were the persons in respect of whom,
                together with their associates no doubt, these provisions were originally inserted.
                I also have a thought that they were successful in resisting the application to have
                them deported. Since the 1920s there has been no suggestion, and I understand there
                is no suggestion now and there is not likely to be any suggestion, that these
                provisions will be used. I have noted that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator
                  Mulvihill</inline> has said and I have indicated to him clearly my own thinking.
                On the other hand I do not feel that it is appropriate at this stage to introduce
                legislation to repeal these provisions. However, I do assure the honourable senator
                that they will be taken into account in a consideration of the Crimes Act when that
                takes place. </para>
