                    <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - After giving full consideration to the report of the Newnes Investigation Committee, which was appointed by the Governments of the Commonwealth and New South Wales, both Governments decided, on the 12th July, 1934, that they would be prepared to assist financially in the development of the shale oil industry in the Newnes-Capertee area, provided that a company or persons possessing the necessary standing and technical and engineering qualifications could be induced to operate the undertaking. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>In reaching this decision, both Governments were actuated by a desire to see the industry developed along the lines recommended by the Newnes Investigation Committee, bearing in mind the importance qf the production of oil fuel from indigenous sources, and the effect which the development of the industry would have upon employment, particularly in connexion with miners. </para>
                <para>In the view of both Governments, however, it is essential that the development of Newnes should be undertaken by persons possessing technical, engineering, and other qualifications, which are regarded as prerequisites of success and stability. The Governments felt that another failure in the Newnes area would be a serious retrograde step, and that if they sponsored the formation of a company on haphazard and ill-considered lines for the purpose of operating the deposits, they would be failing in their duty. Another failure in the Newnes area would also have serious repercussions so far as other fields are concerned, including Baerami, in New South Wales, and Latrobe, in Tasmania. </para>
                <para>Following on this decision, the High Commissioner in London was asked to approach Imperial Chemical Industries Limited and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Cadman, the  chairman  of directors of the AngloPersian Oil Company Limited, which is a partner with the Commonwealth Government in Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited. Imperial Chemical Industries Limited stated that it had no actual experience in the production of oil from shale, and would not be prepared to become associated with the proposal, although it would render any assistance possible without accepting financial commitments. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Cadman intimated that he would visit Australia during October, and would discuss the matter with representatives of the Governments on his arrival. </para>
                <para>At the invitation of the Governments of the Commonwealth and New South Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Cadman visited Newnes on the 22nd and 23rd October, for the purpose of enabling him to express views as to the possibilities of developing the shale oil industry in that locality. The visit was followed by discussions which took place in Canberra on the 25th October, at which were present the Prime Minister, the Minister for Mines of New South Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Cadman, and myself. </para>
                <para>
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline>
                    Cadman said that, in his opinion, the estimates of the Newnes Investigation Committee in regard to the CostS of mining would not be realized. He thought that the figures would be exceeded. He also expressed apprehension as to whether the Pumpherston  adapted retorts, more commonly known as the Fell retorts, which are installed at Newnes, would be capable of efficiently treating the rich shale which is available in that locality.
                </para>
                <para>In connexion with both these matters, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Herbert</inline> Gepp and I advised <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Cadman that - </para>

                    <item label="2.">
                        <para>The retorts have been operated over considerable periods and have been proved by results to be reasonably suitable. However, we both felt that, as a result of research, greater  efficiency  may be obtained, but we were convinced that the retorts are the best which have been evolved up to date; moreover, the financial results which were placed before <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Cadman were based upon yields obtained from the retorts. </para>

                    Cadman intimated that, while he was not greatly impressed with the possibilities of developing the shale oil industry in the Newnes area, he would arrange for expert officers of his company to visit Australia at an early date to investigate the possibilities of the industry.
                </para>
                <para>Since that discussion took place, the Government has received a letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Cadman, in which the following passages occur: - </para>

                    <para>AsI have previously assured you, my desire is to assist the Commonwealth Government in any way within my power, and it was with this object that I placed my technical experience at your disposal. </para>
                    <para>The Anglo-Persian Oil Company, of which I am  chairman,  and which is a partner of the Commonwealth Government in the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited, can only have the same objective as the Commonwealth Government in desiring to sec developed in Australia any petroleum resources which can render Australia internally secure in respect of oil supplies on terms and conditions which are practicable and economically sound. </para>
                    <para>My company are in full sympathy with the policy of the Commonwealth Government, and, in order to assist them, I have arranged for two of the men at our disposal who arc most experienced in the mining, retorting, and refining of shale, to visit Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robert</inline> Crichton, a director and the general manager of Scottish Oils (Shale) Limited, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> R. J. Conacher, the manager, will leave England in time to intercept me at a convenient port on my return journey on their outward voyage to Melbourne. </para>
                    <para>I trust that their advice, after a careful survey of the situation, will contribute a substantial and authoritative addition to the knowledge of this difficult problem, and that the Commonwealth Government will, with such assistance, be the better able to determine the future policy- it should follow in this matter. </para>

Is the Minister aware also that sales tax is imposed on rat poison, whereas no such tax is imposed on a similar poison used for the destruction of rabbits? Will the Minister arrange for rat poison to be placed on the exempt list at the earliest possible moment? </para>

If not, has the fact been taken into account that there are large deposits of brown coal at Port Clinton, near fresh and salt water, bituminous coal of the Styx field, black lignite of Blair Athol, anthracite coal similar to Welsh coal, in the Mackenzie Valley, and semianthracite coal in the Dawson Valley, of which a government geologist once said the quantity was immeasurable, and that for oil production the central Queensland coals are regarded as amongst the best offering? </para>

                        <para>&#91;3.25&#93;. - I congratulate Senators Collett and Grant on the speeches which they delivered in moving and seconding respectively the Address-in-Reply. I was, however, somewhat pained that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> did not see all the virtues of the then Government; he seemed to think that there were some spots on the ministerial sun. In my opinion, some of his remarks were a little unfair as, for instance, when he said that that Government was quick to deal with tariff matters when secondary industries were affected, but was slow to come to the relief of primary industries. In order to show that that statement was not quite just, I remind the honorable senator of the action taken by the Government in respect of butter, hops, fruit, potatoes and timber, which he will admit are the products of primary industries. Moreover, if he will study the programme of the Commonwealth Government for the last two and a half years he will see that 75 per cent. of it affected primary industries. The honorable senator seems to have forgotten that the remissions of sales tax, primage duty, and other forms of taxation affected directly a number of primary industries. Those remissions of taxation were made by the Government with the special object of assisting primary producers. I remind him also of the legislation introduced in relation to wheat and butter. In the light of these facts, the late Government can scarcely be charged with having neglected the primary industries of the Commonwealth. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The honorable senator also asked what the Government intended to do in regard to the Navigation Act, and referred to a statement made by the Prime Minister just after the election. I have read that statement which was that, in the light of the result of the election in Tasmania, the Government would review its decision regarding the Navigation Act. That means, not necessarily that the Government will not carry out the promise made, but only that the matter will be reviewed. </para>

                        PEARCE.That depends on the point of view from which one regards the honorable senator&#39;s speech. I am unable to congratulate him on the amendment which he submitted. In the first place, it is delightfully vague. It contains a number of high sounding phrases which, on analysis, are difficult to understand. For instance, it is urged that immediate steps should be taken -
                    </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>To extend the functions and activities of the Commonwealth Bank, increasing its power to make bank credit available and utilizing such credit to finance public works. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The honorable senator did not enlighten us as to the nature of the suggested extension. The Commonwealth Bank is able now to make credit available to governments and private individuals and it does so ; but when the honorable senator speaks of extending its power to make credit available and utilizing such credit to finance public works, it is difficult to understand what is intended. Is it his contention that the Commonwealth Bank itself should not only find the money, but actually directly finance the particular work to be carried out ? And how is the money to be found ? Is it to be secured by way of loan ? When loan moneys are required the ordinary procedure is to invite public subscriptions, but this paragraph in the honorable senator&#39;s amendment seems to suggest that this practice is to&#39; be departed from and that the Commonwealth Bank itself is to find the money. One might ask also on what terms the money is to be raised, and in what way are those terms to be fixed. </para>

                        PEARCE.There the honorable senator errs as nearly all his followers did during the election campaign. The Commonwealth Bank did not find &#163;470,000,000. I read a statement by a member of another place that the Commonwealth Bank found the money to finance Australia&#39;s part in the war. That is absolutely incorrect. The money was raised in the ordinary way, by public subscriptions, to the war loans. The Commonwealth Bank and other banks subscribed to those loans, but subscriptions were also forthcoming from thousands of people, whom no one could, by any stretch of the imagination term capitalists or money-lenders. The money was found by the people, by insurance societies, and various other institutions; yet honorable senators went up and down the country telling the electors that the whole of the money required to finance Australia&#39;s part in the war was found by the Commonwealth Bank.

                        PEARCE.On the contrary it is very vague. In every dispute that comes before the Arbitration Court the court itself has to give consideration to those factors, but they are all conditioned by the capacity of the country to pay. It is all very well to talk about increased powers of production, but that does not carry us more than half way to a solution of the problem. When we have produced, we have still to sell, and while it is truethat mechanization has increased the power of production it is also true that, owing &#39;to other economic causes, produce in many cases does not realize the cost of production.

I could answer the honorable senator&#39;s question., &#34;Why not?&#34;, but it would take too long to do so.

On this matter. I cannot do better than quote an article which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of yesterday. The article which i9 headed, &#34; Finance - Purchasing Power - Fallacies of the Inflationist&#34;, contains this passage: - </para>

                        <para>There could be no better example of the fallacy of the idea that then, is not enough money with which to transact business than that of the United States. Figures published on Saturday from the League of Nations World Economic Survey for 1933-34 showed that a phenomenal accumulation of credit resources in the hands of the federal reserve banks and the federal treasury has been accompanied by a drying-up of the demand for commercial credit. &#93;n other words, business has been given almost unprecedented opportunities for using bank credit, and yet fails to take them. </para>

Thus  this  survey is world-wide. The article continues - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Vet the idea persists, and is constantly voiced, that some vast river of credit and currency is being dammed  Hp,  and that only its release is required to restore prosperity. The victory of supporters of the New Deal in Hit United States elections has been hailed in some quarters as the forerunner of further inflation or devaluation, apparently because President Roosevelt was given power by the last Congress to bring about either of these things. . . The National City Bank of New York, in the October issue of its circular,  lias  tome interesting comments on the plan to create purchasing power by inflating the currency. Thora who support the idea, it states, disregard the obvious truth that commodities  and  services are purchasing power in themselves, and that more than 90 per cent, of the trade of the country settles itself in the busiest times without the USe of money. They also disregard the obvious disruption of trade relations between the several sections of the productive system which fully accounts for iiic appearance of surpluses and the foll of prices, loss of purchasing power, and increase of unemployment </para>
                        <para>Moreover, the bank continues, the injection of more money or government credit into such <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> situation on a large scale introduces a new unbalancing influence. The basic principle of the economic system is the exchange of services. The trade of the country, left to itself, practically settles itself daily through more than 400 clearing houses. Each section ships out its own products, and receives practically corresponding values from  the Test  of the country or world. If now the Government enters the construction field with great  expenditures for projects which are prompted largely by the motive to provide employment, and from which any other possible return must be delayed for many years, where is the compensating flow to the taxpayers, who must currently pay the cost, or, if that is covered by loans, must keep up the interest payments? The national economy must balance, as it normally does, in the exchanges between the different groups and sections of the industrial system; but to take capital from thebody of the people by taxation or loans for investment in works which will produce noincome in the near future must tend to aggravate rather than remedy the disorders of an unbalanced economy. It is evident that the temporary stimulus given to general business by the disbursement of capital funds would not compensate for sinking the funds per- &#39;manently, with no expectation of return&#34;; and so it is a fair question in each case whether the prospect of a return justifies the taxation or borrowing which supplies the funds. The emergency investments cannot go on indefinitely without producing returns, and the direct stimulus of disbursements will cease when they cease. </para>

                    <para>I propose to refer to the remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> on the subjects of unemployment and pensions, and to that part of the amendment to the Address-in-Reply which deals with those matters. In regard to unemployment, I have had supplied to me officially by the department figures which show that at the peak period of 1932 unemployment in Australia stood at 30 per cent., whereas in September, 1934, it had dropped to 20.4 per cent. This decrease, when analyzed, reveals some very interesting facts. The figures show that in June; 1933, throughout Australia there were 394,453 persons in receipt of sustenance. Unquestionably, those persons were unemployed. In June, 1934, there were in the Commonwealth 131,074 people employed on relief work, and 89,755 people drawing sustenance. Adding together those two numbers, we get a total of 220,829, as compared with 394,453 in June, 1933. The figures disclose a very encouraging improvement of the unemployment position, showing, as they do, that, apart from relief workers, 173,b&#39;24 persons who were drawing sustenance in 1933 have found employment, presumably in industry. These statistics refute the allegation that the decrease in unemployment has mainly been caused by placing men on relief work, and counting them as in employment. After allowing for those engaged on relief -work, there remains an actual reduction of 173,624 in the number of persons unemployed. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. With respect to old-age pensions honorable senators opposite are never tired of trying to make it appear that the Government and the party it represents have in some way meted out harsh treatment to invalid and old-age pensioners, and that the Government is  unsym- pathetic  towards the aged and infirm, his contention can be refuted by a glance at the figures published in the budget papers for 1934-35, in which, on page 133, it is shown &#39;that on the 30th June, 1934, there were 183,397 old-ago pensions current throughout Australia, whilst the corresponding total at the end of the previous year was 176,425. Thus, during the year when harsh and discouraging conditions were alleged by honorable senators opposite to have existed, the number of pensioners increased by 6,927. The figures relating to invalid pensions are to be found on page 135. They tell a similar story, the number of pensions current at the 30th June, 1934, being 77,282, as compared with 72,742 at the 30th June, 1933, an increase of 4,540. On page 140 are shown the amounts paid for invalid and old-age pensions in every year from 1910. In the peak year, 1931. the total payments to pensioners and benevolent asylums and hospitals was &#163;11,710,953. In the present financial year provision is made in the budget for a total payment of &#163;12,000,000, the highest amount ever paid in the history of this form of social legislation, being about &#163;300,000 more than in the peak year referred to. I therefore suggest that, although honorable senators opposite may exaggerate the effects of recent legislation as they like, it is impossible to escape the logic of the figures which I have quoted. </para>

                    <para>Griffin was excluded by reason of his failure to pass the dictation test. His exclusion i3 a matter of ordinary national security. He is a man who came to the Commonwealth from New Zealand, but he has spent a considerable period of time in Russia.

                    <para>Most of the interest aroused is directed, not to the New Zealander. but to Kisch, who has what is apparently the added attraction of a cosmopolitan origin, though it is doubtful what country claims him. Kisch has been excluded under paragraph <inline font-style="italic">gh</inline> of section 3. This paragraph was added to the act in 1925. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> in a speech in the House of Representatives, set out two reasons for its addition - </para>

                    </list>
                    <para>The crux of the whole matter is not merely information from the British Government, but the fact that the British Government has itself excluded Kisch from landing in Great Britain. Great Britain is, and always has been, famous for its high degree of tolerance towards persons associated with continental political movements, even when they are of a revolutionary character. There probably is in England a very much stronger tradition of tolerance than we have here in Australia, so that, when Britain excludes Kisch, it must needs be for some strong reason. What is more, the Government of the United Kingdom excluded him after he had been allowed to land, and had spoken in England. </para>
                    <para>It is to me a curious thing that a considerable number of people immediately choose to impute wrong motives to those in authority in their own country, who obviously have sources of information not available to others. They are prepared to assume the worst against them, in favour of an unknown man from a foreign country. </para>
                    <para>Kisch waa, until the last few days, practically unknown. True, if one went to the trouble of examining the European <inline font-style="italic">Who&#39;s Who,</inline> one would find the name of Egon Erwin Kisch, a German writer and journalist, whose address was in a Berlin suburb. But of the various people who have discussed the matter with the Attorney-General, even some who were inclined to champion Kisch, every one, when pressed, had admitted that he, or she, had never heard of Kisch before. He has, as honorable senators know, received a  great  deal of publicity; but the descriptions of him have been of a vague kind - &#34; the Jewish writer,&#34; &#34; the </para>
                    <para class="block">Czechoslovakian journalist,&#34; &#34; the German novelist. &#34; The Attorney-General has been spoken to about Kisch by many keen students of international affairs, and many pressmen; but not one had ever before heard of him, either to his credit or discredit. Many of the champions of Kisch are persons genuinely interested in international peace and goodwill and genuine lovers of liberty and freedom of speech. </para>
                    <para>I state quite definitely that the Government does not yield to the most ardent of them in its desire for peace in the world, without which there can be no secure peace in this country. It does not yield to the mo3t ardent of them in its love of liberty and freedom of speech. It stands for the complete freedom of opinion. But there are certain limits which must be fixed. The fact that a line has to be drawn somewhere will be admitted by members of all parties. In many cases a committee drawn from all parties would have no difficulty in saying unanimously : &#34; This man shall not enter, &#34; or &#34; This man shall enter.&#34; Any one who advocates a peaceful change of government is free to say what he likes, but speech and writing calculated violently to overthrow the existing order cannot be tolerated in any community which claims to be democratic. </para>

                        PEARCE.We shall see. It may be urged that Kisch was in possession of a passport with the visa of a British consular officer. Even assuming this to be so, permission to land still rests only with the Commonwealth authorities, who are the sole judges of whether he should be allowed to enter Australia. For very obvious reasons the grant of a visa can bc no guarantee of entry to another country, particularly to a country thousands of miles away.

                    <para>Among their activities both Griffin and Kisch were to attend the conference at present sitting in Melbourne of what is known as the Anti-War Movement. This movement has a history which needs notice. In August of 1932 &#34;an International Congress against war was held at Amsterdam. Previously it had been intended to hold it at Geneva, but tha </para>
                    <para class="block">Cantonal authorities refused to allow it. This congress was organized to a large extent by Communists. It set up a permanent international committee consisting of representatives of most countries. Instructions quickly reached Australia, and the movement was launched here at the beginning of last year, 1933, not directly by the Communist party, but sponsored by bodies in close sympathy with that party. It also attracted to it at the outset many persons, sincere believers in peace, who had no  connection or sympathy with Communism. Conferences were called in several of the State capitals for April 1933 and leaflets issued made much of the support of trade unions, professional men and returned soldiers. Several ministers of religion were connected with the movement. This is a good instance of Communist activity, an anti-religious society cloaking its works under the cover of religion. Shortly after this a delegation was announced as setting out from Europe to anti-war conferences to be held in Shanghai and Yokohama. These conferences were forbidden by the Chinese and Japanese authorities. A committee was to have been set up in Japan to direct the campaign in Australia and New Zealand. </para>
                    <para>The next step in Australia was the . holding of an anti-war conference in Sydney in June of last year. There were about 600 present, the majority of them being Communists. In May of this year an interesting letter from Sydney -reporting on the success of the movement in Australia appeared in the organ of the World Committee against War. This publication reported, among other things, that the Australian fleet was in revolutionary mutiny. The letter from Sydney showed quite clearly that the Australian committee was trying to carry out the directions of the World Committee. It reported having most difficulty in Victoria, where, it stated, the movement was directed principally towards pacifist bodies and the middle classes, and in particular the youth of the community, at the expense of the fighting character of the movement. &#34; In Victoria, &#34; it said, &#34; particular efforts are made to attract youth. &#34; It stated that the Australian rulers, and with them the Australian Labour party, were making  use  of the Victorian centenary in order to organize a defence week. I am sure that will be news to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes.</inline> Elsewhere, it stated, attention was being directed principally to the industrial workers, the Labour party and trade unions. </para>
                    <para>Thus we come to the present Anti-War Conference in Melbourne, which Kisch and Griffin were to attend. Honorable senators will note that it is not sponsored by any reputable, constitutional body. Tho Government is genuinely anxious to assist any bona fide peace movement, but that term cannot be applied to what is a thinly veiled Communist demonstration. </para>

                        PEARCE.It certainly can claim to have done that. The Commonwealth is represented at. assemblies of the League of Nations, and on the Disarmament Conference, and the Government is opposed to the class war which is so diligently advocated by certain persons in Australia. But I wish to trace the connexion between this movement and Communism. The leaders of Soviet Russia perceived the use to which such a movement to further their general purpose could be put. Instructions were accordingly issued by the Comintern, head of the propagandist section of -the Soviet, and the Communist party of Australia in. due course received a document entitled &#34; The Attitude of the Proletariat towards War. &#34; The first All Australian Congress Against War was held in Sydney at the end of September, 1933. It was the culmination of the strenuous efforts on the part of the Communist party. In this connexion it may be noted -

                    <para>The Government has literature indicating that the various slogans, propaganda, and lines of attack used by the Anti-War Movement are those of the Communist party and its manifesto, &#34; Tho Attitude of the Proletariat towards War, &#34; and are included, word for word, in the literature now being distributed throughout Australia. The movement condemns everything in the way of defence measures, issues vile slanders about mutinous conduct and disloyalty of our naval forces, attacks the boy scouts and girl guide movements, and, in fact, uses every means to undermine any measures taken for our legitimate defence. Its aim is to assist in paving the way for revolution by white-anting all defence measures. The ultimate object is to ensure that our defence forces shall be so weak and unreliable as to be unable to preserve peace, order and good government when the attempt is made to overthrow our existing form of government and substitute a Soviet system. </para>
                    <para>It is passing strange that the supporters of Kisch and the defenders of this movement belong to a party which clearly realizes that this Anti-War Movement is a Communist auxiliary. Its success has caused dissension in the New South Wales Labour party and the Sydney Trades and Labour Council, Well aware of its origin and real objects, has prohibited its followers from taking part in the Anti-War Movement. </para>
                    <para>It might be noted that Australia is not the only country which prevents foreigners connected with this movement from landing in their country. Prohibitions have been made in several countries and I would remind honorable senators that delegates were prevented from landing recently at Shanghai and Yokohama to attend the Anti-War Conference proposed to be held there. </para>
                    <para>The information at the disposal of the Government, which comes from an undoubted source, discloses that Kisch is a member of a recognized Communist organ, and he is, and has been for a long time, associated with its propaganda branch. </para>

                        <para>. - Despite the criticism which ons hears from time to time that a debate on an Address-in-Reply involves a waste of time, I contend that it has its uses. It is easy to criticize many customs, as honorable senators on this side of the chamber have done from time to time, and our criticisms have often been justified. There is little in the world that does not possess some satisfactory features, and the debate on the Address-in-Reply provides honorable senators with an &#39;opportunity to give their views on various public matters. I should be sorry wore we deprived of this opportunity, because there are occasions, particularly when the administration is conducted on conservative lines, when we should have full scope to express our individual opinions, even if at times they may conflict with those with whom we sit cheek by jowl. Coming back from a general election honorable senators on this side could have a good deal to  say  concerning the manner. in which the campaign was conducted, but I shall defer any comments in that respect until later. The Address-in-Reply to the Speech of  His Excellency  the Governor-General should be treated seriously. Having heard a number of similar speeches I must say that that with which the present Parliament was opened was one of the shortest and also one of the most ridiculous I have ever heard. The fact that the personnel of the Government has been changed within a few weeks after the speech was delivered makes its basis ridiculous, and no doubt those responsible for its preparation now regret that His Excellency was asked to deliver such utterances, lt is amusing to notice that the Country party, which was once a strong opponent of the United Australia party, has now fairly strong representation in a Coalition Cabinet. One of the first paragraphs in the speech reads - </para>

                    <para class="block">Within a few weeks of that striking pronouncement, the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> and the honorable member for Gippsland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Paterson),</inline> who, throughout the life of the last Parliament, we&#39;re opposed to the Government on fiscal matters, have become members of the Cabinet. It has been stated from time to time that certain honorable senators on this side, including <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> actually saved the last Government from defeat by supporting its tariff proposals. It is said that governments can be made and unmade only in the House of Representatives; but, when the tariff was under discussion in this chamber, the Government had to submit to so many defeats that it became a question whether or not the Government would have to put up test bills to determine whether the majority of the Senate intended to support its tariff policy, or whether that majority proposed to proceed with a policy of obstruction, in which event there would have , been every possibility of a double dissolution. An adverse vote in the Senate could, in effect, bring about the defeat of a government, and, during the period of which I- speak, the votes of seven or eight honorable senators on this side of the chamber actually saved the Government from defeat. When the tariff was before this chamber, I supported the Government on so many occasions that I felt that my reputation as a Labour man was at stake. </para>

                            <para>-  It is .better to have straight-out freetraders than halfhearted protectionists, who, when an appeal is made to the people, can ride on two horses. There was so much opposition to the Government&#39;s tariff proposals by certain government supporters that it amounted to obstruction. Prior to the general elections, the candidates of the Country party visited country electorates as representatives of the primary producers, and by so doing secured a substantial country vote; but, by winking the other eye, they also secured the votes of the United Australia party supporters. That is why the Labour party has been unable to win certain country seats. After the election campaign, during which the members of the Country party strongly criticized the United Australia party, the members of both parties are all in the one camp. </para>

Moreover,  ia  man who came to this country to preach peace was not allowed to land. The Government has not only treated Herr Kisch in this way, but has also meted out similar treatment to British subjects. Under a bill presented to this Parliament some years ago, the government of the day sought power to deport persons not born in this country. Under that legislation, I might have been deported from this country because I am not a native of Australia. Not having studied the European <inline font-style="italic">Who&#39;s Who,</inline> I do not know much about Herr Kisch, but I am concerned at his exclusion because of the possible consequences. </para>

                            <para>- No. We must not forget that there is, or should be, such  a  thing as the liberty of the individual. To-day, the liberty of Herr Kisch is involved; to-morrow it might be the liberty of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes.</inline> Indeed, if the disciples of Lenin or Trotsky were to attain power in the Commonwealth to-morrow, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DuncanHughes</inline> would probably be one of the first persons in the community to receive attention at their hands. In that event, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> and myself, knowing that the honorable senator would not deserve the harsh treatment which might be meted out to him, would feel called upon to defend him. There being no likelihood of war in the near future, there is no need to keep out men like Herr Kisch. It would be far safer to let him, and others like him, into this country than to drive them under-ground by ill considered action. Every week on the Yarra bank, Melbourne, or in the Sydney domain, wild theories in regard to many subjects are propounded by people who generally arc regarded merely as foolish, and it is well known that Hyde Park, London, provides persons having all kinds of strange ideas with an outlet for their emotions. The freedom of speech allowed to those who teach strange doctrines has the effect of drawing the rest of the community closer together. </para>

                    <para>The fusion of the United Australia and Country parties has made the Governor-General&#39;s Speech utterly ridiculous. </para>
                    <para class="block">Dealing with unemployment, the Governor-General said that a complete survey of the problem was proposed. Nearly six years ago, a Labour Government was prepared to grapple with the problem in a way which would have solved it, but, unfortunately, it did not have a majority in both Houses of the Parliament, and, consequently, was unable to give effect to its policy. The Labour party&#39;s policy for the re-adjustment of the financial structure would, if put into operation, solve this and many other problems now confronting us. It may be news to some honorable senators that some time ago the Forbes-Coates Coalition Government of New Zealand appointed a committee to consider monetary and banking reform. The majority of the members of that committee were men with conservative views, but its report reads like a speech by a Labour leader. It supports all that I said during the election campaign - and I said some strong things. I am reported in the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Courier</inline> as having said that Australia would not be injured if all the private banking institutions were eliminated. I did not advocate stealing their funds, or confiscating the savings of the people, as my remarks might be construed to mean. I am reminded of what took place in New Zealand in 1896 when the government of the day, headed by the late Richard Seddon, came to the rescue of the Bank of New Zealand, proving what we on this side have contended all along - that, in the final analysis, the security behind any bank is the productive capacity of the people  and a common honesty and desire to pay. The Government of New Zealand appointed to the directorate of the Bank of New Zealand a number of men who, it expected, would follow a course of action dictated by the Government, but, instead, they decided that the first function of the bank was to make profits for its shareholders. In view of the claim of the Labour party that the first duty of a bank is to serve the people and help industry, it is interesting to note that the committee to which I have referred reported that the private banks of New Zealand should be utilized for the benefit of the people, whereas they existed only to make profits for their shareholders. It pointed out  also that as many of those shareholders resided in Australia the profits made by the bank were not retained in the dominion. What that New Zealand committee said regarding the Australian banks operating in that dominion, the Labour party says of a number of banks in Australia, the profits of which are paid to shareholders in England and elsewhere. The committee urged that the control of the banking institutions operating in the sister dominion should be in the hands of New Zealanders, and we of that Labour party claim that the control of banking in Australia should be centred in the a country, and not in London or New York. Instead of prohibiting the entry into this country of men like Herr Kisch, action should have been taken to keep out men like <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Otto</inline> Niemeyer. As I have said, the conclusions of the committee appointed to investigate the monetary and banking systems of New Zealand could not have been more condemnatory of the present system had they been written by Labour men. </para>
                    <para>A responsible, cautious Labour leader like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> would certainly not go any farther than the New Zealand Monetary Committee of conservative members of Parliament did. I would advise every honorable senator who desires to obtain an accurate view of national finance to read this report. </para>

                            <para>-  It can be said to the credit of the Labour party that it has suffered defeat more than once because of the boldness of the policy which it has submitted, although that policy ultimately has been adopted. During the last election campaign in Queensland, I spent two or three weeks in supporting a Labour candidate who  was a  graduate  of  the Melbourne  University - a  barrister about 45 years of  age,  who had served as a journalist and also as  a  minister of the Methodist Church. Because of his experience and academic distinctions, I naturally expected to hear from him a very excellent  speech when he  addressed the electors  in one of the principal towns of a  semi-rural constituency. I anticipated that he would give a great deal of attention to the desperate plight of {he farmers, and that any reference that he might make to the need for banking reform would be kept in the background by the conservative newspapers, as is the case with paragraph* about Labour matters. As a rule, a Labour candidate&#39;s speech . is dismissed in a paragraph by other than the Labour journals. The candidate whom I supported spoke for an hour on what he picturesquely described as &#34; The international Jew and the need for banking reform in Aus. tralia &#34;. In the speech with which I followed I thought it wise to emphasize the sins and omissions of our opponents by referring to the neglect of tropical industries by the Lyons Government and its lamentable tinkering with the old age pensions system, particularly in regard to the property provisions of the amended act. I pointed out also that, whilst the Lyons Government had remitted millions by way of land taxation to the rich class, it had failed to make any adequate provision to cope with unemployment. I spoke for half an hour on these and other matters to which the candidate had not referred. Next morning the local daily, to whom the candidate had supplied a typewritten copy of his speech, devoted two and a half columns to his address, and about three-quarters of a column to my remarks, although I had not supplied it with a copy of them. But the report of the candidate&#39;s speech covered only that part of it in which he dealt with banking and monetary reform. All other subjects were ignored. On the same page appeared a cartoon showing &#34; Jimmy &#34; Scullin and &#34; Jack &#34; Lang standing on a huge building bearing the words, &#34; Savings Bank,&#34; and stretching clutching hands over it. At the side stood <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons,</inline> who could not be better caricatured than as a koala or native bear. Instead of caricaturing him, however, the artist showed the Prime Minister as a commanding figure, standing four-square to the bank, with a warning finger pointing to these gentlemen and saying of them, &#34;It is your money they will take &#34;. That was only one of many attempts to make the people  believe that the Labour party are thieves. I do not know <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kisch,</inline> but I should say that he would be a more estimable citizen than the man who drew and the mon who authorized that cartoon. The Labour party does not stand for confiscation. It3 policy, extending now over a period of 40 years, has always been one of sound progress along just and fair lines. </para>

                    <para>It was by means of propaganda of this kind, however, that the Labour party was defeated. Our boldness in attempting to get into the heads of the people the fact that, as exemplified by the depression, the time had come when we should curb the efforts of the money profiteers - the people who use the banks only to secure fat dividends for themselves - was responsible for our defeat. </para>
                    <para>The report of the conservative mcmbers of the New Zealand banking commission - I do not ask honorable senators to look at the minority report by Labour members- - urges that the banks should serve the people rather than be used merely to produce dividends for a few shareholders. That, too, is the view of the Labour party, and when next we fight this issue I hope we shall resort to the very best propaganda to convince the people that the time has come for the nationalization or socialization of banking, or Some such &#34;  ization  &#34; as will take out of the hands of the moneyed few the power to exploit banking and to extend credit for their own particular interests. The calling in of overdrafts, among other things; prevents the expansion of industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> told us this afternoon that there is plenty of money available - that the banks are ready to advance as much money as is required. But on what terms? The banking institutions control the industrial situation. International finance rules the world. The conservative members of the New Zealand Monetary Committee  support our view in that regard. They consider that the Dominion should be free from the control of the Niemeyers,  Guggenheimers  and other financiers in London and New York who control the dominions. We have the power to control our own financial economy, and the people should have the courage to use it. </para>

It is ridiculous to find that there is a growing opinion that the party that is able to put up a list of candidates headed by a man whose surname starts with &#34; A &#34; should be considered able to control an election. So advantageous is it held by a number of people under the group system to have some one with .a surname commencing with &#34; A &#34; to head the list on the ballot-paper that it would not be surprising to find such a man offering himself for sale.

                            <para>- I do not, but there certainly are many people who think that the first three names on a ballot-paper are those for whom they should vote one, two and three. In 1928, Senators Foll, Crawford and Reid were the retiring members of the Nationalist party and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooper</inline> was the fourth candidate in the group. Our candidates were Messrs. Horn, Lawson, myself and Valentine. The Nationalist party in order to safeguard the position of the retiring senators - it thought it would be unfair that one of them should be elected for only three years - departed from the correct alphabetical order and put <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Crawford</inline> first to be voted for on the ballot-paper, followed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid. Senator Cooper,</inline> the new candidate, was placed fourth. We, on the other hand, had the supposed advantage of arranging our group according to alphabetical order, but, strange to say, we were defeated by 86,000 votes, which was the greatest majority ever recorded against us in Queensland. This adverse vote averaged 8,600 votes in each constituency. That experience afforded us a guide  to the advantages or disadvantages of the new practice, because at the previous election we were defeated by 50,000 votes, and three years earlier, when I was a candidate, by from 11,000 to 6,000. Thus the idea of ensuring the placing of one&#39;s party group at the top of the ballot-paper, or having the party candidates voted for alphabetically, does not always work out in the way some people would have us believe. However, the problem is a difficult one. There are certainly a lot of people of foolish and careless habits whose votes can be caught by this method. </para>

                    <para>As an alternative&#39; to the present method, the position of the names of the party groups on the ballot-paper should be decided by lot after the names of the candidates have appeared. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan,</inline> a lawyer, will agree that the casting of lots for such a purpose would not be illegal. That would be a. fairer way of allocating positions on the ballot-paper, and I would support any amendment to effect such an alteration, together with some others which I have suggested in previous speeches on the subject. The present basis of representation in this chamber is certainly unfair. At the next election, the Government parties will have the advantage of going to the polls with 33 senators to the Labour party&#39;s three That is unfair, and the only way in which we could make the system fair would be to confine the candidates to the two largest parties. There is much to be said in favour of a system of proportional representation, but does any one want this Parliament to be cursed with seven or eight different parties? &#34;With triennial elections, the people should be quite satisfied to choose between two parties; the average man does not want to be bothered with the intricacies of having to vote for more than two. It is not exaggerating the position to say that at the present time there is a great distaste on the part of the public for the parliamentary system. This revulsion of feeling has been accentuated by the many jibes and criticisms aimed at politicians by the so-called popular newspapers. An occasional deportation of journalistic  iconoclasts would do no harm to the parliamentary system, and probably would be more advantageous than the preventing of men like Kisch and Griffin from landing in Australia. An improvement of the existing electoral system would be to allow in each State one senator out of three to represent the minority at the polls. </para>
                    <para>At present there is a third large party in the field - the Country party - which claims to receive a big vote, but the large number of votes recorded for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> in Victoria was the result of a split in the parties, and was cast against the three Labour condidates,  rather than for the political organization he was supposed to represent. The only fair way of approaching this problem would be to confine the candidates to the six representatives of the two main parties. One probable result of this would be to insure the election of a healthy opposition. A government cannot render the greatest service to the community, nor can it be wisely entrusted with the job of governing, without the aid of an active opposition. Democracy demands such an opposition, and this is the only way I can see whereby we can ensure such a check. There is a danger that if we start tinkering with the present system we shall have foisted upon us a wretched abortion of an Upper House, like the Legislative Council in New South Wales. The Lang Government must be held partly responsible for the bringing into being of a second chamber, whose constitution is a murder of democracy. </para>

                            <para>-- We do not want a murderous chamber of that kind in the Federal Parliament. If we are to progress on sound, cautious, lines, the New South Wales type of Upper House is the worst kind of chamber we could have in the federal sphere. Here we have some pride in pur chamber. I have, at least, because I was brought up to respect the principle of adult suffrage. As senators, we, equally with the members of the House of Representatives, have to face the electors; in fact, we have to wage a more extensive fight and cover more- ground than our colleagues in another place. But when a senator is chosen, he is the choice, not of an electoral college, or a State legislature, as in some other countries, but of the whole of the electors in a State, and for that reason he can speak with more authority and effect than can a member of the House of Representatives. Even in Tasmania, a senator must represent a large majority of the electors, whilst in New South Wales, Senators Dunn and Rae, although unsuccessful, polled a large minority of over 1,250,000 votes, and in Queensland about 547,000 decided that Senators Crawford and Foll should have another tenure of office. Thus it would be wicked to destroy the grand democratic nature of the Senate. Whilst I am a Labour representative and stand primarily for the interests of the workers, whether they be employed iu farm, field, or factory, it would be hypocritical if I, or any honorable member in this chamber, did not realize that we are also representatives of States. We have to ensure that no two States, such as Victoria and New South Wales, gain such a measure of control in this Parliament as would enable them to trample down the rights of the smaller States. If this Senate accepts any cheap scheme that would be detrimental to the interests of the smaller States, or undemocratic, it will be making a sorry mistake. The electorate for the Senate is the people, and political experience has shown, as instanced in Switzerland, that the bulk of the people are conservative and slow moving. Thus, we can always expect that the total vote of the people of a whole State will reflect the solid, sensible, opinion of the majority of the people. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collett</inline> that we should consider very gravely any proposal to destroy the present system of electing members to this chamber. In my own experience as a reporter in the press gallery, I have seen only five representatives of my opponents in this chamber, the other 31 senators being Labour men. That composition of the chamber reflected the opinion of the majority of the electors at that time, and the Labour party was therefore quite entitled to rule. The people at that time apparently did not want a greater opposition, but rather sought to give the government of the day the right to rule without undue interference by the Senate. If two parties in a chamber are approximately equal in numerical strength, there is a tendency for members on either side to desert their pledges for some reason or another. Where there is a majority of only one to four members, there is a danger that the- will of the people will not be carried out. When the people speak with a decided voice on a situation that declaration should be respected. At the end of three years, the people may throw out the majority as they have done on numerous occasions. </para>

                    <para>I desire now to deal with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant&#39;s</inline> remarks concerning the proposed amendment of the Navigation Act. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> said that the Prime Minister in his policy speech definitely promised an amendment of the coasting provisions of the Navigation Act, and he quoted from the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> which reported <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons</inline> as having said that the Labour vote in Tasmania at the federal elections could be construed as popular antagonism to an amendment of the Navigation Act which would permit overseas ships to carry passengers between Tasmania and the mainland. The <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> suggested that the Government should take action without delay to amend the act in accordance with its promise. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> relied on that quotation, as though the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> were a great aid to him. I cannot understand a conservative member, like the honorable senator when called upon to protect the country&#39;s interests, quoting the opinion of a journal that stands for free trade and black labour. As I understand it, the proposed amendment is intended to allow ships manned with cheap, coloured labour to engage in the Australian coastal trade. The Navigation Act requires that ships engaging in this trade shall pay Australian rates of wages and conform to prescribed conditions of employment. One of the essential conditions is the employment of white labour. If that requirement is broken down what will become of the White Australia ideal? The rich overseas owners of ships trading to Australia choose to employ coloured labour, aud to pay rates of wages which are much below those paid to Australian seamen. If such ships using cheap coloured labour of an inferior type are allowed to participate in our coastal trade, what will be the fate of our coastal marine? Honorable senators have received much correspondence on this subject. I have received a copy of the speech made by an English shipping magnate, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shaw,</inline> who has fairly argued that Australia should watch very carefully any attempt  that might be made by the Matson line of steamers, which is subsidized by the Government of the United States of America, to cut into our coastal trade, this company is not competing fairly but is seeking to obtain business from Australian companies which are being carried on under Australian conditions. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shaw</inline> made out a very fair case, and I agree with much of what he said, but I should not like to see the shipping trade between Australia and New Zealand and between Australia aud the islands under its control fall into the hands of a monopoly. This is the basis of the Labour party&#39;s opposition to shipping combines. It is well known that although the various shipping companies throughout the world are apparently in active competition with one another, there is agreement as to freights and fares. Although a traveller from Australia to Great Britain might have the choice of vessels belonging to three or four different companies, the fares charged on all of them are approximately the same. Therefore, so far as the subsidized Matson line is concerned, while I sympathize with those who object to its unfair competition with the Australian shipping interests, I should be sorry to think that, as a result of representations that have been made to the Government, the travelling public were exploited and victimized by a shipping monopoly. </para>
                    <para>In conclusion I express the hope that when next we face the electors there will not be the same misrepresentation by our opponents of the Labour party&#39;s financial and monetary proposals. There is not the slightest doubt that Labour owed its de- feat nt the recent election to this gross misrepresentation. The party was deliberately maligned and the electors were deceived about its objective by those people who now desire to prevent Kisch from gaining entry to Australia because they fear, perhaps, what he might say offensively about the Women&#39;s National or Electoral League. There was a time when I had some respect for the Eight Honorable W. M. Hughes. Some years ago he was a good Labour man.  His  more recent achievements have somewhat revived my wavering belief in the idea of a resurrection. In the short time occupied by Captain Scott and his companion in the flight to Australia in the centenary air race, the Lyons Ministry was reconstructed and the right honorable gentleman succeded in staying in it, as did also <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Gullett, who it will be remembered, some years ago described <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page, now his colleague in the new Government, as the most tragic Treasurer in the history of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>. - Something has been said this afternoon about the unwisdom and danger of belittling our parliamentary institutions. I can think of nothing more regrettable or more likely to weaken the people&#39;s faith in our system of Parliamentary Government than the small attendance of senators at this moment. It is obvious that Government supporters are not interested in the business of the country, or else their minds have become so obfuscated that they have no desire to be enlightened by anything that might be said in opposition to their crusted conservative ideas. For the last hour there has not been a quorum present. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Quorum formed.&#93;</inline> The Leader of the Senate this afternoon, defending the Government&#39;s action in refusing to allow Kisch to land in Australia, read a long document in which were set out the reasons for his exclusion ; but the right honorable gentleman did not quote his authority for the statements contained in it. Consequently I am not sure whether the official statement was the result of inquiries made by him or by the Attorney-General. I also resent his attempt to associate the Australian </para>

                            <para>- I do so, but repeat that I should like to see the statement. The Australian Labour party has officially declared that no Communist can become or remain a member of the Australian Labour party. But that does not prevent Labour members of this chamber from declaring their abhorrence of every attempt to interfere with the liberty of the subject, <inline font-style="italic">n.3</inline> has been done in this case. If this man Kisch, of whom, until the present controversy commenced, <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> had no knowledge whatever, after landing in Australia engaged in any subversive activities, the law  i3  wide enough to enable the Government to deal with him without resorting to the dictation test. The Loader of the Senate mentioned with some pride the fact that Great Britain was admittedly in the forefront of those nations which gave sanctuary to foreign political refugees. Wc should not be far wrong if we followed the example of the Mother Country in this respect. </para>

The British Government allowed Kisch to land; later it took steps to deport him.  This  Government knows that there are in the Commonwealth subversive organizations which are working in a way en tirely repugnant to Australian ideals and sense of fair play, but it is making no attempt to deal with them. I have not the slightest doubt that the Leader of the Senate, who until recently was the Minister for Defence, is aware of the activities of these subversive agencies. Ho knows, I feel sure, that there is an organization known as the New Guard in New- South Wales, as well as another body known as the Australian Legion. He knows that members of these organizations are armed, that retired military officers are in command of their several units, and that they have definitely declared their intention to overthrow the Government of Australia if it exhibits characteristics objectionable to the people whom they represent. The right honorable gentleman knows all this, yet no action has been taken by the Government of which he is a member to deal with these organizations. </para>

The Leader of the Senate can have &#39;access -to it if he wishes to inform his mind about what is happening. I accept his assurance that he had no knowledge of this matter, but I must say that, iu his position as Minister for Defence, he must have been lamentably ignorant of what was going on in the community. I have  a  detailed report of the activities of the Australian Legion. The right honorable gentleman may see it if be wishes to do so. It indicates where the arms are, from whom they were bought, and where they are stored. </para>

                    <para>We on this side of the chamber take, second place to none in a desire for liberty and freedom, but we have no intention of interpreting liberty and freedom to mean licence. We have some conception of what the freedom of the subject, and of the press should mean to every decent Australian. The Leader of the Government did not attempt to link up this man Kisch with any one of the activities of the organizations to which ho referred, and with which, as bo knows, members of my party have no sympathy. He gave no semblance of a reason why Kisch has been prevented from landing in this country. Kisch should have been allowed to say whatever he desired to say and then, if necessary, the Government could have dealt with him under the existing law, which surely provides it with ample power. </para>
                    <para>I regret that I cannot congratulate the mover and seconder of the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply upon the manner in which they performed their tasks. I am sure that they were perfectly honest and sincere in all they said, but I am unable to compliment them on their logic or their ability to dissect the document which is compiled in language that can readily be understood. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collett</inline> commenced by saying that he was sure that we all are pleased with the improved conditions existing in Australia as compared with those which prevailed until a government similar to that now in office assumed control. I felt at the moment that it would have been most pertinent to have inquired from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collett</inline> - &#34; Who are enjoying the improved conditions? &#34;. Certainly the 800 unemployed in Canberra, and the tens of thousands of unemployed in the other capital cities are not. This afternoon the Leader of the Government quoted certain figures and we were told that the percentage of unemployed has decreased from 30 to 20.4. No one knows better than the honorable gentleman that those figures do not fairly represent the percentage of unemployment in Australia. We all know they are based on the returns supplied by registered industrial organizations in Australia, and that they do not adequately portray the degree of unemployment in this country at the time when they were compiled. The Minister knows that they do not take into account those only partially employed or the thousands of youths between the ages of 19 and 21 years who have never had a day&#39;s work since they left school and whose prospects of obtaining employment under existing conditions are extremely remote. Consequently when the Minister attempts to persuade the unfortunate people still submerged in this economic pit of unemployment that their position has improved by 10 per cent., it is an insult not only to the intelligence of those whom he was addressing, but also to those who have not enjoyed any of the alleged improved conditions to which he referred, and who, in consequence of the inactivity of this Government, will be grey-headed before they receive any benefit. </para>
                    <para>The Governor-General&#39;s Speech is a most indefinite document. I admit that it is a clever production, because it does not pin the Government down to any particular policy. We were told for instance that &#34; with this object in view employment and its associated questions have been allotted as a special ministerial task to the Minister for Commerce &#34;. Although the Speech was prepared only a short time ago that is not now a fact, as those duties have been delegated to a gentleman who is no longer a member of the Cabinet, but who has graciously undertaken the work in question without any ministerial allowance. We have to debate an Address-in-Reply to a Speech which, owing to political changes, is now inaccurate. We have also been informed that the Government proposes to make a complete survey of the unemployment problem in order to determine whether its root causes can be dealt with by direct Commonwealth action. If the Government responsible for the production of this document has still to go searching for the root causes of unemployment the position is pitiable, to say the least of it. The man in the street, who has not the same opportunities as members of this Parliament, can disclose the root causes of  unemployment.  He could explain what we on this side of the chamber have tried to submit as a remedy. For instance, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> said that if the pensioners were given more money to spend the purchasing power of the community would be reduced. I suppose that I would be called to order if I said that the right honorable gentleman knew better than that when he uttered those words, but, I know, and I am sure the right honorable gentleman also knows, that his statement was most illogical. Let us examine his simple statement. A certain amount of money is being expended to provide invalid and old-age pensions. Our suggestion is that that amount shall be increased by 2s. 6d. a week, that some of the irksome regular  tions made by this Government should be withdrawn so that a larger number of persons could become eligible for pensions, and that a number, who because of the conditions which prevail are refusing to claim a. pension should participate in this aid. If these objectionable conditions were removed the extra payments made to pensioners would increase, not decrease, the purchasing power of the community. It is an excuse or a subterfuge to say that the additional amount of revenue required to restore pensions to the original rate can be obtained only by increased taxation, and that if money is taken from the pockets of the people by means of taxation the amount available for spending must be decreased. That statement is not only illogical,  but  is also obviously untrue, because if 2s. 6d. is taken by means of taxation from those who have a surplus and given to pensioners the purchasing power of the people would not be decreased. Money collected by means of increased taxation would not be taken from those who spend all that they have, but when collected would be paid to those who because of dire necessity must spend every fraction they receive. In that way the purchasing power of the community would be increased. It has been contended that honorable senators on this side have said that this Government has no sympathy with the pensioners. I have never  said  anything of the sort. &#34;We have said that this Government is bubbling over with sympathy for those who are powerless to help themselves, but it never goes beyond professions of sympathy. It is time that this sympathy developed into something concrete, and the Government made some attempt to assist to provide food, clothing and shelter for those so sadly circumstanced. </para>

                            <para>- It is well that that interjection, which I expected, came from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll,</inline> because he does not always mean the hard things which he says. Whenever we speak on behalf of the poorer section, and particularly the pensioners who are entirely at the mercy of the community and utterly unable to speak for themselves, obstacles are raised by honorable senators opposite. If time permits I shall quote a list of other pensioners, with titles half a yard long, and every one of whom is bleeding the poor in our midst even whiter than they are being bled by the Government ; and yet no word of condemnation is uttered by honorable senators opposite. Discredit is brought upon uo when we raise the subject of invalid and old-age pensioners; but what of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Lukin who refused to have his salary reduced under the financial emergency legislation passed by this Parliament, and who receives a pension of &#163;1,000 a year from the Queensland Government in addition to his salary as a judge, of the Arbitration Court? Protests in cases of that kind are made only on this side of the chamber. We are told in the Speech that a complete survey of the unemployment problem is to be undertaken. I wonder how long that survey will take and when the Government will make up its mind to begin it. I heard a rumour to-day that the Government will shortly introduce its proposals into Parliament, and I wish to assure it that we on this side will support anything which will alleviate the suffering caused by unemployment. The Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> said  this afternoon that the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(&#39;Senator Barnes)</inline> was vague and indefinite. That charge is unfounded. If the right honorable gentleman wants an example of a vagueness and indefiniteness, he has it in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech. From it, we learn that the rural industries of this country are to receive some attention at the hands of the Government; but nothing of a definite nature is indicated. Within the last few days, a deputation of wheat-growers waited on the Government, and I am in a position to know that it required the Government to do something which is not the policy of the Government. The wheat-growers of Australia are not represented in this chamber by the Government and its supporters, or by the alleged champions of the primary producers in the Country party. We on this side stand for the organized marketing of all primary products, with compulsory pools controlled by the producers themselves, whereas the Government stands for other interests. The deputation to which I refer told the Government plainly that it wanted the Labour party&#39;s policy in regard to primary production put into operation, and that if the wheat-growers did not get what they wanted steps would be taken to bring the Government to a sense of its responsibility. As an example of indefiniteness, I quote the following paragraph from the Governor-General&#39;s Speech : - </para>

Having put their hands to the plough, they cannot afford to turn back.

                    <para>Were it not tragic, the paragraphs in the Speech relating to secondary industries and trade treaties would be amusing. The document before us is the best evidence imaginable that the Government is deplorably ill-informed - I would say, ignorant were it not for the Standing Orders - regarding the relative value of primary and secondary industries. The Prime Minister and his colleagues of the United Australia party have just taken into partnership members of a party which during recent years has constantly twitted the Government with having been saved time after time by the Labour party when its tariff policy has been under review. The Governor-General&#39;s Speech is again unreliable - and here again parliamentary procedure prevents the use of a stronger term - when it states - </para>

I suggest that the Government ask its statisticians to take out figures showing the relative importance to the Australian nation of primary and secondary production, and that those figures should recognize that, although the production of milk and cream on the farm is primary production, the manufacture of that milk and cream into butter is a manufacturing process, as is also the conversion of tobacco leaf into cigars and cigarettes. I do not suggest that there should be discrimination between primary and secondary industries, although I submit that there is discrimination now in favour of primary production. We on thi3 side contend that the interests of the producers in the country cannot be separated from those of the dwellers in our cities; economically, the people of Australia are one and indissoluble, and anything which affects one section adversely must have a similar effect on other sections. In its proposals for the benefit of the primary producers, -I hope that the Government will have in mind the men who are struggling to produce in face of great difficulties, not those belonging to the creditor class, who impose on the real producers a heavy burden because of high interest rates. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> knows of the unfair burden which high interest rates place on the wool-growing industry of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>This .afternoon the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> ridiculed the proposal to* issue bank credits, which the Labour party had put forward during the election campaign. He said that the suggestion was vague and indefinite, and claimed that the banks not only had the power to issue credit, but were, in fact, issuing credit where it was needed. The right honorable gentleman showed that he utterly failed to understand the Labour party&#39;s sane policy of nationalization of banking and credit. He went on to say that real money, not credit, was provided to finance the war. There never was, there is not to-day, nor <inline font-style="italic">la</inline> there ever likely to be so much real money in Australia as the amount of credit made available by the Commonwealth Bank alone for the prosecution of the war.

                    <para class="block">We are asked by honorable senators opposite what we mean by &#34; the issue of credit &#34;. They know perfectly well what we have in mind. We mean the mere  book entry which is always made by the banking institutions of this and every other country when a business man asks for an overdraft. Most honorable senators, like myself, probably have had some experience of banking business. There is no gamut to the fraud known as banking procedure of which I have not been an unfortunate victim during my commercial experience of 26 years - 22 years as an employee, and 4 years as an employer. No one can tell me more than I already know as to what the banks are capable of doing, because I have had experience of it all. Every one knows that when a man goes to a banking institution to arrange an overdraft he does not get a solitary coin from it. He gets nothing but an entry in a bank ledger. That is all that is ever done. A man arranges for an overdraft of, say, &#163;10,000, but he gets nothing more than an entry of those figures in the bank ledger. </para>

                            <para>- No, and if we did we could not got it. That is the point. The applicant for an overdraft gets nothing but a credit entry - nothing but figures in a bank book. The issue of credit being a social necessity, it should be for the benefit of the whole community, and the restriction of it is responsible for the depression, the horrors of unemployment, relief work, sustenance, the dole, the soup kitchen, and blanket clubs. The only difference between our policy and that of the banking institutions at present is that we say that the extension and restriction of credit should be the function of the nation operating through its national bank instead of being an opportunity for private financial institutions to exploit the whole of the people in the primary and secondary industries of this country by extortionate interest. </para>

It is either a tribute to his ignorance or to our incapacity to make ourselves understood that he should ask such  a  question. We know what we mean. There is no difficulty whatever in that regard. Without any desire to be unkind in my criticism of those who do not agree with the views of the Labour party on these various matters, let me say that we can never regard public opinion as a criterion of the wisdom or otherwise of any particular policy.

It is a long-standing joke of vaudeville artists that when a political candidate is put into  a tight corner by an interjector at a public meeting, he asks &#34; What did William Gladstone say in 1858 ? &#34; The candidate of course does not know what he said; but neither does the interjector, so the  speaker  feels that he is perfectly safe.

                    <para>The Leader of the Government declared this afternoon that we were merely trifling with, the subject when we proposed in our amendment that it would be a wise Australian policy to progressively reduce hour3 of labour and progressively increase wages commensurate with the increased productivity of the  nation.  Such a declaration he said waa vague and indefinite. He went on to assert that these considerations were taken into account by the Arbitration Court whenever the claims of the workers in any industry were before it. I would remind him. that there has just come before the Commonwealth Arbitration Court a case which has taken seven years to reach it. Yet we are told that there is no occasion for the amendment moved by the Labour party  since  these matters of increasing wages and decreasing hours commensurate with increased productivity and national wealth can always be adjusted by the Arbitration Court. That statement was made in cold blood this afternoon by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> although he represents in this chamber a Government which only a few short years ago went to the electors with a proposal to remove the Arbitration power altogether from the Commonwealth Parliament. The sooner the Government, in the interests of the Australian&#34; people and with proper regard to the progress of this great Commonwealth, realizes that the policy of shorter hours and higher wages is an economic necessity which must be attended to if national disaster is to be avoided, the better. The sooner the Government realizes that, instead of having a minister for labour, it would be  good policy to establish a ministry for leisure, the better for all concerned. Thirty or 40 years ago, it was true that the only way to national salvation was to earn one&#39;s living by the sweat of one&#39;s brow, although a number of wealthy people earned their living by exploiting the sweat of the other fellow&#39;s brow. But the Government must be brought to a realization of the fact that the greater the volume of work carried out, the greater the wealth produced in this country, the greater must be the number of unemployed, unless we perfect our distributing machinery to the same extent as we have improved our productive machinery. We have to realize as a writer has said, that - </para>

This cannot go on without presaging in the minds of all intelligent thinkers, in and out of this chamber, national disaster,  unless  something on a  national basis is attempted in the direction of decreasing hours and increasing wages, commensurate with the increase of the productivity of the nation. When our opponents tell us that we cannot create more employment by the nationalizing of bank credit, they know that what they are saying is incorrect. They know that this nation has the most acceptable security that any debtor can give to a credit-issuing authority; and that on the strength of that security the Commonwealth Bank Board could do as the Labour party desires. We do not propose to alter the personnel of the board any more than we would propose to alter the personnel of any Commonwealth government department after a change of government. All we propose to do is to lay down a new policy for the bank to follow. And that policy would be followed by the bank board if a government were in power that was prepared to accept the responsibility for it. </para>

                            <para>- Labour&#39;s policy would not necessarily mean a change of the personnel of the board so long as the board was prepared to carry out the Labour policy. Of course, if the board sought to obstruct that policy, the Government would have to devise ways and means to counteract such opposition. What I desire to impress, most forcibly, upon honorable senators is the simplicity of our proposal. Any one would imagine from the remarks made by the Leader of the Senate that our plan was some indefinite, complicated and intricate scheme which nobody could understand. All we propose to do is to ask the Commonwealth Bank Board for an issue of credit - in other words, to write credit figures in a hook. The board might ask, as it would be entitled to ask of any borrower. &#34;What security have you to offer?&#34; Do honorable senators think the&#39; Labour party is so barren of ideas as to be unable to foresee that the bank would want security? And is it thought that the Labour party is so ignorant of financial procedure that it would not have the security ready? What security would the nation have to offer the bank board for an issue of credit in order that large  armies  of unemployed might be put to useful and productive work? We would tell the board, as we have told our creditors abroad when we have gone to them in the past for loans, that the security we have to offer is the capacity of our people to produce wool, meat, sugar, flour, butter and fruit and other products; and to that we would add the power of the Parliament to tax the people. That is the security this nation has to offer in return for an issue of credit. We would not be asking the Commonwealth Bank Board to give more than what the banks ordinarily give their clients when they allow overdrafts by placing figures in a bank ledger, and issue cheque books with which to draw on that credit. We are told that our policy means inflation of the currency. It does not mean anything of the kind. But even if it does, even if all the biassed and uncharitable things said against our proposal were true, a trial of it would be worth risking because underlying it all would be the absorption of 300,000 good Australians in industry, making them capable of further wealth production and, at the same time, as our amendment suggests, the rehabilitation of Australia&#39;s whole economic system. This implies a complete economic survey with a view to arriving at a planned economy, to ensure that as the productivity of the Commonwealth increases, the distributive machinery shall be improved. Thus we shall abolish the sad and tragic paradox existing to-day of ever-increasing abundance and wealth alongside increasing misery, unhappiness, unemployment and starvation. To show that these proposals are not just the idle chatterings of a few easily deceived people who have got into Parliament as representatives of the Labour party, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir George</inline> Pearce said, I shall quote reliable financial authorities. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> G.

                    <para class="block">That is all that we say. It is entirely due to the fact that private profit-making financial institutions of this country can,  and do, create credit, and restrict or expand credit when it suits them, that there are ever-recurring periods of &#34; boom &#34; and their inevitable corollary, ensuing periods of &#34;bust&#34;. And the Labour party, backed up by the views of these financial authorities claims that the power now vested in these institutions should be vested in the nation through its representatives in Parliament. The Government should exercise that power to restrict and expand credit, not for the purpose of creating booms and depressions, but for the purpose of bringing about a planned economy. With increased productivity there should be a progressive decrease of hours and an increase of wages in order that this paradox of poverty in the midst of plenty should be removed from the nation&#39;s life.

Money being merely a vehicle for the credit of the community, and the power which the control of money carries with it being nothing less than the control of the entire economic life of the nation, it is desirable that the administration of financial policy should bo vested in a national authority directly responsible to the Sovereign and his people. </para>

It would lead to increased employment, the works carried out would be of benefit to the community, and effect a saving in sustenance amounts which the State governments have to provide today, thus assisting them tobalance their budgets. It would also increase the spending power of the community, and that would, in turn, have the effect of (a) assisting our primary producers; (b) setting the wheels of our secondary industries moving and bringing more money now lying idle in the banks into the industrial field; and (c) raising price levels.

                        Miller&#39;s answer was, &#34;Yes, I shall do my best &#34;. It is, however, a matter of common knowledge that he was not allowed to take any action along the lines suggested, because his policy was inimical to the interests of the profittaking associated banks.

                    <para>I think that I have refuted the statements made by the Leader of the Senate in reply to the address made:by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes)</inline> some days ago. I have shown that the Governor-General&#39;s Speech contains nothing whatever of any value to the people ; that it exposes the inability of the Government to understand the root causes of a problem, which, if we are to be saved from national disaster, must be solved. I further claim that our amendment outlines a plan, which, if put into operation, would attack this problem at the root and lead this country out of its difficulties. I give the Government full credit for trying to understand the problem with which we are confronted, but I repeat that to continue along the lines indicated in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech is merely to tinker with it. It is idle to wait for some world-wide miracle to happen; idle also to talk about prosperity being restored, and to quote, as an evidence of restored confidence, prices which Australian bonds are realizing in London. The high price of gilt-edged securities is no evidence of returning confidence. Bather is it evidence of increasing fear on the part of investors to put their capital into other channels. Any allusion to figures showing a decrease of unemployment percentages does not affect the breakfast table of people with no employment, and the continued reiteration in this chamber of the very serious plight of a large proportion of our primary producers will not solve their problem. Neither in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech nor in the speeches of the mover and seconder of the Address-in-Reply is there to be found the slightest evidence that the Government and its supporters understand the causes which are at work, or the means whereby the evils which are now so painfully and tragically apparent may be removed.  </para>

                        <para>. - I regret that honorable senators opposite have not taken advantage of this motion to discuss matters of great importance to Australia, and by so doing give to honorable senators on this side of the chamber an opportunity to learn where they are wrong in regard to many of the views which they hold on pressing public questions. The Senate meets &#187;o infrequently, and for such short periods, that honorable senators should take every opportunity to analyse the various problems confronting Australia at this juncture. Those honorable senators who do not visit Canberra regularly, or who absent themselves from the chamber, except when the division bells are rung, show a striking lack of interest in the subjects with which this Parliament has to deal. It is a sad commentary upon our bicameral system that honorable senators opposite will not utilize the opportunities provided for enlightening other honorable senators, and the community generally. I believe that much good could be achieved by a freer and fuller discussion of public questions. I have not reached such a stage of senility as to be incapable of absorbing new ideas, and it is regrettable that some should fail to utilize the opportunities provided for educating others. In the heat of an election campaign we cannot calmly debate subjects which affect directly the electorates concerned, and indirectly the whole Commonwealth, in the way that we are able deliberately to discuss and analyse them in the quietude of this chamber. During an election campaign all sorts of lies are put over the other fellow, and the last election campaign was no exception. It reminded me of a book I read in my early  day3  dealing with Baron Munchausen, who was the biggest liar the world ever knew. He was a wonderful gentleman, and a very interesting character. I do not know if honorable senators opposite have read of this man, who in his own estimation was an outstanding individual. On one occasion he said that he went to shoot some birds, but as he had not a supply of bullets he filled his gun with nails and tacks, which penetrated the birds, nailing them to the trees and the birds eventually flew away with the trees attached. I recall reading Bangs&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">The</inline><inline font-style="italic">House</inline><inline font-style="italic">Boat on the Styx.</inline> The boat was occupied by shades who had departed from this world, and included in these were such notable personages as Socrates, Queen Elizabeth, Shakespeare, Bacon. </para>

Many of those who attacked the policy of the Labour party prior to the last general election were deliberately lying, and deserve to be told that they were lying. I shall go so far as to say that some of our knights of the realm deliberately used the public platform to mislead the people. For instance, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Gullett went out of his way to tell the people what, in his opinion, would happen if Labour were returned to power. It is grossly wrong and unfair for any person, whether a knight or an ordinary individual, to use the public platform to lie to the people. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Gullett is reported to have said- </para>

                        <para class="block">Now I come to the statement made by a knight in this chamber - <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Pearce - who undoubtedly rendered great service to the United Australia party and Country party in Queensland. The speeches of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Pearce were, to a large extent, responsible for the return of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll, Senator Crawford</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cooper.</inline> I regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> should have handled the truth so carelessly for the sole purpose of defeating Labour. When <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Pearce came to Queensland, he, like <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Gullett, told some fearful stories concerning the Agricultural Bank of Western Australia. He said - </para>
                        <para>This bank rendered highly valuable service to land settlement. It was managed by a board of trustees, but political influence was allowed to creep in, and members of Parliament, even Cabinet Ministers, pressed claims for advances to clients. </para>
                        <para class="block">That statement was broadcast to thousands of eager listeners who would regard it as truthful, coming as it did from a knight of the realm. The inference was that if the Labour Government were returned the Commonwealth Bank would be subject to political control, and that the savings of the people would be dissipated by a profligate Government. Is it fair that gentlemen such as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Pearce and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Gullett should go to the fair State of Queensland and discredit the Labour party by making statements such as I have quoted? It was good propaganda for the United Australia party and the Country party, and it served its purpose. It gave the electors the impression that Parliament was slipping and that politicians were becoming more degraded every day. Although such stories are told the people ascertain later that they are lies and that some politicians are only what newspapers which attack them say that they are. When acute problems have to be dealt with by the Commonwealth Parliament and the State Parliaments it behoves everyone who speaks on behalf of the people to deal honestly with such problems in a reasonable and scientific way as I shall endeavour to do. The speech which was read by the Governor-General was, of course, prepared by some members of a government which would have been defeated had it not made uri  arrangement with a party to which it had previously been opposed. I do not say that the Speech contains statements made with the deliberate object of misleading the people, but I do say that the results hoped for by the Government are not likely to be achieved. I make that prediction because of my study of world conditions. That the authors of the speech were unaware of the trend of world affairs the following paragraph shows: - </para>
                        <para>My advisers are engaged in the negotiation of prospective trade treaties with a number of foreign countries. They are of the opinion that Australia&#39;s richest overseas market Hee within the Empire and especially within the United Kingdom. But they are fully aware that in some great lines of primary commodities Australia and other dominions, taken together, yield a total production far in excess of the consumption demands of the Empire. Confronted by these conditions my Ministers will make every endeavour to trade on the friendliest terms. obtainable with all nations which are faced with similar problems. </para>
                        <para class="block">That may sound all right, but the inference is that merely by expanding trade and finding markets we shall solve our economic problems. The Labour party advocates reforms because the development of economic nationalism tends to close the channels for investment, making necessary something more than an expansion of our markets. Men like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> believe that our economic problems will be solved by a development of intra-Empire trade, and although we on this side prefer to develop trade between Australia and other portions of the Empire rather than to expand our trade with foreign countries, we realize that merely by exchanging one commodity for another we shall not solve the economic problems confronting the world. There is a general belief among the people that our economic difficulties will be solved by an expansion of trade, but if trade is merely the exchange of this commodity for that commodity we shall not find work for all our people in that way, and therefore we shall not solve the greatest economic problem - that of unemployment. Realizing  the difficulties, the Labour party advocates a change of the monetary system so that we shall be able .to utilize the credit, of the country in such a way that labour will be organized not merely for trade, but also for the development of Australia as an economic unit, thereby improving the position of the country generally. The modern capitalistic system is one of growth and development. So long as development is taking place, and money is being invested in that development, there is work to be done and the unemployment problem is not acute. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Josiah</inline> Stamp is reported to have said that between 1873 and 1923 Great Britain invested abroad &#163;8,000,000,000 of which &#163;5,000,000,000 was lost. That is to say, Britain exported commodities to the value of the first mentioned sum and lost more than half their value. My point is that while Great Britain was exporting that huge surplus of goode, the workers of that country were employed in producing them, and for that Treason unemployment was not an acute problem. Although Great Britain is. drawing from other countries millions of pounds in interest each year - and Australia is being bled by the Old Country in the matter of interest - it is returning in loans, represented by goods, more than it receives in interest, and to that extent its workers are being employed. In Australia the position is that, so long as an intensive developmental policy is in operation, our workers are employed, but with a diminution of the borrowing policy, and a consequent reduction of the labour used in the production of capital goods, there is, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Davidson,</inline> of the Bank of New South &#34;Wales, has told us, a general closing up of the avenues for investment, with the result that labour difficulties are intensified and unemployment becomes more general. The Leader of the Senate quoted certain statistics in an attempt to disabuse our minds of what he described as the false impression that there was a plethora of credit. Private individual capitalism cannot absorb the workers because of the existing worldwide depression, and also because capital development has not progressed in the same ratio as in the past. We on this side admit that bank credit can be created by the private banks when required, and that that credit can be utilized to employ labour; but even though the bank credit is there, it is not utilized to the full because the system of capitalism is not able to employ it in the development of capitalism. When private individuals, firms, and companies cannot utilize the credit of the country, or of the banks, for the development of the country and the production of capital goods, as well as for the employment of labour, there is need for governments to exercise their powers to open up channels in which the spare labour of the community can be employed. The Labour party told the electors that, if returned to power,- it would so utilize this country&#39;s credit that conditions generally would improve and the standard of living of its people would be raised. As a sheep-owner, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> knows the need for water conservation, and of the desirability of constructing a railway from north to south to connect three existing east to west railway systems in Queensland, thereby making possible the quick transport of sheep from place to place. Had the surplus labour of this country been used for purposes such as this in the past, Australia to-day would be in a much higher position as a productive unit. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> said that by expending money on non-productive works we eventually make the position worse instead of better. I agree that that has been the case in the past in some instances. During the war the credit of the community was handed over to private institutions, which, in turn, issued credits that enabled goods to be produced and the war to be prosecuted. Ex-Senator Colebatch told us that during the war both Great Britain and Australia had deliberately inflated the currency, with the result that they were able to finance the war and prosecute it to a successful end. But the war over, this accumulated paper debt, behind which there were no assets whatever, continued to involve the payment of enormous sums by way of interest. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Frank</inline> Anstey, in his pamphlet, <inline font-style="italic">The Kingdom of Shylock,</inline> states that war loans would have been unobtainable here but for the fact that the credit of Australia was utilized by the private banks so that, on the security of a bond for &#163;1,000, approved clients were able to obtain up to &#163;5,000, and even larger sums, and to draw interest in respect of those bonds, although there was nothing behind them but the productive power of the nation. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page, speaking on the Commonwealth Bank Bill, in 1924, said that the Commonwealth had during the war issued notes to private banks at 3 per&#39;&#39; cent. The banks in turn issued credit to approved clients at 4 per cent, to purchase war bonds, on which the holders drew 5 per cent, from the Government. The right honorable gentleman said that the whole matter had never been explained and it was useless now to attempt to explain it. The fact is, however, that there were no private assets behind the issue of that credit by the private banks. In that way the country was able to feed, and clothe and equip its soldiers as well as to provide for the women and children who were left behind. I feel deeply on this question. If it is possible to utilize the private banks of this country in this way in order to carry on a war, it should be possible for Australia, through the Commonwealth Bank, to issue the credit necessary to improve Australia as an economic organization, and to raise the standard of living not only of the workers, but of the producers and the community as a whole. I should be glad if, at the close of my speech, an honorable senator opposite who has studied this question would endeavour to show in what respect we have erred on this question of finance. &#34;We are ready to learn, and if it can be shown that our policy is wrong, then we shall no longer advocate it. </para>

                    <para>Great hopes are entertained in regard to the extension of our trade with other countries, and particularly with the East. The Prime Minister himself has admitted that the markets of Great Britain are becoming saturated, and that we shall have to .look elsewhere for markets for our produce and commodities. I have every respect for those who think that the opening up of new markets will solve our economic problem, but I point out that there are difficulties in the way. Recently a delegation consisting of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W,</inline> H. Austin, Under-Secretary to the Department of Labour and Industry, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomas,</inline> secretary to the Queensland Colliery Proprietors Council, was sent to the East by the Queensland Government to investigate market possibilities there. </para>
                    <para class="block">The delegation visited the Netherland East Indies, British Malaya, China, and the Philippine Islands, and its investigations do not support the views of those who say that the future in this direction is bright; that the depression has been overcome; that unemployment is being reduced, and that we&#39; have set an example to the rest of the worM by overcoming our difficulties through the instrumentality of the Premiers plan. I am not a Jeremiah; I do not wish to throw cold water on any attempt to develop trade with other countries, but I feel that to find a solution of our economic problem we have to f*&#171;&#187; the facts. </para>

I am endeavouring to point out, however, that while I hope, as a good Australian, that we shall be able to hold our markets for wool, I am fearful of what may result from the application of the brain power of Japan to the problem that confronts its people. Having regard to Japan&#39;s desire to develop Manchuria, I fear that within a few years it will be producing wool to such an extent as to very seriously affect our trade. The development of economic nationalism, not only in Asia, but throughout Europe, is such that it appears to me that the Government of Australia must follow other lines than those set out by it in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech. I am speaking in all earnestness. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> has told us that the position is better than it was. I do not deny that statement, but although there has been a slight diminution of unemployment, we cannot ignore the fact that a policy different from that placed before us by the Government must be pursued if we are to overcome our difficulties. </para>

                            <para>- I do not, but I say that in time of national emergency experiments are justifiable. The scheme we have propounded, however, would not be an experiment in the sense that it had never been tried. I repeat, that in war time what we now propose should be done for the benefit of the whole community was done for the benefit not of the people as a whole, but of a few clients of private banking companies.For years hence, the community will be bled for the payment of interest under the present system of finance. Britain to-day is paying interest in respect of money raised in connexion with the Napoleonic wars, and if the present system of finance continues, we shall be paying interest for another thousand years. </para>

                    <para>I submit that, if the community utilizes all the credit forces at its command, sufficient comfort will be ours. Since the people are not imbeciles, why can we not adopt a policy of national accountancy, a monetary system that will reflect the real credit of the community? I have here a publication issued by those so-called &#34;mad men,&#34; the supporters of the Douglas credit proposal. I am not a supporter of the Douglas credit system, but when a paper that rings true comes into my hand&#39; I endeavour to assimilate its contents. This article was written by Hilaire Belloc, a prominent figure in English literature, whose name, no doubt, is well known to honorable senators. In this paper he explains how the national debt of Great Britain was created. He says - </para>

                        <para>At the end of the year 1.692 a group of rich men, who made the politician Montague their agent, proposed to follow the method of state finance which the Dutch had founded long before, and to mortgage to their advantage the powers of government. </para>
                        <para>Montague&#39;s first proposal was put forward on Dec. IS, 1092. On January 20, 1G93, came the first regular inception of the plan, which was matured in the course of the next few months. </para>

                        <para>This was the beginning of what later came to be called the National Debt, for its special character was not merely the lending of the money to the Government, a transaction as old as history, but the novel proposal that the interest should be strictly guaranteed on the security of the national taxes, while immediately afterwards a privileged institution was called into existence, a central bank, which should have the handling of the loan and the interest, and the right to issue notes of credit  on  the security of the Government. </para>

                    <para class="block">From this we see the special character of the national debt. It was not money merely lent to the Government, but involved also a proposal that the interest on the debt should be strictly guaranteed on the security of the nation&#39;s taxes. That is the point I wish to stress. Why should private banks have the monopoly of such a loan and the interest on it, and the right to issue notes and credit on the security of the Government? We know that Great Britain&#39;s national debt has grown from a paltry &#163;1,200,000 to approximately &#163;7,800,000,000 to-day. Australia&#39;s national debt amounts to over &#163;1,000,000,000; but behind it, as behind the national debt of every country, is the security of the nation itself. No country can pay ofl its national debt. Such a debt is only on paper; but every year thousands of millions of pounds are extracted from the pockets of the people in order to pay those who own this paper debt. One of the great troubles of the world to-day is a wrong conception of wealth. </para>

                            <para>- All money is a debt. Money gives the possessor the right and the power to draw services and commodities from the community to the value of such money; the community is in debt to him to the amount of the money he holds. There is a big difference between what is known as bank credit and coins of the realm, the larger denominations of which are practically out of circulation. The gold currency in circulation years ago was real wealth. A .certain amount of energy had been required to produce the coins, which were bartered for other wealth in the form of services or commodities. To-day we have paper money, and bank credit, the power to issue which has been given to private corporations. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> has demonstrated clearly that private banks issue credit in excess of the real wealth they control. The Macmillan report showed convincingly that, under our modern banking system, it is possible for a bank possessing &#163;1,000,000 of national money to issue credit to the amount of &#163;10,000,000. That is to say, private banks have the power to monetize the frozen assets of the country, and, issuing credit to ten times the value of the real money they hold, they draw interest on that inflated or imaginary capital. If private banking institutions can and do issue credits in this way, it should be possible for a national bank to monetize the assets of the nation, and expand credit, charging for interest a mere modicum of what is being charged to-day. But the right of issuing money has practically been taken from the King and the Government, and handed over to the private banking machine. This machine has done its work very capably, making large profits for its shareholders. I am not cavilling at that, nor would any sensible man do so; but, unfortunately, the need of private banks to make money for their shareholders, has caused them to adopt a policy which has been to the detriment of the people as a whole. </para>

                            <para>- A glance at the banking statistics, particularly the rates of interest from 1914- to 1934, will show that the big banks of this country and of the United Kingdom have paid handsome dividends to their shareholders; in addition, huge sums have been placed to reserve, whilst in Australia, all of the banks have been able to erect palatial buildings for their head-quarters. The costly bank premises in Queen-street, Brisbane, suggest that the activities of the banks in creating credit and taking money from the community have been highly profitable. Because of such success in business, they have been able to call in the builders, contractors and architects, and say to them, &#34; Get busy and build us a palatial building.&#34; I have not seen a better building than the headquarters of the Commonwealth Bank in Sydney, whilst the State Savings Bank and all other banks in that city own magnificent. structures. Roughly, I would calculate that &#163;1,000,000 has been devoted to the building pf the banking premises in Queen-street, Brisbane. The modern banking system has allowed the private institutions to secure control of the supply of credit and the issue of money, which, we contend, should be the prerogative of the King and the Government. If the Government had the power to issue and control money, it would be able to employ all our people on necessary work. I am not advocating communism or socialism or any other idealistic system, but I say that if this country utilized the forces of credit through the medium of a central control, such as a Commonwealth Bank, we could employ every employable citizen in Australia, and give him a fair return for his labour. Honorable senators opposite imagine that to-day they have overcome the depression; that the world has turned a corner, and that shortly all in the economic sphere will be well. But just as we turn the corner, lo and behold, there is a shindy over the export of meat. There is a lesson to be learned from this experience. We know that <inline font-weight="bold">Major Elliot,</inline> Minister for Agriculture in the British Government, has stated that he intends to give every encouragement to the development of primary producing industries in Great Britain. Further, I know that organizations in the United Kingdom are battling hard for the restriction of meat imports from Australia. During the recent federal elections this matter was kept very quiet indeed. Next year, probably, we shall have a similar dispute over butter. We know that under the Ottawa agreement Great Britain will be able after June next to demand the restriction of the export of Australian butter to the United Kingdom. </para>

                            <para>- These developments will compel a re-orientation of the Government&#39;s attitude to these matters. If these things are taking place or are to take place, the Government should exercise its brain in an endeavour to find a new solution of &#39;the problem. The economic problem will not be solved by restricting our exports of primary produce. We hear much said of the bonds of Empire, and the crimson thread of kinship, but we know that Great Britain has made agreements with the Argentine Republic and Denmark to purchase from them agreed quantities of meat, butter and other commodities. It follows, therefore, that if the policy of economic nationalism, as laid down by <inline font-weight="bold">Major Elliot,</inline> is adopted in full by Great Britain, its effect will be felt by Australia. The same influences are at work in all countries. </para>

                            <para>- The trade agreements are being made for the purpose of safeguarding British investors. That I think is plain enough to most honorable senators. It should also be clear that if similar agreements are made with other countries, we shall soon reach the stage when one country will know exactly how many million pounds of wool, how many million pounds of butter, and what quantities of other primary or other products it can dispose of in return for trade concessions to customer countries. Since this policy must, of necessity, adversely affect the expansion of primary production in Australia, we should seek some other method to overcome our unemployment difficulties. The Labour party suggests a review of our monetary and financial policy. We contend tha&#39;t the- banking facilities of this country should be so altered as to make it possible for us to utilize the man power of Australia. </para>

It is due to the fact that he and his friends view our present economic problem from the narrow stand-point of modern capitalism.

Self-sufficiency in food production admittedly would mean a considerably reduced export trade, but the spreading economic nationalism abroad has made the export trade already precarious.

                <speech class="block">That I remind honorable senators represents the view of a conservative English newspaper, which points to the need for the adoption of means other than those put forward by this Government. With regard to the meat trade, I remind the Senate that in April last a commission, the  chairman  of which was Lord Bingley, was appointed by <inline font-weight="bold">Major Elliot,</inline> to consider future policy for the Mother Country. This commission suggested that negotiations with the dominions should be immediately commenced, and that autumn imports should be regulated in order to protect the home producer. It also suggested that the Government should consider the imposition of a monetary levy on all imported meat and that the proceeds should be distributed among the home productions. The London <inline font-style="italic">Evening News</inline> dealing with this proposal, stated that the scheme would probably have a serious effect on Britain&#39;s political relations with the dominions. The <inline font-style="italic">Manchester Guardian</inline> expressed the view that if the dominions did not agree to the scheme, compulsion might be applied. I am endeavouring to impress upon honorable senators the necessity for taking cognizance of the trend of thought in the Mother Country concerning this problem. I do not. wish to disturb unduly the nerves of honorable gentlemen opposite, but I direct their attention to the following comments which appeared in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> of recent date: - <para>The mechanization of Asia iB one of the marvels of the world&#39;s industry in the postwar years. It is not easy to realize that, in </para><para class="block">Shanghai alone, there are now 173 modern flour mills, or were a year ago; ten years ago there were only 21. The cotton &#39; mills of China. at the end of 1921 had well under 2,000,000 spindles; at the end of 1931 they had 4,500,000 spindles. In 1920, Japanese cotton spindles were employing 35,000 men and 105,000 women; ten years later they were employing 190,000 men and 809,000 women. In 1920, there were 3,668 joint stock companies incorporated in India; in 1929 there were 0.330, with a capital more than double that of the earlier date, and most of the newcomers were industrial. </para><para>We all recall the complaints made by the cotton interests of Lancashire about competition from India and Japan, and we cannot blame them for voicing their protests against policies which are ruining their trade. All the circumstances indicate that, owing to the rapid development of modern capitalism, decentralization is essential, and that when it takes place it will mean a serious diminution of international trade and render necessary a complete overhaul of our economic and financial policies. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>232</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JZD</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">FOLL, Hattil</name><name role="display">Senator FOLL</name></talker><para>- Is it not a fact- that increased prosperity in Japan will mean greater markets for our producers? </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>232</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K6P</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">BROWN, Gordon</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>- The honorable senator must know that, although Japan is expanding industrially with great rapidity, and a similar movement is taking place in Manchukuo, the latter country is practically a protectorate of Japan, and both nations are catering for their own requirements.

Whilst capitalism was developing and countries like England and the United States of America were exporting capital to other countries, the world was able to absorb its workers in various primary and secondary industries. But since practically all countries are now becoming competitors, there is urgent need for an overhaul of our financial machinery in order to fit in with the altered economic circumstances. In many directions Australia is now becoming a competitor of other countries. We are rapidly developing our secondary industries, and the  Governor-General&#39;s  Speech indicates that the Government intends to give full support to both primary and secondary industries. Leaders of thought in the Mother Country do not cavil at the development of our secondary industries, but I suggest -that if Australia, South Africa, Canada, and other primary producing countries which formerly were customers of the older industrial nations are now catering for their own requirements in the field of secondary production, there is definite need for a policy somewhat different from that outlined in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech. Unless the Government makes provision to meet the new situation, Australia must suffer in the near future. I, therefore, appeal to the Ministry to take full cognizance of world events, and so shape its policy as to enable us to meet, with a certain degree of confidence, the difficulties that confront us. It is not  sufficient  to resort to such palliatives as providing men with a few days&#39; work weekly and making arrangements for the expenditure of a paltry &#163;1,000,000 or so as a Christmas dole. We cannot expect Australia to progress under such a policy. The problem of unemployment should be dealt with in a comprehensive way, by employing people on reproductive works of national importance. I trust that as a result of the efforts which the Government proposes to make, some scheme will be placed before the Senate which will afford immediate relief to those who are so sadly in need of it. The time is rapidly approaching when the present financial system must fall to the ground. Interest can be paid to the interest mongers only so long as we continue to increase our overseas trade. Unless we can do so our load of debt and interest will become so terrific that it will be impossible for Australia to meet its liabilities. After the Great War various countries, including Great Britain, defaulted in their payments. A study of the figures shows that our national debt is sti.l increasing and that if we continue to create paper debts and issue paper credits, it will not be many years before we shall be faced with a financial cataclysm. If we attack this problem from a national standpoint we must realize that our problems cannot be solved under the present financial system. We are increasing our national debt and facing an ever increasing burden of interest. The financial system must be altered. Success cannot be achieved by intensive competition with the rest of the world, involving a further exploitation of the workers. The economic machine should be organized in the interests of the whole of the Australian people. We have already demonstrated that there is need for a change, and unless this Parliament adopts a policy in keeping with the altered conditions we shall find that the Australian people will have to submit to even greater hardships than they have experienced up to the present, and that their condition may be even worse than that of the peoples of other countries. </para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>233</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JY7</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">DUNCAN-HUGHES, John</name><name role="display">Senator DUNCAN-HUGHES</name></talker><para>.- Until to-day I had no intention of speaking on this motion, but as the debate has proceeded, various views have been expressed upon which I should like to comment, more particularly as, with the exception of the mover and seconder of the motion, there have been very few speakers on this side of the chamber, and it may be thought that the views expressed by honorable senators opposite truly represent the general feeling of the Senate. In the first place, I  should  like to refer to some of the remarks made this afternoon. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> said that the great problem we have to solve is that of unemployment. It is not, The real economic problem which we have to solve is not unemployment - although that is included in it - but how to produce at a payable price. Until we can do that production and trade must decrease, and unemployment increase. It is incorrect to say that the main problem is unemployment; that is only one phase of it. Un&#39; ess we can sell our produce overseas at a profitable price unemployment must increase. </para></talk.start><para>I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown,</inline> who was very critical concerning the operations of the trading banks, that Australia has been settled for over 150 years, and that for the greater part of that period its development has been assisted by the private banks. The Commonwealth Bank was not established until 1911. At the commencement of this century some  private banking institutions had been in existence for nearly 100 years. For instance, the Bank of New South Wales was founded in 1817. All through the nineteenth century, and long before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> and I were born, these private banking institutions were assisting the people by a sane and sound policy which has enabled Australia to be developed as it has been. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>233</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K7P</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">COLLINGS, Joseph</name><name role="display">Senator Collings</name></talker><para>- And fleecing the people, all the time. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>233</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JY7</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">DUNCAN-HUGHES, John</name><name role="display">Senator DUNCAN-HUGHES</name></talker><para>- They have not fleeced the people; statistics prove the contrary. The rise in the value of bank shares has not been such that any one could say that the rise was due to a fleecing policy, as the honorable senator suggests, or that they had made undue profits. For about 100 years before the Commonwealth Bank came into existence the private banks assisted the trade and commerce of this country. Instead of these institutions becoming stronger during this century, their operations have been severely restricted. During the latter part of the last century there were a number of amalgamations. J can also vaguely recall the bank smashes in the early &#39;nineties. If we are to study this problem intelligently, we should give credit where it is due. We all know that the Commonwealth Bank has done good work, but it should not be used as a weapon to bludgeon out of existence those private concerns which should have the same right to operate in .a free country as have other industries or undertakings. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> also said that money is thicker than blood, but I remind him that there is only one country that would introduce sentiment into business and that is that great country from which we sprang. Does any one imagine that a foreign country would treat us in any other way than from the view-point of business? Great Britain is the only country from which we can expect any sentimental consideration. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>234</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K6P</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">BROWN, Gordon</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name></talker><para>- I was showing the difficulties Great Britain is experiencing as a result of the development of a world economic system. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>234</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JY7</name.id><electorate>SOUTH AUSTRALIA</electorate><party>UAP</party><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">DUNCAN-HUGHES, John</name><name role="display">Senator DUNCAN-HUGHES</name></talker><para>- HUGHES. - I thought that the honorable senator&#39;s argument was that we could not look for anything from Great Britain but a money-grasping attitude, which would he entirely divorced from all sentiment. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>234</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K6P</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">BROWN, Gordon</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name></talker><para>- The honorable senator has misunderstood me. </para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>234</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JY7</name.id><electorate>SOUTH AUSTRALIA</electorate><party>UAP</party><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">DUNCAN-HUGHES, John</name><name role="display">Senator DUNCAN-HUGHES</name></talker><para>- HUGHES. - Great Britain is the only country which is likely to allow sentiment to weigh with it in its dealings with us. </para></talk.start><para>I now pass on to the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings,</inline> who is always able to introduce some electricity into a debate which happens to be a bit thin or is becoming rather dull. I do not pretend to agree with him on many points. That is not surprising because I do not imagine that I would ever be acceptable in a Labour constituency. One of his arguments is that we should be able to get credits for national purposes on the security of the country&#39;s production. That security has a varying value. We are able to offer as a security only such goods as are within the power of the country to produce and sell at a profit. Some persons loosely say &#34;we produce wool, wheat, sugar, butter, and other produce &#34;. Such statements are sometimes made by those who do not produce anything. I presume <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> means that the country as a whole produces wool and wheat and other primary products; but what is the value of such commodities as a security when they cannot be produced at a profit? Will any one lend money on commodities produced at a loss? Generally speaking, that is our difficulty at present. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> quoted the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone</inline> who, of course, made many speeches, but I do not think the honorable senator was wise in the quotation he selected. It was to the effect that the leisured class had never taken an honorable step for the benefit of the general community, but always in an effort to retard its progress. A good many of the leisured class were whigs, and therefore <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone&#39;s</inline> suppotters. If he said what has been attributed to him, he must have said it in a moment of extreme enthusiasm. I should like the honorable senator to let me know at what stage of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone&#39;s</inline> career he made the statement referred to. It could not have been made in his early days, when he was a conservative; and it must be remembered that he himself was of the leisured class. As I listened to the honorable senator, I though of Lord Shaftesbury, who, although the seventh earl of an old and rich family, was yet the greatest Englishman in striving to ameliorate the conditions of all who worked in factories. There is no name comparable with that of Shaftesbury - a member of the leisured class - as a benefactor of the poor, especially the poor who work in factories. Is Lord Shaftesbury an instance of the soundness of the statement attributed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone?</inline> I thought also of the great protagonists of the movement for the emancipation of the slaves ; of Wilberforce, and of Buxton - the latter the grandfather of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Fowell Buxton, a former Governor of South Australia. Both these men came from the leisured class. The Wilberforce family held the same property in Yorkshire from the 12th to the 18th century, a fact which in itself denotes that they were people of some strength and tenacity. Are these leaders of the anti-slavery movement further illustrations of the soundness of the argument that the leisured class has never been anything but a drag on the wheel of progress ? </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>234</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K7P</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">COLLINGS, Joseph</name><name role="display">Senator Collings</name></talker><para>- They were the exceptions that proved the rule. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>234</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JY7</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">DUNCAN-HUGHES, John</name><name role="display">Senator DUNCAN-HUGHES</name></talker><para>- Even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> himself would find it difficult to point to two subjects of more importance from his point of view than the abolition of slavery and the improvement of the conditions of factory workers.

The Labour party had the further advantage that the Government had been in office for three years in a time which all admit was somewhat difficult. The Government was subject to criticism by all sections of the community; among others I criticized it.

If the honorable senator wants an illustration of the British attitude towards oppressed peoples, he can find it in the treatment meted out during recent months to members of the Jewish race who have left Germany for England. Karl Marx, Lenin, and Trotski took refuge in England when expelled from their own countries. They requited such hospitality ill, because while accepting sanctuary in England, they plotted for the overthrow of the system under which they sheltered. </para></talk.start></continue><para class="block">If that is an honest return for hospitality it is one which I certainly do not care for. And, therefore, I say that if Great Britain has decided as the result of her experience of this <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kisch</inline> that he is a person it does not want to have; that it has had him once and does not want to have him again - if it practically puts him in the same position aa Trotsky has been placed by almost every country in Europe: he can hardly go anywhere - then I am fully prepared to follow the lead which Great Britain has given us, and to say that we do not want him here. If there is one thing which has shown quite clearly that he is not a desirable person to have in Australia, it is the action that he took yesterday when, the Chief Justice of Victoria having decided that he should not be allowed to land, he actually broke the law by leaping ashore when he had been ordered not to do so. A law-breaker in seeking to enter Australia! He proved himself to be a law-breaker, and that is sufficient to justify us in saying, &#34; You cannot come here, and if you can get an advertisement from the performance you have put up, you are welcome to it. It is, after all, a very poor thing to be like Trotsky, unwanted anywhere.&#34; I do not think we need worry unduly about Kisch. What was done was obviously in accordance with the law. He is obviously not a person that we require or desire here, and the sooner he gets back to his own country the better. There he will be able to write his book, to have it translated into English, and, if he is lucky, the Trade and Customs Department may allow it to be brought in here so that those interested may read what he has to say. So far as I am concerned, I shall waste no time on it. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>236</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K7P</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">COLLINGS, Joseph</name><name role="display">Senator Collings</name></talker><para>-  The honorable senator should have listened to the speech made in another place to-day by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies).</inline></para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>236</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JY7</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">DUNCAN-HUGHES, John</name><name role="display">Senator DUNCAN-HUGHES</name></talker><para>- It was impossible to hear the Attorney-General in another place, and at the same time to listen to the honorable senator.

These matters in themselves are likely to keep us steadily at work, for at any rate a year, if not more. This policy speech was brought before us after the Government had been in office for only about a fortnight, so that there was not much time for its preparation.

On page 1, great satisfaction is expressed at the visit of  His  Royal Highness the Duke of Gloucester. I am sure that satisfaction is held by the Labour party just as it is on this side of the House. Then again, take the question of unemployment: the first three paragraphs might have been prepared by Labour itself. As for the last three, they set out the principal directions in which it is intended to move. There can be no objection to them, although I should have thought that so much had been spoken and written and so many conferences had been held on the general question of unemployment and how to attack it, that &#34; the root causes, &#34; if they are going to be known, should be known by now. We have come to a time when we want in some respects to have more action by the Government and perhaps fewer speeches either by myself or anyone else. There are great as well as minor problems facing us, and I think that the country would welcome more definite and rather rapid action even if in some cases it were not to be successful. Take as an illustration of the minor difficulties the question of trade conditions in the East. For over a year we have been told that it is desirable to appoint trade commissioners in the East. Names have been called for, and I understand a large number have been received. One applicant has been appointed for New Zealand, and so far as I know, he is a very suitable man for the position. But the proposal to appoint commissioners in Batavia, Japan and parts of China, which has been endorsed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Latham&#39;s</inline> report on his visit to the East, still hangs fire. I think the matter originally came up eighteen months ago or two years ago, when there was a discussion with some commercial interests at Canberra. It seems to me that it is not a trivial matter; that it should be possible to select from the applicants a suitable man and- to let him go on with the job straight away. All these unfortunate applicants are wondering, I suppose, whether they are to be selected, or whether their names are to be pigeonholed. No elaborate policy needs to be worked out. It is merely a matter of selecting a suitable applicant for the particular job required. Nothing is gained by the matter being dragged on. It is better that a man should be sent forthwith even if later on he had to be withdrawn as unsuitable: I see no reason why an applicant is likely to become more suitable because of the delay. </para></talk.start></continue><para>On the general question of the primary and secondary industries, I do not propose to say a great deal. In this connexion I should like to congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collett</inline> on the speech which he made in moving the adoption of the Address-in-Reply. I do not agree at all with what was said to-day as to there being no cause for congratulation. It seemed to me, speaking as quite .a junior member of the chamber, as being an admirable speech to come from a member of the Senate. It was thoroughly independent, and obviously based on his own judgment, after having listened carefully to what the various sides had to say. That is the proper approach to be made to public questions in this chamber. &#39; Although I am a party man, I think this chamber should be less partisan than&#34; the other. That appears to be its chief justification. </para><para>After a year of rather unexpected prosperity in wool, we have virtually gone back, as the graph of the position will show, to the depression level of wool, which lasted for about three years before the recent pick-up. The attitude of the representatives of the Wool Council and the Growers&#39; Council which met here a fortnight ago was really that they wanted to know what the Government was going to do. They had advocated for some time a reduction in taxation as a means of assisting the industry. They had advocated tariff reductions as another means, and while there had been remissions in both these ways, they had not been as great as they should have been. They were here, in effect, to say to the Government, &#34; We are more or less up against it. We have never come to the Government for assistance ; but we cannot go on for an unlimited time under the conditions at present operating and with the prices that we are at present receiving.

That sentence is extraordinarily true; it confirms what I said earlier in my speech. Unless we can sell our surplus primary products overseas, we are not going to have prosperity in any industry - primary or secondary - or in business, and we are not going to have anything but a decrease of the number of people employed. I commend that sentence to the attention of honorable senators. It seems to sum up our industrial and trade position most clearly and soundly. </para><para>In regard to trade treaties, I have no inside knowledge of the difficulties with respect to the negotiations of these arrangements, but, speaking as an outsider, and following up the general ideas that I have held on this subject  for  years past, I think the Government is going to face the gravest difficulties in negotiating new agreements. That is obvious from the fact that the Belgian treaty, about which I inquired this afternoon, has been the subject of negotiations for from twelve to fifteen mouths, and finality has not yet been announced. A little while ago, I was urging that the Government should come to decisions more rapidly, and I repeat that suggestion in regard to the negotiation of treaties. If every trade treaty is to take from a year to two years to complete, our trade will in the meantime fall away in an alarming manner. I do not say that for the purpose of embarrassing the Government, but, speaking as an ordinary, and I hope, sensible, individual, I feel convinced that the Government will have the gravest difficulty with regard to these treaties; that in their negotiations Ministers will probably require all the assistance that can be afforded them ; that delay in dealing with them will do nothing but harm; and that it will be perfectly impossible for us to get everything, and give nothing. A stage has now been reached at which the subject of tariffs has passed altogether outside the sole decision of Australian public men and parties. &#34;We are now faced by the pressure of the world. As we have predicted for at least three years, demands  are coming to us from every side; to-day we have to face the massed determination of the peoples of the world that they will not buy from us unless we buy from them. We have to face that fact, and no amount of delay or procrastination or shirking of the issue will enable us to avoid it, and delay will probably result in out losing trade which we shall not be able to recover. I hope the Government will surmount these difficulties, because I feel that some members of it, at least, realize that we must have two-way trade. </para><para>We are very often told that the Ottawa agreement has never been anything but a drawback .to this country; that we have never got anything out of it ; that we gave everything and got nothing but generalities in return.

                    <para>. - I desire  to make a  few  remarks on the festivities held in Canberra in connexion with the recent visit of  His  Royal High ness the Duke of Gloucester. It may be safely said that, generally speaking, those festivities were successful, and I congratulate all those who were responsible for the arrangements, including the decorations, and the excellent State dinner. However, there were a few defects to which attention should be directed, in the hope that on similar occasions in future more attention will be given to certain details of hospitality. The consular representatives of foreign countries and other important guests were instructed, or invited, to assemble in the dining-room of Parliament House at 6.10 on the evening of the State dinner. They did so, but nobody was there to receive them; after standing about for nearly an hour, during which they were not offered any refreshment, they were herded together at tables in what is practically an annexe of the main dining-room. From this position it was impossible for at least half of them to see his Royal Highness or those people sitting at the top table, or to hear any of the speeches made on that occasion. That was very regrettable. At the top table, where there was a great deal of room, there were seated all the junior Ministers, some of whom had been in Parliament for only a short time, and in the Ministry for about a day, and remained Ministers for not very much longer. But the Chief Justice of Australia <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Frank Gavan Duffy),</inline> was placed at the southwestcorner of Table H, which was one of the lesser tables, a long way from the junior Ministers at the top table. I do not blame the Chief Justice for having been offended at this treatment and for having walked out of the dining-room and back to the Hotel Canberra, where he had his dinner. Then <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Stanley</inline> Argyle, the Premier of Victoria, who was mainly responsible for the Duke&#39;s visit to this country - the Premier of the State whose centenary we were celebrating - was also placed at a considerable distance from the top table, as were also the  President  of &#39;the Senate and the  Speaker  of the House of Representatives. In Great Britain the procedure adopted towards foreign diplomats, the presiding officers in the House of Lords and the House of Commons is entirely different. Most honorable senators were placed  generally with their backs to the top table instead ofbeing distributed among the various guests, whilst on the other hand I saw in very prominent places right in front of the table at which  His  Royal Highness sat, ex-members of both Houses of this Parliament and some people who had not even that distinction. How some of these people were invited to the dinner at all, is a mystery to me. But they were more prominently seated than the Chief Justice of Australia, the Premier of Victoria, the  President  of the Senate, and the  Speaker  of the House of Representatives. </para>

                <para>The arrangements for the transport of visitors after the function were also unsatisfactory. The night was dark and wet, yet distinguished visitors from Great Britain and other countries as well as consular representatives who had honoured us with their presence, had to jump down, women as well as men, from a high platform and were obliged to break our railway by-laws by crossing the rails and clambering, as best they could, into the train which was standing some distance from the station. On the following morning when we reached the Victorian border we found that the refreshment car was not attached to the train. There was again an unseemly scramble at Albury, due to the fact that  bo  many of our visitors did not know where to go. I was able to guide a number of them to the railway refreshment room, where they obtained a hurried and somewhat inferior breakfast. I should add that prior to reaching Albury, the usual courtesy of serving morning tea and light refreshments on the train was not observed. When I asked the conductor if hot water and morning tea were available - I explained that I was not so much concerned about my own needs as I was for the needs of our distinguished visitors - his reply was : &#34; There are only &#39; &#39;tothersiders &#39; on this train &#34; - the inference being that it was not customary to serve morning tea for them. Then, as I have stated, when we transferred to the Victorian train, the usual facilities for refreshment were not available to our distinguished visitors. The lack of these courtesies was not, I suggest, due to the probable cost, because we had been honored with the presence of a large number of representatives of foreign countries and other distinguished visitors, and Australians are well known for their lavish entertainment of their guests. In every other respect the arrangements for the comfort of our visitors was excellent ; but there was a definite lack of organization at the Canberra functions and I can only assume that it was due to carelessness or ignorance. I mention the matter now in the hope that, on future occasions when we may be similarly honored, there will not be a recurrence of these unfortunate if unintentional discourtesies. I have not the slightest idea who was responsible for the lack of attention to the foreign ambassadors. </para>

I do not know who was responsible for the muddle in the dining room at Canberra or on the train, but I hope that a similar mistake will not recur on any future occasion when we are again honored by a visit from some member of the Royal Family and the representatives of foreign countries. </para>

                    <para>. - I direct the attention of the Government to a matter that is causing considerable concern in the State which I have the honour to assist to represent in this chamber. I refer to&#39; the operation of Japanese sampans in North Queensland waters to which much publicity has been given in the Queensland newspapers as well as in those of the southern States. The reports state that large Japanese vessels, especially designed for pearl shell andbeche <inline font-style="italic">de mer</inline> fishing have been operating on the fishing grounds off the northern coast of Queensland, and that their presence is seriously interfering with the trade of Australian luggers engaged in that business. I understand that a prominent member of the Queensland Government has stated that a protest has been made without avail to the Commonwealth Government, and I think it should be definitely stated whether the Japanese samp ans are operating in </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Queensland territorial waters, or whether they are working in a neutral zone, and are, therefore, beyond the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Government. I am informed that, in addition to interfering with Australian vessels engaged in. that trade, the Japanese have done extensive damage to coco-nut plantations which were established on a number of the islands by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Mcllwraith, a former Premier of Queensland. These plantations are an extremely valuable asset, because on many occasions they have saved the lives of shipwrecked mariners cast ashore from vessels which had been lost in the typhoons which are experienced in northern tropical areas. The cutting down of coco-nut trees for the purpose of getting the nuts is wanton destruction because, as is well known, they will not grow again, whereas if they are not interfered with, they will last for hundreds of years, and may be the means of succouring many other shipwrecked mariners. &#34;We should have some definite information from the Government as to the position. The operations of these sampans are causing considerable alarm to the &#39; people in Northern Queensland, and, as 1 have explained, they are injuring the legitimate trade of our own luggers. Recently it was stated that, owing to the extensive nature of the work being done by these sampans, several Australian luggers have been tied up, and their employees paid off. If the sampans are operating in territorial waters over which the Commonwealth has jurisdiction, the position is serious. Requests have been made for the provision of a patrol boat or a seaplane as a precaution against intrusion by foreigners. I do not wish to exaggerate in any way the .alarm that is being caused to the people in North Queensland; but I strongly urge the Government to ascertain definitely whether the owners of these sampans are committing a breach of international law, and, if so, to take immediate steps to check them. </para>

                    <para>. - Referring to the matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll,</inline> I remind the honorable senator that a question placed on the notice- paper by one of his colleagues from Queensland was answered by the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> this afternoon. I shall have some further inquiries made from the External Affairs Department to ascertain if a more definite statement can be furnished to the honorable senator. The matter has been under the consideration of the Government for some considerable time, and I am aware that steps are being taken to keep a closer watch on these marauders, if they be marauders, in our northern waters. </para>

                <para>It is a matter of deep regret to the Government that anything, which could be construed as discourtesy, should have happened in connexion with the recent festivities in Canberra to mark the visit, of  His  Royal Highness the Duke of Gloucester to this city. I regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> did not advise me of his intention to mention the matter on the motion for the adjournment of the Senate; had he done so I could have obtained some information from the officers concerned, who may be held responsible for anything that happened. But there are one or two matters about which I did hear something, and I can assure honorable senators that, so far as the seating arrangements at the top table were concerned, the order of precedence laid down was rigidly observed. It is possible, of course, that some honorable senators have forgotten that a number of visitors occupied prominent places at the table by reason of the distinguished services which they had previously rendered to the community. I say nothing as to that. As regards the gentleman whom we do not usually discuss in this chamber or the House of Representatives, the Chief Justice of Australia, I admit that a mistake was made, but not by any officer of the Prime Minister&#39;s Department, because the seating arrangements at the dinner were arranged by an officer of that department strictly in accordance with the order of precedence. Unfortunately, some one did not recognize the truth of the old Scotch saying,  &#34;Where the MacPherson is, there&#39;s the head of the table,&#34; because, unfortunately, he startednumbering the table from the wrong end, and it is a matter of deep regret to the </para>
                <para class="block">Government that such a mistake occurred. Apparently, the officer in charge did not have an opportunity to see to this matter, but immediately it was noticed a senior member of the Ministry endeavoured to rectify the mistake, and had the numbering of seats altered. I was a witness to that unfortunate incident, which was indeed painful, and I am sure we are all sorry that such a distinguished gentleman should have been unintentionally placed in an embarrassing position. I have not previously heard of any lack of attention to the consuls of the various countries, who were with us on that occasion. &#39; We always endeavour to show them the respect due to their high and honorable position ; but I would remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guthrie</inline> that consuls do not carry ambassadorial rank. If any discourtesy was shown to them by their not being suitably received in the precincts of the building, I very much regret it. </para>
                <para>I had not previously heard of any discourtesy to you, sir, to the Premier of Victoria, or to any member of the Senate. Perhaps it would have been better, from the viewpoint of social intercourse, had the seating arrangements been made in a somewhat different way; for instance members of the legislature might have been interspersed amongst the visitors. I know nothing concerning the train service; but of course after the train had left the Federal Territory this Government was not in any way responsible for the arrangements in connexion with it. The Government, which cannot accept any responsibility, regrets that these difficulties should have arisen. </para>
