                <para class="block">Since the last meeting of the Senate, the  Hon.  David Morley Charleston, who was a member of the Senate for South Australia from 1901 to 1904, has passed away. Prior to entering the Federal Parliament, he was a member of the Legislative Council of South Australia from 1891 to 1901, except for a very short period. Probably he was unknown to the majority of the present members of this chamber, but I recollect him well as one of that remarkable band who represented South Australia in the first Senate. He died at the ripe age of 86 years. I am sure that all present will desire to express their sympathy with his relatives in their bereavement. </para>

                        <para>-I ask the Minister for Development what qualifications, if any, Dr. Gilruth possesses to enable him to make a report upon the mineral potentialities of the Northern Territory? Is it not a fact that Dr. Gilruth is attached to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research as a veterinary scientist ? If Dr. Gilruth has no qualifications that entitle him to express an opinion on the mineral potentialities of the Northern Territory, will the Government take steps to see that his mouth is closed upon such matters? </para>

                        <para>- I am not aware that Dr. Gilruth has expressed any opinion on the mineral potentialities of the Northern Territory. I understand that he has given an historical review on the subject from his view-point, and that his remarks are based upon an examination of mineral production in the Northern Territory. Perhaps at a later stage I shall have an opportunity to make a statement with respect to the publicity given to the matter. </para>

If not, why is he paid the salary he at present receives ? Is it not a fact that his opinions, which have been broadcast, are calculated to injure the future progress of the Northern Territory? </para>

                        <para>- With respect to the last point raised by the honorable senator, I admit that it is most unfortunate that publicity has been given to some of the information conveyed to one  of the bodies attached to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. Dr. Gilruth&#39;s duties are almost entirely devoted to veterinary science, and I understand that the information published was sought by a committee dealing with the chilled beef industry. </para>

                        <para>- There has been no suspension of any section of the Navigation Act in relation to ships engaged in the AustralianAmerican Pacific trade. Trade between the Commonwealth and the Territories of Papua and New Guinea was exempted from the coasting trade provisions of the act in 1925, following a recommendation by a royal commission which investigated the mutter that such was necessary to the welfare of the territory. The Australian line of steamers trading to those parts is in receipt of a substantialsubsidy for the service; consequently, it is considered that there is no real ground for any distress or anxiety on its part. </para>

This clothing is handed over from rime to time to the State Government in the State in which it accumulates, for distribution to persons in necessitous circumstances. All surplus stocks of military clothing were distributed to the unemployed some years ago. </para>

The Minister in the House of Representatives stated that strong efforts were made to come to a favorable trade agreement with Belgium within the period of six months under the temporary agreement signed in December last. A further period which will not expire until 1.5th August remains within which it is hoped that an agreement will be arrived at. </para>

                    <para>Honorable senators will recollect that, as a result of the requests of this chamber on  the  Customs Tariff Bill which was dis- cussed over a lengthy period and passed bv Parliament at the end of last year, several items in the customs tariff schedule were renumbered. In the mean- time. however, the Customs Tariff (Ex- change Adjustment) Act has been passed by  both  Houses, and in order to bring the schedule to the Customs Tariff (Exchange Adjustment) Act into line with the Customs Tariff 1933, a resolution was tabled on the 3rd November, 1933. The purpose of the present bill is to confirm that resolution, and so to adjust the schedule to the Customs Tariff (Exchange Adjustment) Act as to make it agree with the schedule to the customs tariff. I assure honorable senators that this is merely a machinery measure, which does not affect the levying of customs duties. </para>

In accordance with the Ottawa Agreement, the Customs Tariff 1933 provided fo&#39;r the free admission of certain products of the British Colonial Empire on which a duty has been imposed under the general tariff. Some of these products are produced in Papua and New Guinea, and are dutiable under the general tariff, because the products of Papua and Now Guinea are not admissible under the British preferential tariff. The present Papua and New Guinea Customs Tariff exempts from duty certain tropical products which were dutiable under the 1921- 30 tariff, and in order to extend the list to additional products which, in. the 1933 tariff, were made free when produced in British non-self-governing colonies and protectorates, proposals were tabled in this House on the 9th March and the 30th November, 1933. These proposals are now operating, and the list of commodities affected is set out in the schedule to this bill which is designed to ratify the resolutions of the dates mentioned. </para>

                    <para class="block">The purpose of this measure is to ratify the maritime conventions signed in recent years by the maritime powers of the world and to incorporate such conventions in the Navigation Act 1912-1926. The most important of these relate to the safety of life at sea and the load-line. I fee) sure that honorable senators will desire that a measure having such worthy objects shall have a speedy passage. The bill does not in any way deal with those sections of the Navigation Act which provide for the protection of Australian coastal shipping against unequal competition of overseas services. It is merely the machinery measure to implement conventions agreed upon by the nations of the world. The representatives of 30 countries, including the United Kingdom and Australia, agreed to the load-line convention in 1930, and 23 of these countries, including the principle maritime powers of the world, have since ratified it. The convention for the safety of life at sea was signed by eighteen countries, eleven of which have ratified it. It will be appreciated by honorable senators that the conventions have no legal status in any country until ratified. The text of the load-line and safety conventions is given in schedules 6 and 7 of the bill. A printed memorandum has been prepared and circulated showing by means of italics and black type the effect of the amendments proposed by the bill upon the relative sections of the principal act. </para>
                    <para>The loss of the <inline font-style="italic">Titanic</inline> in  1912  created an insistent demand for more stringent laws relating to the safety of life at sea, demonstrating as it did the need for the carrying of life-boats for all, including passengers and crew., The outbreak of the World War delayed progress in the matter, but in  1929  a number of countries, including Australia, accepted the invitation of the Governments of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in a conference which assembled in London. The object of this conference was to agree on a basis which would be acceptable to all countries for ensuring the utmost safety of life in passenger ships engaged in international trading. The present convention is the first effective international agreement on this important subject. An international voyage means, of course, a voyage from one country to another. The matter of regulating the coasting trade within its own territorial waters was left to each country to deal with. It will he gratifying to those who were associated with the earlier amendments to the Navigation Act to know that in a number of important matters provisions which are already in the act have anticipated the findings of the recent conference and the requirements of the convention. The general features of the safety provisions of the convention fall under the following heads: - (a) Construction; (fe) lifesaving appliances; (c) radio telegraphy; and <inline font-style="italic">(d)</inline> safety of navigation. There are also machinery provisions of which the principal relate to (a) certificates; and  (6)  equivalent appliances. The convention provides that the life-boats and buoyant apparatus must comply with the following conditions: - <inline font-style="italic">(a)</inline> they must be capable of being got into the water safely and rapidly; (Z&#62;) it must be possible to embark the passengers in the boats rapidly and in good order; and (c) the arrangement of each boat and article of buoyant apparatus must be such that it will not interfere with the operation of other boats and buoyant apparatus. The safety convention also provides that all ocean-going passenger ships shall, in addition to life-boats and life-jackets for all, carry light, buoyant apparatus sufficient for the support, in the water, of  25  per cent, of the persons on board. Such apparatus, in the form of light, buoyant rafts, which can be easily man-handled and thrown from the ship&#39;s deck, has, in practice, proved of great value when the. rapidity of the disaster has made it impossible to get the passengers away in the boats. Regulations annexed to the safety convention deal with the means of ingress to, and egress from, the various compartments and decks, and their lighting. </para>
                    <para>Stringent restrictions are also imposed on the carriage of dangerous goods in passenger ships, and provision is made for the carrying of fire extinguishing appliances. Both these matters are already dealt with, to some extent, in the Navigation Act. The amendments now proposed will &#39;bring the existing provisions into line with the convention. All ships engaged in international voyages, except cargo ships of less than  1,600  tons gross, are required, under the convention, to carry an efficient wireless installation, and at least one qualified operator. </para>
                    <para>At the International Load-Line Conference held in London in  1930,  an agreement was reached adopting universal rules for the assignment to ships of loadlines, fixing the limits within which they may load in different parts of the world during different seasons of the year. Representatives of  30  countries, including Australia, attended the conference. The convention, which was adopted by the conference, has, up to date, been ratified, or acceded to, by nineteen maritime countries. Its provisions will, consequently, apply to practically the whole of the merchant ships of the world. It is the first international agreement which has been made fixing loading limits for merchant ships, although there has been for some years a considerable measure of uniformity, based on the British rules, in those adopted by certain other principal maritime nations. </para>
                    <para>As will readily be understood, one of the most important factors in securing the safety of cargo ships is the enforcement of laws and regulations relating to loadlines and overloading. That so many countries have come into line on this matter is a great step forward. Incidentally, the adoption of a uniform load-line system will be of great benefit to British shipping. Previously, certain countries placed no load-line restrictions on the loading of their vessels. Their ships, therefore, could, and did, load more deeply than was permissible under British law for British ships. This was of great advantage to them, as the extra earnings amounted, on certain voyages, to thousands of pounds. The convention will make the rules in the various countries completely uniform, with a far wider application than the old system ever had. </para>
                    <para>Other conventions are dealt with in a statement which has been circulated for the information of honorable senators. Five other international conventions of relatively minor importance are also given effect by the bill. These relate to - </para>

                    <para>Mention was made in the House of Representatives of the provisions of the bill in regard to the survey of ships. It was suggested that, in the matter of survey, this bill was not &#34; on all fours &#34; with the British Merchant Shipping Act. The Government some time ago communicated with the Board of Trade in Great Britain on this particular subject and ascertained that, allowing for the essential differences between the maritime conditions prevailing in Great Britain and those prevailing in Australia, the standard of surrey provided for here was in no way inferior to the standard prevailing there. In the Merchant Shipping Act of Great Britain, four classes of surveyors are appointed under section 724, viz., ship surveyors, engineer and ship surveyors, ship (nautical) surveyors, and wireless telegraphy surveyors. The three last-mentioned have their counterparts in the surveyors anointed under the Navigation Act. </para>
                    <para>The ship surveyor is a specialist, usually a graduate in the theory of naval architecture, with added practical experience in the design and construction of ships. There are no ship surveyors on the staff of the Commonwealth marine branch, and there is no necessity for them. The special province of the ship surveyor is in the field of ship building, examining and checking plans and specifications ti secure stability and general seaworthiness, and the subsequent supervision of the actual construction of the vessel in the ship-building yard. The work usually attended to by ship surveyors in Groat Britain is divided up between the engineer and ship surveyors, and the nautical and ship surveyors on the staff. That our surveys are, in- the view of the Board of Trade, equally as efficient as its own, is shown by the fact that two of our officers - one engineer and ship surveyor and one nautical and ship surveyor - have just been formally appointed by the beard to be an engineer and ship surveyor and a ship (nautical) surveyor, respective to survey here, for a Board of Trade safety certificate, certain passenger ships registered in the United Kingdom and engaged in international voyages from Australia. This was done with a knowledge by the board of the status of these officers and of the parts they take, under our system, in the survey of ships. </para>
                    <para>The Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> has given an assurance that there is no intention whatever to limit the area of operations of engineer surveyors. He has ako undertaken to see that the demarcation of duties of the various types of marine surveyors is safeguarded in the regulations under the act. This, I feel sure, will be acceptable to honorable senators as it is to the marine industrial organizations. To a large extent, the measure is technical. It has been passed by the House of Representatives, and can, I submit, be accepted with confidence by the Senate as a definite step in the direction of bringing us into line with other countries which have already accepted those conventions. </para>

                    <para class="block">The measure relates to the proof in a court of law of statistics or abstracts thereof compiled and tabulated by the Commonwealth Statistician pursuant to section 20 of the Census and Statistics Act. In connexion with proceedings recently for an offence under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904-1930, it became necessary to prove the index numbers compiled and tabulated by the Commonwealth Statistician. The <inline font-style="italic">Quarterly Summaries of Australian Statistics</inline> containing the index numbers and purporting to be printed by the Government Printer were tendered as proof of the index numbers, counsel contending that mere production was sufficient proof, under section 9 of the (Commonwealth) Evidence Act 1905. Counsel also relied upon sections 5 and 6 of that act. The Special Magistrate held, however, that the documents were not admissible under these sections, and, in the absence of direct proof of the index numbers, they were held not to have been proved, The matter is one of some importance in relation to the enforcement of awards of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, and to facilitate proof of the index numbers it is proposed that the Evidence Act 1905 should bo amended so as to provide that evidence of any statistics or abstracts thereof compiled by the Statistician may be given by the production of a document published by the Statistician and containing those statistics. The bill is a procedure measure and relates entirely to the proof of the contents of documents containing statistics and abstracts. No question, therefore, arises as to the method of compiling those statistics. The statistics are compiled pursuant to the Census and Statistics Act, and it is highly desirable that some expeditious mode of bringing the results of the Statistician&#39;s compilations before the courts should be provided. That is the object of the bill. Before the point was successfully taken in the Arbitration Court, it was thought that the law was as is now provided in the bill. In these days, when statistics play an important part in our economic life, it is important to have a speedy method of proving certain official documents. </para>

It ill becomes the right honorable gentleman to try to be politically funny now that he has become highly respectable as a member of the United Australia party, by describing members of the Labour Opposition as advocates of communism. It is well known that the government of the day brought a legal action against the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Truth,</inline> because of its remarks about discontent and mutiny in the Royal Australian Navy in Western Australia, and that that action was dismissed with costs against the Government. The right honorable gentleman, as Minister for Defence, takes umbrage at criticism from Labour senators of the administration of his department, but surely the Defence Department is not sacrosanct. As the Minister knows, discontent in the navy is rampant. </para>
                <para>Representations were made to the Prime Minister, as the honorable member for Wilmot, after a section of the Australian Navy had been prevented from participating in the Tasmanian regatta at Hobart, although naval vessels had regularly attended the regatta for many years previously. The reason given for their absence , on the last occasion was that the men were required for naval practice at Jervis Bay and elsewhere. It is stated by many men of the lower ratings that they have suffered from severe punishment, lack of food, and general reductions of pay. Did the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir George Pearce),</inline> in his reply refer to the brand of communism advocated by Bernard Shaw in a speech that was broadcast over the air. That gentleman was invited to visit New Zealand as a guest of the citizens of that dominion, yet he made an indictment of the political system operating in New Zealand and Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Shaw,</inline> who has been honoured by being invited to garden parties given by the King, definitely stated that he was a Communist. On the other hand, a recent conference of Australian graziers, pastoralists and squatters, made representations to the Commonwealth Government, which is now led by a Labour renegade - I refer to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)-</inline></para>

                        <para>- The right honorable gentleman will no doubt have an opportunity to reply to my remarks. &#34;We find that the Graziers Association suggested to this politically pure Government that trade compacts should be made between Soviet Russia and Australia. It seems to those on the Labour side that the gold of Soviet Russia is good enough to go into the pockets of the graziers, and, later, it may go into the political funds of the United Australia party and the Country party. If the Minister for Defence replies to my comments, I hope he will say something about the history of the recent proceedings against a Sydney newspaper which condemned his administration of the navy, lock, stock and barrel. </para>

                <para>The Senate is to adjourn until tomorrow. The Government ought to be ashamed to ask honorable senators to rise before 5 o&#39;clock this afternoon, so soon after a recess of over seven months. </para>
                <para>Within the last 4S hours we have been told that the Minister in Charge of  Development  <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan)</inline> has been urged to have inquiries made as to the possibility of extracting petrol from wheat. This country produces enormous quantities of wheat which is badly needed in some countries, but, apparently, the only solution for the present difficulties of our growers is the adoption of some process to convert the grain into petrol! This Government has been backing and filling ever since it entered office. By means of pres3 propaganda, a good deal of it of a lying nature, it has endeavoured  to persuade the people that it has a definite programme for the future. ; </para>
                <para>The administrative cost of &#39; this branch of the legislature runs into tens of thousands of pounds per annum. Yet the Government can provide no work for it. I notice in the visitors&#39; gallery a number of spectators, doubtless citizens and taxpayers of New South Wales. Soon they will see members of this chamber retire to the nice apartments that have been provided for their convenience. Later, we shall  enjoy  a sub stantial dinner; but hundreds of thousands of men and women throughout Australia, whose only crime is that they have no work to do, will be hard put to it to get something to eat. </para>
                <para>The Leader of the Senate is, as usual, sneering at what I am saying. If he had to face the electors at the coming election, the reception given to him would very quickly take that smirking smile off his face. But the right honorable gentleman is secure - he has another three and a half years to go. He has been for 30 years a member of this chamber, and for a great proportion of that period has enjoyed the fruits of office. Endowed with a convenient political conscience, he has always been willing, from the inception of federation, to trim his sails to every political wind that blows, and so has been a member of various governments. He began life a3 a working carpenter and a trade unionist; but soon sacrificed all his political principles in order to make secure his place in this chamber. </para>
                <para>The right honorable gentleman this afternoon made light of the dissatisfaction among the lower ratings in the Australian Navy. No one can doubt that this discontent exists, and it is not confined to the lower deck. Quite recently, as a result of press propaganda and other pressure, the Government appointed a royal commission to inquire into the circumstances surrounding the death of LieutenantCommander A. D. Casey, a former resident of Tasmania. Perhaps it will be suggested that M. Stalin,  President  of the Soviet Republic, was in some way responsible for the death of that naval officer. It is, however, well known that he resented the many pin pricks to which he was subjected by the administration. Let the Minister for Defence smile that off when he appears before the royal commission. Let him go to Tasmania, and see how he will be received by the friends and relatives of the  deceased officer, who got such a raw deal from the higher ranks and the Naval Board, under the administration of the Leader of the Senate. </para>
                <para>In the course of a few weeks we shall, I suppose, be all on an equal footing, because then we shall be appearing before the electors, at street corners and  elsewhere, and stating our views of recent political developments. When we are out among the people, candidates representing my party will have no president to check them, and no standing orders to observe. I have no doubt about the reception that will be given to the Leader of the Senate when he appears before the people of Western Australia. </para>

                <para>Perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy,</inline> the Cromwell of the Riverina, will have something to say on this motion for the adjournment. There is ample time before the usual dinner hour. We are here to express our views on issues that come before us. At all events, I am clear about that being the reason for my presence in this chamber. If I get &#34; bumped &#34; at the coming election, there will always be the dole, or perhaps I shall again accustom myself to pick-and-shovel work. But, while I am in the Senate, tuy job is to talk about all phases of political happenings. I should like to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hardy</inline> on the conferences that are being held behind closed doors in this Parliament House between Ministers and representatives of the Country party. Can he tell us if decisions which may be reached there will have the endorsement of the rank and file of Riverina farmers? I am hoping, also, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Elliott</inline> will have something to say. That honorable gentleman, we are told, is being &#34; dumped by the powers that be in Victoria, and will not be included in the Senate team, simply because he has been sniping and sharp-shooting Ministers and supporters through the columns of the Shepparton, Castlemaine, and Mildura papers which are under his control. Perhaps he will enlighten us about the opinion of the rank and file of the Country party in Victoria concerning recent political developments. </para>
                <para>When the Leader of the Senate visits Western Australia, after the impending dissolution, to take part in the election, he will, I am sure, be again decorated with the &#34;order of the raspberry &#34; which was conferred upon him when he was in that State in connexion with the secession campaign. I would very much like to hear Senators Hardy and Elliott airing their views as to the difference of opinion in the minds of the rank and file of the Country party with regard to the alleged pact approved by the secret meeting of party leaders. I have heard it said that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page, the leader of the Country party, has no authority to commit his followers to any agreement such as has been outlined; they do not approve of this proposed rush to the country, five months before the people would, in the ordinary course of events, have an opportunity to censure this Administration for its many faults. </para>
                <para>What does the Government intend to do, before Parliament dissolves, for the farmers, and especially those who are on the dole in New South Wales? Also, what are its proposals for the relief of unemployment? It has remitted about &#163;9,000,000 of taxes to the wealthy sections of the community, and intends to set aside &#163;4,000,000 of the estimated surplus of &#163;6,000,000 for defence expenditure. Against whom is it proposed to defend this country? Is it feared that Hitler will shortly turn his attention to Australia, and cut off a few heads? What is the fear underlying this proposal for increased defence expenditure? I protest against the adjournment of the Senate at this early hour. After the long recess the Government should have business to put before honorable senators. </para>

                    <para>.- I should not have risen to speak but for the extraordinary statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn.</inline> That honorable gentleman has alleged that there is disaffection in the Australian Navy, caused by ill treatment of the lower ratings. The honorable senator addressed a question on this subject to the Minister for Defence to-day, and the reply, I thought, hit the nail on the head. The Minister suggested that the question was really inspired by a desire to create disaffection among the naval ratings. I happen to know a little about the efforts that have been made, in recent years, to cause trouble in the Australian Navy. It ill becomes <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> to make these allegations, in view of the fact that the propaganda to which I have referred is of Soviet origin, and has -been used very much &#39;by gentlemen whom he honours as his associates. I well remember when H.M.A.S. <inline font-style="italic">Australia,</inline> called at Burnie, an individual associated with the .cause supported  by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> was detected dis  tributing  Soviet literature to t;he man on guard at the gangway. The literature in his possession was issued  by  the Friends of the Soviet Union, an organization of which I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> knows something. My  only  regret is that the authorities did not take prompt action on that  &#34;Occasion  to deal with the offender. Fortunately. the literature did not reach its intended destination. It was seized by the police, but whether or not any action was taken against that individual, I do 11Ot know. </para>

                    also suggested that, as a means of punishing the men, the Australian Navy did not visit Hobart for the annual regatta this year. The explanation of the fleet&#39;s absence from the regatta was given by the Leader of the Senate
                    <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline>
                    to-day. Every intelligent resident of Hobart accepted the decision of the Naval authorities that, in the interests of the training of the men, the fleet should not visit Hobart this year. The honorable senator&#39;s suggestion that the action taken was -in the nature of punishment is ridiculous. I deplore the efforts which are continually being made to create disaffection among the personnel of the Navy, and I hope that the authorities will take strong action to deal with any individual who is&#39; found guilty of such an attempt.

                <para class="block">For some time I have been studying the <inline font-style="italic">Finance Bulletin</inline> referred to in an effort to extract information from it. In my opinion, one of the duties of a member of Parliament is to obtain, from official sources, information which will be of assistance to the public, and so far as I am aware, no honorable senator asks questions for any other reason. Had members more time at their disposal, they could possibly obtain for themselves much of the information which they now seek at question time; but since every government department contains experts, who are well versed in the matters under their control, the asking of questions -in Parliament seems to be the most satisfactory and expeditious means of obtaining reliable information. I understand that the legislation controlling banking in Australia provides that the trading banks shall supply to the Government particulars of their transactions during each year. If that is not the case, it ought to be. I thought that the information sought by me would have been readily available to the Minister. I strongly protest against the flippant answer given tome. </para>

                        <para>-I am glad to hear that interjection. Since the promise was made, the Government has announced that an election will take place in September. The wheat-growers of Australia are not willing that Parliament should adjourn before legislation to assist the wheat-growing industry has been placed on the statute-book. After a recess of about seven months, Parliament has re-assembled, and it should continue in session long enough to pass legislation for the stabilization of this important industry, and for fixing an Australian price, under the control of the growers themselves, for that portion of the Australian wheat crop which is consumed within the Commonwealth. The growers of wheat have to pay artificial Australian prices for a great many of their requirements, and, as some compensation, we should ensure to them an Australian price for that portion of their crop which is consumed in the Commonwealth. Whatever legislation is to be introduced to assist them should be placed on the statute-book before this Parliament closes. The wheat-growers of this country, who have had four years of unprofitable prices for their product, now want more than a promise that their case will be considered after the election. The legislation which, during recent years, has been introduced to assist them, has always been brought forward a short time before Parliament has gone into recess. Successive governments have, in effect, said, &#34; Here is a bill for the assistance of the wheat-growing industry; take it or leave it, there is no time to amend it&#34;. The wheat-growers do not want merely temporary relief; they ask that the industry be stabilized on a permanent basis. Government candidates at the forthcoming election will be at a great disadvantage if legislation has not been passed to assist the wheat-growing industry. Promises will not suffice; all honorable senators remember a previous unfulfilled promise of 4s. a bushel for wheat. I emphasize the need for prompt and permanent assistance to the wheat-growing industry. </para>

The employment of these 5,000 persons in South Australia has been the means of removing 20,000 persons in South Australia from the list of dole recipients. It was the intention of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holden,</inline> and also of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richards,</inline> to extend their motor body building activities, even to the point of manufacturing the steel they require; but, after spending &#163;160,000on one plant, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holden</inline> has now to submit to an examination by the Tariff Board as to whether some of the trade which he now controls should not be given to Great Britain&#34;. If the protection of the industry is reduced, Great Britain will send goods to Australia, men will be thrown out of work, dragging others with them, and the market for the commodity they are producing will thereby be depleted. This matter should interest the representatives of Tasmania in this chamber, as the Holden factory is one of the largest purchasers of Tasmanian timber, and if it is interfered with, Tasmania will be seriously affected. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly not. The Government, which has referred the matter to the Tariff Board, has already received from the board 60 reports on. other items with which it has yet, to deal. It is afraid of making a definite pronouncement with respect to this industry before the election, but honorable senators on this side of the chamber will tell the employees of the industry that their future depends upon the defeat of this Government. If the present Ministry is returned to power, it is uncertain that the industry will be carried on as at present. This protest is being made, not only iby those associated with the party to which I belong, but also by members of every other political party in South Australia. Is it suggested that all these gentlemen are wrong, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> is right, ? </para>

                        <para>- I am particularly concerned with the maintenance of the motor body building industry in South Australia. The honorable senator might very well voice a complaint with respect to Oregon against the present Government; he could not do so against the Scullin Government. I urge the Government to remove the uncertainty which at present exists in the minds of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holden</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Richards</inline> as to whether it, would be safe to extend the important industry which they are controlling. It is useless for the Government to attempt to justify its action on the ground that it is complying with the terms of the Ottawa agreement. That agreement was intended to encourage reciprocal trade within the British Empire, and not merely reciprocal trade between Australia and Great Britain. The object of the inquiry, as stated by the representatives of British manufacturers, is to place Australia in the position which it was intended to occupy under the Ottawa agreement. </para>

I submit this request, not in any party spirit, but in the earnest hope that the Government will remove the uncertainty which exists in the minds of those associated with the industry in South Australia. The Government should withdraw the reference to the Tariff Board, and leave the matter to be determined by the incoming government. </para>

I rise with a great deal of diffidence to take up the time of the Senate at this juncture, because, when it oan be avoided, honorable senators should not unduly avail themselves of the motion for adjournment to bring forward matters of public concern. I am obliged, however, to seize this opportunity to voice a very definite protest against Parliament being in recess for about seven months, during which important things have been done behind the backs of the representatives of the people. To-day, within a week of our reassembling, we were told that we must he ready to scurry into recess again, on this occasion with the object of facing the people. I suppose that I would not be believed if I said that I have not the slightest objection to this Government being sent before its masters at the earliest possible date. I believe that the Government, is already tainted with the defeatist complex and that that complex will be proved to have been well founded. </para>

                        <para>- I can understandthat the honorable senator cannot lisi.en to any comments on this subject without suspecting the critic of self-interest. It is true that I will not be affected by the results of the forthcoming election, but I may inform the honorable senator that three of his colleagues will not be here when Parliament reassembles, because Queensland will definitely return three Labour men to the Senate at the next election as it did on the last occasion. I have four years yet to serve, but I am protesting, as I have done on previous occasions, against the disgraceful waste of time which has occurred. Parliament has been in recess for many months and the Government now proposes to hustle the business through in the shortest possible time. To-day, the AssistantMinister moved the second reading of a bill of considerable proportions and importance, which we are asked to pass without having had sufficient time to consider it. Other important measures to be brought before the Senate to-morrow will be disposed of without receiving adequate attention. I cannot be accused of insincerity when I say that I do not belong to the Communist party. I am not a believer in its methods or principles but nothing will drive the people of Australia, particularly the class represented by the Australian Labour party in this chamber, into the arms of the Communist party, more speedily than the discredit which this Government is bringing upon constitutional government. As a believer in constitutional government and as* one who wishes to see Australia continue along the path of parliamentary reform, I have no hesitation in saying that we cannot keep Parliament in recess for seven months in one year and yet make the people -believe that this institution is necessary to their progress and welfare. The majority of the members of this Parliament have been busy during the recess, but the point I wish to make is that Australia either needs this Parliament or it does not. If it does need it, we should be here to do our job; we cannot do it when we are in recess. The Senate met last week for the first time this year, and, this afternoon the Leader of the chamber said that if we transact the business before us without wasting time we may catch the train from Canberra to-morrow night. </para>

                <para>I support the protest made by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes)</inline> with respect to the manner in which questions are answered by responsible Ministers. A few months ago the honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. George Lawson)</inline> and I sent a joint telegram to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> advising him that certain officials at the national broadcasting station, 4QG Brisbane, had been dismissed, and that other employees had received notice of dismissal. &#34;We said that we viewed with alarm the condition of affairs prevailing with respect to the administration of that station. A day or two later we sent another joint telegram in which we expressed our surprise that no reply had been received, and asked that for the time being matters be allowed to remain as they were. To that message we received the following telegram on the 11th May from the Prime Minister : - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>Reference your telegram 10 May Acting Postmaster-General had advised me that no changes are being made in departmental staff station 4QG. Possibly your telegram refers to men employed by Australian Broadcasting Commission. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">That was most unsatisfactory, as our telegram made it perfectly clear that we were referring to dismissals and further threatened  disratings  and dismissals of employees of the 4QG broadcasting station, and not to the mechanical employees under the control of the Postmaster-General. Everyone knows of the terrorist condition&#39;s brought about by the present general manager, <inline font-weight="bold">Major Conder.</inline> No such trouble was experienced under the management of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> P. Williams, whose regrettable death occurred about eighteen months ago. Since the present general manager assumed control the conditions have been most unsatisfactory. Station 4QG was established ten or more years ago, under the control and ownership of the State of Queensland. During that time it has built up a considerable staff. The first manager was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> J. Robinson, a highly capable officer, who had previously been in charge of 2FO Sydney, which was formerly conducted by Farmers Limited. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robinson</inline> was brought to Queensland and given supreme control. The Premier of the day, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore,</inline> said that he knew nothing about, wireless, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robinson</inline> was asked to take complete charge. &#34;If you fall down on the job &#34;, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Theodore</inline> said, &#34; it will bc your funeral.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robinson</inline> so conducted that station that it became a revenue-producing concern, although we are sometimes told&#39; that a State enterprise cannot prosper with a Labour government in power. All the spade-work was accomplished, and a capable staff was organized. <inline font-weight="bold">Major Conder</inline> himself, when he became  General Manager of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, wrote personal letters to a large number of the staff, thanking them for their loyal and successful services, and asking them te carry on their good work. Se remarked that although they were only temporary employees, they would be confirmed in their positions as soon as possible. Yet their appointments have never been confirmed. On the contrary, wholesale dismissals have occurred. 1 have nothing to say against the commission system of control, but it is doubtful whether it can be satisfactory under the present conditions. The members of  the  commission are only part-time employees; they have private commercial interests, and are merely paid a small salary for a part-time job. Probably a better system would be to have a smaller body composed of full-time men, each an expert in his particular department. They should be paid adequate salaries. 1 also suggest that divided control of the technical and broadcasting branches is unwise. At present the Postmaster-General controls the technical side, while the programmes and this artists are under the direction of the  commission. <inline font-style="italic">T</inline> shall relate a few of the things that have happened in Queensland under the new control; similar things have occurred, in Sydney and other parts of Australia. Ono of the innovations made by <inline font-weight="bold">Major Condor</inline> has been to send touring  artists of various kinds to the national broad casts stations. I suggest that if their services are worth retaining, they could give their performances at one bf the important southern stations in Melbourne or Sydney, and the landlines of the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department could be utilized for the purpose of relaying the programmes to 4QG and other stations. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Major Conder</inline> sends these artists from one capital city to another,, and they are  broadcast from 4QG often after they have been heard by Queensland listeners who are able to tune in to Melbourne or Sydney. These artists are ordered to Queensland, regardless of expense, and consequently we cannot obtain engagements for our local artists of greater ability. </para>
                <para>I shall also refer to glaring incidents in regard to the staff that was built up in Queensland before the advent of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Conder. Mr. Harry</inline> Borrodale,  one of Queensland&#39;s leading elocutionists, has had lengthy theatrical and broadcasting experience, but he wa3 summarily dismissed from the position of announcer. I am personally acquainted with this gentleman, and I consider that, as an elocutionist, he has no superior in Australia. That is generally admitted by those who are in a position to express an opinion regarding him. No reason was given for his dismissal, and he was replaced by a son of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alexander</inline> Gordon, from Sydney. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gordon&#39;s</inline> work cannot be compared with that of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Borrodale,  but he is paid more for his work than had been received by his predecessor. Miss Olive Donoghue commenced work with 4QG as a girl. She advanced gradually, and became first a senior typist and then treasurer.  Her  work was of a high standard. <inline font-weight="bold">Major Conder</inline> wrote to her last Christmas, complimenting her on her splendid work, and asking her to continue it. He also sent her a gold medallion brooch as a gift from the commission. Yet a few months later she was coolly dismissed, and another girl was sent from Sydney to replace her. <inline font-weight="bold">Major Conder</inline> had the temerity to demand the return of the medallion, but this request was refused. At Christmas she was congratulated on her work and on her loyalty and efficiency, but in April, she was called into the office of the divisional manager and was informed that as <inline font-weight="bold">Major Conder</inline> was sending <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> girl from the south she would have to leave. Later she asked for notice in writing, but this was refused.  Her  work was more than satisfactory, and drew praise from the secretary of the Commission. Despite her years of service, she was mercilessly &#34; sacked &#34; to make room for somebody without experience to whom <inline font-weight="bold">Major Conder</inline> desired to give a position. This roughshod treatment should not be tolerated. Miss </para>
                <para class="block">Donoghue should be immediately reinstated. I despatched a telegram to the Postmaster-General before her dismissal, for it had come to my ears that another woman was to be given her position. </para>
                <para>
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stanley</inline>
                    Phillips, Queensland&#39;s best sporting commentator, was humbugged by the commission for several weeks, and the threat of dismissal was held, over him. A B class station made an offer to him and he went to it, taking with him thousands of A class listeners.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. David</inline>
                    Felsman  manager of the programme department, and a first class officer with years of service - I have known him since he was a lad - was disrated to the post of relieving announcer, and his position was handed to a junior official with no experience and less ability in the matter of compiling programmes. In recent months a number of artists have been unloaded upon Queensland. Maggie  Teyte,  Tudor Davies and Yelland Richards arrived from England under contract to J. and N. Tait. They appeared in Melbourne in public, but their season was a hopeless failure. They were then booked by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Major Conder</inline>
                    and sent on tour of Australia at &#163;165 a week. If their performances had been worth listening to, which they were not, they could have been relayed from Melbourne. Their salaries were not paid directly to the artists, but were handed over to J. C. Williamson Limited, which firm, I should say, obviously brought them out to Australia, unloading them upon the commission when they had proved a box office failure. These artists were sent to Queensland after local programmes had been arranged, and the divisional manager knew nothing of their pending arrival, which upset the whole of the advertised programmes for a considerable time ahead.
                </para>
                <para>Some time ago <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> asked a question about the military band which performed under <inline font-weight="bold">Major Adkins.</inline> I intend to ask for a statement as to the financial result of the tour of this band. After it had visited the capital cities, it was unloaded upon the national broadcasting stations throughout Australia in order, no doubt, to cover up the fact that its tour had resulted in a heavy financial loss. The broadcasting stations had to take the band after the public had had its fill of it, and the fees paid to it for broadcasting helped to reduce the loss on the tour. I shall also tell honorable senators what happened to two Queensland artists of Australian-wide repute, about whose qualifications there is no doubt whatever. Arthur Sharman, a brilliant Brisbane pianist, left for London, where he studied for some time. Before returning to Australia he wrote to the commission stating some of the works which he could perform.  His  letter, with full details, was personally handed to <inline font-weight="bold">Major Conder,</inline> who stated that he would arrange recitals by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sharman.</inline> On his return to Australia <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sharman</inline> was informed chat the commission had never heard of him. A B class station quickly took him up, and he is now in the employ of one of the principal B class stations. Ruth Portrate,  one of Queensland&#39;s brilliant sopranos, returned to Australia after a successful season abroad, during the course of which she appeared at the British Broadcasting Commission&#39;s studios and as principal soprano with the Carla Rosa Opera Company. On reaching Sydney she approached the commission, interviewed <inline font-weight="bold">Major Conder</inline> and was told that she would be given engagements. She waited in Sydney at her own expense for three weeks and refused other lucrative engagements, on the strength of the general manager&#39;s assurance to her. No letter was forwarded to her, and in disgust she left for her home. </para>
                <para>I understand that the Auditor-General has been asked to investigate some of the matters to which I am now about to refer. When it was decided to refit and refurnish 4QG, Brisbane, the general manager visited that city, called in a firm of decorators and furnishers, and ordered work and material running into a cost of about &#163;1,400 without calling for quotations from other firms. The decorations, carpets, &#38;c, were chosen by <inline font-weight="bold">Major Conder.</inline> When the refurnishing was complete, he again visited Brisbane, and, apparently, not caring for the carpets he himself had chosen a few weeks previously, bad them replaced by more expensive carpets sent up from the south. </para>
                <para class="block">Because he did not like the painting which had been done, he had it done again at much additional cost, in spite of the fact that he had himself ordered it only a few weeks previously. On one occasion, the general manager was requested hy the staff to provide a small and inexpensive ice chest for the benefit of the employees. However, their request was refused as positively unnecessary, and nothing more was said about the subject. But what happened? Subsequently, a very lavish and expensive electric refrigerator was purchased at a high cost and sent to the station. So elaborate was this piece of machinery that it had to he installed in special quarters. There was no excuse whatever for the purchase of an expensive electric refrigerator, especially as the original request was for an exceedingly modest household ice chest.

                    <para>. -  I support the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> concerning the position of the motor body building industry in South Australia. Holdens and Richards&#39;, with subsidiary industries, in Adelaide give employment to about  7,000  persons. So it will be realized that this enterprise is of great importance to South Australia, where the number of unemployed is greater than in any other State. South Australia is really in a very bad way, and it would be a calamity if any action by the. Government, acting on the advice of the Tariff Board, jeopardized the motor-body industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holden</inline> has, I believe, stated that tariff reduction would mean the closing of the works. Is Parliament to accept willy nilly the recommendations of the Tariff Board ? Will members of this Parliament allow  5,000  men to be thrown out of work merely to give preference to Britain in respect of certain tariff items? If the tariff is altered there will be a heavy increase of imported motor bodies, to the destruction of the South Australian industry. Even if the number of workers displaced were only  2.000,  it would be a serious addition to the total number of unemployed in that State, and the extra workless persons would be a further burden on the taxpayers. The Government should declare emphatically that Parliament, and not, the Tariff Board, has the final say in these matters. The Tariff Board should simply be an advisory body. Surely Ministers do not expect members  if this Parliament to accept, without question, the .decisions of the Tariff Board. The secondary industries of this country should have adequate protection. In this matter the people of Australia will support their representatives in this chamber. If we accept all recommendations of the Tariff Board, the investment of capital in secondary industries will decline. This Parliament should give every encouragement to the management of establishments like those of Holden and Richards to increase their plant and provide more employment for our people. Any one who has visited Holdens&#39; . works must have been impressed with the highly efficient system of mass production in operation there. We have not yet been informed of the Government&#39;s intention, but according to a statement by the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. White)</inline> not long ago, it is proposed to accept the recommendations of the Tariff Board. If the report in this instance should recommend a reduction of customs duties, an important Australian industry will be at the mercy of competitors in Great Britain. Our experience in connexion with the Ottawa Agreement,&#39; as it has affected other Australian industries, should convince us of the folly of accepting the Tariff Board&#39;s recommendations in this matter. If, as the result, of government action, following .advice from the board, the motor-body building industry in South Australia is destroyed, it, will be a serious reflection upon this Parliament. Even if the House of Representatives should agree to a reduction of duties, I hope that the donate will be strong enough to reject the proposals. It has done this on other occasions, and the issue in this case is so important that it should not hesitate to do so again. Every member of this Parliament should do all that lies in his power to protect Australian industries, especially during this period of depression. We should not heed the dictates of an outside body. If the Government interferes with this South Australian industry, its candidates will be punished when they appear before the electors. If Ministers wish to help our primary industries, they should ensure that secondary industries have adequate protection so that they may widen the field of employment and thus increase the home market for the sale of primary products. We shall not be doing that if we agree to any proposal to give a further concession to the United Kingdom in connexion with the manufacture of motor bodies. When the Scullin Government was in power, a request was made for an increase of 12 per cent, in the duty on motor-car bodies. This additional protection, it was urged, would enable Australian firms to meet overseas competition. The necessary encouragement having been given, the industry made wonderful strides. Before long it was exporting bodies, and, in an overseas exhibition, actually won first prize. Surely an industry which has become so efficient and gives employment to so many thousands of Australian artisans should be given every consideration. A few weeks ago, I visited the West Coast district of South Australia where I was distressed to find the farmers in a deplorable state. Many of them are still living in the bag houses which they built when they took up land there many years ago. These men are broken financially and in spirit; they are without hope. Numbers of farmers have already walked off their farms, and others will soon follow their example if assistance is not forthcoming promptly. I speak with personal knowledge of the conditions in South Australia, although I understand that in the other States also many farmers are in a bad way. For many months, South Australia has been practically without rain ; I do not know whether any rain has fallen within the last few days in that State. </para>

                    (Queensland) f5. 55&#93;. - The country is entitled to an explanation of the decision of the: Government to hold an election in September, on a date which, apparently, has not yet been finally decided. It is ridiculous that, after a recess of nearly seven months, mid before any business of importance has 1,een &#39;brought before Parliament, the Government should decide to appeal to the electors. Why could not tuc Government&#39;s budget proposals have been ready for Parliament when it met? The explanation probably is that the United Australia party and the Country party lui ve not yet composed their differences. Only about ten weeks remain before the election, and if, as is rumoured, the budget is not to be introduced until the first week of August, a short and strenuous election campaign is inevitable. One would expect the present Government, which is controlled largely from Melbourne and Tasmania, to desire to remain in office during the centenary celebrations in Victoria, and the visit of the Duke of Gloucester. Its decision to hold an election in September is inexplicable, and shows an utter contempt for the parliamentary institution. The two political parties which are now negotiating for a working arrangement have been wrangling for years, yet they expect the electors to accept them as a united party. One recollects the charge of &#34; gross treachery &#34; hurled by the Country party against that party with which it now seeks to unite. I would be lacking in my duty if I failed to protest against the treatment of Parliament by the Government. The royal visitor should not be expected . to come to Australia immediately after what may be a bitter election campaign.

                    PEARCE.I suppose that a Labour government does right by design and not by accident. Let us study the example set by the Queensland Labour Government, which is not hampered by a legislative council. Listening to some honorable senators opposite one would imagine that a Labour government does not go into recess at all. The Queensland Labour Government went into recess before this Parliament; it has not yet re-assembled,  and, according to the latest report, will not meet until
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Forgan</inline>
                    Smith, who is now enjoying himself abroad, returns to Queensland. In the opinion of some honorable senators opposite a parliamentary recess is a crime when proposed by a government consisting of members of the United Australia party, hut a virtue when proposed by a Labour government.

                <para>In reply to the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hoare</inline> I assure the Senate that the Government has no sinister intention towards the motor body industry, and I know of no government proposal calculated to injure it. I was interested, as I am sure were all honorable senators on this side of the chamber, to hear that when the Scullin Government was in office, the industry in South Australia got into such a condition that only 400 men were employed, and that 5,000 men are now engaged. That is a wonderful proof of the return of prosperity due to the confidence which this Government has restored in Australia. Surely when the men engaged in the industry have these facts brought under their notice, they will have no fear of the future, but will do all they can to ensure that there is no change of government. </para>
                <para>The Government. is as much concerned as is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> in keeping the farmers on their farms, and will take such action as is necessary in that direction. On two previous occasions it acted in time to give the wheat-growers relief when it was needed, and in connexion with the coming harvest the Government, in this or the next Parliament, will see that whatever assistance is rendered is given at the proper time. </para>
                <para>The Leader of the Opposition complained of the answer given to a question by the Minister representing the Treasurer in this chamber. I do not think it fair that the country should be put to the expense of obtaining information that is not contained in official documents. The Government should not be expected to employ some one to glean information that is readily available to any one who takes the trouble to apply to the right source. Official answers are given on official figures. The reply to the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition was that information on the basis desired by the honorable senator was not officially compiled, and that the only particulars of banking officially compiled were those prepared by the Statistician, which were contained in the bulletin, the number of which was given. If the Government were to do as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> has suggested some one would have to be employed to search at libraries or other sources for information that could be gathered by the private secretary to the honorable senator. </para>
                <para>I sympathize with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> in his suggestion that I should appear before the electors of Western Australia before whom the honorable senator himself has recently appeared. I understand from reports that he had quite an arctic reception, so cool indeed that when he returned he referred to the people of Western Australia in anything but flattering terms. The honorable senator&#39;s mission to Western Australia was most unsuccessful. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator referred to the prosecution of a newspaper which goes under the name of the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Truth,</inline> and he attempted to justify his attitude because a certain prosecution failed. Prom his point of view, he could not have mentioned a more unfortunate case. If honorable senators read the report of that case, they will find that in the summing up, the point was made that the prosecution had proved that the article complained of had been published, and that it was calculated to cause disaffection. A conviction would have been recorded but for the defence advanced that the article had been published without the knowledge of the publisher. That&#39; was the only reason why the prosecution failed. It was an instance of the gutter press, if not the communistic press, publishing a report about an alleged strike at Port Melbourne. No such strike occurred. Honorable senators must know that on no fewer than three occasions, reports have been published of alleged strikes in the navy, although no strikes took place. Surely, we must look for the motive for action of this kind. The motive in the case of the communists is clear. They publish these reports because they wish a strike to occur ; they desire to cause disaffection in the Royal Australian Navy. I suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bunn</inline> is doing a disservice to this country by repeating in this chamber, under the guise of asking questions, press reports which have been proved to be false. In doing this, he is taking a dangerous course. Nobody imagines that there are not some discontented men in every service, and it. is unwise to suggest to them that the way to redress their grievances is to go on strike. Generally speaking, the Australian .Navy is a contented service, and nobody should know that better than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn,</inline> because he has sent to me probably more letters than any other member of Parliament from men who were in the navy and are now trying to get back into it. I refer, not to men who have been expelled from the navy, but to those who were retrenched when the expenditure on the navy was reduced, and to others whose service had expired. They were members of the service when the conditions were not so good as they are to-day, for they have been improved out of all recognition within the last two years. Men who knew the navy under worse conditions are now trying to return to it, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> has been asking me to take them back ; but he now tries to make it appear that this is a discontented Service. If be is sincere in the statements made by him this afternoon, and wishes to deal honestly with these men, he should advise them not to attempt to rejoin the navy. Nevertheless, he has asked that their claims should be given every consideration, and, ,1 may SAY, full consideration will be given to each case. </para>

                    are receiving applications from able-bodied young men who are anxious to serve their country in the navy. The conditions on these ships are not unknown. The vessels travel from State to State, and the members of their crews mix with the civil population, with the result that their comrades on shore receive information as&#39; to conditions in the Service. If these conditions were such as has been suggested to-day by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn,</inline>
                    is it likely that hundreds of young men would be anxious to join the navy? The very fact that large numbers of recruits are offering shows that tb* men are well treated. We should not make any arm of the defence forces the sport of party politics. During the time I have been Minister for Defence, and particularly in the last two years, I have deliberately refrained from attempting to make political capital out of defence policy. In Sydney, a few months ago, when I outlined the Government&#39;s defence policy, I appealed to the electors not to allow this to be made a - party question. If it docs become a party issue, speeches such as that made by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline>
                    to-day will be made again, merely to discredit the government that happens to be in power. I suggest to the honorable senator that when he reads his speech in
                    <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline>
                    he will realize that he has cast a slur on the Australian Navy by suggesting that the men are discontented. The Government believes that they are proudly serving their country, and it has tried to give them the best conditions that Australia can afford.
