                    <para class="block">This bill provides for an appropriation  of £176,000  to cover expenditure on various works and services for which provision was not made in  the  budget for the current financial year. Appropriations already passed by Parliament for expenditure on works from loan and from revenue, and available for expenditure during the current financial year, exceed  £4,250,000.  As that amount  is  a considerable increase on the amount expended  on  such services during the last  financial  year  it  will materially assist  in the  alleviation of the unemployment problem. </para>
                    <para>The bill now before the Senate will provide the appropriation necessary to carry out a number of additional works and services which are of such a nature as to enable the works to be put in hand immediately so that employment may be found before Christmas for a large number of men who are at present unemployed. Moreover, the character of the proposed works is such that the greater portion of the expenditure will be required for labour rather than for materials. </para>
                    <para>The schedule to the bill indicates under four headings the nature of the works upon which the money will be expended. Of the total, the sum of £154,000 will be expended on works and services in the various States, and will be distributed practically on a population basis. The sum of £12,000 is being allotted for works and services in the Federal Capital Territory, £4,000 for undertakings in the Northern Territory, and an additional amount of £6,000 for New South Wales to be expended in the construction of dips for cattle tick control. The last mentioned amount is to be supplemented by a contribution of £4,400 by the Government of New South Wales. </para>
                    <para>The total amount proposed to be appropriated will be divided among a large number of comparatively small works distributed throughout the Commonwealth. At this stage it is impracticable to furnish details of such works, but I hope to be able to furnish further particulars when the bill is in committee. </para>
                    <para>I emphasize that these works do not, of themselves, constitute a complete works programme; they are merely supplementary to the already large works programme which is now being carried out under appropriations amounting to £4,250,000, which have already been passed by Parliament. The works covered by this bill are mostly of a class that can be put in hand without the necessity for the preparation of detailed plans and specifications, which would involve considerable time. In order to obviate the delays caused by calling for tenders, the work will, so far as possible, be carried out by day labour under the direction of the Commonwealth Works Branch. Of the total amount to be appropriated, approximately £65,000 will be expended in New South Wales, £42,000 in Victoria, £23,000 in Queensland, £12,000 in South Australia, £10,000 inWestern Australia, £6,000 in Tasmania, £12,000 in the Federal Capital Territory, and £4,000 in the Northern Territory. As the passing of this hill will enable work to be given during the next few weeks to a considerable number of men who are at present unemployed, it is hoped that it will be passed through all stages without lengthy discussion, so that the works may be commenced as soon as possible. </para>

                        <para>.- I am glad that at last the Government has bestirred itself sufficiently to introduce a bill for the carrying out of works which will provide some measure of relief to unemployed men, who otherwise could anticipate only a dismal Christmas season. For that reason, I shall not delay the passage of the bill; but I should like a definite assurance from the Minister that the works to be undertaken by the Commonwealth will be carried out under the direction of its own Works Branch. In the past, large sums of Commonwealth money have been expended by the States upon relief conditions which provided for only a couple of days' work for a man in each week. I hope that that system will not operate in connexion with the expenditure of this money, but that the Commonwealth itself will undertake the works and pay award rates to those engaged on them. When this Parliament appropriates money for the purpose of relieving unemployment, it is not right that that money should be applied by the States, or by local governing bodies in the States, merely as a means of granting relief to hungry men, who are paid about 22s. for two days' work a week, and are expected to subsist on that sum for an indefinite period. If the money is to be expended by the Commonwealth, under its own control, and the men to be engaged are paid proper rates of pay, I shall be satisfied to allow the bill to be passed as quickly as possible in order that the men may be set to work. </para>

                    <para class="block">Government candidates, as well as newspapers supporting the Government, promised that if the Lyons Ministry were returned, it would undertake such works as would usher in a new era in this country. Now, it appears that the Government's programme comprises no great undertakings, for only a comparatively small sum is to be appropriated under this measure. We, on this side, while accepting the measure of relief to be provided, look for something more. Under the present economic system, men must starve ifthere is no work for themto do. I look forward to the day when every man will have an assured income whether or not work is made available for him. That may appear to some honorable senators a somewhat revolutionary proposal, but it is the opinion of many distinguished visitors to this country, one of whom was so impressed with the potentialities of Australia that he said recently that four hours' work a day would probably be sufficient to provide for the needs of the nation. I ask leave to continue my remarks at a later stage. </para>

My answer is that we have good reason to be vigorous  in  our complaint that the Government has not put forward any common sense suggestion for the solution of the problem. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> smiled when I mentioned a few moments ago that, although in this country we have an abundance of all that is necessary for the well being of the people, the position, unfortunately, is that only those who have a private income or employment can obtain the wherewithal to satisfy their requirements. Unfortunately although the land is overflowing with foodstuffs and all that the people require, society in its lack of wisdom says, " We are very sorry there is not work for all to do, but those for whom there is not work to do must starve." That such an attitude should be taken up shows that we have not reached a very high state of civilization. </para>

As the result of this action it is hoped that there will be a reduction of £10,000,000 a year in the imports of these commodities within the next few years. </para>

The Queensland Government, through the Minister for Mines, has done splendid work by expending several thousands of pounds in fitting out members of the unemployed to engage in prospecting. In that way profitable employment has been found for quite a number of men. That is a very important consideration. </para>

                        <para>- It has everything to do with it. My desire is that the money for which this bill provides shall be spent in a way that will be most serviceable to the unemployed and to the country. If men are employed merely in producing commodities on the export of which restrictions already exist, little benefit will result. Money should be used to provide employment in producing goods that will find a ready market in other parts of the world. I have taken advantage of this schedule to drive home my point. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Rivett's</inline> pamphlet should bring home to Ministers and the people generally that the Government, instead of only playing and tinkering with the problem of unemployment, should exercise its ability and administrative powers in the organization of gold production on an efficient basis, gold being more acceptable in other parts of the world than our primary products. Action in that direction would prove far more effective than the Government's present policy of trying to find work for the unemployed by spending a few thousand pounds on repainting and titivating public buildings. </para>

                    <para>. - I am very glad that the Government is providing a sum of £176,000 for the relief of unemployment before Christmas, but I agree with the previous  speaker  that this amount is very small and falls far short of what the people expected to follow the return of the Lyons Government to office. Although I listened carefully to the Minister's speech I am still unaware of the basis on which this money has been apportioned. It appears that the allocations have not been based on either population or area, or partly on population and partly on area as were previous grants, such as those for road construction. Only £10,000 of this amount is to be allocated to Western Australia, which in area forms one-third of the Commonwealth, and possesses only one-fifteenth of the population of Australia to develop it ! If area were taken into consideration Western Australia should receive one-third of the total amount, and if only half the total grant were distributed on a population basis, and half on area, it would be entitled to receive one-sixth of the amount. Yet Western Australia is given no consideration for its huge area, and for the fact that it is comparatively undeveloped. It is given a paltry £10,000. Is it any wonder that the people of that State want to secede from the 'federation? </para>

                        <para>- They would govern Western Australia well. At the State luncheon to-day I heard one of the distinguished visitors from New Zealand praise Canberra - Australia's tragedy - the place for whose development the rest of Australia is being bled white, and for the expenditure on which no return is shown. It is all very well for a° gentleman coming from a dominion which had the good sense to keep out of the Australian federation to praise the beautiful result of the huge expenditure at Canberra, but the people of Australia are suffering under excessive and unnecessary federal taxation to keep it going. Of this grant for the relief of unemployment, £12,000 is to be devoted to works in the Federal Capital Territory - this little, useless capital where every act of government administration could be done more efficiently and economically in one of the State capitals. But this Territory is to receive £12,000, whereas to one-third of the Commonwealth - Western Australia - a mere £10,000 is to be granted. I inform our distinguished visitors that this action is typical of the attitude of the Federal Parliament to Western Australia. A study of the whole of the federal expenditure would reveal that we have invariably been treated in this fashion. The gentleman from New Zealand admires,as I do, the rose gardens of Canberra, but I remind him that the people of Australia have to pay for them to the amount of at least £30,000 annually. This capital city is to have wonderful buildings to house the arts and sciences, but people struggling in the outlying parts of the Commonwealth who can never enjoy these beauties have to pay for them. This measure is typical of the Government's attitude to Western Australia. Of the small amount of £176,000, the Federal Capital is to receive £12,000, whilst one-third of the Commonwealth - the most undeveloped State- </para>

                        <para>- During the brief adjournment, I had an opportunity to read the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of the debate on this measure in the House of Representatives. I find that £12,000 is to be set aside for expenditure on works in the Federal Capital Territory, £4,000 for the Northern Territory, and £6,000 for the construction of cattle dips in the Grafton district of New South Wales, but only £10,000 for Western Australia. The distribution of the amount available is typical of the regard paid by the Commonwealth to the needs of Western Australia. Although that State has one-fifteenth of the population of the Commonwealth, it will receive only one-seventeenth of the sum provided in this bill. The Government would be wise to withdraw the measure, because the amount is inadequate, and bring down another bill appropriating £500,000. This sum would give employment to a considerable number of people between now and Christmas. The larger amount should also be distributed amongst States on the same basis as the federal roads grants are distributed - namely, three-fifths on a population basis, and two-fifths on an area basis. Personally, I think the most equitable basis is area alone, but I would be satisfied if the Government increased the amount to £500,000, and, in allocating it, observed the principle laid down in the act relating to federal aid roads. When one remembers that the sum provided in this bill is, in the main, for expenditure on roads, there is no reason why there should be a departure from the method of allocation observed in the Federal Aid Roads Act. </para>

                <para>I am pleased that, for the first time in legislation of this nature, the Government accepts responsibility for the construction and repair ofroads on, or approaching, Commonwealth properties. During my six years membership of the Senate, I have placed before governments many requests for the construction or repair of roads leading exclusively to Commonwealth properties, but on every occasion the responsible Ministers have declined to accept responsibility for works of that nature. Although the Commonwealth pays no rates to local-governing bodies, it has hitherto declined responsibility in respect of roads on, or leading to, Commonwealth properties; but in item 3 of the schedule to this bill, there is provision for £35,600 for the construction and repair of Commonwealth roads. This is a very important principle, which, I hope, will be recognized by the Government in future. Hitherto, the stand taken by the Commonwealth Ministers has resulted in an unfair proportion of expenditure being thrown upon individual ratepayers. The road to the Maylands aerodrome, Perth, is used entirely for Commonwealth purposes, and is in a shocking condition. Repeated requests have been made to the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> and the heads of other departments for urgent repairs to be made to it, but without avail. Consequently, when distinguished visitors have come to Western Australia, the members of the Australian Aero Club in that State have, in desperation, carried out the necessary repairs at their own expense. I should like to know whether any portion of the £35,600 provided for in item 3 of the schedule will be expended on that road, which is the worst in the metropolitan area, and is a disgrace to the Commonwealth Government. The road" to the rifle range at Swanbourne is also in urgent need of repair. The same may be said of the roads to the lighthouses at Cape Naturaliste and Cape LeeuwinSome time ago, 'the former Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart)</inline> authorized a grant of £50 for the improvement of these roads. I should like to know if further provision is made in this bill. There is also a large area of neglected Commonwealth property at Fremantle - the Henderson naval base - where, many years ago, the Commonwealth expended £1,200,000 on the commencing  of the establishment of naval dockyards and works which were to be the most up to date in Australia. Unfortunately, that project was abandoned, and the condition of the site now suggests that the federal blight, has settled over it. I hope that the Government will, without further delay, give attention to this area, and not throw responsibility for road construction and repairs on the local governing authority, which depends for much of its revenue upon rates paid by market gardeners and other producers in a small way of business. As the Commonwealth Government has now admitted the principle of maintaining roads leading to properties under its control, I hope the roads I have mentioned, as well as others, will receive proper attention. I am glad that the bill has been introduced, but I trust that, in committee, the basis of apportionment will be altered to that adopted under the federal aid roads scheme. When Commonwealth money is made available to the States it should be on the basis of area and population, and I trust that the Government will decide to apportion this amount on the same basis as the federal aid roads grant. If that is done, I shall, while Western Australia remains in the federation, be relieved of the obligation to direct attention to the callous neglect to which that State has to submit in this and in many other ways. </para>

                    <para>.- Some of the honorable senators who have spoken on this measure have suggested that the amount to be appropriated is all that the Government proposes to make available to relieve unemployment, but the Minister stated quite plainly that the amount to be provided is in addition to other appropriations yet to be made.  Unfortunately  the amount is not so large as some would like, but it. will be the means of providing some relief at Christmas. The fact that the basis of allocation is not quite the same as under the federal aid roads scheme or general loan expenditure is not of great importance in this instance. </para>

A previous Government which attempted to afford relief in this manner was ultimately defeated; but as I believe this Government is anxious to relieve the unemployment situation prior to Christmas, I trust that its objective will, to some extent, be achieved. If this amount is distributed amongst the 300,000 unemployed and their dependants, it will represent only11s. 6d. or 12s. a head which is quite inadequate.

                        <para>- I am glad to have that assurance from the Minister. Further, I trust that the Government will follow the lead given by the Scullin Government, which directed the Works Department to assist those whose need was greatest I was glad to hear the Minister say that most of the money would be expended in the payment of wages, as was the case under the Scullin Government's proposals. I am pleased also that the Commonwealth proposes to handle its own money on this occasion. I have a great admiration for the officers of the Commonwealth Works Branch, and I feel that if they control this expenditure justice will be done. </para>

                <para>I hope that the Government will follow the lead of the Scullin Government and stipulate that award rates and conditions shall be observed on all the works to be undertaken by it. Legislation passed by the several States makes possible the evasion of award conditions, particularly in regard to marginal rates of pay, and I ask the Commonwealth Government not to take advantage of that legislation to the detriment of the workers. If these conditions are observed, I shall have no complaint to make, except that the amount of money to be expended is less than is required. However, we must be thankful for small mercies - I speak as one who will soon be unemployed. The worker, who previously was not prepared to make any sacrifice, is now resigned to his fate, and is willing to accept the crumbs which fall from the master's table, but no Government should take advantage of his present frame of mind. In my opinion, the problem of unemployment is not being tackled determinedly by any government in this country. When 300,000 registered trade unionists, able and willing to work, are idle, it is time to embark on a bold programme. </para>
                <para>I was pleased to hear the Minister say that the appropriation of the amount covered by this bill is meant to be only a small contribution to the relief of unemployment before Christmas, and that a larger scheme would be introduced shortly. Unlike the Scullin Government, the present Government has a sufficient majority in both Houses of the Parliament to put through any proposals it desires. It may be that the financial institutions of the country will still place difficulties in the way; but the people believed that they would treat the present Government more leniently than a Labour government, and they recorded their votes accordingly. The Government should use its utmost endeavours to persuade those who provide the wherewithal for the carrying out of works to relieve unemployment of their duty in that direction. If governments do not tackle and solve the problem of unemployment, the unemployed themselves will tackle it, and parliaments will be dissolved and another form of administration set up. I do not wish to see that  happen; but I wonder how much longer men who are willing and anxious to work will tolerate a state of semi-starvation with  no hope for the future. The most important problem facing the Government is the relief of unemployment, and it is not too much to ask that those who control the destinies of the nation should render service to the Empire by making work available. If the Government fails, it will be because it is not big enough, or game enough, to tackle the problem. </para>

                    <para>.- The bill speaks for itself, in that it indicates the earnest desire of the Government to do something to relieve the unemployment situation before the Christmas season comes upon us. The scheme covered by this measure is of a temporary nature, and has nothing whatever to do with the Government's proposals for a larger measure of relief.  I  should like to deal generally with the subject of employment, and especially to reply to some statements made by Opposition senators. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dooley</inline> said that the States had taken advantage of the plight of the workless, and had not paid to them standard wages or observed award conditions ; but I assure him that the policy adopted by the States has done more to alleviate distress among those out of work than would have been possible under the policy which he advocated. </para>

                <para>Probably the most serious phase of the unemployment problem is its effect on the youths of this country. Unless something Ls done shortly to remedy the existing state of affairs, heaven only knows what may happen, even in Australia. I hope that Opposition senators will bear with me if I utter some home truths in this connexion.. For many years, and possibly with the best of intentions, we have slavishly followed a policy which has prevented thousands of young lads from having had an opportunity in life. Many of them have reached manhood without ever having had a chance, largely because every State has passed legislation restricting juvenile employment. Laws have been passed stipulating that, in certain industries, only one boy may be employed to every three men, and in other industries one boy to four or more men. What right have men of mature age to say that boys who, in five or six years' time, will attain the age of manhood, shall, on leaving school, be denied an opportunity to equip themselves for the responsibilities of manhood? </para>

                        <para>- I have had ideals, and I have stuck to them. Surely it is not an unworthy ideal that employment should be found for all our people, especially the youths of to-day, who will be the men of to-morrow. Unless steps are taken to find employment for them, it is impossible to say what kind of a community will exist twenty years hence. Under our State educational systems, millions of pounds have been expended in providing technical education for Australian youths, and to enable them, in the words of a leading educationist in New South Wales, " to find themselves," only to realize later, when they have left school, that our laws have closed the doors of industry against them. </para>

                        <para>- I suggest that any restriction on the employment of our young people is wrong. Who, can we reasonably anticipate, will be the homebuilders and bread-winners of Australia in the future if the boys of to-day are still to be faced with these restrictions? How can the boys of to-day fit themselves to take up such responsibilities when these restrictions are enforced? Having by law kept lads out of work until they reach the age of seventeen or eighteen years, we then declare that they shall not be employed at less than a certain wage. What employer can afford to pay the stipulated wage to a youth who, because the law has not permitted him to learn anything about it, knows nothing of the trade in which he desires to be engaged. " Payment according to age" is an absurd requirement, and has no regard whatever to ability or experience. Any day in the week, one may meet in Collins or Swanston streets, Melbourne, from 50 to 100 young men who have never done any work, and who will tell inquirers that they have applied from time to time for jobs only to be told that they are too old to be taken on since the wage fixed for their age is more than the industry concerned can afford to pay. </para>

One would imagine that it was commencing only to-day to make promises to the unemployed. This Government has been the most " promising" of which I have had experience, so far as the serious problem of unemployment is concerned. On the 10th May, 1932, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> speaking on the Unemployment Relief Works Loan Bill, made the following remarks :- </para>

                <para class="block">Two or three weeks ago, we had in the Governor-General's speech a statement to the effect that " my advisers will take steps to ascertain the root causes of unemployment." Two and a half years ago, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> said that the Government was desirous of evolving a co-operative plan as between the States and the Commonwealth that would take a long and. a short range, view of the. problem. But when is the job to be tackled? This afternoon, with the knowledge that we shall adjourn to-morrow and that there will be later on another of the series of intolerable adjournments, we are asked to pass a bill that provides for a miserable £176,000 expenditure and we are called upon to deal with it at once on the ground that it is to provide temporaryChristmas relief. When are the people responsible for the government of this country going to recognize that at least 1,000,000 are suffering from the effects ofcontinuous unemployment? This is no recent happening. In Canberra alone, we have the tragic spectacle of800 people out of work. If the whole of this £176,000 were spent here it would not represent a reasonable attempt to grapple with their problem alone. Mention of Canberra reminds me that something should be done to improve the disgraceful housing conditions at the Causeway and Molonglo. For the last two years, I have been asking for reform in this respect, but nothing has been done, or is being done other than the serving of notices to some of the unfortunate tenants of these miserable cottages that they must pay up arrears of rent or go out. </para>

We on this side have a great regard for the genial Minister in charge of this bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan),</inline> but with all respect, I say that his levity, whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> was speaking, was unworthy of him. We on this side are not setting ourselves up as the special champions of the unemployed, but because of our experience of the tragic results of unemployment, because such' education as we have was acquired in the university of hard knocks and, because we know what the unemployed to-day are suffering, we are determined that no patchwork system of relief shall be allowed to pass without criticism. We accept this bill as representing, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dooley</inline> put it, a crumb from the Government's table. It is a slight measure of improvement, but we protest that it is not an attempt to tackle the problem in a thorough going way. The Government is not dealing with the problem in anything like an effective manner and, what is more, it does not intend to deal with it. We shall adjourn a fortnight hence, meet early in the year for a few weeks, and then adjourn for some months. In the meantime nothing will be done to bring us nearer a realization of the promise made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> twoand ahalf years ago. </para>

We should be delightedthat theotherday the foundation stone of the National Library was laidhere and that the establish ment of a national university is contemplated; yet some honorable senators are continually going out of their way to misrepresent Canberra.

                        <para>- I am not suggesting that the beauty of Canberra does not appeal to the honorable senator. I am referring rather to the wisdomof the examplewhich has been set in building a national capital where the real work of the nation can be done. Is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> aware that up to the 30th June, 1932, the building of Canberra had cost £12,232,408, and that the revenue received from buildings and other sources up to that date amounted roughly to £3,000,000? In other words, the actual cost up to that time was about £9,250,000. At the same date the State debts amounted to £768,000,000, the Commonwealth debts, incurred very largely in helping the States, amounted to £386,000,000 and the railway debts of Australia totalled £352,000,000. The Sydney Harbour bridge and the Sydney city railway cost £42,000,000. Nobody declared that the expenditure on these projects was a deplorable waste of public money. </para>

                        <para>- I am replying toSenator E. B. Johnston,who was not interrupted when he advanced his arguments against the development of Canberra. One method to relieve unemploymentis not to interfere with the development ofCanberra, but to continue the policy ofprevious governments, which definitely promised the people of Canberra that they would proceed with the development of this capital and progressively transfer every Commonwealth department to the seat of government. In that waymy remarks are relevant to a debateonunemployment. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne,</inline>
                    I regret, has a most unfortunate habit of throwing out challengesto honor able senatorson this side of the chamber and then scuttling out of the way when effective replies are being made to his arguments. He said that he had many cherished ideals; perhaps his conduct represents his* ideal of the manly way of tackling a problem.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline>
                    said that honorable gentlemen on this aide of the chamber are responsible for the great tragedy of unemployment among the youths of this country. I fling back that accusation. He said that, because of the Labour party's policy, expressed through Labour governments, the number of juveniles permitted to be employed in industry to-day was in the proportion of one to three, four, or five adults, and he suggested that if the legislation embodying those provisions were abolished the unemployment situation in Australia would be immediately relieved. The strength of the honorable senator is not in hig logic; apparently a course in Euclid in his earlier days would have benefited him considerably. He does not realize that to-day there is a certain number of adults normally employed at adult wages, and in proportion to that number, a certain number of youths. Of course he realizes that there is a large number of youths unemployed, but do not all employers, whether governments or private enterprise, employ all the people for whom they can find work? Employers in private enterprise certainly will never go without employees, if they can make a profit out of employing them. If a certain number of adults is employed to-day, and employers are to be allowed to put on additional youths will not the number of employees remain practically the same as at present? Of course not.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline>
                    asked, by interjection, whether
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline>
                    was suggesting that we should encourage a policy that would assist a boy to scab on his father? The intelligent retort in reply to that interjection was that to-day the fathers are scabbing on their sons.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline>
                    knows that the opposite is true. In my home town I know of men and women who have reared families to adult age, and although on relief work themselves, are still keeping in the home their children who are also unemployed. I fail to see the force of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne's</inline>
                    contention that this difficulty can be surmounted by displacing men now employed in industry and allowing their jobs to be taken by juveniles. Among other things of which we, as a nation, can feel proud, is the fact that the percentages of women and youths employed in industry are the lowest for any country. That is particularly so in Queensland. The arguments advanced this afternoon by
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline>
                    are merely duplicates of statements made by his prototypes when Lord Shaftesbury's reform bill was being put through the House of Commons three-quarters of a century ago. It is deplorable that we have to sit here and listen to such time-worn platitudes while no sensible attempt is made by the Government to grapple with this problem. Obviously, it has no understanding whatever of the fundamental causes of unemployment, or of the basic causes of the major problems with which every country is faced to-day. Therefore, it is charitable to say that that ignorance probably accounts for the Government's incapacity to tackle these problems. I would be sorry if this bill were not passed. I have no doubt it will be passed, but at this stage, I emphasize that we on this side of the chamber accept this measure merely, as the Minister said, as an immediate attempt which can be made before Christmas to relieve some of those most seriously affected by unemployment. But we repeat our demands, as we shall at every opportunity, that the Government must not continue to fob us off with attempts like this to solve the problem of unemployment, and that it shall get down to the real job before many more weeks have elapsed for the benefit of those who are suffering most acutely and for the betterment of the nation as a whole.

                    <para>. - It is regrettable that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> could not refrain from applying a rather caustic criticism to employers as a whole. He said that employers were not likely to employ people unless they could make a profit out of them. It is within the knowledge of every <inline font-style="italic">honorable</inline> senator that multitudes of employers in the years of the depression retained many employees and engaged additional employees when they  could not possibly have been in a position to make profit out of their labour. [Quorum <inline font-style="italic">formed.]</inline> These employers took this step when they were actually operating at a loss. That applies to employers in both the primary and secondary industries. I feel sure that the honorable gentleman himself will admit that that is true, and that he made a very sweeping statement in the enthusiasm of the moment. </para>

I have taken the trouble to calculate the amount <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> of the respective populations, which the various sums will represent when distributed among the different States of the Commonwealth. The grants to Western Australia and South Australia work out at about 6d. a head of the total population in those States; in the Federal Capital Territory, the average will be more than £1 a head, and in the Northern Territory, almost £1 a head. If this money were to be expended on developmental works, such a basis might be considered fair, but where the object of the grant is to provide special work in the nature of </para>

                <para class="block">Christmas relief, I cannot see any just reason why the unemployed people in South Australia and Western Australia should receive this money at the rate of only 6d. a head, whilst those in the Northern Territory and the Federal Capital Territory are to receive it at the rate of £1 a head. Such a distribution does not seem logical, and for that reason the Minister should explain the basis on which the allocations were made. Personally, I feel that the only reasonable way to arrange this particular distribution would be on . a basis, not of population or area, but of the number of unemployed people in each part of Australia. That has not been done. I do not object to the Northern Territory being assisted and developed; in fact, I agree with other honorable senators that it is most regrettable that so little has been done in that direction. But no real developmental work will be done through the expenditure of a mere £4,000 on Christmas relief. The only way in which we can hope to achieve good results in the Northern Territory is by the appointment of a Minister who is conversant, or will make himself conversant, with its needs, and who will be constantly at his post. For years we have had the spectacle of Ministers for Internal Affairs, animated by zeal for the welfare of the people there, but because of changing political circumstances, their work was of little avail. We all remember that interest was displayed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir George</inline> Pearce, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Abbott, Mr. Parkhill</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Perkins,</inline> to mention only a few, who, following their appointment to administer the Territory, paid a visit to that vast area, but within a few weeks or months, because of changes in the Ministry, were given another portfolio. The result was that all the experience which they had gained was lost to the Commonwealth and the time which they had given to the study of Northern Territory problems was wasted. The development of the Northern Territory when it comes will not be due so much to the enterprise of chartered companies - we have not heard very much about that aspect of Government policy lately - as to the appointment of a Minister, a junior Minister if you like, who will make the study of its peculiar problems a full time and continuing job. </para>
                <para>I notice in the list of works which was supplied to members of the House of Representatives that of the amount allocated for expenditure in South Australia, £1,750 is earmarked for drainage at the Keswick Military Reserve. That item brings to -mind a very troublesome subject, and one which gave rise to more correspondence than was caused by any other subject with which I have had to deal since I became a member of this Parliament. The drain which runs through the Keswick reserve is insufficient to cope with abnormal flood waters which come down it occasionally. Complaints have been made about this drain since at least 1913. When I was a member of the House of Representatives for the division of Boothby I had brought to my notice the fact that the unfortunate people living in an avenue in the neighbourhood of the barracks - the majority of them are returned soldiers - had been flooded out on several occasions. Sometimes water inches deep flowed  through  their houses. It was my duty to see first the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bowden,</inline> the then Minister for Defence, and subsequently his successor, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Neville</inline> Howse, with a view to having that state of affairs remedied. The Defence Department which is solely concerned in this matter, wished to put in a second 5-ft. pipe drain to carry off the excessive flood waters which, at rare intervals, cause so much trouble in that neighbourhood: but it was urged that because of the rapidity with which storm waters come down the drain it would not be an effective step. The city council concerned raised objections and I, on behalf  of that body, made representations to the Government. The department relied on the opinion of its experts, but I was convinced from information placed in my hands by the district council and others concerned, that the proposal then made would not be effective. We recommended the construction of an open drain which at least would have a chance of carrying away abnormal flood waters. Speaking on this subject in the House of Representatives on the 19th August, 1925, 1 said this - . </para>
                <para>The Minister, I am pleased to say, has shown an interest in the matter, and has made provision for the work to be  proceeded  with. An additional 5-ft. pipe is to be laid. Personally </para>
                <para class="block">I have grave doubts whether this 5-ft. pipe will answer the purpose. </para>
                <para class="block">In my communication to the Minister on behalf of the district council, I put the case much more strongly than I did when speaking in the House. We were supposed to know nothing about the matter, and, as one might expect, the official view prevailed. The second 5-ft. pipe was put in to deal with the flood waters at Keswick. But again the water has come down in rushing torrents, and because the provision made for it was inadequate, it has once more flooded the residences of these people to their great discomfort and personal loss. Some years ago it was clearly demonstrated to the Government that this would be the result unless the open drain were put in. Representations have since been, or will be, made to the Government that residents who have suffered loss due to this cause, should be recompensed. I am glad that provision has been made for effective drainage, and I assume that at last the department has come round to our view on the subject. After a lapse of ten years it is some consolation to know that what one said on a particular subject has been proved, by subsequent events, to be correct, although in this case every one must deeply regret that the unfortunate residents at Keswick have again been the sufferers. I hope that the Government will also consider the fairness and  advisableness  of compensating the property-owners and occupiers, the majority of whom are returned soldiers, for the damage done by flood waters. </para>

                    <para>. - My original intention was to allow the bill a speedy passage, because its object is to make available a sum of money for expenditure on works as a little Christmas box for the unemployed in the various States. But I feel that I must point out that, as there are approximately 300,000 unemployed persons in the Commonwealth, the amount set aside represents only the value of two or three ties per man. Still it is something. Even 10s. or 15s. is acceptable to those in great need of it, as occasionally it would have been to me earlier in my life. The fact that the Government has brought down this measure is,  in itself, an acknowledgment of the  serious  condition of the working classes. We  do  not scorn this gesture of the  Government  on their behalf - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dooley</inline> and the leader of  my party <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator</inline> Barnes) reminded us this afternoon  that  similar provision was  made  during  the  regime of the Scullin Government -  but  as Labour members  we believe that the only  effective remedy for unemployment is the adoption of long-range  scientific  proposals that will gain the  respect of  the people of Australia. One can hardly doubt that our parliamentary  system  of government, in respect of unemployment problems at all events, is on  its trial.  If we fail to agree upon  a_  satisfactory solution of the present trouble, the existing system of government may be displaced by another perhaps in  the  form of industrial councils, having for their objective the continued employment of the people on works  of  an enduring character. Geographical parliaments, as we now know them,  may  be  swept  away. I offer this suggestion  in the  nature of a warning to the Government and its supporters, and I hope that those who constitute the large majority  which  the Ministry commands in both Houses, will realize their responsibility  in  this matter. There has  been  . much talk of proposals to deal  with  unemployment, and the Government has retained the services of a former Minister of wide experience, one who  may be  regarded as the fifteenth Minister  in the  Cabinet, to formulate proposals for submission to this Parliament. But  I fear that  there is little reason to hope that  this  Government will handle the situation in the way advocated by the Labour party for so many years, and as  the  Scullin Government would have  dealt  with it but for the hostile majority in the Senate three or four years ago. </para>

                        <para>-  I do not sub.scribe to that view because railways are essential in wet weather, and also for safe and comfortable travelling. Despite all this talk about expenditure on the unification of railway gauges, and other urgent public works, this Government is not likely to do very much because its masters outside appear to think that expenditure on relief works, an arrangement that was much favoured in the time of our grandfathers, meets the situation. We have to remember, however, that there are in Australia approximately 300,000 persons out of work and living from hand to mouth as a direct result of the Government's disregard of their welfare and the anarchistic state of our economic structure. </para>

                        <para>- It may have dropped temporarily, but the honorable senator is aware that during one recent year the increased return from Australian wool alone amounted to £17,000,000. Whenever the subject of unemployment is under discussion in this chamber, the members of" the Labour party urge the necessity for a general reconstruction of our economic and financial system; but honorable senators opposite, who are as deeply steeped in  toryism  as were the men of 4.0 or 50 years ago, are always opposed to any reform, and consequently have no means of determining the value of the Labour party's proposals. If some determined attempt is not made to prevent the recurring curse of unemployment, and so bring about a general improvement of the conditions under which many persons in Australia are compelled to live, our parliamentary system must eventually collapse. </para>

Three or four months ago, I despatched a letter to a somewhat distinguished gentleman in England, a distant relative of mine, who, when replying, asked me the meaning of the agitation for secession in Western Australia. I propose to send him a copy of the Co.se <inline font-style="italic">for Union,</inline> which- will give him the facts. As he holds Western Aus- - tralian stock and the other members of his family hold Victorian stock, he is interested in Australian affairs. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. MacDonald</inline> should convey to that gentleman the views he heard expressed in this chamber, it might not be of advantage to Western Australia. </para>

I understand that only about £22,000 is to be expended in Queensland, which, compared with the expenditure by the Queensland Government of over £5,000,000 last year, and the proposed expenditure this financial year of over £6,000,000 is a mere drop in the bucket. The population, of Queensland is about one-seventh of that of the whole Commonwealth, and therefore, on a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis, the allocation, for Queensland should be £25,142.28, which, in- view of the substantial measure of relief necessary, is entirely inadequate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>

                <para class="block">Payne appears to have reached that period in his life when he should ask an economist to sub-edit the remarks he proposes to make. In advocating the employment of boy labour, he is suggesting something repugnant to the average Australian. The wholesale employment of boys, when unemployment is so general among their fathers, would result only in throwing their fathers out of work. I have known men. in government departments in Queensland who  are  stronger and even healthier than I am, but who have been compelled to retire at 65 years of age. I know of a youth, seventeen years of age, who, after passing the Commonwealth Public Service examination, had to make the momentous decision of whether he would enter the Service or accept employment in private enterprise. He accepted the latter, but when he reached 21, he was sacked. </para>

                        <para>- That would be the logical outcome of the honorable senator's suggestion. The absence of remunerative employment is ruining many youths, not only in Australia, but also in Great Britain. According to a cablegram received by a Melbourne newspaper, 75 per cent. of 100,000 men who offered themselves as recruits in the British army were rejected. That was due almost entirely to the conditions under which the people in Great Britain are compelled to live. Many men in Great Britain are short in stature and poorly nourished, in consequence of the economic conditions which prevail. These conditions may eventually be responsible for the downfall of the British Empire. </para>

                <para>On another occasion I may deal further with this subject, but I pass on now to the report of the committee appointed to inquire into the proposal to establish in Australiaa plantfor the production of oil from coal by the hydrogenation process. I mention this subject because the successful extraction of oil from coal would open up an avenue of employment for large numbers of our people. Each year Australia pays to other countries about £10,000,000 for motive spirit. The people of Australia generally desire that experiments shall be conducted with a view to finding means of extracting oil from coal in the event of flow oil not being found in this country. The Governor-General's Speech mentioned the unification of railway gauges, reafforestation, and water storage as proposals which the Government had under consideration with the object of providing work; I mention the extraction of oil from coal as another means of stimulating employment. The report of the committee to which I have referred states under the heading "Availability of suitable Coal Supplies " - </para>

                    <para>It may be taken as definitely proved that there are in Australia ample supplies of bituminous coal thoroughly well suited for the production of liquid fuels by treatment with hydrogen gas under appropriate conditions of temperature and pressure and in the presence of catalysts capable of bringing about the desired chemical changes at a satisfactory rate. The proof of this is available in numerous tests carried out in the laboratories of Imperial Chemical Industries Limited and at the Fuel Research Station of the British Department of Scientific and Industrial Research at East Greenwich. Parts of Australia are, as a matter of fact, particularly well provided with black coals quite as well adapted for treatment as are those which are being used at the present time in Great Britain in the large scale work just mentioned, at  Billingham </para>

                    <para>It seems to us, in the light of this position, that it would be folly to initiate any establishment of plant in Australia until this invaluable Dillingham experiment is completed. Certainly Imperial Chemical Industries could not be expected to expend money on what would be no more than a wholly unnecessary repetition of an experiment already in progress in Great Britain. . . Improved technique is steadily making possible an increased yield of petrol with corresponding reduction in the output of hydrocarbon gases, representing a decided improvement in the economics of hydrogenation. </para>

                <para class="block">Those of us who visualized our coal deposits .providing employment for our people are disappointed that the committee does not recommend the erection of a hydrogenation plant. The people of Australia are inquiring whether outside interests are delaying the search for oil in Australia. I have received a letter from the Rockhampton Chamber of Commerce suggesting that investigations be carried out on the Blair Athol field, where the deposits of coal are known to be at least  443,000,000  tons. I should like the Minister to give the Senate an assurance that this matter will be kept before the Government. If the Billing- ham experiments prove  successful, no  time should  be  lost in erecting  plants to  extract  oil  from coal  in Australia, because  in that way not only would  practically  one-third of the interest on  the national  debt be saved, but work  would also  be found for thousands of  Australians.  The proposals covered  by this  bill, although welcome,  will not provide  more than  a  small Christmas  box to  the unemployed of this country.  What  is wanted is that the Government  shall  direct its attention to big proposals  such  as I have mentioned, for,  if successful,  they would assist materially  in reducing  unemployment. </para>

                    <para>. - In discussing a bill of this nature  honorable  senators should not adopt  a parochial  view. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> asked whether the allocation to the  States had  been made on a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis  or according  to population or area.  If it were on  an area basis the honorable senator  would  no doubt be pleased, for in that  case  Western Australia would receive  about  one-third of the amount  to be  appropriated. During the  honorable  senator's speech  I  interjected  that  although Western Australia  is a large  State, much of it has a  low rainfall,  and can be classed only  as poor  country, some of it almost  desert, incapable  of carrying more  than one .head  of cattle to  200  or  300  square  miles. Information  supplied in the  House of  Representatives indicates that most  of the  works to be undertaken with  the money  to be appropriated under  this bill are  already long overdue. For a  number of  years, particularly since the  Scullin Government  came into office  in 1929, the  defences of this country have  been sadly  neglected. Rifle ranges, parade  grounds,  drill halls, and other necessary  units of  a defence system have been  allowed to  get into shocking disrepair, and  I am,  therefore, glad that attention is  to  be  given  to them. The Tasmanian  allocation  will be expended on repairs to  various  post offices and rifle ranges, road  construction  in the vicinity of the aerodrome  on  King Island, and renovations to  war service  homes. Indeed, an examination  of  the works proposed to  be undertaken  in the several States  reveals  that most of them are  long overdue. </para>

                <para class="block">I join  issue  with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> from Western Australia - whom I am glad to  see fully  restored to health and able to  take  his seat in this chamber again -  in his  references to the Commonwealth.  I am a  native-born son of Tasmania, and  am  proud to represent it in the Senate,  but I am  first of all an Australian. I cannot forget that some twenty years ago,  as a  member of the 15th Battalion of  the  A.I.F., which consisted of Queenslanders and Tasmanians, I was associated with the chummy 16th Battalion,  which  came from the State of Western Australia. No finer battalion ever trod  this  earth. Physically, mentally, and in  every  other respect they were a magnificent body of men. The great bulk of them came from the goldfields, and all were  good  Australians. I cannot believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> was expressing the views of the people of Western Australia when,  he  spoke as he did this afternoon  with  regard to secession. Secession is unthinkable. We in this island continent  are  Australians first of all. There  is a  legislative remedy for all our ills,  and the  good sense of the majority of  the  people of this great country will  see  that every portion of it gets a fair  and  just deal. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> was rather unfortunate in his reference to the disabilities and wrongs of his State. One might retort in a way that would be effective, but rather unpleasant, by reminding him that the Commonwealth carried out its part of the bargain with regard to the construction of the East-West railway, but that Western Australia has not yet carried out its portion  of the  bargain by laying down a uniform gauge line from Kalgoorlie to Perth. That, however, is a subject that has nothing to do with this bill, and I shall  not  pursue it. I would ask the honorable senator, however, to keep all these things  in  mind and to take a big broad Australian view rather than the small parochial view of this great question. Surely we should not be parochial in dealing with this bill, debating it merely from  the  point of view of the expenditure  to  be made in the several States, and entering into a somewhat acrimonious discussion as to whether the expenditure should  be  distributed on a population or  an area  basis. I am afraid that  my  own little State would suffer if either of those principles were adopted, and I therefore shall not advocate either of them. The schedule to the bill itself shows how the money is to be expended. It is to be regretted that interstate feeling on the question of secession should have been imported into this debate. The bill contains no reference to secession, and secession, I repeat, is absolutely unthinkable. In 1914 I was a Tasmanian, but after the 25th April, 1915, thank God, I, in common with hundreds and thousands of others, became an Australian, and I hold that in the consideration of all these matters we should adopt a truly Australian attitude. We come from different States, it is true, but we are the same in speech, in blood, in race and tradition, and to talk of secession is not only utterly futile, but also absolutely unAustralian. Such talk will not get us anywhere. </para>

It is pitiful and pathetic that hundreds and thousands of the rising generation should be out of work.

These boys have done everything their parents have asked of them. They have passed from' the State schools to the secondary schools, and some have even graduated from our universities, yet we have nothing to offer them.

                    <para>. - I do not propose to go down to the lower levels that have been sounded by some honorable senators during this debate, nor to try to reach the higher ranges which have also marked this discussion, but I intend to offer a few observations on the apparent misconception in the minds of some honorable senators regarding the scope and intention of this measure. The bill, as I indicated when moving the second reading, is a mere palliative. It will give a certain measure of relief between now and the end of the year, but is not intended to represent the policy of the Government in regard to unemployment. That policy must have much greater consideration and will be brought down to this chamber after mature deliberation. I do not propose to discuss the root causes of unemployment which our honorable friends opposite are prepared so quickly and readily to determine. I would point out to them, however, that their brothers in the various State parliaments have failed to do anything; though theirs is the duty in the first place to deal with unemployment within their own borders, they have failed to provide any solution for this most distressing problem. Even those who claim to be greater than Lenin will find, if they look at the condition of affairs in the country where his principles apply to-day, that the situation is there more distressful than that which applies in Australia. In Russia conditions of hunger and suffering unparalleled in the rest of the world prevail. With such an example before us it would ill become us to consider those measures which have been indicated by certain honorable senators opposite, and which, if applied to Australia, would result in a still greater degree of suffering on the part of those whom my honorable friends desire to serve. It is the deep concern of this Government, as it must be the deep concern of every government, that the unemployed position shall be remedied as speedily as possible, but to apply a remedy that would make the last condition of these people worse than the present would be utter folly. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator probably moves in a circle that knows more of Rasputin than I do. I am dealing not with Rasputin, but with a question of principle. It has been suggested that this is only a temporary measure. I admit that it is. I do not put it forward as representing even the works policy of the Government to assist the unemployed. I have already explained the reason for its introduction at this juncture. It has been said that it is an exceedingly modest effort compared with what has been done by the States. I point out in the first place that it is a mere palliative, and in the second place that we have not the facilities for spending money that are available to the States. The States control water supply, railways and other large enterprises with which the Commonwealth does not deal, and in respect of these they can engage in a good deal of expenditure. May I say to the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes),</inline> that this is merely an appropriation bill to enable £176,000 to be expended in the relief of unemployment by the end of the year, and that the usual conditions will prevail. The expenditure will be entirely under the control of the Commonwealth Works Department, and none of those pranks which some one suggested was played by another distinguished government, whose name I have forgotten, will be indulged in. </para>

                        <para>- Then, shall I say that none of the pranks which it intended to play will be resorted to by this Government in the expenditure of this money. Before the Christmas recess, 1 shall place before honorable senators the major proposals of the Government to deal with this problem in its wider sphere. Much has been said in this debate concerning the basis upon which the various grants have been allocated. In dealing with a hurried measure of this kind, it was almost impossible to consider the merits of any scientific system such as one honorable gentleman suggested for allocation of the money between the States. </para>

                <para>In arranging the distribution among the States, the claims of the Federal Capital Territory and the Northern Territory were not taken into consideration, and in respect of them no estimate was made on a basis of either population or area. If an area basis had been adopted in respect of the Northern Territory, which is the concern of the Commonwealth alone, the Commonwealth might have retained a larger share for expenditure in that area. So far as the Federal Capital Territory is concerned, the ordinary annual Estimates were pruned and  repruned  with the result that an amount of approximately £12,000 was refused for works within the Territory which the Department of the Interior considered essential. In allocating these grants, the Government endeavoured to rectify that decrease in the Estimates for the Federal Capital Territory. The grant of £4,000 for expenditure in the Northern Territory will be devoted to the construction and repair of roads and approaches to various centres. Had we distributed this money on a population basis, Western Australia, which is now to receive £10,702, would have got only £9,940. Had we adopted as a basis the numbers of unemployed in the respective areas, Western Australia, because of its favorable position in this respect, would have received only between £8,000 and £9,000. </para>

                    <para>. - I feel constrained to say a few words of comment on the motion that the Senate shall adjourn until Tuesday week. When I reached Canberra to-day and examined the notice-paper for the Senate, Ifound that it was completely bare of Government business. The only business listed was in the form of five questions by private members and the usual three contingent notices of motion. I anticipated when this chamber adjourned the week before last that there would not be much legislation to consider when it resumed this week, and I ventured to suggest privately that rather than summon members from all parts of Australia when there was no work to do, the preferable course would be to carry a motion authorizing the  President  to summon members when there was business for this chamber to transact. This is the fifth sitting day of the Senate since the opening of the new Parliament, and on three occasions this chamber rose before 6 o'clock. I do not wish to stress this aspect of the matter too much, but I remind Ministers that it is no light thing for members from the more distant States to attend in Canberra unless there is business to be done. It is comparatively easy for Ministers, who, perhaps are required to remain in Canberra to administer their departments, and it is relatively easy for those senators from New South Wales and Victoria who can reach this city by train in a few hours; but the position is quite different with senators representing Queensland, Tasmania or my own State. Senators from Western Australia seem to have no chance of returning to their State at all during a session. They have to come here at the opening of Parliament and stay here or in one of the nearer capital cities until the legislature adjourns. Therefore, in this matter, I am speaking more directly for the representatives from Tasmania, Queensland, and South Australia. I must confess that I find it fatiguing to be obliged to spend as I did the week before last, and as I shall probably have to do this week, four nights out of five travelling in a train, unless such a course is necessary for the transaction of public business. Furthermore, it is not reasonable to State governments which allow us free passages over their railway lines unless there is good cause for it. Of course, I do not for a moment begrudge attendance in Parliament when my duties require it. On this point I am sure that I can speak on behalf of other senators also. I have always held that it is the duty of a member of Parliament to attend when Parliament is sitting, and ever since </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">I have been a member of this legislature, I have kept my absences down to a minimum. We are paid to be here and should attend when Parliament is sitting. But members may fairly expect that the difficulties of attendance will receive some consideration, and that they will not be brought here, as they were a fortnight ago and again this week, for the purpose of sitting merely for a few hours and then being told that they are at liberty to return to their homes a thousand miles or more away and remain there for a fortnight. As most of us have other work to do, I do not think we should be justified in remaining here for perhaps ten or fourteen days doing nothing. The inevitable result of these frequent adjournments of the Senate is that at the end of a session we are involved in a hopeless rush when legislation is being fairly shovelled before us in a way that makes it impossible for us to thoroughly master the details. I do not suggest that this is the fault of any party in this Parliament. The fault is probably common to all governments and parties. No doubt, it is desirable, from the point of view of a ministry, that members who are in the habit of offering embarrassing criticism should not' have too many opportunities to do so. I am, however, afraid that this way of conducting the business of the Senate is liable to bring this chamber into a certain amount of disrepute. I do not say that this is the fault of Senate Ministers, although I think the Government could, if it wished, initiate more legislation in this chamber. In the sheep industry, as some honorable senators are no doubt aware, it is regarded as one of the first essentials if the work is to be conducted smoothly, that the station-owner or manager should, during shearing, keep the sheep up to the shearer. That principle, I suggest, might, with advantage, be applied by Ministers in this chamber. Speaking figuratively, we are called together to shear something - to consider and criticize legislation designed for the public good - and it is to be deplored that, as in the case of the indifferent station-manager, there is now no work for us to do. I presume that, as it is stated that Parliament will soon be adjourning until early in </para>
                <para class="block">February, there is no likelihood of there being a great rush of legislation before .we adjourn, as has happened in the past, but that many of the measures contemplated may be postponed over the Christmas vacation. It is, however, inevitable that certain bills will require consideration before we adjourn. To obviate future difficulties due to the rush of legislation at the end of a session, I suggest that, as we are dependent upon the House of Representatives for the supply of the necessary " sheep " to be shorn, the Government should adopt the practice of the House of Commons, which, in order to ensure the passage of bills within a reasonable time, works to a schedule; that is to say it fixes the time by which the various stages of particular bills must be completed. At the appointed time the guillotine is applied, a vote is taken, and the measure is completed. As the number of members in the Senate is not large, and some honorable gentlemen do not speak very often, I would prefer the guillotine to be applied after reasonable discussion of a bill, instead of having an interminable discussion on subjects in general and then a tremendous rush of work at the end of every session. The adoption of the House of Commons practice would, I believe, be a good way out of our difficulties. I conclude by expressing the hope that the Government will consider the suggestion which has been made to it several times privately, and which I now make publicly because nothing appears to have been done. As, under existing arrangements, Senate Ministers cannot say definitely when there will be work for us to do, I think it would be better, on occasions like this, if the  President  were authorized to send telegrams to honorable senators advising them when their presence was required for the transaction of public business. This would be preferable to requiring them to spend so much time travelling about Australia to no purpose. </para>

                    <para>.- It is regrettable that, because of the state of public business in the House of Representatives, the Senate again finds itself with no work to do. I do not charge the representatives of the Ministry in this chamber with neglect, or with a desire  to  embarrass or inconvenience honorable senators. Apparently, it is not their fault ; but . the responsibility must rest upon the shoulders of some one. Parliament has now been sitting for some weeks, but effect has not been given to the promises made prior to the general elections, and prominent amongst which was the immediate relief of unemployment. Honorable senators are compelled to travel long distances to attend the Senate only to find that the work which they are required to do occupies only a few hours. Thousands of people throughout Australia are awaiting almost with palpitating hearts for the Government to honour its promises, particularly with respect to unemployment. The Opposition in this chamber is not sufficiently strong to embarrass the Government. The Ministry is embarrassed by its own- </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. Parliament has been sitting for only a few weeks, but the Prime Minister now finds that he cannot give effect to the policy which he enunciated prior to the last general election, and that criticisms are being indulged in not only by the members of the Opposition, but also by  his  own supporters. I believe that the Prime Minister, who would die rather than break a promise to a pal, now has to admit that he cannot do what he undertook to do. The right honorable gentleman, who said that the tariff would not be tampered with by his Government, finds that owing to the exigencies of the political situation the protection policy may possibly be destroyed. It has been stated in the press that certain tariff board reports, which were deliberately suppressed prior to the elections, will shortly be made public. How can a government, which includes the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> and other members of the Country party, submit a definite policy to Parliament? The Prime Minister retires at night, and returns to duty next morning to find that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Page</inline> has spent the night in compiling further tariff amendments. I know that the Post.masterGeneral <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan)</inline> is doing his best in very difficult circumstances; but on a previous occasion </para>

It is now proposed that the Senate shall re-assemble on the 11th December and, according to the  press  which controls this Government, Parliament will go into recess on the 14th of that month. Apparently, the Government intend to ask the Senate to dispose of, within three days, whatever legislation is dealt with by the House of Representatives between now and the 11th December.

As was mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes),</inline> honorable senators will be expected within three days to dispose of business which had occupied the House of Representatives for several weeks. There are several contributing factors, one of which the Leader of the Opposition conveniently ignored. He blamed certain individuals in another branch of the legislature, but he refrained from mentioning others who are really responsible. I read the proceedings of this Parliament carefully, and I know that much time is wasted by the Opposition merely with the object of preventing legislation from being brought forward. </para>

It is time that these petty tactics ceased, and all joined to place on the statute-book legislation of value to Australia. </para>

                        <para>- The amendment moved to the Address-in-Reply was merely party political propaganda. I have no objection to the Governor-General's Speech being discussed on ite merits, but it is wrong to waste time with unnecessary amendments. I hope that in future members of the Opposition in this chamber will confer with their fellow members in the other branch of the legislature with a view to avoiding unnecessary delays in dealing with legislation. </para>

                    <para>. - Honorable senators should not be called together unless there is work for them to do. I desire to attend every sitting of the Senate, but I object to being brought here for one day's work after an adjournment for thirteen days, and then, because there is no business before the Senate, having to spend another thirteen days awaiting a further call to Canberra. I left Fremantle on the 8 th November, although, had I travelled overland, instead of by steamer, I could have left a day or two later, and reached here as soon. On the day on which I arrived in Sydney, intending to proceed at once to Canberra, the Senate adjourned for thirteen days. Now, after one day's sitting, it is proposed to adjourn for another thirteen days. The main business of the Senate will not begin until the 11th December, so that I could have remained in Western Australia another four weeks and still have reached here in time to participate in the business of the Senate. I realize that, because of constitutional difficulties, and the provisions of the Standing Orders, certain classes of legislation must be initiated in the House of Representatives. </para>

                        <para>-Surely it is possible to initiate more legislation in this chamber than is done now! I am concerned about what is likely to happen when we meet on the 11th December, because it is reported in the press that Parliament is to adjourn a few days later. Although I desire to be home for Christmas, I would prefer to stay here aird attend in a proper manner to the work that comes before us rather than that the business of the Senate should be rushed through without proper consideration being given to it. The Government has promised to introduce measures providing for rural rehabilitation, the relief of farmers, the appointment of an interstate commission, and other important matters. I hope that, when they come before us, honorable senators will have an opportunity to read and consider them, before being asked to record their votes. On. several occasions legislation for the relief of wheat-growers has been brought before us in the closing hours of a session, and we have been forced to sit all night to deal with it, without having had a proper chance to understand its provisions. After a long sitting, honorable senators are unable to grasp the finer points of the legislation placed before them, and they are unable ro consult those whom it vitally concerns. </para>

                <para class="block">If, when we again meet, there is any attempt to show undue haste in dealing with the matters that come before us, I shall support any attempt to secure the adjournment of the debate in order to allow sufficient time for adequate consideration. I favour the abolition of the Federal Parliament altogether, but so long as it continues I shall oppose the abolition of the Senate. The worst enemies of the Senate are not those persons who advocate from the soap box the abolition of this august  chamber,  but those who, in the Senate, are prepared to allow legislation to pass without proper consideration being given to it. Members of the Senate have a duty to perform in the review of legislation passed by the House of Representatives, and the protection, of the rights of the weaker State.?. "What chance is there of dealing with legislation when the Standing Orders are suspended to enable bills to be passed through all their stages with, but honorable senators having a full knowledge of their contents, and an opportunity to consult those most concerned ? I  hope  that the Government will heed the protests of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DuncanHughes</inline> and others, and not call the Senate together unless there is work for it to do. Senators from Western Australia have to spend five days in trains to reach Canberra, and it is irritating to find no work to do when we get here.

                    <para>. - When the Senate meets again on the 11th December, very little time will remain before Christmas to deal with the legislation which will come before it. We have not been told what business will be submitted to us when we re-assemble, although I assume that we shall be asked to deal with the budget and the Appropriation Bill. There is no mention of any tariff proposal being brought before us. As a matter of fact, the Government does not know where it is. For the last two months it has been engaged in making cabinets rather than in preparing legislation. Three different cabinets have been formed within the last eight -weeks. On the 16th September - the day after the general election - the Government knew what the result would be, and, i" view of its promises during the campaign, it should have got to work straight away. Instead of that, it has been forming cabinets - a pleasing job to those who remain in, but very unpleasant for those who fall out. In Victoria, 25 years ago, a non-Labour party with a substantial majority in both Houses formed so many cabinets that there was scarcely a member of either House who did not at one time or another hold office. It is rumour*"4 that the present Government, as cotstructed by the cabinet makers, is not satisfactory to the two parties involved, so that when we meet next February the process of cabinet making will probably continue, and the business of the country will again be held up. Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes,</inline> who rarely addresses the Senate without making a suggestion, I propose to put forward something in the way of an innovation, although I fear it will not meet with the approval of the majority. Following Aristotle's idea of how a country should be ruled - that there should be rotation of office - I say that there should be a rotation of members on the ministerial bench, and particularly in this chamber. Such a change would have a very healthy effect upon the conduct of Ministers in the Senate. If, for instance, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan</inline> knew that in any event he would have to go out of office within a year of his having joined the Ministry, he would be more ready to fight for the rights of the Senate. I am an abolitionist, but while the Senate exists its rights ae a States' House and chamber of review should be preserved. </para>

                        <para>- For a number of reasons, which time will not permit me to state to-night. But given a House of Representatives plus a liberal use of the popular referendum, I think the democratic needs of this country would be met. That is what Labour intends. It would abolish this chamber, but would bring in an, instrument of redress that would meet all the requirements of a progressive democratic community like Australia. If members of the Government in this chamber knew that they could not retain office for more  than twelve months or two years, they would be more independent of their colleagues in another place and less inclined to kow-tow to the majority of the members of the Cabinet who sit in that other place. As a matter of fact, little respect is shown to this chamber; even when an honorable senator asks a question, difficulties are put in the way of an answer to it. "We do not receive the respect that is our due. If I were to submit twenty questions a day, as I might easily do if I so desired, I should perhaps expect to receive something of the treatment now meted out to us, but, as it is, there is no excuse for it. Ministers in this chamber appear to feel that their first duty is to the majority of the Cabinet sitting in another place, and they are prepared to allow the Senate to be treated just as Ministers in another place think fit. We are called here again and again only to find that there is no business ready for submission to us. It is ridiculous to suggest that there has been any obstruction on the part of the Labour party in either House. Reference has been made to the amendment to the Address-in-Reply ; but all who have spent any time in Parliament know that a debate on the Address-in-Reply gives a newly-elected government time to prepare its legislalation. In the case of a homogeneous Government, which is not quarrelling about the spoils of office, a fortnight's debate on the Address-in-Reply gives it an opportunity to prepare legislation based on the programme which it has submitted to the people. That opportunity, however, has not been availed of by the present Government, and consequently we have these frequent adjournments of the Senate. I suggest that the Government should give stronger representation to Queensland. We have over one-seventh of the population of Australia - a population verging on 1,000,000- </para>

                        <para>- As a member of the Labour party, I believe in the abolition of the Senate, but just as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Malcolm</inline> MacDonald said to-day, when dealing with the delicate matter of the restriction of trade between Australia and the Old Country, that he agreed with the principle of restriction, but recognized the difficulty of carrying it out, so, while agreeing that the Senate should be abolished as proposed by the Australian Labour party, I hope it will not be abolished until I have spent a few years as a member of it. Personally, it suits me very well to be a senator, but having regard to the way in which the Senate is treated by the Government it must  be  admitted that the game is not being played with the people of Australia. I  am  not going to say where the 'blame rests, but I am satisfied that if the present Government really had, as it claimed during the elections, a solution of our economic problems, it would before now have introduced the necessary legislation. It is unfair for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> to sal  that members of the Labour party in another place deliberately obstructed the passing of certain legislation.  His  statement is grossly inaccurate. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin</inline> has said, on several occasions, that if the Government brought down proposals that would tend to solve the unemployed problem, our party would do all in its power to give legislative effect to them. Having regard to the casual sittings of the Senate, it seems to me that its business might very well be done by correspondence. There would be no occasion then for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> to leave Western Australia. We could be informed by post of the business proposed by the Government, and could notify the Government of how we proposed to cast our votes. </para>

                    <para>. - Perhaps I am responsible, in a measure, for bringing this censure on my head. The only reason, however, for my decision a fortnight ago to re-assemble honorable senators to-day was that the Appropriation (Works and Services) Bill could be no longer delayed. Its passage through the House of Representatives had been expedited, and if honorable senators had not re-assembled to-day, it is possible that this legislation would not have become operative in time to afford the relief which the Government considers is urgently needed by the class of people whom it has been devised to assist. I realize that it is very inconvenient for honorable senators to be brought from their homes to Canberra to sit for a single day, but I had to take that risk in the absence of the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce).</inline> I knew that the legislation we have ready could not be introduced in this chamber, and, at the same time, I was doubtful as to whether the House of Representatives would have passed the Appropriation Bill in time to make it available for consideration by honorable senators to-day. </para>

                        <para>- I shall deal with that point later. Something has been said to the effect that we are not playing the game with the public. From what I have seen in the House of Representatives the "game" is being played - the political cards are being played, and nothing is being done to enable the Government to function as it should. Legislative measures are exercising the minds of Ministers night and day, but the Government is being harassed by a hydraheaded Opposition which mouths and proclaims its pity for the unemployed, and its desire to serve the people, but, at the same time, is holding up essential legislation. Thus the responsibility for this delay cannot rest on the shoulders of the Government. </para>

                        <para>- The Estimates, for instance. I understand that these have been discussed in three different ways* What sort of a " game " are those responsible for these tactics playing? An amendment was moved to reduce the first item on the Estimates by fi, and debate ensued <inline font-style="italic">ad nauseam.</inline> When that amendment was disposed of another Opposition member took advantage of the Standing Orders to move that the amount be reduced by 10s., with the result that the whole of the debate was repeated. These tactics have been continued week after week. My friends opposite smile when I point out these things; but such methods are not politically honest, and do not reflect credit on any party, or parties, responsible for them. These tactics are employed to the detriment of the people, and thereby legislation which could have been submitted to the Senate has been delayed. I cannot accept, on behalf of the Government, any responsibility for what has happened in this respect. In bringing honorable senators here to-day, I was actuated by the knowledge that the Appropriation (Works and Services) Bill had to be passed immediately in the interests of those people whom it is intended to benefit. It is provided under the Constitution that Parliament must meet within 30 days of an election. Some considerable time elapsed before the results of the election were known definitely; we met within the statutory period; the Government was re-formed, and the House of Representatives has been in session every week since. </para>

                <para>Perhaps the best course to adopt in future to avoid the inconvenience of which honorable senators have complained is that suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DuncanHughes,</inline> viz., that if business is not ready for the consideration of the Senate, its reassembly should be delayed, and members summoned later by telegram. That is the procedure adopted when the Senate is adjourning for a lengthy and indefinite period. However, in the absence of the Leader of the Senate, 1 did not care to take the responsibility of altering the practice that has been followed in the past. In fixing the 11th December as the date of resumption for the Senate, I have a fairly reliable idea of what business we shall then be asked to deal with. The measures include one or two which cannot be initiated in this Senate, because they must be preceded by a message from the Governor-General. These,  however, are not of urgent importance, and could very well wait until January or February. But there are three major matters to which this chamber will be asked to direct its attention. First, there is the larger measure of unemployment relief, which is being prepared and will have to be first considered in the House of Representatives. The second measure will deal with the wheat industry, the report on which I tabled this evening. Thirdly, there will be the Appropriation Bill, which should, be passed before the 51st December, as we have supply only to that date. </para>

                        <para>- I see unreason why the Appropriation Bill could not be passed in one day if honorable senators dealt with it expeditiously.. Information is always available on every detail of the Estimates. Usually the delay occurs, not in considering the items, but through the dissemination of political propaganda before the chambercommences to discuss the details of expenditure. It may be that honorable senators will find it impossible to get through the work allotted, but in  the interests  of honorable senators who have to journey to distant States, the Government is hopeful that Parliament will be able to deal with these matters so that it may rise at the ensuing week-end. Honorable senators are already familiarwith the class of legislation relating to» the wheat industry, and with the general proposals for the relief of unemployment,, whilst the Appropriation Bill will be a matter for consideration in committee. </para>

                <para>I do not propose to follow the ramifications of the speech of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes^, who* made various suggestions inferring, iaone instance, that members in another place have sacrificed principle. So far- a3 the formation of the composite government is concerned, there has been. n®&lt; sacrifice of principle by any honorable member. It is suggested that we should" initiate more work in this chamber. That could be done, except for the reason that the legislation we desire to consider has: to be initiated in the House of Representatives by message from the Governor-General. The illustration employed by Senator Duncan-Hughes that the Government, in presenting business to the Senate is failing to keep the sheep up to the shearers, is not quite to the point. In-, my day, a shearer was paid at a piecework rate. The shearers in this chamber, if honorable senators may be so described,, are not employed on a piece-work rate,, but at an annual salary.</inline></para>
                <para>I realize the responsibility resting, onthe Government in this matter, but Ministers cannot help themselves. Thebill dealt with to-day was pressing, aRc the legislation to be presented to  this chamber  on the 11th December will also be of an urgent nature. But we cannot deal with it until it is passed by the other- chamber. If honorable senators opposite have any influence -with those responsible for the delay in the House of Repre-  sentatives, I suggest they might exert it for the convenience of honorable senators. -Question resolved in the affirmative. </para>

                <para>Copies of the report of the directors and the balance-sheet of Commonwealth Oil Henneries Limited, as at the 30th June, 1934, have been placed on the table of the Library. </para>
                <para class="block">On the 14th November, when replying to certain observations by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll,</inline> I indicated that I would have further inquiries made from the External Affairs Department with a view to a more definite statement being .made in regard to the operations of Japanese vessels in North Queensland waters. Several reports have been received recently to the effect that foreign shell-fishing vessels are operating actively, and apparently Tin increasing numbers, in waters off the Australian coast. Allegations have ako been made from time to time that -Japanese crews have been responsible for damage to planters' holdings, but no specific  report has been received by the -Commonwealth Government of the depreciations in regard to the destruction of  coco-nut  trees, to which the honorable senator referred. The Commonwealth "have been fully seized for some time of the necessity for being able to legislate for fisheries in territorial waters, and raised the matter at the constitutional conference in February last. No conclusion was arrived at, and subsequently the Commonwealth Government communicated with the State governments to ascertain if they were prepared, either by way of amendment of the Constitution Or by a possible reference of power, to facilitate the Commonwealth exercising legislative powers in regard to whale fisheries, pearl, beche-de-mer, and trochus fisheries within territorial limits. Up to the present only four States have replied to this communication, and the nature of these replies indicates that there is no measure of agreement on the subject. Therefore, the Commonwealth and States in the meantime, must take such measures ,as will enable their own laws to be enforced, and steps with a view to more adequate policing are now being taken by the Commonwealth departments concerned. </para>
                <para>On the 13 th November, a copy of a report, to which reference had been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings,</inline> was ordered to be laid upon the table of the Senate. This report dealt with an alleged armed organization in Queensland, and, more particularly, the statement was made therein that during the last six months rifles had been sold to the public from the Brisbane military ordnance stores in large numbers, and that only six transactions had been recorded. The Government has had this statement investigated, and it appears that, since the prohibition of the importation of arms and ammunition into Australia, the Defence Department has been selling arms and ammunition to the public under certain conditions approved by the Minister. These conditions are designed to ensure that the purchasers are reputable persons. Firms who purchase for re-sale are required to keep a record of every sale for inspection by the department whenever desired. Service rifles and ammunition are extensively used in kangaroo and buffalo hunting, and in killing crocodiles. For the year ended the 30th June, 1934, the department sold throughout Australia 637 rifles and 1,040,758 rounds of small arms ammunition, exclusive of sales to rifle clubs. These quantities incidentally are much below those imported into Australia before importation was stopped. The 310-inch rifles referred to are old stock, for which there is no ammunition, a fact that makes their disposal very difficult. Reference was also made in the report to a machine gun in a building in Sydney. The story relating to this gun has been told frequently in the last three years. It has always been found to be completely without foundation. Owing to the precautions which have been taken for the safe custody of Vickers machine guns and other weapons, none has been lost by the Defence Department. There has never been any indication of possession by any organization of any automatic weapon. No information is available concerning parts for assembling armoured , cars by any Queensland organization. One Sydney organization was found to have the necessary mild steel plates to fit on twelve chassis. These passed into the possession of the Defence Department some twelve months ago. </para>

                    <para>.- Without knowing that the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan)</inline> had intended to make a statement of the subject of armed organizations in Australia, I had determined to avail myself of the opportunity afforded by this motion to say something, because of the statement made in the House of Representatives, and because also of the garbled reports which have appeared in the newspapers as to what I have said about the subversive organizations, as well as the contents of the document which I have laid on the table of the Senate. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The press has erroneously stated that I quoted from that document. I did nothing of the kind. My statement about the organizations in question was brief and contained no reference whatever to the document until I was challenged by one honorable senator, who asked me for the source of my information. I replied that I held in my hand a report which contained the facts alluded to and many others. The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill)</inline> said in the House of Representatives - I am glad that the Postmaster-General did not repeat the statement in the Senate to-night, for it would appear that he at least has some conscience - that I had admitted that the statement was unsigned, undated, and unofficial. I definitely told the Senate that the statement was official; that it was prepared by the Defence Department, and was presented to a department of the Queensland Government. Of course it was unsigned. ' My document was merely a typewritten copy of the original. I said definitely that I would not disclose the means by which I had obtained the information. The reason is, I think, obvious to most honorable senators. </para>

                        <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> is seeking information, he must adopt means other than that of interrogating me while I am addressing the Senate. Every one knows that the present Minister for Defence has a most unfortunate manner. He gives one the impression that he believes he can get over any difficulty by sneering at his opponent, waving his hand and declaring that " there is nothing in it ". My statement in the Senate was true, but I quite expected that every attempt would be made to misrepresent what I said. I know enough of the operations of Government departments and of Ministers to realize that no effort would be made to verify the truth of my statements, but that, on the contrary, every attempt would be made to cast ridicule upon them. What were those statements? I asserted that the Government was taking extreme action to prevent a certain .person from landing in Australia and addressing meetings, and I went on to say that I did not know the individual concerned and had no sympathy with him. Then I put to the Government a very pertinent question, and one which I shall repeat whenever the occasion warrants it. I asked why its powers were always exercised when it appeared that the individual or the organization concerned was likely to operate on behalf of the working classes and against the policy of the present Ministry. I went on to say that the former Minister for Defence and the Government knew of the existence of subversive organizations, but had not taken any steps to suppress them. To show that I was not biased in this matter, I mentioned the New Guard, which had been and still is operating in New South Wales ; the Australian Legion which was, until a few months ago, in active operation in Northern Queensland, and the so-called Labour Red Army, which of my own personal knowledge was in existence  in New South Wales in 1931 and subsequently. The last-named is a working-class organization. I said further that I did not believe in force, and that if the Government was determined to prevent a certain man from landing in Australia to deliver lectures - I might have added that it was also censoring books which advocated a policy in opposition to that for which it stands - I would like to see it suppress these illegal organizations, which were armed. An attempt has been made to laugh that statement out of court. It has been said that the organizations concerned could not get the arms. </para>

                        <para>- Again <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> is seeking information by way of interrogation. We now have the admission that there is a possibility of these organizations being armed. The Minister for Defence said that this statement was not true, and added that no " concealable " weapons had been sold by the Ordnance Department. I have not a copy of the document which I laid on the table of the Senate, but I know it contained no reference to " concealable " weapons. Nor did I say that any person or organization had come into the possession of " automatic " weapons. What I said was that arms had been sold and were in the possession of at least one of these organizations. That statement I repeat. It has been said that the swastika emblems to which reference was made in the document, were in no way symbolic of subversive organizations, but were being sold as good luck charms by some individual in Northern Queensland. That was the Minister's reply to my statement. I now tell him and the Department of Defence that they cannot put anything over me in this matter without my protest. I am not likely to be a victim of any of these organizations. Only a few weeks ago, because tramway employees in Melbourne were on strike, another organized fascist body undertook to provide 500 free labourers to take their place. That is another of the subversive organizations which I might include in my list. I say definitely that these bodies are constituted to frustrate any effort made on behalf of the working classes to improve their conditions whenever it appears that they have become tired of the political system under which so much is denied to them. </para>

                        <para>- I said that the report was prepared by the Defence Department and presented to a department of the Queensland Government. That fact has already been made public in another place, and I understand that inquiries are being made by the Queensland Government with regard to the matter. I have no desire to escape my personal responsibility, but I shall want to know how the inquiry is to be conducted, because I know how easy it is for investigations to be carried out in the interests of those concerned so that the investigator shall not discover anything. Make no mistake about that. I am not innocent of the methods of governments. My parliamentary experience is not limited to my membership of this Senate. Here is another statement, published by a newspaper circulating in Queensland and, I understand, in every capital city of Australia, in its issue of the 12th August, 1934- </para>

                <para>Sensational moves are being made in Queens land to set up FASCISM. Startling steps taken recently aim at the complete organization of a "Commonwealth Legion", secretly recruited, covertly organized, stealthily armed clandestinely drilled, preparing for the day when the master stroke, the coup d'etat, will be taken to achieve supreme power. Whisperers are at work sounding out likely recruits. Organizers, snooping round the State, have already enrolled some hundreds in the rank and file of a civilian army on the lines of the infamous New South Wales "New Guard", and recently 1000 badges in the shape of the sinister Hitler swastika embossed, on a five-pointed star, suggestive of the Southern Cross, were sent to North Queensland. </para>
                <para>The authorities, both civil and military, are watching every move with the utmost suspicion, for it is realized that such an organization! may be the precursor of grim strife and the stepping stone to the setting-up of a dictatorship of the Mussolini or Hitler pattern, despite the intensely democratic principles of moat Australians. </para>

                <para class="block">The Minister for Defence practically admitted in the House of Representatives the charges I made, although I do not suggest that he admitted all of those contained in the document which I quoted. My charge that, these organizations existed was admitted by him. He cannot deny the existence of the New Guard or the. statement I made in this chamber months ago that Campbell, who was then, and may still be, the leader of the New Guard, had declared that that organization, was prepared to take action in certain circumstances. That statement has appeared in Australian newspapers. The document, from which I quoted, stated that the members of these organizations were armed and that retired military officers were in control. The names of these officers are known to the Defence Department, and, I presume, to the Minister. If they are not they ought to be. What were the other charges I made? I said that swastika badges were made by a Queensland firm. That statement has been confirmed. The Minister for Defence thinks that he can get over this sinister development by saying that the badges wore manufactured as a sort of good luck charm, sold in North Queensland for charitable purposes, and that the person to whom they were supplied has still about 85© left on his hands. I leave it to any intelligent person to determine whether that is a likely explanation of the position. It is not only in this country that those of us interested in working class movements and working class organizations are taking exception to fascism.

The independent trades unions, he said, could live only in an atmosphere of freedom, not dictatorship,whether it be brown, black or red.

Any one who knows me wall realize that I applaud such kindly acts and those who have heard my statements know that I did not say anything about the Australian Legion of Ex-Service Clubs. I did refer to the fact that an organization known as the Australian Legion was active in North Queensland and that certain badges were manufactured in Queensland for it, which the Minister now says were good luck badges.

                    <para class="block">That is all that I said. Knowing that these organizations exist, the Government does not need to wait for the confirmation of my remarks, because the organizations are illegal. Were the Government to suppress them, it would declare to the world that it stands for the British ideals which we, in Australia, have inherited, and for the constitutional parliamentary system of government which we enjoy, and will not allow subversive organizations to exist, even on a small scale. I should not have referred to this matter to-night, had I not been afraid that I would not have an opportunity to do so when we meet on the 11th December. We shall then probably have a number of all-night sittings in order to get through our work. I am in entire agreement with those who have objected ito the adjournment of the Senate for nearly a fortnight, and rejoice that I have gathered a number of recruits to the ranks of those who object to the way the business of the Senate is conducted. I do  not object to being brought here if there  is  work to do, but I do object to being forced to waste time when I get here. </para>

                        <para>. - A few days ago, I asked whether the Government would consider the exemption of rat poison from  Bales  tax, pointing out that, owing to the exceptionally wet season in Queensland, rata had caused considerable damage in the sugar fields and that Weils disease had caused sickness among the cane-workers and led to industrial trouble as well. The Minister promised that the matter would be brought under the notice of the Government. I pointed out then that similar poison used for the destruction of rabbits was exempt from  Bales  tax. I wrote to the Prime Minister's Department on the subject, and received  a  reply from the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thorby),</inline> on behalf of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons),</inline> in which  ho  stated that he regretted that no means existed whereby rat poison could be exempt from sales tax. I do not blame <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thorby</inline> for that stupid letter; he probably signed it after having been told by soma official that it was all right. I know that there are ways  of  exempting items from sales tax, and cannot understand that any one should be so foolish as  to  send such a letter to me. When I received that reply, I communicated with the organizations which had brought the matter  to  my notice. Imagine my surprise when I read in the press a day  or  two later that Cabinet had decided  to  exempt  Tat  poison from sales tax, although so far I have received  no  notification from the Department to that effect. Such occurrences place honorable senators in an unfair position. I hope that the Minister will institute inquiries in order to ascertain who was responsible for such an absurd letter being sent to me. </para>

Had he been employed by a private concern, he would have been able to obtain redress; but as his claim is against the Government, he will not get compensation unless on the recommendation of such a committee as I have mentioned.
