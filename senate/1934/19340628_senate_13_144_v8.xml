                <para class="block">The news of the death of the King of Belgium in such tragic circumstances <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> the 17th February last stirred the world. The late King was one of the truly heroic figures of the Great War, and earned for himself the title of "Albert the Brave." He bore the misfortunes of the war with a fortitude and courage that won for him the respect of the Allied Nations. Not only in war, but in peace also he manifested wonderful qualities which endeared him to his people. After the war, he busied himself with projects for the welfare of the Belgian nation, and not in material things alone, for he strove also to foster the intellectual life of his country. It is fitting that we extend to the people of Belgium our sincerest sympathy in the great loss that they sustained by the death of their King. </para>

                    <para>.- I second the motion. The death of so great a man as King Albert of Belgium was, I am sure, a severe blow to the people of that country. He was a distinguished figure, not only during the Great War, but also subsequently in the days of peace. Although we in Australia may not have an intimate  knowledge  of the many good qualities of the deceased sovereign, I am sure that the people of this country associate themselves with the sentiments that have been expressed by the Leader of the Senate. </para>

                        <para>The Government and people of the Commonwealth of Australia, as well as my wife and myself, have received with profound regret the announcement of the death of Viscount Novar. We recall with the highest appreciation his outstanding services during the extended term of his occupancy of the office of Governor-General of the Commonwealth, which was attended with peculiar difficulties, and included the whole period of the great war, and the subsequent visit of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales to the Commonwealth. Will yon please accept our deep sympathy. </para>

He thus occupied that high office during the most critical years in the history of Australia. Soon after assuming office he was called upon to consider a question of grave political importance, namely, whether there should be a dissolution of both Houses of the Parliament. Again, early in his term of office Australia entered into the conflict of the great war, and during the whole period of the war he participated enthusiastically in patriotic activities and projects for the welfare of members of our forces and their dependants. Those of us who made his acquaintance will remember his personal charm and his deep knowledge of all matters pertaining to the duties of his office. </para>

Honorable senators will, I am sure, join in expressing sympathy with  Lady  Novar in her great bereavement. The women of Australia will remember the great work carried out by Lady Novar during the war, particularly in connexion with the Red Cross and other organizations working on behalf of our kinsfolk  then  engaged in that great conflict.

                <para class="block">By the death of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Josiah</inline> Symon, another member has been removed from the ranks of that fast disappearing band of distinguished jurists and statesmen who participated in the conferences which led to the establishment of the Commonwealth. He was a member of the Australasian Federal Convention of 1897-98. In 1901 he was elected as a senator for the State of South Australia, and occupied that position until 1913. From August, 1904, to July, 1905, he was Attorney-General in the ReidMcLean Ministry. Prior to entering the Federal Parliament, the late gentleman had been a member of the House of Assembly of South Australia, from 1881 to1887. In 1901 he was honoured by  His  Majesty by being made a Knight Commander of the Most Distinguished Order of St. Michael and St. George. After a life of distinguished public service, he passed away on the 29th March last at the ripe age of 87. </para>
                <para>I suppose I had a longer personal association with the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Josiah</inline> Symon, as a member of the Senate, than had any other honorable senator. I  well  remember the distinguished  band of  South Australian representatives  in the  first Senate. They were men of outstanding ability amongst all the members of the first Federal Parliament, and none of them ranged higher than <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Josiah</inline> Symon. He possessed exceptional gifts and a remarkable personality, and, during the time he was a member of the first Senate, he made a mark in the history of Australia that will endure. I esteem it a great privilege to have been associated with so great a man, and to have seen the qualities which he displayed in those early days of federation. </para>

In two branches he occupied an extraordinarily high position. As an advocate in the courts of law, he attained in his own State an unrivalled eminence.  His  forensic abilities were known throughout the length and breadth of Australia. He brought to the service of this country great mental powers that were enriched by a wide knowledge of literature. By reason of his legal attainments, he played an important part in the framing of the Commonwealth Constitution, and he served as member and Minister in this Parliament and as a member of the Parliament of South Australia. Although he was not born in this country, his sentiments were entirely Australian, and we all lament the passing of one whom we may fittingly term a great Australian. </para>

                <para class="block">The late gentleman was a member of the first Senate, in which he represented the State of Western Australia. At the first election for the Senate, he headed the poll in that State. He had previously been Mayor of Kalgoorlie and the remarkable vote in his favour, both in the gold-fields districts and in the other parts of the State, was a recognition of his fitness to represent, particularly, the goldfields population. After serving his first term as senator, he did not seek reelection, but entered into the administrative service of Papua. Later he served for a time in an administrative capacity in the Northern Territory. He was most enthusiastic in his work, and rendered valuable service, notably in the development of tropical agriculture. After relinquishing Government employment, he took up land in Western Australia, where he died quite recently. During the war, he volunteered for service abroad and served with the Australian Imperial Force from  1916  to  1919,  and was mentioned in despatches. We remember him as a man of kindly disposition, and a general favorite with his fellow senators. I am sure that all his old friends mourn his death. </para>

The late senator was well known to me personally for many years as a journalist and as one who took a very active interest in the welfare of the people of this country. Able and sincere, as a journalist and as an active member of society in many other walks of life he rendered great service to his country, and I know that his death will be a severe blow to his partners in effort for the welfare of the people of South Australia and the Commonwealth generally. I join sincerely with the Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> in expressing our deepest sympathy with his widow and family. </para>

                    <para>. -  I desire to support the motion. The deceased gentleman was not a member of the Senate sufficiently long for honorable senators not previously acquainted with him to assess his real worth. At one period of his life, he was the secretary to an official representative of Australia in London, and his work in that capacity was carried out with credit to himself and to the chief with whom he was associated. He was an able journalist, and devoted his activities to the promotion of the Labour cause, particularly in connexion with Labour newspapers. He was a man of untiring effort and outstanding ability, and those who knew him best loved him most. I do not think that any man, within the Labour movement, at any rate, was more highly respected than the late Harry Kneebone.  His  word was his bond.  His  actions bore the hallmarks of sincerity and honesty of purpose. He was a kind and loving father and an excellent husband. The passing of such a man  is a  great loss to Australia. </para>

                <para class="block">By the death of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson a distinguished figure has been removed from the commercial, industrial and banking life of Australia. Whilst we naturally think of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson in connexion with the Commonwealth Bank, he rendered valuable service to his country in connexion with the Repatriation Commission, of which he was the first  deputy chairman.  Those who recollect his work in that regard will long remember his splendid efforts in helping to lay the foundation of our repatriation system. In more recent years he devoted all his energies to assisting to guide the Commonwealth through the doubtful days of the depression. In his capacity as  chairman  of the Commonwealth Bank Board he won for himself undying renown.  His  Majesty honoured him on several occasions, and, in 1932, he was created a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire. Our sincerest sympathy goes out to his sorrowing widow and family in their sad bereavement; but they have the consolation of knowing that by his great public service <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson reared in the hearts and minds of the people a monument that will long endure. </para>

                            <para>- The experimental farm at Mareeba is no longer controlled by the Commonwealth Government. The honorable senator will remember that a sum of money - the amount was, I think, £10,000 - was set aside by the Commonwealth to enable the State Governments to deal with certain phases of tobacco-growing. At a conference of Ministers of Agriculture and their officers in conjunction with officers of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research at Hobart in February last, it was decided to increase the amount and that under the new arrangement, control of the Mareeba  and  other farms should be entirely iri the hands of the State Government. The Commonwealth is, however, doing what it can to assist the State by retaining certain officers at the farm for the time being. </para>

                <para class="block">It is anticipated that a supply bill will be passed by the House of Representatives to-day, and that that measure will be before this chamber to-morrow, when the Senate will be asked to discuss it. Next week, the Senate will be asked to deal with the bills of which the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan)</inline> gave notice to-day, and possibly some other measures which may come from the House of Representatives. The main measure which wo are expectingwill be an amendment of the Income Tax Act to give effect to some of the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Taxation, but it is unlikely that that bill willbebefore this chamber next week. The House of Representatives expects to be considering the redistribution proposals at an early date, and if these are adopted complementary motions will be necessary in the Senate. </para>
                <para>Earlier in the proceedings to-day, it was my mournful duty to move several motions concerning the deaths of ex-members of this chamber andothers. There is also a fairly long list of deaths of ex-members of the </para>
                <para class="block">House of Representatives, and, although it has become an established practice not to move motions of condolence in this chamber with respect to such deaths, I think that I should make some reference to them. The  Hon.  Agar Wynne, who represented the Balaclava electorate from 1906 to 1914, and was Postmaster-General from June, 1913, to September, 1914, died on the 12thMay, 1934. One of the pioneers of federation, the  Hon.  Sydney Smith, who represented Macquarie from 1901 to 1906, and was Postmaster-General from August, 1904, to July, 1905, died on the 21st February last. The  Hon.  Thomas Brown, who was a member of the' House of Representatives from 1901 to 1913, and who represented Canobolas and Calare, died on the 23rd March, 1934. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Percy</inline> Edmund Coleman, mem  ber  for Reid from 1922 to 1930, died on the 25th May, 1934. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coleman,</inline> who was a comparatively young man, was known to all of us as an active member of the House of Representatives, and as one who rendered distinguished public service. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edward</inline> Ernest Heitmann, who was  member  for Kalgoorlie from 1917 to 1919, died on the 30th January, 1934. The deceased gentleman may be unknown to some honorable senators, but he was known to many Western Australians as a patriotic and earnest citizen. He was one of those who, although well advanced in years, enlisted for active service during the  war.  The strenuous life he led doubtless sapped his constitution. Another death to which I should like <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> make reference is that of Lady Northcote, the wife of a former Governor-General. Lady Northcote's name may not be familiar to some honorable senators, but those who were in the Federal Parliamentwhen Lord Northcote was Governor-General will remember the great work which she rendered in Australia, especially in encouraging and helping women's philanthropic movements. She also did much to encourage culture in Australia, particularly in connexion with music. After her departure from Australia, she took a  great  interest in the progress of the Commonwealth, and by her death, Australia has lost a good friend. </para>
