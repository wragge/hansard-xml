            <para class="block">HIS EXCELLENCY THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL entered the chamber and, being seated, with the  President  on his right hand, a message was sent to the House of Representatives intimating that  His Excellency  desired the attendance of honorable members in the Senate Chamber, who, being come with their  Speaker, </para>
            <para>His EXCELLENCY was pleased to deliver the following speech: - </para>
            <para>Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen -of the House of Representa-tives </para>
            <para>You are called together to deliberate upon matters of urgent importance to the well-being of the Commonwealth. </para>
            <para>My Ministers are very gratified that, with the gracious approval of the King, it has been possible for His Royal Highness the Duke of Gloucester to visit Australia. The enthusiastic reception accorded to His Royal Highness manifests the deep affection in which members of the royal family are held in this country, and discloses again Australia's loyalty to the throne and person of His Majesty. </para>
            <para>It is proposed that an address of welcome from both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament be presented to  His  Royal Highness on the occasion of his visit to Canberra. </para>
                    <para>Employment</para>
                <para>My advisers take pride  in the  fact thai during the past two years Australia has, together with the United Kingdom, taken a leading place among the nations of  the  world in .financial and industrial recovery. They also observe with satisfaction the consistent and substantial  improvement  in employment over  that  period. </para>
                <para>The Government takes this opportunity to say that the partial recovery from  the  depression which has been achieved would not have been possible  without  the patriotic co-operation of the people as a whole, and especially the gallant fortitude of those who have been the  keenest  sufferers. </para>
                <para>My advisers regard with sympathy and concern the heavy unemployment which still persists and propose to give to this grave and pressing problem priority over other matters. </para>
                <para>With this object in . view employment and its associated questions have bees allotted as a special ministerial task to the Minister of State for Commerce, who will, for a period at least, devote the major portion of his labours to this great problem, and will be relieved of much of the work of the Commerce Department. Consideration will be directed to three principal matters: - </para>
                <list type="loweralpha">
                    <item label="(a)">
                        <para>A complete survey of the unemployment problem in order to determine whether there are any root causes which could be effectively dealt with by direct Commonwealth action or by some concerted action on the part of the Commonwealth and the States; </para>
                    </item>
                    <item label="(b)">
                        <para>Theselection, preparation and carrying out of works which, by reason of their size  or  special connexion with Commonwealth functions, can properly be done by the Commonwealth alone; and </para>
                    </item>
                    <item label="(c)">
                        <para>Close collaboration with the State employment authorities with a view to the carrying out of works which, though within the authority of the States, cannot at present be undertaken without financial aid from the Commonwealth. </para>
                    </item>
                </list>
                <para class="block">The selection of these works will be a matter for consultation with the States which will be invited to consider such undertakings as the unification of the railway gauges between capital cities, farther country water storage, national forestry, housing and the treatment  of coal  deposits and shale for oil and other commercial products. In particular the Commonwealth will aim at the creation of opportunities for the employment of youth. </para>
                <para class="italic">
                    <inline font-style="italic">Rural Industries:Relief and Assistance.</inline>
                </para>
                <para>My Government wishes to express to all primary producers the indebtedness of the nation for the manner in which they have, despite low price levels, continued to maintain and in many industries substantially increase the measure of their production and export. As far as lies within its power and resources, the Government will continue and enlarge its policy of aid to rural industry until such time as marketing results show considerable improvement. </para>
                <para>In accordance with this policy my advisers are entering into immediate discussions with the Governments of the various States in relation to the question of financial rural relief. It will be understood that, as the Constitution now stands, the Commonwealth has not power to deal directly with such domestic matters as the tenure and financial security of the primary producer ; it must accordingly act through the medium of financing existing or future State schemes. Consultation with the State authorities in order to determine the precise nature of proposals and the amount of financial assistance necessary, together with the terms upon which it should be provided, will at once be put in hand. </para>
                <para>Steps will be taken at a very early date to give effect to the Government's undertakings with respect to a bounty upon the approaching season's wheat. </para>
                    <para>Secondary Industries and Trade Treaties</para>
                <para>My Ministers will adhere to the national policy of protection and will, in tariff matters, follow the course which proved so successful during the life of the last Parliament. They strongly maintain the view that the first service of the tariff must still be the upholding of local primary and secondary industries, the fortunes of which are closely interwoven and cannot be properly considered apart. </para>
                <para>The satisfactory sale of our surplus primary produce is the index to the prosperity of every Australian industry and business and of all sources of employment. My advisers believe that trade agreements and treaties, if framed with care and vision, cannot fail to bring additional income and employment to the community as a whole. </para>
                <para>With this desirable object in view my advisers will submit legislation as occasion arises. They anticipate that during next year opportunity will be found  to  discuss with His Majesty's  Government  in the United Kingdom certain phases  of  the Ottawa Agreement with  a  view to adding still further  to  the  advantages  which it is now conferring upon the contracting parties. </para>
                <para>My advisers are engaged in the negotiation of prospective trade treaties with  a  number of foreign countries. They are of the opinion that Australia's richest overseas market lies within the Empire and especially within the United Kingdom. But they are fully aware that in some great lines of primary commodities Australia and other dominions,  taken  together, yield a total production far in excess of the consumption demands of the Empire. Confronted by these conditions my Ministers will make every endeavour to trade on the friendliest terms obtainable with all nations which are faced with similar problems. </para>
                <para>When in making agreements or treaties alterations in the tariff, which have not been formally referred to the Tariff Board, are necessary, my Ministers will submit the agreements or treaties with these alterations for the endorsement of Parliament within a limited period. </para>
                <para>My Ministers are now engaged in con- sideration of a series of Tariff Board reports. A schedule based upon these reports will be submitted to Parliament at an early date, and the reports will be made available at the same time. </para>
                <para>My Government will take steps to set up an Interstate Commission as a working part of the Constitution. </para>
                <para>The first business of Parliament will be consideration of the Estimates. </para>
                <para>In the earnest hope that Divine Providence may guide your deliberations and further the welfare of the people of the Commonwealth, I now leave you to the discharge of your high and important duties. </para>

                        <para>.- I second the motion. Australia has already given a magnificent demonstration of its attachment to the Mother Country, and its high regard for British traditions. I hope that we in this far-flung portion of the British Empire will uphold and advance the principles for which our ancestors fought. Amongst those principles were freedom of speech, and recognition of the political equality of all men. Politically and industrially, we in Australia have advanced further and more rapidly than our forefathers would have thought possible. His Royal Highness the Duke of Gloucester, upon his return to the United Kingdom, will be able to convey to its people a vivid firsthand impression of us and our country. A few days ago, I saw His Royal Highness presenting a cup to* a racehorse owner and congratulating the jockey, and I could not help thinking that Royalty, which makes contact with all classes of the community and promotes their mutual understanding, has its uses. So I join in welcoming a son of the King. God bless him. </para>

                    <para>The news of the death of King Alexander in such tragic circumstances was received in Australia with feelings, not only of sincere regret, but also of horror. He was struck down by the bullet of an assassin while still in the flower of his manhood, and whilst engaged on a mission of goodwill from his own country to France. Upon receiptof the news the right honorable the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> requested  His  Majesty's ambassador at Belgrade to convey to the Government of Jugoslavia the deepest sympathy of the Government and people of Australia in the great national loss which that country had sustained. As a tribute to the memory of the deceased ruler, flags were flown at half-mast on government buildings throughout Australia on Thursday last, the 18th October, the occasion of King Alexander's funeral. The sympathy of honorable senators will, I am sure, go out to Queen Marie and members of her family, and to the Government and people of Jugoslavia in the death of King Alexander. </para>

I recall reading, not so long ago, a statement by a member of the Spanish Cortes that these tragic events were incidental to the occupation of kings, the reference on that occasion being, I believe, to a similar fate that befel an earlier Spanish monarch. Happily, such happenings are rare in the history of the British race. We believe that, no matter how widely our people may differ in their political opinions, the sacrifice of human life is not justified, because, under our system of government, other means of adjusting our differences are available to us. No matter how strongly our opinions may differ, we do not desire the death of our bitterest political enemy. I join with the Leader of the Senate in expressing, on behalf of my party, our great sorrow at the tragic death of King Alexander. </para>

                <para>The death of M. Raymond Poincare, the great war-time President of France, has been announced. He was President from 1913 to 1920, and again from 1922 to 1924. Entering politics at an early age, he rose to occupy many important portfolios, and his political career was distinguished by his occupancy of the office of Prime Minister of France on three occasions. Those of us who were associated with activities connected with the conduct -of the Great War will remember his fearlessness, his endeavours to. cement alliances between France and other countries, and his statesmanship. A truly great man has died, and it is fitting that we mourn with his country in the profound loss which it has suffered. </para>

                    Mathews, a former member of the House of Representatives, who passed away on the 16th October last, represented Melbourne Ports from 1906 to 1931 - a period of a quarter of a century - and was on several occasions elected unopposed. He was  Chairman  of the Committee on Causes of Death and Invalidity in the Commonwealth in 1916 and 1917, and a member of the Standing Committee on Public Works from 1917 to 1925. In spite of ill health towards the end of his parliamentary career, he strove to attend 'the sittings of the Parliament and to do all that lay in his power to carry out his duties. The way in which he triumphed over his physical infirmities stamped him as a man of remarkable courage.  His  frank and fearless nature will be remembered; and, with his death, passes a citizen who gave of  his  best  in  the interests of Australia and the people he represented. I desire to extend to  his  widow the sincere sympathy of the Senate in her bereavement.

                    <para>-On this motion I could speak at great length, because I was very fond of " Jimmy " Mathews. Apart from his personal charm, he won respect, by the fortitude he displayed when ill health overtook him late in life. No man could have shown greater courage than he did always; for years he struggled to this Parliament to record his vote, when his health was such that he should have been carried here on a float. He was loyal to his constituents, and to his party, and he was always in  hi3  place when he was needed. I regret that a man with so great a heart and such strength of character should be lost to Australia. Rut great men come and go: others take their places, and the work of the nation is carried on. After all, courage forms the character of  a  country, and carries it through its difficulties. I shall always revere the memory of my late lamented friend, and I would like to convey to his widow the deep sympathy of myself and my colleagues with her in her bereavement. </para>

                <para>It is somewhat unusual  for the  Federal Parliament to be asked to pass  a  motion of condolence or regret in connexion with the death of  a  citizen who had not been  a  member of this Parliament. But I think the Senate will agree with me that the passing of so distinguished a citizen as this leader of science should not pass without notice by the Parliament of the Commonwealth. A scientist and explorer of the highest rank, the work of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edgeworth</inline> David was known, not only throughout Australia,  but  throughout the world. He was  a  man of indomitable courage and great character. I remember how, in the early stages of the war, although he was then an old man,  he  came to me, as the Minister for Defence, and offered to place his scientific knowledge and services at the disposal of the Commonwealth Government during the war.  Those  services were accepted, and, old as he was, he organized a mining unit, which was sent overseas and was usefully employed in some of the theatres of war. He was always willing to place his services at the disposal of the Government to advance the development of Australia. Many years ago, when we were considering the possibility of discovering oil in Australia, I, as the responsible Minister concerned, turned at once to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edgeworth</inline> David, and without any hesitation he advised us of the steps to be taken in order to encourage prospecting for oil. He was an active worker in many fields. In him a delightful personality was combined with an exceptional intellect. It can be truly said that he devoted his whole life to the betterment and development of the country of which he was a citizen, and it is fitting that this Senate should record its regret at the loss which Australia has sustained by his death. I am sure our sympathy goes out to his widow and the members of his family. </para>

                    <para>- Although a motion of this character, in relation to a private citizen, is unusual, I endorse the action taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to recognize the worth of one of our great countrymen, a man whose scholarly attainments and public service had won for him many degrees and decorations. From time to time I read with great interest of many of his achievements, and I gloried in them. So I submit that, even if this motion is without precedent, this Parliament is entitled to place on record its appreciation of great services rendered by a citizen of the Commonwealth. I express to Lady David and the members of her family our great regret at the loss of a man who was wonderfully valuable to Australia. </para>

                    <para>-I desire to associate myself with this motion. Professor David was a man of great and outstanding ability, not only in scientific research, but also as an organizer in the teaching department of the Sydney University. He taught nearly all our leading scientists, especially in the realm of geology, and lifted that particular branch of knowledge in Australia to a notably high plane. By precept and example he did much to mould the minds and characters of the youths passing through the University of Sydney, and the noble sentiments he preached and practised are being lived by many of his former students. I regret the occasion for this motion; but I have pleasure in paying my tribute to the memory of <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> great worker and teacher. </para>

                <para class="block">The debate on the Address-in-Reply will commence on Wednesday next, and it is also possible that the Appropriation Bill may be received at an early date. Honorable senators are aware that the Government obtained Supply only sufficient for it to carry on until after the general election, and that the Estimates which are to be brought before the House of Representatives will be the same Estimates as were submitted to the last Parliament. Probably the Estimates will be passed at an early date, but, if not, another Supply Bill will have to he passed, probably next week. Legislation in connexion with the wheat industry also will be submitted, and although I cannot say when such legislation will reach this chamber, it should be passed in time to enable the necessary machinery to be set in motion before the next harvest. There is a good deal of important business to transact. </para>

                    <para>.- The speech delivered by  His Excellency  the Governor-General to-day sounded all right, and I am glad that an early opportunity will be afforded honorable senators to discuss subjects of great importance to the Australian people. The Government is wise in asking the Parliament to adjourn until next week so that in the meantime we may join in the welcome to  His  Royal Highness the Duke of Gloucester, but we cannot overlook the fact that matters of grave importance require our earnest and immediate  consideration. We do not know what is actually facing this country at present. There are many important problems awaiting solution, the gravest of which is the provision of employment for our people. We have to determine whether large numbers of the people are to remain on the verge of starvation or are to be given an opportunity to earn a decent living. </para>

                    <para>. - In the speech which was read by His Excellency the Governor-General in the Senate this afternoon, reference was made to our rural industries, and particularly to the wheat industry. I understand that it  is  the intention of the Government, during the present session, to give special consideration to the deplorable and unfortunate conditions which obtain in the Australian wheat-growing industry. I direct the attention of the Government to an authoritative statement which appeared in the press about three weeks ago, and which has not been contradicted, to the effect that five firms which carry on the business of purchasing and dealing with wheat, three of which are represented in Australia and form the principal wheat buying agencies in the Commonwealth, have agreed among themselves to form a combine for the specific purpose of offering the lowest possible price to the wheat-growing countries which have wheat to sell. Such a statement deserves the serious consideration of the Government when it is formulating its policy to assist those engaged in the wheat-growing industry. </para>

                <para>- I remind the honorable senator that as the Address-in-Reply has been made an order of the day for the next day of sitting, he cannot discuss the Governor-General's speech at this stage, but he is quite entitled to debate in a general way, the production and marketing of wheat in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- That is what I am endeavouring to do. I am urging the Ministers to take these factors into consideration when they are working out the details of the policy which was submitted to the Senate this afternoon by  His Excellency  the Governor-General. There is another aspect of the situation, relating to the assistance for primary producers, which does not encroach upon the Government proposals outlined in  His  Excellency's speech. I refer to the legislation passed in November last for the payment of a bounty to wheat-growers. It was the intention of Parliament, that that assistance, which was made possible at the expense of the consumers of bread in the Commonwealth - the scheme was financed in the main from the proceeds of a tax on flour - should go direct to our wheat-farmers. Unfortunately, that has not been the result in every instance. In South Australia, we have the spectacle of Commonwealth assistance to wheat-growers being utilized for the benefit of farmers' creditors. I therefore contend that action should be taken this session to ensure that any assistance granted by this Parliament to wheat-farmers should be given direct to those sorely afflicted producers. My third point is this : In 1912, this Parliament passed an act for the payment of a maternity allowance in recognition of the claims of mothers. The intention was that it should be paid to all mothers irrespective of their financial position. Again the design of this Parliament is being thwarted, because, under legislation passed by the South Australian Parliament, a maternity allowance payable to the wife of a wheat-farmer has been garnisheed for the benefit of her husband's creditors. This ought to be  stopped. A provision of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act makes the receipt of a pension the inalienable right of the pensioner, and a similar safeguard should be inserted in the act relating to maternity allowances. </para>

                <para>I regret that I have to raise these points, but they are important, and require the early consideration of this Government. Despite the confidence apparently expressed in the Government at the recent election, unless the matters to which I referred are dealt with promptly and the necessary steps taken to rectify the anomalies, there will he a very great feeling of disappointment throughout Australia. </para>
