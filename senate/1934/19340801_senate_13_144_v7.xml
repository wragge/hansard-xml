According to figures supplied by the Commonwealth Statistician, the percentage of unemployment amongst reporting trade unions was  -  In the second quarter of 1932, 30 per cent.; in the second quarter of 1934, 20.9 per cent.

                            <para>Yes. During this financial year both Commonwealth and State governments are increasing their expenditure on public works, which will materially assist in the relief of unemployment. In addition, the Commonwealth is arranging for a special grant of &#163;2,000,000 to be made to the States, portion of which it is anticipated will be used by the State governments directly for therelief of juvenile unemployment. </para>

                    <para class="block">This is a short measure to amendthe Commonwealth Public Service Act is respect of salary payments in lieu of furlough, and also in respect of the appointment of returned soldiers to the Public Service. The first amendment relates to the salary rate upon which payment in lieu of furlough is to be calculated upon the retirement of an officer, or upon which the amount to he paid to his dependants on his death is to be ascertained. At present the different rates of salary received by the officer during a period immediately preceding his death must be taken into account. For example, an officer who retires after 40 years&#39; service is eligible for payment of salary for twelve months in lieu of furlough, and to  ascertain the amount due to him his varying salaries in the twelve months preceding his retirement must be taken into account. In that period he may have suffered a reduction which has  subsequently been wholly or partly restored, and the amount received in lieu of furlough would be less than twelve months&#39; pay calculated on his salary at the time of retirement. It is considered that there should  be  a uniform method of payment in these cases, and that it should  be  based upon the salary the officer receives at retirement or at death. </para>
                    <para>Tlie other amendment relates to section 84 of the act. Under sub-section 8 of that section, a returned soldier may be appointed vo the Commonwealth Service, although not free from physical defects clue to service in the war, if ho receives a medical certificate showing that he is free from such physical defects as would incapacitate him for the efi  cient discharge of the duties of the position to which he is to be appointed. </para>
                    <para>Case3  have occurred where the medical officer certifies that the returned soldier is at present physically capable of performing the duties of the position, but that the indications arc that his present fitness is unlikely to continue. In such a case, having regard to the likelihood of premature retirement on the ground of invalidity, and the consequent charge upon the superannuation fund, a returned soldier is not appointed. The proposed amendment provides that if the medical practitioner certifies that any physical defect of a returned soldier is likely to prevent continuance of efficient service up to the age of 60 years, he shall not if appointed to the Commonwealth Service, be deemed to  be  an employee within the meaning, and for the purpose, of the Superannuation Act. This means that returned soldiers will not be debarred from appointment, as nt present, but in view of their disability they will not be eligible to contribute for a civil pension. The amendment is suggested in the interest of returned soldiers of this class, as it will enable them to obtain appointments at present not available to them, and at the same time will safeguard the superannuation fund from the encroachment of invalidity cases which were  not con  templated when the fund was established. </para>

If it is agreed to,  it  will enable men now temporarily employed  in  the Public Service, and who have pasted the necessary examination, to be permanently appointed, which at present cannot bc done. The amendments proposed in the bill are not contentious, and as the session is to terminate shortly, I trust that honorable senators will agree to pass the bill through all its  stages without  delay. </para>

                        <para>. - Although honorable senators on this side of the chamber intend to support the bill, certain persons in  the  Public Service who are not returned soldiers appear to have been treated unjustly. A few weeks ago  it  was discovered after  a  man had been occupying a position in the Post and Telegraph Department for two months that he was blind in one eye. No ordinary person could detect the young man&#39;s disability, but after a brief period of service he was dismissed. He is  only  eighteen  or  nineteen years of age. Whilst we on this side desire to do what is fair to returned soldiers by agreeing that  no  obstacle should be put in the way of their earning their living because of incapacity resulting from war injuries, we consider  the  provision in the  Public  .Service Act, which caused the dismissal of this young fellow, to be distinctly unfair. He showed  in  the few weeks of his employment in the Service that he could do his work well, and satisfied the foreman that he was highly capable; yet he was dismissed when it was discovered that, he was blind in one eve, although that defect had existed practically from his birth. This is the hard case of a young recruit in the industrial army, against whom, because he was  not  born in  time  to go. to  the  war, the Public Service Act operates unfairly. I rose  merely to point out that members of the industrial army also suffer disabilities. </para>

                            <para>- In that case he would not have been disqualified. The act was specially amended in the interests of returned soldiers to provide that those who suffered from defects arising out of war injuries could be admitted to the Service, but with the limitation I have already mentioned. This young man, however, not being a returned soldier, was not eligible for admission under these conditions. The regulations provide that to secure admission to the Service, an applicant must possess the sight of both eyes. The reason for that is obvious. It is a well-known fact that when one loses the sight of one eye, there is a predisposition to lose the sight of the other. Applicants are supposed to divulge any defects of that kind. The bill does not in any way alter the ordinary conditions of entry into the Public Service, but deals only with the two points which I explained earlier. </para>

                    <para>.- I asked yesterday whether bonus shares declared out of the capitalization of profits of companies, having already paid income tax, were to be classified under this bill as dividends and again made taxable. The definition of &#34; dividends &#34; in this measure includes &#34; the paid-up value of shares distributed by a company to its shareholders to the extent to which the paid-up value represents the capitalization of the whole or any part of the profits to the company&#34;. These profits have, in the past, been taxed at the full rate imposed on dividends, and have been passed to reserve. Will the Minister give the committee the assurance, if he can do so, that those reserves of a company will not again be subjected to taxation if distributed to the shareholders in the form of paid-up shares ? </para>

The present law taxes bonus shares, except those paid out of specified profits. The effect of the bill, based upon the recommendations of the royal commission, will be a reduction of exemptions in order to place bonus shares, for all practical purposes, on the same footing as cash distributions. The principle of taxing bonus shares is not introduced by this bill ; it has been embodied in the law for many years. The profits so distributed have paid tax in the hands of the company only at the flat rate of tax payable by companies, and the shareholders, when they receive the shares, receive a tax rebate at their own rate of tax or the standard company rate, whichever is the less. </para>

                    <para>&#91;3.35&#93;. - Having given further consideration to this matter in the light of the telegram from the Perth Building Society, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> read last night, the Government has decided to resist the amendment because it proposes discriminatory treatment in favour of building societies which is not justified. A special property tax is charged on all interest included in the taxable income of any person or company, whether the interest is derived in the course of carrying on a business or not. A large proportion of the special property tax is paid upon interest, and the removal of any considerable portion of interest from the field subject to that tax would seriously affect the revenue. It would not be possible to relieve interest from the tax simply because it is derived in the carrying on of a business, because that would mean that interest received by banks and other financial institutions, upon which a large proportion of the tax is paid, would be exempt. Building societies could not be exempted from this tax without similar consideration being given to other cooperative and mutual assurance societies which are at present liable for the tax and would remain liable even if the amendment were passed. The exemption of all such bodies from the tax would have a serious effect on the revenue. Under the present law, building societies which are co-operative companies receive a substantial benefit, inasmuch as they are entitled to a deduction, in addition to the general deductions under the act, of all interest and dividends distributed to their shareholders. Their taxable income consists, therefore, only of undistributed income, whereas the taxable income of an ordinary company includes both distributed and undistributed income. It is important to note that the royal commission is of the opinion that this proposed concession to co-operative companies is not justified, and on page 147 of its third report the commission recommends its withdrawal from the act. Although this bill does not do that, the position will have to receive serious consideration when matters affecting both the Commonwealth and the States are being discussed by the respective Governments with a view to obtaining uniformity of treatment. The only concession that these societies can expect is the lifting of the special property tax at some future date. TheGovernment could not make a special exemption in favour of building societies without causing serious repercussions throughout Australia. </para>

It seeks very little relief, as all it asks is that the tax, which is payable under the act, shall be taken from the income which is subject to the special property tax. It is quite clear, therefore, that the arguments advanced by the Minister in reply to my previous amendment do not apply in this case.

There is no principle enunciated in the proposed amendment which could &#34;logically be confined to building societies. If the principle were justified in connexion with building societies, it would be equally applicable to all persons and companies, part of whose income is subject to the special property fax. Any such proposal generally applied would seriously affect the revenue, and would greatly add to the complications of assessment. It is to be remembered that the purpose of the bill is to achieve simplification  with  as  little  disturbance of the revenue as possible. The acceptance of the principle  laid down  iu the proposed amendment would seriously disturb the balance now obtaining in the bill, and would amount  to  a remission of taxation, which the Government is unable at present to grant. The confining of it to building societies, however, would be productive of many anomalies which would not be justified. </para>

                <para>I have ascertained that many representations were made on this matter while the bill was being dealt with in committee  in  the House  of  Representatives, and I also understand that Sena  tor  Grant has an objection to lodge  in  terms almost identical  with  those in  the  telegram I  have read.  This  bill  is the  outcome of the prolonged and impartial investigation by the Royal Commission ou Taxation. The reports of the commission have been made public for months past, and the recommendations, which are being implemented by the bill, have been considered by a conference of Taxation Commissioners, the Federal Taxation Department, and the Government. The portion of the bill relating to private companies is based entirely upon the recommendations made by the royal commission after consideration of all the evidence given before it on the subject, and is necessary to remove dissatisfaction existing under the present law, and to prevent tax evasion. As regards the specific matters mentioned in the telegram received by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Plain,</inline> the bill removes the discretionary powers now vested in the Commissioner in relation to insufficient distributions by companies, and makes the operation of the section automatic. The Melbourne Chamber of Commerce states that this legislation is ft direct interference with rights conferred under the State Companies Act: without some elaboration of this objection, I can only reply that it is considered that the bill does not interfere with any such rights. It is not reasonably possible at this stage to withdraw this portion of the bill, as ample time has been given to all persons affected to make any representations in regard to it, and the large number that have been made on every conceivable point has received full consideration. At an earlier stage, I informed honorable senators that the fullest publicity was given to the bill and  its provisions, and advice and suggestions were invited from all quarters concerned. As a result of representations received, certain1 amendments were made in the House of Representatives. This clause is an integral part of the bill, and the Government must insist on its retention. </para>

                    said that when the bill was explained in the House of Representatives, the Minister in charge of it made an incorrect statement. I assume that the Minister was speaking in general terms. The provisions of section 21 will, under this amendment of the law, apply to private companies which are covered by the definition, and I think the measure will, in that respect, clear up a doubt that has existed hitherto. It may happen that a company which does not now come within the definition, has been regarded as a private company for the purpose of the application of the provisions contained in section 21, but those cases are, I suggest, very rare.

The present law, in its terms, is not limited to private companies, but, generally, it has been applied to companies of that description.

                <para>As to the doubt expressed by the honorable senator concerning the precise meaning of paragraph <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> of the definition clause relating to private companies, I remind him that it should be read in conjunction with the definition of a private company - &#34; Private company &#34; means a company which is under the control of not more than seven persons, and which is not a company in which the public are substantially interested, or a subsidiary of a public company. </para>
                <para class="block">If there are only three persons interested, or if the shares are controlled by them or on their behalf, the company shall be deemed to be a private company, and, as recommended by the royal commission, will come under the provisions of proposed new division 2. </para>
                <para>This matter has been the subject of a great deal of discussion. The proposals now before the committee have been designed with a view to simplification of the law and to remedy a very vexatious problem in administration. Assessments issued under the old law met with considerable opposition, and have caused a great deal of dissatisfaction. This bill, it is hoped, will put the matter on a definite basis. Every private company will know what are its obligations. </para>

                <para class="block">No one expected when this provision was inserted in the act in 1931 that its effect would be to penalize a considerable number of the poorer people in the community who had invested their savings in preference shares. Certainly no one thought that they would be called upon to pay one of the highest rates of tax imposed under the Commonwealth law. Yet that has been the result. The department states that an alteration of the law in the manner I have proposed would entail administrative difficulties. I am not concerned with administrative difficulties so much as with the distinct hardship that is inflicted on a very deserving section of the community, which we profess to protect in the drafting of our taxation measures. Parliament, in its wisdom, decided that persons whose means are small shall be exempt from taxation. Yet this provision which may have been justifiable in its application to certain companies, actually places a heavy burden upon the shoulders of small investors who own preference shares. Their position is, I think, familiar to most honorable senators, because I have referred to it on other occasions, and it should not now be necessary for me to emphasize the injustice of this tax as it affects them. The deduction of the tax by the company from dividends paid to its shareholders is optional. Some companies contend that it would be unjust to the ordinary shareholders if the special property tax on dividends declared on preference shares were not deducted, irrespective of whether or not the recipients were persons enjoying exemption&#39; under the Income Tax Act because of their limited income. Let us see how this provision operates. If a company has sufficient profits to pay its preference shareholders the dividend at the rate provided, and the ordinary shareholders a similar rate of dividend, those preference shareholders whose income is so small that they are exempted under the principal act, have to pay this special property tax, whilst ordinary shareholders with a similar dividend and similar income are not called upon to paythe tax. Both are exempted under the act, but in practice one section, the preference shareholders, has to pay the tax. For example, Brown may have invested &#163;500, representing perhaps his life&#39;s savings in preference shares, and Jones a similar sum. in ordinary shares. The former, under section 88a, is required to pay the tax, but the latter is exempted. Fifty persons may be ordinary shareholders and another 50 persons preference shareholders in the same company; not having an income exceeding &#163;250 a year, all of them are exempt under the act, but one section only has to pay the tax. A continuance of the present system cannot be justified. Where the tax has been paid by a company to the department on behalf of those who, under the act, are not taxable, it should be refunded. </para>

                        <para>- The amount involved cannot be large; but if  it  were the department should devise some other means to make up the loss. Even a considerable loss of revenue does not justify the department in making an exempt person pay at the highest rate levied under our taxation legislation. I consider that I am justified in testing the opinion of the committee as to whether the present unjust system should be continued, because under  it a heavy burden is imposed upon those least able to bear it. 1 have no axe to grind in this matter. I am a shareholder in companies from which I derive dividends on preference shares, but I am in a fortunate position in that I obtain &#39;the full exemption of &#163;250, and a rebate of the amount which the company has paid on my behalf. Those more favorably situated enjoy the privilege of exemptions, deductions and rebates, while poorer- persons who should not have to pay anything at all have to pay the heaviest tax imposed by the law. </para>

                    and I trust that it will be rejected by the committee. The honorable senator has been so persistent in his efforts, and&#39; appears to have made out such a good case, that I should like to meet him if that were possible. I have examined this proposal in proper perspective, and after consultation with the taxation officers I am satisfied that section 88a of the principal act is sound. That section was embodied in the Income Tax Act in 1931 because ordinary shareholders in companies said that it was unjust that they should have to carry the whole burden of the special property tax. When the position is analysed we can readily perceive that that is correct. In prosperous times ordinary shareholders in a company receive large dividends, but they do not always enjoy that privilege. During periods of depression preference shareholders are assured of receiving some definite amount, while ordinary shareholders have no such assurance.

                    LAWSON.Much depends upon the prosperity of the company concerned, and the state of trade at the time; but if the company did not make a profit, it did not have to pay the tax, which is a tax upon income. Section 88a was introduced in 1931 at the request of ordinary shareholders, who contended that it &#34;was unfair that they should bear the full- weight of the special property tax payable by a company; df the whole of the property tax were paid out, the fund from which ordinary dividends were declared, obviously the amount available to ordinary shareholders would be reduced. Although the adoption of such a provision may have introduced anomalies, its purpose was to endeavour to do justice to both sections of shareholders. The preference shareholders would receive their full dividend at the rate provided for in the articles of association, the tax on preference dividends would be paid out of a common fund, and the rate of dividend to ordinary shareholders consequently reduced. This was an attempt to spread the burden equitably between the two sections of shareholders.
                </para>
                <para>A plea is now being made on behalf of preference shareholders because the act empowers, but does not require, a company to deduct from a preference dividend the portion of the special property tax paid by the company proportionate to that dividend. But where a company does exercise that power, the preference shareholder is, in effect, not in a worse position than the ordinary shareholder. As regards the latter, the fund available for distribution by the company is diminished by the amount of the special property tax paid by the company, and the dividend which the company can pay is correspondingly reduced. Preference shareholders desire to be assured of being in a better position than ordinary shareholders, namely, that they should get their full dividend without deduction in respect of the special property tax imposed as an emergency measure. If any relief is to be given, it could not be limited to companies with preference shareholders; neither could it be limited to holding companies nor to the dividend income of a company. The grievance really relates to the assessment of a company for special property tax at all. It may be said that any income upon which a company pays the special property tax would, if distributed to shareholders, and liable only in their hands, pay either no special property tax or a greatly reduced amount of tax because of the operation of the flat rate deduction of &#163;250 which each such, shareholder would enjoy. The matter is bound up with the general scheme of company taxation, and it could be urged with equal strength that a company should not pay ordinary income tax upon that part of  its income, which, if distributed to its shareholders would not be liable to tax in their hands, because their net income is less than the statutory exemption. It could also be said that such a shareholder should be entitled to a refund of the tax paid by the company on the profits distributed to him. That involves a vital principle, the general application of which would bc too costly, and its limitation to specified types would not be justified because of the serious anomalies that would arise. For the reasons given by the department, the request moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> cannot be accepted. </para>

                        <para>- I remind the Assistant Minister that the department has made one or two errors. For instance, the Assistant Minister stated that the original super tax of 10 per cent., or 2s. in the &#163;1 caine out of the funds of the company, so in that respect there was a. differentiation between the tax imposed on preference shareholders and that imposed on ordinary shareholders. Dividends are always followed by the department into the hands of industrial shareholders and included in their assessments. To those having a taxable income a rebate is allowed; but shareholders whose income is below the statutory exemption of &#163;250 do not get the rebate. </para>

                        <para>- I can assure the Assistant Minister that dividends are included iti assessments and rebates are then allowed at the company rate. As the department always follows dividends to individual taxpayers why should they not pay the tax? The department includes dividends in the assessment of an individual taxpayer, so that on the graduated scale he may be assessed at a higher rate even if a rebate is allowed subsequently.  A  special property {ax is imposed on companies, but if a company does not have any property income it does not, of course, have to pay the tax. It has been said that preference shareholders have been holding out for their pound of flesh in the matter of dividends; but it seems to be forgotten that preference shareholders have had to submit to a compulsory deduction of  22-^  per cent. I think that the majority of companies have deducted the full  22^  per cent., and the shareholders in such companies have, therefore, suffered to that extent. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> that&#62; on an income of  &#163;100  a year, the department should not impose a property tax, as there is a statutory exemption of  &#163;230  a year. It is easy for the department to say that it is impracticable to give effect to a request which would benefit the small taxpayer. If a suggestion is made in the interests of taxpayers the department says that relief cannot be afforded, but no difficulties are raised when the burden upon the taxpayer can be increased. A company should be deprived of the right to deduct the tax, and &#39;the department should be compelled to follow the dividend to the shareholder who receives it. Tho amendment, if .carried, would cause practically no loss of revenue. If any resulted, it would be only reasonable and proper for the revenue to bear it, seeing that; the existing act professes to grant the statutory exemption to every taxpayer. </para>

                    <para>.- I can answer the question by the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce).</inline> I understood that the matter was to be brought under the notice of the royal commission, and prepared a case for a certain gentleman to put, but, having other work on his hands, he was not able to carry out his undertaking. I am fairly sure, therefore, that the matter did not come before the commission. Two statements that have been made by the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Lawson)</inline> call for a reply from me. I do not blame the department. My grievance is against the Government. The department must carry out the law as it finds it, and its officer? cannot consider equity. Equity, however, should exercise the mind of the Government. If they feel that a proposal is inequitable, they should take steps to remove it. The department, if so instructed, will find a means of working the machinery in such a way as to avoid injustice. The Assistant Minister said that a preference shareholder would under the 1931 provision be in no worse position than an ordinary shareholder, but that is not true where a company pays a dividend of an equal amount to its ordinary and preference shareholders, as many companies are doing. Some companies are paying to ordinary shareholders a dividend at least three times as great as that paid to holders of preference shares. The Minister is misinformed when he says that preference shareholders are suffering no more than ordinary shareholders. An ordinary shareholder receives his dividend, but if his net income is less than &#163;250 a year, he is not deemed to be an income tax payer at all, whereas a preference shareholder in a company that exercises the power given by the act of 1931, even if his total income is only &#163;50  h  year and that is all he has to live on, must suffer the company &#39;to deduct 6 per cent, of his dividend. In 1931-32 the tax was 10 per cent., and in the following year <inline font-style="italic">7i</inline> per cent. The amount deducted&#34; is handed to the Income Tax Commissioner, although the preference shareholder&#39;s income from all sources is &#163;50 a year; so notwithstanding the general exemption of &#163;250, the department receives from him the highest tax levied in the Commonwealth. The Government must do something to cure this evil. It is unfair to allow it to continue. I have shown conclusively that ordinary shareholders are paid their full dividends, receiving at the same time all the benefits of the act in the way of exemption and deduction, whereas the unfortunate preference shareholder has to pay the highest rate levied, is allowed no deduction, and does not participate in the general exemption which is supposed to apply to the whole community. </para>

                        <para>- The Assistant Minister further objected that,  as  the general exemption from the special property tax is &#163;250  a  year, the amendment would cause  a  heavy loss of revenue. Does the honorable senator mean that, although Parliament in its wisdom has decreed a general exemption of &#163;250 a year, yet through the ramifications of a section of another act, which has nothing to do with the exemptions under the principal act, some people are compelled to pay the special property tax, and have no right or opportunity to participate in the general exemption? Does he mean that the department is justified in swelling the Consolidated Revenue by such means, in spite of the fact that the law enacts that the people thus penalized shall not be taxed at all? The Assistant Minister&#39;s statement that a loss of revenue would be caused is surely an admission that the receipts of the department have been wrongly inflated by imposing taxation on those whom Parliament exempts in the Taxation Act. These people are justified in expecting the Government to realize promptly the unfair position in which they have been placed, and to refund every penny they have had to pay in excess of what the principal act requires. I hope that the committee will support the amendment, the acceptance of which may necessitate some other provision to assist companies. That, however, is a matter for future consideration. My present object is to remove this burden from people who are least able to bear it. </para>

There is in the law a special provision that money which has already paid tax in the hands of the company shall not be called upon to pay again in the hands of the individual, and shall not affect the rate at which the individual is assessed. </para>

                    LAWSON.What the honorable senator suggests is, administratively, practically impossible. It would be burdensome and too difficult to administer. Section 88a was put in the act of 1931 by the Scullin Government in an endeavour to do justice as between the two classes of shareholders. A refund to preference shareholders would involve so much vexatious administration that it is considered impracticable. The 22$ per cent, deduction from dividends of preference shareholders has nothing to do with any Commonwealth act. It is made under the financial emergency legislation of the State in which the preference shareholder derives his income.

                        <para>- The preference shareholder is not a shareholder in the ordinary sense. He has lent his money for the purpose of investment in the company at a fixed rate of interest. In pursuance of State financial emergency legislation, some States apply the 22^ per cent, deduction to preference shareholders; others do not. In any event, it is beyond the power of the Commonwealth to interfere. As such deductions,, wherever made, are in no way due to Commonwealth legislation, the Government must oppose the amendment. </para>

Otherwise, 1 should have been glad to withdraw it. I have no grievance against the companies or the department.

                    <para class="block">The estimates of expenditure  from the  Consolidated Revenue Fund  for additions,  new works, buildings, &#38;c.,  for the  year ending the 30th June, 1935, provide for a total expenditure of &#163;1,624,880. The following table shows the distribution of that amount over the various sections of the new works estimates, and gives a comparison with the expenditure for the financial year 1933-34: - </para>

                    <para class="block">The amount provided in these estimates for new works from the Consolidated Revenue Fund is &#163;184,423 less than the amount expended from revenue last year; but I remind honorable senators that provision is made in the works loan estimates for &#163;1,000,000 for post-office undertakings. The total estimated expenditure from revenue and loan fund, including the balance of the loan fund appropriation of last year, is &#163;2,845,051, compared with &#163;1,667,910 actually expended during 1933-34. The estimated increased expenditure of &#163;1,177,141  is  exclusive of &#163;1,160,000 to be expended on defence works from the amount to be specially appropriated for that purpose from the accumulated excess receipts in the Consolidated Revenue Fund at the 30th June, 1934. It will be seen that the Government is making substantial provision for additional expenditure on works during the current financial year. Owing to financial stringency, works expenditure has necessarily been curtailed during recent years. It  is  now necessary to provide for much more liberal expenditure in order to meet the growing needs of the various departments and to supply the public with postal and other facilities in respect  of  which increased revenue is being received. The larger expenditure on new works will aid in the alleviation of the unemployment problem. I commend the measure to the favorable consideration of the Senate. </para>

                        <para>.- I congratulate the Government on its attempt to relieve unemployment, although the effort is very belated. The bill will provide work for a comparatively small number of men ; it will not go far towards fulfilling the Government&#39;s promise to provide work for the workless. Notwithstanding that this measure is brought forward practically on the eve of an election, I am glad that, at last, the Government is attempting to do something for the unemployed, and I shall not delay its passage. </para>

                        <para>. - Nothing has occurred to warrant a departure from what has been the procedure in the Senate for over 30 years. This is an elected chamber, and I cannot agree with any proposal that would take control of the business of this chamber out of the control of the elected representatives. If the proposed procedure were applied to similar occasions in the House of Representatives, and all things were equal, one might be tempted to fall in with the wishes of the Government.I do not know what the Government has in mind when it proposes to give this drastic power to an official of the Senate. </para>

                    <para class="block">I am not going to say that the  Clerk,  whoever he might be, would abuse the power proposed to be given to him under this amendment. As a labour senator, however, I always look forward to the swing of the. political pendulum, and with that in mind I suggest that this proposal may have a boomerang effect. Of course it can be contended that the framers of the Constitution clearly contemplated that the Senate should not be a party chamber. We have, however, seen the Senate change from a chamber of review to a strictly party chamber, in which partisan feeling at times has been bitter. I do not intend to support the amendment. </para>

                        <para>. - I desire to remove a misapprehension from the mind of the honorable senator. This amendment has not been proposed by the Government. It is the unanimous recommendation of the Standing Orders Committee, and in submitting this and other recommendations to honorable senators I am merely acting for the  President.  There is no doubt that the power proposed to be given to the  Clerk  is inferentially contained in the existing Standing Order. Unless the  Clerk  has some such control over debate the proceedings of the Senate might get. into a hopeless state. A certain amount of trouble has occurred in the past. </para>

                        <para>- The power given by the existing Standing Order to the  Clerk  is so slight as not to be dangerous. Somebody must preside while the  President  is being elected, and for the sake of convenience the  Clerk  is named. But an occasion might arise when there would be considerable friction between parties over the choice of a presiding officer, and I do not think the onus of giving a ruling on such occasions should rest on a paid official of this chamber. </para>

                            <para>- We have not yet given it to any one. Under the existing Standing Order the  Clerk  presides in a limited sense only. He is in the same position as the corresponding official in the British Parliament or in other parliaments of the Empire. He can indicate by pointing which honorable senator is to speak when two or more rise simultaneously, but he can go no further than that. In the event of a brawl occurring on these occasions there are other means of settling it, and I do not think that the  Clerk  should be placed in the invidious position of having to give a ruling should any friction occur. Under such circumstances the Senate should settle its own quarrels. Bather than give the proposed powers to an official it would be better to provide that the honorable senator previously occupying the position should fill the presidential chair until his successor was elected. Failing that, some other means preferable to the proposal contained in the amendment could be devised for controlling the business on such occasions. In the past we have always managed to get along without any serious disagreement. </para>

                        <para>. - I think I understand the reason for the apprehension which, apparently, exists in the minds of Senators Dunn and Rae as to the consequence of vesting in the  Clerk  of the Senate the authority of the presiding officer in all proceedings for the election of the  President.  But it will be admitted that it is advisable to clothe some one with authority in order to reach finality. At present, there is a great deal of indefiniteness about the proceedings. Honorable senators can, if they wish, take a whole day over the business. Need  I  remind Senators Dunn and Rae that, in the State which they represent, on one occasion the choosing of a  speaker  for the Legislative Assembly gave rise to a discussion which lasted for many hours. Probably the less said about its conclusion, the better; it ended rather ingloriously. The motion now before the Chair defines clearly the procedure to be followed. If it is objected that it is unwise to give to the  Clerk  the powers of the  President,  I remind honorable senators that the privileges enjoyed by the presiding officer are subject to certain limitations, and the Senate may disagree with his ruling; so also, would the  Clerk,  if be offended, be subject to correction by the Senate, in which power finally resides. This recommendation of the Standing Orders committee is an attempt to end the uncertainty which exists at present concerning proceedings for the election of the  President,  and I think it will appeal to the good sense of honorable senators generally. We may take it that the  Clerk  will not act unfairly, because, for one reason, he will be clothed with the powers of the presiding officer for only a limited period, and if he offends he can be quickly called to order. </para>

                        <para>. -  It is not my intention to oppose the motion, because in view of what has occurred in the past, it is desirable to agree upon some procedure for the election of  President.  Nevertheless, it seems to me that the amplification of the powers of the  Clerk  may place him in an invidious position. He will be expected, for the time being, to assume all the powers of the  President.  In view of what has taken place during the term of this Parliament, I am somewhat in sympathy with the views of Senators Rae and Dunn, whose desire is to ensure the fullest measure of debate in respect of any question that comes before this chamber, It is obvious that the Government did attempt to have the rules of debate altered so as to limit discussion on the first and second reading of important bills, and I am glad to know that the Standing Orders Committee did not lend its support to that suggestion. It is desirable that the freest discussion should be permitted in connexion with all bills brought before the Senate. Only to-day we passed, without discussion, a measure involving the borrowing of over &#163;1,250,000. As the items in the schedule were taken as a whole, honorable senators bad no opportunity to deal with details of the bill. There is an undoubted tendency on the part of the Government to shorten debate on measures that come before the Senate, and to prevent honorable senators from being heard as they should be heard when they think that any particular measure affects the people whom they represent. I do not intend to oppose the motion to vest the  Clerk  temporarily with the powers of the  President,  but with other honorable senators I look with sus picion on this tendency to shorten debate. We have evidence of it in the fact, that although so far as we know, Parliament will be adjourned to-morrow night, there is a long list of bills to be dealt with. I view almost with alarm this tendency to restrict debate on important measures that come before this chamber. </para>

                        <para>. -  I think we may assume that the Standing Orders Committee would not have submitted this recommendation unless it was convinced that there was good reason for it. The procedure suggested, of course, is a departure from a very old established custom in connexion with the election of the presiding officers. I have not had time to find out how long it has been observed, hut I know it has been the practice in the House of Commons for a great many years. This recommendation is a definite departure from the custom which lays down, in effect, that just as members of Parliament have freedom from arrest in Parliament House, so members cannot on the motion to choose the member who shall preside, be subject to any authority over them within their own Parliament. There was substantial reason for the adoption of that course. The only reason, I take it, for the alteration now proposed - I think it is a valid reason - is that it has been somewhat abused. I do not say that it has been abused in this chamber, but to my knowledge it has been taken advantage of in the House of Representatives, one member in particular making very long speeches about anything and everything, simply because there was no specific Standing Order governing the procedure by which he could be checked. We may quite properly assume that the  Clerk,  who knows the Standing Orders if anybody does,  is  not likely to adminster them unwisely, because, for one thing, his reign is short and the day of retribution would come soon. But apart from that fact, any one who has risen to the position of Clerk of the Senate or of the House of Representatives  is  not likely to be a person to take momentary advantage of his authority. </para>

                            <para>- I am not quite certain to what extent he would be forced to accept a motion that his ruling be dissented from. He might rule it out of order, and for the moment, be in complete control. Under the present system the  Clerk  is under the painful necessity of having to point. As we were taught, when children, that it is not good manners to point, we should not require the  Clerk  to be guilty of what* is regarded as bad form! That procedure, I think, is somewhat farcical. I see no objection to giving the  Clerk  power to call upon individual senators by name. I agree with that part of the recommendation which suggests that speeches in support of nominations for the presiding officer should be limited to fifteen minutes. That time ought to be quite sufficient for any honorable senator to extol the merits of even the greatest  President  or future  President.  Above all, the Senate, in surrendering temporarily by this proposal its right, does not give away its power. If any attempt were made to abuse the authority which it gives to the  Clerk,  or if the new procedure were found to be unworkable, it could be changed. While the suggested procedure is a definite departure from an old-established custom, I think it is justified. I intend to support the motion. </para>

                        <para>. - It seems to me that the reasons advanced in support of the proposal to change the procedure for the electionof the  President  emphasize the arguments of those who are opposed to it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> mentioned the trivial objection that, under the existing arrangement, the  Clerk  is obliged to point to the honorable senator who shall next address the Senate. That objection can be overcome quite easily. I have not the slightest objection to the  Clerk  being authorized to call an honorable senator by name. I have always thought the present practice rather foolish. As to the main objection that there has been a certain amount of abuse under the existing procedure or lack of it, I do not think that any one can accuse me of taking advantage of any situation to abuse fellow senators or any one else. While I admit that, in a moment of anger, I might feel impelled to say something which I would regret afterwards, I am not prone to abuse my fellows. It is, however, desirable that there should bo a clear distinction between abuse and candid criticism. In the ordinary conduct of business in the Senate no opportunity is afforded to criticize candidly the presiding officer, as is the case when the Senate is called upon to choose its  President..  It is only right that, when an honorable senator is nominated for the position, our right of criticism should be unrestricted. We should be able to say exactly what we think of his fitness or unfitness for the position. Short of offering a deliberate insult to a candidate to whom we might be opposed, we should have the full opportunity to criticize his conduct in the chair, if he is seeking re-election, or his fitness if he has not had previous experience in the chair. If the recommendation be adopted, we shall he rigidly bound, not merely by the rules, but by the practice in this chamber, and shall be denied the opportunity to say anything detrimental to the character or capacity of the honorable senator nominated. Ineffect honorable senators will be prevented from criticizing an honorable senator selected to hold the highest office which the Senate has to offer, and who, in their opinion, may be unsuitable for the position. It would be preferable to incur the risk of an honorable senator abusing his rights rather than to prevent legitimate criticism. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline> Hays said that the  Clerk  of the Senate should be as capable of controlling the proceedings in this chamber as is a duly elected president; but on such occasions we should not permit an officer over whom we would have no authority to exercise such power. I oppose the motion. </para>

                    <para class="block">That is to say, the Minister or private member introducting the bill has the right to say that he is moving the second reading <inline font-style="italic">pro forma,</inline> and then no debate is allowed, provided that an intimation has been given of the intention to move the reference of the bill to a select committee or standing committee. The proviso ensures that all honorable senators shall  be  advised of the position, but honorable senators other than the mover, who have no rights up to this stage, have had their rights provided for in Standing Order  196.  All that has been done by the Standing Orders Committee in the amendments now proposed is to simplify the method adopted in Standing Order  196.  The recommendation of the committee is that present Standing Order  196  be left out and that three new Standing Orders should embody the whole of the provisions now contained in it. Proposed new Standing Order  196 repeats the  ordinary practice of the committal of the bill after the second reading. By proposed new Standing Order  196a  a motion to refer the bill to a standing committee or select committee, and/or an instruction, may be moved immediately after the second reading. Proposed new Standing Order  196b  provides that where the second reading of any bill has been taken <inline font-style="italic">pro forma,</inline> on the first occasion for consideration of the bill in committee of the whole the question that the bill be now committed shall be proposed, and the motion shall be open to debate as though  it  were a second-reading motion. The committee has not interfered with Standing Order  195a  at all relating to the <inline font-style="italic">pro forma</inline> introduction of the bill if the honorable senator in charge of it intends to have it referred to a committee, but it has preserved all the rights of debate given in Standing Order  196.  There were some suggestions of limitation. </para>

                            <para>- I suggest that that objection has been met. As regards the possibility of repetition of debate, raised by proposed new Standing Order  196b,  under our old procedure the proposal to refer a bill to a select committee was made as an amendment to the motion for the second reading. Under the new procedure the action will be taken as the result of a substantive motion made after the second reading. In the former case the following rules of debate would apply  - (1)  Senators who had spoken to the motion for the second reading could speak again, but only to the amendment;  (2)  Senators who had not previously spoken would, if speaking after the amendment had been moved, be taken as speaking both to the original motion and the amendment. In the latter case the remarks of senators speaking to thesubstantive motion would be confined to the subject-matter of it, and they should not discuss the bill itself. What, then, are the possibilities for repetition of debate? Presuming that the amendment was moved practically at the close of the debate on the second reading, any senator who had already taken part in the debate could speak again to the amendment. In such circumstances the opportunity for debate would be very little less than would arise as the result of the moving of the substantive motion. Repetition would occur if senators, in speaking to the substantive motion, digressed into a discussion of the bill itself, but such digression would not be in order and could be checked by the  President  or by senators themselves. </para>

                    <para>It is considered that the proposed alteration provides a better form of putting the question for the peremptory closing of a debate. Under the present Standing Orders, after the Senate has divided on the question &#34; that the Senate do now divide &#34;, should the question be resolved in the affirmative, the Senate must at once divide again on the main question. The Senate may not desire to divide on such question, but may be prepared to allow it to go on the voices. The amendment really effects a cleaning up. </para>

                    <para>I have discussed the proposal contained in the motion with several honorable senators, and they appear to think that it is somewhat unfair to ask the Senate to determine on each occasion the length of any extension of time which should be granted to a senator. Under the existing standing order, a senator who is granted an extension of time is entitled to an additional 30 minutes; the amendment suggested by the Standing Orders Committee provides that the duration of the extension shall be stipulated in the motion proposing it. When the matter came before the Standing Orders Committee I was not favorably impressed with the proposal to vary the time of the extension ; but I assure honorable senators that the Standing Orders Committee made its recommendation on the understanding that the standing order would be administered in a friendly spirit. It was not aimed at any one honorable senator, and was not intended to prevent a  speaker  from completing his remarks, if he had sufficient material for a speech of a little longer duration than the usual time allotted to him. The committee had in mind occasions when senators had intimated that an additional few minutes would be sufficient, for them to complete their remarks. The unanimous view of the members of the committee was that an honorable senator who desired an extension of time should indicate the length of the extension necessary, and that, if the motion for such extension was agreed to, no objection would be raised if he took an additional 30 minutes. The committee has endeavoured to amend the standing order with a view to shortening the time of debate without infringing upon the rights of honorable senators. If the new standing order is administered in the spirit in which it was framed, no injustice will be done to any member of this chamber. </para>

Under the existing standing order, any honorable senator may move that the limit of one hour, or one and a half hours, may be extended for 30 minutes. If such a courtesy is extended to an honorable senator, it does not impose on him any obligation to speak for the full 30 minutes. </para>

                            <para>- There is probably not any member of the Senate whose speeches would not be improved by condensation ; but it may sometimes happen that &#39; a senator honestly finds that he cannot say in five minutes what he thought he could. If he wants another extension of time must some one move that he be allowed a further five, ten, fifteen, or 29 minutes? So far, no solution of the difficulty mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Halloran</inline> has been offered. In m.v opinion, the amendment will present difficulties; the Senate may be placed in the invidious position of having to ask an honorable senator how much more time he desires for the completion of his speech. </para>

                        suggested that a  speaker  should be given a signal when the time allotted1 to him has nearly expired. The purpose of the honorable senator can be achieved without a standing order. The  Clerk  keeps a record of the time at which each honorable senator commences to speak, and he could intimate the approach of the termination of the time allowed, either by a memorandum to the honorable senator speaking, or by informing the occupant of the chair, who, in turn, could advise the  speaker.  I agree with
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rao</inline>
                        that it is a convenience to a  speaker  to know when his time is about to expire, so that he may round off his remarks in the time still remaining to him ; but there is no need for a standing order to enable such notification to be given.

                        (Queensland) 1 6.4&#93;. - When I read in the report of the Standing - Orders Committee the phrase &#34; except a slight modification of the provision with regard to extension of time,&#34; I was inclined, to think that nothing of great importance was proposed. I have had sufficient industry to refer to the existing Standing Order, and I have come to the conclusion that the words proposed to be inserted will very materially alter it. I base that conclusion on the experience of this Parliament. I listened with great attention to the arguments advanced by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Halloran,</inline>
                        but they did not convince me, although I regret to have to disagree with my  deputy  leader. I think
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brennan</inline>
                        dealt with this matter very fully and convincingly. We have to provide for such contingencies as might arise from party bitterness in the future. I am not saying that any power of restricting debate would be used more maliciously by one side than by the other. We have to remember &#39;that, if drastically-minded,  either party might use the provision now suggested, simply for the purpose of harassing an opponent. If a leader should suggest that an opponent be stifled by the application of the Standing Orders, members of his party would naturally support him in the carrying out of that suggestion.

                        <para>- If the proposed amendment to include the words &#34; for any period up to thirty minutes &#34; is adopted, a ridiculous position might arise. If honorable senators on this side wished to curtail an opponent&#39;s speech they could do so very easily by moving a contemptuous motion. Or a member of the majority party might move that a  speaker  be allowed to continue his speech for a minute. All honorable senators cannot express themselves succinctly; some are naturally verbose and discursive, but that is no reason why their right of speech should be limited by their opponents. I read recently of a very fine journalist who won his case at law but obtained a verdict for only one shilling. That verdict was contemptuous. Under the proposed amendment a  speaker  might be facetiously or contemptuously granted an extension for 30 seconds. The modification of the existing Standing Order, although described by the Minister as slight, can have very serious consequences. It could be used purely as a means of wasting the time of the House. Senators could move for an extension of 20 seconds or half a minute or any other such ridiculous period and upon the rejection of the motion, a further motion for a slightly longer extension could be made. These trifling motions, and amendments upon them, could continue almost indefinitely. </para>

                            <para>- Nevertheless the proposed amendment would open the way for the moving of a succession of contemptuous motions, thus wasting time. I think it would be far better if a definite time for the extension of speeches were stated. Otherwise it would be better not to permit any alteration at all. It appears to me that the Standing Orders Committee did not give to this proposal adequate consideration ; probably it was pressed by a strong member of the committee and passed without its implications being fully appreciated. I hope that the committee will reject the amendment. </para>

                        <para>. - Personally I would have been very pleased to support the amendment if it stated a definite period for the extension of speeches. The freest possible discussion should be allowed on matters of national importance, especially as during this year the Senate has met for only comparatively a few hours. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir George</inline> Pearce has been so long a member of this chamber that he has reached a stage when he cannot really enjoy a good discussion on anything. Probably if I had been a senator for so long a period I should feel the same. From what I can see of the honorable senator, he is very happy in limiting discussions and curtailing speech on matters coming before the Senate. I have noticed a look of boredom on his face. </para>

                    <para class="block">The purpose of this measure is to appropriate &#163;4,160,000 out of revenue for defence expenditure of a capital nature. This amount will be paid to the credit, of the Defence Equipment Trust Fund, and will be applied to naval construction, purchase of armaments, aircraft, munitions, equipment, machinery, plant, and reserves of ammunition and oil fuel; for defence works and buildings, and for the acquisition of sites therefor. When speaking on another measure this afternoon, the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Lawson)</inline> indicated the origin of this money, and explained how it came to be available, so it is not necessary for me to say anything further on that point. </para>
                    <para>On the 25th September, 1933, when speaking in Sydney, I outlined to the  &#91;Ml  people of Australia the Government&#39;s defence policy. I pointed out then that owing to the financial stress through which Australia had passed, our defences had fallen below a reasonable margin of safety. I did not then, and I do not now, place any of the blame for that state of affairs on the preceding Government. The Scullin Administration was the victim of circumstances. During its regime the financial position of Australia was so serious that drastic reductions had to be made in all forms of governmental expenditure. But with the revival of our finances, and in view of the condition of world affairs to-day, it becomes the bounden duty of this Parliament to make more adequate provision for the protection of Australia than we have to-day. </para>
                    <para>One of the most serious aspects of defence is that owing to the period, of financial stringency through which wo have passed, not only was there insufficient money available for the upkeep of existing defence services, but, in addition, our reserves were exhausted. As honorable senators are no doubt aware, we are not self sufficient in this respect, so if, unhappily, war again broke out, and Australia were attacked, we should have to depend very largely upon our reserves. A start was made last year to make good the deficiency. Provision for the continuance of that important, work is contained in the bill now before honorable senators. </para>
                    <para>I am aware that there are in Australia many people who cavil at this proposed expenditure; but I suggest to honorable senators that if there is one country on earth with peaceful intentions, that country is Australia. We have no intention or desire to interfere with any other nation. All we ask is to be allowed to continue the peaceful development of this country. No matter how strongly some people may be opposed to expenditure on defence, and how firmly convinced they may be that it takes two to make a quarrel, they must realize that circumstances may arise in which it takes only one to make a quarrel - if, for example, one government has peaceful intentions, and the government  of another country is aggressive. Ju recent history there have been many instances of peaceful nations having been attacked by other nations. Therefore, it behoves us to make more adequate provision for the defence of Australia against attack. </para>
                    <para>Another serious phase in connexion with our defence is that all the material for the three arms of the Service - the Navy, the Army and the Air Force - has become obsolete at about the same time. On the naval side the cruisers <inline font-style="italic">Sydney</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide</inline> are obsolete. The same may be said of our fixed defences. The guns in our forts were installed in 1911, and to-day are out of date. In the air force the trouble is not so much obsolescence of equipment as wastage of material duc to ordinary wear and tear. Thus it happens that capital expenditures for the three arms of the Service synchronizes in this particular period. </para>
                    <para>When I outlined the Government&#39;s defence programme in September last, I emphasized the necessity for a long-term policy, and urged that the defence of Australia should be treated as a non-party question, pointing out that it would be a waste of money for one government representing a particular political party to lay down a policy if, later, with a change of government, that policy were materially altered or perhaps abandoned. </para>
                    <para>The Government is now asking for the necessary appropriation to give effect to this policy. We should like to feel that no matter what change takes place as a result of the ensuing elections, the defence programme for Australia will be carried on by the succeeding government. I need only point to the position of our fixed defences to bring home to honorable senators the urgent need for a long-term policy. Obviously it is impossible to provide the whole of the necessary equipment for land defence in one year. The expenditure must necessarily be spread over three or four years before the most vital ports in Australia are placed in something like a reasonable state of defence. It would be aif absolute waste of money if we were to spend a large sum. on this year&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">-programme</inline> and then, because of a change of government or some other untoward happening, the programme were abandoned next year. I, therefore, hope that whatever may be the &#39;result of the coming election we shall be able to ensure, under the provisions of this bill, a coherent and continuous defence programme for Australia. This, I think, is a reasonable request to make, and it is one to which I hope all parties in this Parliament will subscribe. </para>
                    <para>The first arm of the Government is to restore the defence forces from the weakened condition to which they were reduced by the radical cuts in expenditure in 1930-31 and 1931-32; and having established the permanent organization on n satisfactory maintenance basis, then proceed with the programme, the fulfilment of which will be a step towards those strengths which I outlined in my speech in Sydney last year. This developmental programme has been planned for a period of three years at an estimated cost of &#163;6,200,000. &#39; Of this amount &#163;5,000,000 is to be applied to capital expenditure, and &#163;1,200,000 for an increase of maintenance expenditure consequent upon the capital expenditure referred to. The appropriation of &#163;4,160,000 in this bill is towards that capital expenditure. The maintenance expenditure for 1934-35 is (included in the estimates of expenditure for ordinary services. Of the total amount of &#163;4.160,000 the sum of &#163;2,250,000 is to be applied to naval construction. Practically the whole of this sum is required- for the purchase of a new cruiser to be named H.M.A.S. <inline font-style="italic">Sydney,</inline> and a second sloop. One sloop is already under construction at Cockatoo Island Dockyard, the money for it having been provided during the last financial year. An amount of &#163;50,000 appears on the Estimates towards the construction of the second sloop. </para>
                    <para>In pursuance of the Government&#39;s policy to maintain the Royal Australian Navy at an effective strength, and as a fair contribution to Empire naval defence, in April of this year the Government decided to replace H.M.A.S. <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane,</inline> a cruiser of 5,120 tons, and armed with eight 6-in. guns, and which became over age in 1932, by a new ship of the <inline font-style="italic">Leander</inline> type, to be named </para>

                        <para>Cruisers of this class are of 7,250 tons. The armament consists of eight6-in. guns, four anti-aircraft guns, and six 21-in. torpedo tubes. The speed is32&#189; knots, and oil fuel is used in the engines. The machinery includes Parsons-geared turbines and four screws. The6-in. guns are in four turrets, and are of an entirely new model. The new cruiser will be the most up-to-date vessel of the kind afloat. Its length will be 564&#189; feet, the beam 55 ft. 2 in., and the mean draught 16 feet. </para>
                        <para>The approximate cost of building the vessel in Great Britain will be &#163;1,800,000, and, with about &#163;450,000 added for exchange, the total cost will amount to &#163;2,250,000. </para>

                    <para class="block">The types of cruisers and the ships we have on the Australian station are not selected haphazard. In this matter the Commonwealth Government is in direct consultation with the Committee of Imperial Defence, and that committee is in consultation with the Admiralty in the selection and stationing of ships, with a view to the service which they would have to perform in time of war. I know that some ill-informed critics, who have discussed the merits of the ships that we have on the Australian station, have endeavoured to show that we have been ill advised in selecting particular types. All I can say on that point is that, if <inline font-style="italic">we</inline> have been ill advised, it is a poor lookout for the British Empire, because those advising us are responsible for British naval strategy, not merely on the seas surrounding the United Kingdom, but also on the seas in every quarter of the globe. Every ship on the Australian station is there as the result of such advice. The. role which such a squadron willplay if war should eventuate has already been predetermined in the naval strategy of the Empire, and surely those responsible for this plan are qualified to know in what part of the Empire a particular type of ship can perform the greatest service.Some ill-informed persons also speak of the ships as if their role in the defence of the Australian coast is not determined with that object in view. The task of the fast cruisers of the Empire navies is to defend the trade routes, and the tradeand commerce of the Empire, and for such a taskthese ships, and particularly those of the type </para>
                    <para class="block">I have described, are the most suitable. In the southern hemisphere there are other British squadrons which, in time of war, would act in co-operation, and quite probably would be under one command. The composition of them is determined by the knowledge that on the Australian station there are ships of certain types, speeds, and armament. &#34;With the possible exception of New Zealand, Australia is more vitally interested in the protection of trade routes than is any other portion of the British Empire. Our whole economic life depends upon the seas being kept open. I ask honorable senators to visualize what would happen to this country if our overseas trade were interrupted for even a month. </para>

If the whole of our overseas trade were interrupted, what would be the effect upon our finances, trade and economic life? This country would be practically paralyzed. In these circumstances, it is vital that, in any emergency, the trade routes between Australia and the Mother Country, and other parts of the Empire, should remain open. For that purpose no ships are more valuable than the types that are being placed on the Australian station. </para>

                    <para>There is another aspect to this question to which I invite the attention of the Senate: In our treaties with foreign countries, in relation to disarmament, the British Empire is regarded as one unit. In the treaty that resulted from the Washington Disarmament Conference, the fleets of the Empire are regarded as one, and the quota of ships allotted to the British Empire includes the Australian squadron. In that treaty a certain life is allocated to each of various classes of ships, and at certain periods the nations which are parties to the treaty are entitled to replace with modern vessels those that become obsolete. H.M.A.S. <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> became over age in 1932, and, from that year, was regarded as obsolete; the British Empire was not entitled to replace it in 1932, but is entitled to do so in 1935. </para>

                            <para>- I shall answer that later. Australia was a signatory of the Washington Naval Agreement, under which the battle-cruiser H.M.A.S. <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> was declared to be one of the ships to be disposed of, and as a voluntary act on the part of the Commonwealth was  sunk  outside Sydney Heads. If we do not replace H.M.A.S. <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> in 1935, some other ship of the British quota will have to be replaced, and the British Government will re* place one of its cruisers of the* type with an up-to-date cruiser of the type I have indicated ; but it will have to scrap a. more modern vessel than H.M.A.S. <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane.</inline> By retaining that vessel in the Empire&#39;s fleets we would be keeping the more obsolete of two cruisers. If the Commonwealth Government had wished to build the new cruiser in Australia to replace H.M.A.S. <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> in 1935 steps to that end should have been taken in 1931 at the latest, because, in view of our experience in the construction of the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane,</inline> four or five years at least would be required to construct a vessel of the <inline font-style="italic">Le.and.cr</inline> type. That was not done, because the necessary money was not available, but to-day we are able to provide the money with which to replace the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> by 1935 with one of the most modern cruisers in existence. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </interjection>
                    <para>It is also interesting to note that when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin,</inline> as Prime Minister, was in England in 1930, he gave the British Admiralty an undertaking that if the financial conditions permitted, H.M.A.S. <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> would be replaced in 1935 with an up-to-date cruiser. In these circumstances I feel confident that the Government will have the unanimous support of the Senate in the action which it is taking in this regard. </para>
                    <para>In regard to the  sloops  that are to be built in Australia, an order for one has already been placed with the company at present controlling the Cockatoo Island Dockyard. Honorable senators will remember that at a time when the Government was losing &#163;60,000 a year on the dockyard It entered into an agreement with a company to lease it and a grant from the Treasury had to be made to make up the deficiency. At that time 350 men were employed at Cockatoo Island, but <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> the sloop <inline font-style="italic">now</inline> being constructed there  150 men are at work. Later the number will be increased to 350. On this one job which the Government has already given to the dockyard, as many men will be employed as were engaged in the whole dockyard when it was controlled by the Government. It is proposed to place an order for a second sloop this year, which will provide employment for au additional 350 men, and it is estimated that within six or nine months the number of men working on the sloops will be 650. The total number that will be employed at the dockyard when the two sloops are fully under construction will be 1,000. If, therefore, anything were needed to justify the action which the Government took at the time it handed over the dockyard, those figures amply demonstrate its wisdom. </para>
                    <para>In addition to this programme, it must be remembered that the Navy to-day lives on oil, and as Australia is not yet self-contained in the matter of oil fuel, although we have hopes in regard to Newnes, and trust also that some day supplies of flow oil may be struck, we must provide for reserves of fuel in Australia until those hopes are realized. Therefore, towards the capital expenditure on these matters, provision is here made for : &#34; Reserves of stores, &#163;109,395 &#34;, and &#34; Oil fuel tanks at Darwin and Sydney, towards cost, &#163;26,810&#34;, or a total of &#163;136,205. </para>
                    <para>The capital expenditure on the Army for this year will be as follows: - Coast defences &#163;141,500, anti-aircraft defence &#163;28,000, mechanization &#163;3,000, gun ammunition &#163;42,126. technical stores &#163;9,020, or a total of &#163;223,646. That is the amount to be provided from this trust fund, but  additional  sums are included in the ordinary Estimates. As regards the fixed defences, we are not relying merely &#34; on the judgment of local experts, but have the benefit of the advice of the Committee of Imperial Defence, as to which, in their opinion, are the most vital points that need adequate coastal defence and also the nature of that defence. In that regard too, we have acted upon the best advice that the British Empire can produce, as to both the points to be defended and the class of the defences there. In the provision now being made, a considerable step will be taken in that direction. </para>
                    <para>As to the Air Force, for the replacement of damaged and lost planes we are providing in the ordinary Estimates for eighteen Hawker Demons, those being the latest type of aircraft advised by the British Air Ministry and our own Air Force officers. We have also made provision for the purchase of 24 seaplanes of the amphibian Seagull Mark V. type, which is the latest type now being used by Great Britain. In addition, we are in this bill providing for the extension of the Air Force. The provision to which I have just referred will make up the wastage, but by the use of this reserve fund, which we are setting aside, we propose to put into operation the remainder of the first portion of the plan which Air-Marshal Salmond gave to Australia some years ago. To that end, out of this vote we are providing for the following capital expenditure: Technical equipment, including aircraft engines, motor transport vehicles, ammunition and technical stores &#163;162,400, and for build*  ings,  works and sites &#163;88,600, making a total of &#163;251,000. This will entail the formation of the following new units: Two general purpose squadrons and one wing head-quarters, with stores depot, aircraft repair section, and engine repair section at Richmond, New South Wales; one general purpose squadron at Laverton, Victoria; coastal reconnaissance flight at Point Cook, Victoria, and Citizen Air Force squadron at Perth, Western Australia. These additions will considerably increase our strength in the air as compared with what has existed hitherto. They will enable us, if necessary, to put the seaplane carrier <inline font-style="italic">Albatross</inline> in commission again and equip her with modern amphibians. </para>

                            <para>- We have not had them before. We had Seagulls, which are to-day obsolete. Another factor provided for in this bill and also partly in last year&#39;s estimate is this : There has been adopted in the British Navy what is known as the catapult contrivance for launching seaplanes from ships, and our cruisers and also the carrier <inline font-style="italic">Albatross</inline> are being equipped with catapults, so that they will be able to make a much more effective use of their seaplanes than has hitherto been the case. In this regard the opening up of the new air mail service will have an important bearing on the air defence &#39; of Australia. Honorable senators know that there have been some developments at Darwin in connexion with its defence and also in connexion with the air mail service, which will result in making Darwin a very important air port for Australia. These developments include, not only the aerodrome, but the hangar and the repair workshops, which will be an important factor in the air defence of Australia, if any threat should come from the north. </para>

                    <para>Another factor in our defence, partly covered by this bill - a factor which does not excite quite so much public attention as do other branches of the service, but still is in- itself of almost vital importance -is the development of the manufacture of munitions in Australia. I am glad to announce that Australia can conscientiously say that there are no millionaires within its borders making profits out of the provision of armaments. We have no armament firms whatsoever in Australia. Our armament and munition factories are not owned by private enterprise and therefore the element of profit does not enter into the production of these needs. I have read many sensational stories and allegations of the part that the proprietors of munition works play in promoting war. These can never be told of Australia, because our munition factories are owned, not by private enterprise, but by the people. It is pleasing to know that in this regard Australia is more self-reliant to-day than it ever was before. In this bill, and also in the Estimates, provision is made for a considerable extension of these works. The vote in this bill for capital expenditure in the Munitions Supply branch is &#163;5,000 for machinery and plant, and &#163;15,000 for buildings, works and sites, or a total of &#163;20,000, but a very much larger vote is provided for in the ordinary budget proposals. With the money that is to be made available this year, Ave shall be able to commence the manufacture in Australia of the special class of cordite, the most up to date in existence, used particularly by the Navy. Whereas we depended previously for many of these requisites on importations from overseas, we shall not only be able to supply our own needs, but, pursuant to the co-operation that has taken place in the last twelve months &#34;with the sister dominion of New Zealand, will be able to supply, and, indeed, are supplying, to that dominion a considerable proportion of the munitions required for its local defence. This progressive policy will also be most valuable should any trouble approach from, let me say, anywhere in the vicinity of India, because, by these means, we, in Australia, should be able, in view of the comparatively short distance involved, to provide many munitions if they&#39; became necessary in that quarter. I was recently furnished with a list showing that no longer than five years ago, the munitions imported for our peace-time requirements largely exceeded what we made in Australia. I am glad <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> be able to state that Inst year the munitions made in the Commonwealth -far exceeded those which we imported. In a large proportion of these votes, and especially in the case of munitions, and the building up of our reserves, we are giving employment locally, and also making ourselves self-contained, so that if &#34;we should be for a period cut off from other portions of the Empire during a war, we should be better able to defend ourselves. As I have received resolutions from people who seem to think that this expenditure could be better made in giving employment in other directions, I wish to emphasize that the employment given by it is no mean item. I have already stated that work is to be given at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard to as many as 750 men, all of whom will be earning substantial rates of pay. In addition, we are this year recruiting for the Navy, in order to man the new cruiser in August, 1935, just under 700 men. These are adults, not boys, who will enter the service and to that extent relieve the labour market. It is also gratifying to know that whereas, before the war, 75 per cent, of the personnel of the Australian Navy were officers and men of the British Navy, to-day 98 per cent, of the personnel, both officers and men, are Australians, who entered the service and received their naval education and training in the Commonwealth. We are progressing towards the ideal of self-reliance. It cannot be said that our defence preparations savour of militarism, in any degree whatsoever. Our system of defence is based entirely on the belief that the citizens of this country should be trained to defend themselves and their homes. Our permanent army consists of a small number of men whose sole duty is the training of officers and rank and file in their military duties. If war came, our army would consist of citizen forces, officered by citizens trained by this small cadre of permanent officers. The position of the navy is different; it must be prepared to act on short notice. We must have a naval reserve of Australian citizens capable of manning any vessel which is in reserve. </para>
                    <para>I have taken up more time than I intended, in an endeavour to make the position clear to honorable senators, so that they, and. indeed the country generally, may realize that the proposals of the Government are a substantial step towards the defence of Australia. I assure the Senate that these proposals contain nothing that can be dispensed with; they are the minimum which considerations of national safety permit. In my opinion anything less would be evidence of foolishness. Unless in peace we are prepared to train men and provide ships, materials and arms to defend this vast and. rich country we cannot hope to hold it. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. Some persons in the community think that- we could, at short notice, mobilize the men of Australia and make soldiers of them ; but their contention is not borne out by the experience of the last war. Notwithstanding all the enthusiasm with which the youth of Australia rallied to the colours and threw themselves into the work of training; despite their natural ability which impressed observers in other countries many  months elapsed before they could take the field as trained soldiers. We have no guarantee that, in the event of another war, an opportunity would be given to us to train our citizens. We may improvise an army, but we cannot improvise a navy or an air force, or at short notice provide docks or the equipment necessary for our defence. I ask the Senate to support the bill without regard to party considerations. </para>

                    <para>The only feature of the bill to which I object is the proposal to purchase a cruiser. Each of the three arms of defence - the navy, the army, and the air force - thinks that it is the most important in the defence of any country. The army believes that it is indispensable; the navy recalls the days of Nelson and Drake, and argues that, as the navy saved England in the past, so to-day it is the nation&#39;s greatest bulwark; the air force claims that future wars will be fought in the air, and that only by providing adequate air equipment can the safety of the nation be assured. In 1925 when the Bruce-Page Government decided to purchase two cruisers of 10,000 tons each, I opposed the proposal, because I did not think that the money would be expended in a way which would provide the best means of defending Australia. I had previously had a conversation with an air force expert, in which I asked him what would happen if a battleship and a number- of aeroplanes were opposedHe said that, given six aeroplanes with two men in each, he would sink the biggest battleship afloat. He expected that in the conflict two aeroplanes and four men would be lost.  His  argument appealed to me, and I opposed the spending of &#163;5,000,000 to purchase two cruisers. I believed then, as I believe now, that the money would have been better spent in equipping an up-to-date air force, so that no ship would venture near our shores. I do not believe that it is necessary to purchase the cruiser which the Government proposes to obtain. The Bruce Page Government said that one of the two cruisers then thought necessary would be built in England, but that no decision regarding the building of the second vessel would be arrived at until after Parliament had been consulted. Notwithstanding that undertaking, both cruisers were ordered from England before Parliament had an opportunity to discuss the matter. At a cost &#163;5,000,000 to Australia, the two cruisers were obtained, but their condition wai such that no one knows what would hav, happened had they met an enemy battleship. </para>

                            <para>- That is progress and we cannot escape such developments. When our fathers and mothers came to Australia the voyage occupied six months, and many of them were lucky to get here at all. We are the children of sturdy and courageous pioneers, and all of us must feel eager to preserve the liberties they won for us. I think we can depend upon the progeny of such forebears to protect the country they helped <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> settle. But what is the urgent need for acquiring a battleship ? The vessel which is to be brought from England will have taken three years to construct, and has already been on the stocks for two years. Even if Australia did require this vessel urgently, I emphasize that Australian workmen, backed by the Australian nation, would be game enough to try to build a bigger and better battleship than it would be possible for England to send to us. But there is no urgent need for this battleship. The time is approaching when Australians will have so developed the resources of this country that its workmen will be capable of building anything, including a battleship. We have already built a battleship and we can do it again. </para>

                            <para>- At any rate Australia built me, and I am not a bad battleship. I do not see the necessity for Australia to spend about &#163;3,000,000 on the purchase of a vessel that is to be built in another country. The work will employ people who are our kinsmen certainly; I do not necessarily object to that, but when we have among our present hungry population unemployed workmen well equipped in technical knowledge; when we have the dockyards and the country can supply the necessary materials for the building of the vessel, the sending of money abroad is indefensible. If the Government challenged the workmen of this country to build this warship they would build it in half the time that will be required to bring the vessel from England. I, and members on this side of the chamber, will certainly not vote for the proposed purchase. The Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill),</inline> when discussing this matter in the  House of Representatives, said that the stationing of this vessel in Australian waters was part of a scheme for Empire defence, and that its urgency arose out of that. This evening the Minister for Defence said that one of the purposes of Empire defence was to protect trade routes. Certainly the protection of trade routes is very vital to Great Britain. This was one of the reasons why Great Britain built its navy to such proportions that prior to 1914 it was equal to the next two most powerful  navies.  That naval superiority was necessitated by the fact that Britain was an isolated country, which, could not feed itself and so was driven to take measures to keep trade routes open for the carriage of foodstuffs from its colonies and dominions, and other parts of the world. Thus it was Britain&#39;s particular responsibility to protect the trade routes. But is that aspect of the matter of so much importance to Australia? Would it matter to Australia if the trade routes of the world were not open? We could not be starved. So far as I can see any interruption of the trade routes would, affect this country only to the extent that we would not be able to pay our debts to the landlord, as we do now with revenue received for our exports. In a local sense it is the landlord&#39;s job to keep the footpath open to facilitate his collection of the rent. So we say to the landlord of this nation, &#34; If you want to gather the rent from this country it is your job to keep the road clear.&#34; Only the United Kingdom would be embarrassed if we could not send our produce abroad to pay our debts. The Minister for Defence stated that the new cruiser is to be a unit in the system of Empire defence. If that is so, it is immaterial whether the vessel belongs to Australia or to  Great  Britain. In either case the vessel will be part of the defence of the Empire. Australia did not place the order for the cruiser to be built; </para>

                    <para class="block">Great Britain must have been constructing it to replace another cruiser. The Mother Country, like other countries, is embarrassed, and involved in the European embroglio. In protecting itself it has entered into agreements with other countries for the limitation of armaments by the restriction of naval building to certain quotas and classes of ships. Now, apparently, something has gone wrong. Great Britain has reached the danger limit, and has decided to sell to Australia a cruiser of the <inline font-style="italic">Leander</inline> type, so that it may be able to build a new one without exceeding its treaty obligations. I admit gladly and earnestly that Great Britain has done more than any other country to secure the peace of the world. And I am glad that it has done so. We are continually being reminded of what the Mother Country has done for Australia; but, as I said a few days ago, the boot is on the other foot. Australia has been doing a great deal for the Mother Country. If Great Britain wanted to evade its compact with other nations it would be a more graceful action on its part if it treated Australia as a sturdy father would treat a sturdy son, and said &#34;.Tack, you had better take this job on: I will give you the ships with which to do it.&#34; In 1925 the cost of building a 10,000 ton cruiser  wa3  estimated to be &#163;2.!879,000. Since then the cost of living index figure has dropped from 1.844 to 1.459. The cost of living makes a tremendous difference to the cost of building a warship; on such work a large number of men is employed, and the cost of living regulates the wages. It has been stated that, if this vessel were built in Australia, approximately &#163;1,000,000 only would be expended here on material and labour. If with that money we could employ 1,000 men on this work, I think it would be well worth our while to adopt that course, considering that there are 300,000 men out of work in Australia to-day, and that many of them are skilled tradesmen. In addition, their sons are leaving school, and seekiii: any job that will .provide them with a living. Why should we send money out of this country for anything? Even at the risk that if Australian artisans were given this work they might build a ship that would sink as soon as it left </para>
                    <para class="block">Sydney Harbour, this work should be undertaken locally. I oppose strongly any proposal that such a large sum of money as &#163;3,000,000 should be sent out of this country to build a ship that can be built at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard. The Government expended a lot of money in developing and equipping that establishment, and we have the opinion of experts that our workers are competent to build ships. I am aware of the agreement the Government has made with the company which recently took over these docks, and I think that the company, with a guarantee of work front the Government to the value of &#163;40,000 annually, is &#34; on a good wicket.&#34; Notwithstanding my love for Great Britain, I resent this purchase. It is time that Australian workmen were given the opportunity to show what they can accomplish in this -field of industry, and it is for this Parliament to provide that opportunity. I disagree entirely with the suggestion inferentially contained in this proposal that Australia has not the workmen capable of building a warship.

                        <para>The Government is very anxious that  at  least one cruiser should be built in Australia.  Many  reasons for this must he immediately obvious to any one. One is that the Government would naturally be desirous of promoting industry in Australia. Another is that unless it  is to  come about that defence will not be required wu should in future years have to make  provision  for the construction of further units  of  the- Australian Navy. To do that it will  be  essential that we should have a first-class dockyard and first-class staff in Australia, capable of doing the work. Apart from  this  we have the fact that from time to time  w&#187;  should inevitably require to repair our  ship*.  We should not be  in  a position to do  that until  we have actually built in the Commonwealth  ships  of the class we require. </para>

I agree with him that if we are to defend this country,  we should he in a position to supply all our own equipment. We might very well tell the &#34; old man &#34; 12,000 miles across the sea that we want to build some of these vessels ourselves. 1 view this matter not as a soldier, a sailor, or an airman, but as a citizen of this country who is proud of the achievements of his fellow Australians. Iamfirmly convinced that the day will never come when it will be possible for an aggressor to invade Australia successfully. I agree entirely with Commander Wackett whose seaplane design attracted somuch attention a few years ago, that the future of Australia&#39;s defence is in the air. Commander Wackett assured mo that with sis of his Widgeons he would be able to sink the greatest battleship that was ever built. </para>

                            <para>- I can readily understand that a military man should have a special pride in his arm of the service, and be unable to appreciate the importance of, say, the naval arm or the air force. Some permanent naval men, I believe, are under the impression that the mere landsman is unable even to stagger home properly. My honest opinion is that we should not depend upon squadrons of soldiers alone for the defence of Australia. Science, as applied to warfare, has made that impossible. A military aeroplane, supplied with a few poison bombs, can decimate an army. It would be wise to build in Australia, all the naval vessels we require, hut my view is that small ships such as the one now under construction at Cockatoo Island Dockyard are sufficient to police our waters. With an efficient air force I doubt that any battleship could come within 300 miles of the Australian coast without being sunk. </para>

                    <para>- I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> that it is necessary to take measures for the defence of Australia, and I am in accord with some of the remarks of the right honorable the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce).</inline> As an integral part of the Empire. Australia should be prepared to hear a reasonable proportion of the expenditure required for that defence, and allow the experts to determine the means to be employed, though.I believe that the major portion of the ex penditure on defence should be confined to Australia. The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> mentioned that Australia was now exporting munitions to New Zealand. It is only necessary to pursue that policy a little further to reach the stage at which we should be building all the naval vessels required, as well as naval and military aeroplanes for the defence of Australia. </para>

                    <para>Although one would like to think that, in this 20th century, war between the white races is impossible, we remember that war did take place some years ago, and we must face the fact that, in all probability, it will occur again. Therefore, repugnant as expenditure of this nature may be to the majority of the citizens of Australia, it is our duty to put the defence of this country on an organized basis. Towards this end we should, as far as possible, manufacture all the necessary equipment, and not, as in the past, depend so much upon the Mother Country. I agree with the sentiments expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> some years ago, that we should endeavour to build in Australia warships required for the defence of this country. Naval construction is not such a formidable proposition as some people believe it to be. The cruiser which the Government is purchasing is, I think, of 7,250 tons. A vessel of that size could be constructed at Cockatoo Island Dockyard, and the money kept in this country. Certain of the equipment would, of course, have to be imported. I was surprised to hear the Minister say that the main armament of the new cruiser will be only 6-in. guns. I doubt that guns of that calibre will be an effective protection, because we all remember that, during the Great War, the German cruisers <inline font-style="italic">Scharnhorst</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Gneisenau,</inline> armed with 8-in. guns, wrought havoc off the coast of South America with the <inline font-style="italic">Good Hope</inline> and other British cruisers of the older type, but in their turn were destroyed by British battle cruisers of the <inline font-style="italic">Invincible</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Indomitable</inline> class with 12-in. guns, which I saw at Spithead twenty years ago. It would, therefore, appear that the new Australian cruiser, with a main armament of 6-in. guns, will not prove a very formidable opponent to modern war vessels, which might be sent to harass Australian shipping. As it was known that the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> was becoming obsolete, action should have been taken earlier to provide a more up-to-date cruiser for Australian defence. Certainly the proposal should have been brought before Parliament before the Government committed itself to the expenditure of a large sum of money for the purchase of a vessel in Great Britain. Apparently there has been a grave oversight on the part of some one in authority. Honorable senators on this side of the chamber cannot be held responsible. I understand that <inline font-style="italic">the new cruiser</inline> was laiddown about two years ago during the term of the present Government. My principal objection to this bill is that the vessel was purchased wi thout the consent of Parliament, and that arrangements should have been made for its construction in Australia. </para>
                    <para>I believe that a stronger air force is essential for the effective defence of Australia. Some experts hold that an effective air force will be the deciding factor in future wars; but my sympathies are with the land forces, and I should not be surprised if the final issue in future wars rests with the land armies of opposing forces as in past centuries. </para>

                        <para>.- The statement of the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce),</inline> based as it was upon his personal knowledge of the subject, was so comprehen sive, clear and convincing, that there does not appear to be any need to elaborate the subject, or to criticize any of the points he raised. The right honorable gentleman referred to the fact that the Government&#39;s defence proposals embrace the three arms of defence, as is necessary since knowledge and experience have proved that no country can be defended by only one arm of the service. In listening to the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes)</inline> and his account of a conversation he had with an airman, it was not difficult to understand how ideas originate, and to realize that they usually have their genesis in the fact that a man has pride in the service of which he is a member. In primeval days, when personal contact became inevitable, the weaker sought protection by arming himself with a sling while his opponent assumed suitable armour to protect him from the assault of his rival. The same principle is being adopted to-day,and battleships with the protection they enjoy are equal to the onslaughts of modern aircraft. </para>

                    <para>The. Minister mentioned that H.M.A.S. <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> will be obsolete in 1935, and as she must be replaced next year by a modern ship, it is impossible to build such a vessel in Australia. I am strongly in favour of units of the Australian fleet being built in Australia whenever practicable, but unfortunately we have not reached the stage when that can be done economically. </para>
                    <para>The Minister mentioned that the primary function of H.M.A.S. <inline font-style="italic">Sydney</inline> will be to protect our trade routes, that her speed will be 32 knots, and that she will carry eight6-in. guns. These are light guns of high velocity and of extreme range, and are particularly suitable for vessels travelling at a high speed. The lighter guns are often more effective under certain conditions than are those of a heavier type. I have heard the Leader of the Opposition deliver a number or interesting speeches in this chamber, but I have never known him to display less enthusiasm for his subject than he did to-night, possibly because he was endeavouring to express opinions in which he did not honestly believe. The honorable senator knows that adequate defence of Australia is essential, and that if one portion of the Empire fails to provide a proper defence system, Empire defence becomes ineffective. </para>

                        <para>. - The subject of defence has  been  discussed in this chamber so often that it is not my intention to labour it to-night. On this occasion I believe that the Government is submitting additional defence proposals on the eve of an election in an endeavour to stampede the people. The members of the Labour party do not apologize for the attitude they adopt towards defence. As was stated by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes),</inline> one ot the main planks of the Labour party&#39;s pintform is the adequate defence of Australia. I presume that, the order for a vessel costing &#163;3,000,000 was placed in Great Britain by the High Commissioner in congenial company and in the most attractive surroundings, in an endeavour to assist British workmen regardless of the strong claims of the unemployed in Australia. Some time ago, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> conducted negotiations with the British Government, which resulted in orders for ships required in Australia being placed with British shipbuilders at a  time when the slipways on the Clyde were empty and the British people were on the verge of an industrial revolution. Although certain vessels are becoming obsolete, suitable cruisers could be constructed at Cockatoo Island Dockyard. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grant</inline> will endeavour to justify before the Tasmanian electors the vote which he proposes to give on this bill, but I know that there are many in that State who would prefer to see &#163;3,000,000 devoted to industrial developments in Australia. When I commenced to learn my trade in 1913 in what were then the State workshops adjacent to Balmain, on Sydney Harbour, large contracts were accepted by those works from the Sydney Harbour Trust and from other similar undertakings. There were also State works on what was then known as Biloela. Under the name of Cockatoo Island that establishment was transferred by the State to the Commonwealth Government, whose property it became. Australia at that time was embarking on a comprehensive policy of defence, and the then </para>

                    <para class="block">Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> came from Melbourne and met the men at a mass meeting at what was known as the 25-ton steam crane on the island. He made a very fine oration to them. I heard it, because I was one of them.  His  speech was indeed a classic, because at that time he was younger and more vigorous; he had a punch, and he was a member of an energetic fighting party - the Australian Labour party. He pointed out the ideals of the Australian nation, stressed what Australian workmen could do, and wished the men Godspeed in their mission. The first unit constructed at Cockatoo Island was the <inline font-style="italic">Warrego,</inline> a Baver type of torpedo destroyer. She came out in cases and was assembled at the island, and her launching was made the occasion for a- great festival. It marked an epoch in Australian shipbuilding, and the progress of the handicrafts connected with it. The gentleman who at that time enunciated the principles of naval shipbuilding in Australia was no other than the present Leader of the Senate. No doubt he recollects the occasion when he stood on top of the 25-ton steam crane in 1913. The men employed there next built the <inline font-style="italic">Parramatta,</inline> and then went on to bigger jobs, turning out the cruisers <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide</inline> in a very efficient manner. If those vessels and their auxiliaries, the aeroplane carrier <inline font-style="italic">Albatross,</inline> and merchant vessels, such as the <inline font-style="italic">Fordsdale</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Ferndale,</inline> which became merchant cruisers, could be built by Australian workmen, why in the name of commonsense cannot this 7,250-ton cruiser be built in Australia? The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> has stated that it is required straight away, but the Government will not receive it at once. We know that in the British shipbuilding yards, which were the cradle of an industry that has now spread all over the world, it takes two and three years to build cruisers of this kind. The <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> definitely stated that the new cruiser was one of the stock vessels, that her keel was not laid down to the order of the Commonwealth Government, but that  she  was already under construction. She is not nearly finished, yet the Government rushes in to spend &#163;3,000,000 on her purchase. </para>
                    <para class="block">The platform and objective of the Australian Labour party lays it down that naval and military expenditure must be allocated from direct taxation. Consequently the whole of the money required for this purpose will have to be found by the people of Australia. Appeals are constantly being made by bishops and clergymen of all denominations, and public men, including shire presidents and mayors of suburban councils, for the provision of work for the idle youth of Australia. A well-known distillery firm, whose head-quarters are in Adelaide, publishes a feature &#34; stunt &#34; in a leading newspaper, covering many subjects of topical importance. I read one a few weeks ago entitled &#34; The Call of South &#34;. It asked what Australia was going to do for the youth of the nation. Only a few short months ago the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> met a deputation of lads between the ages of 15 and 23 who had never worked. It represented 1,500 young men in one centre of the northern coal-fields alone, and it met the right honorable gentleman at Kurri Kurri. Similar critical conditions exist throughout all the other States. Business men, big and small, including manufacturers, who are capable of tendering for the supply of the machinery and other essentials for the construction of a cruiser, are given no opportunity to undertake this important work, with the result that the young men of the nation are still compelled to stand idle at street corners. It may be argued that Australia is not in  a  position to build this vessel, but that, excuse is mere &#34; eye-wash &#34;. The Minister for Defence admitted in reply to a question which I placed a few weeks ago on the notice-paper, that during a period of  a  little over twelve months, the present lessees of the vast establishment at Cockatoo Island paid only &#163;1,300 in rent for the use of machinery and plant, which cost Australia nearly &#163;2,000,000. The Government no doubt will claim that it is giving work to the shipbuilders, artisans, and skilled labourers of Sydney in the construction of a sloop and three auxiliary vessels, but that does not alter the fact that &#163;3,000,000 has to be found out of direct taxation to pay for the building of a cruiser on the other side of the world, notwithstanding the fact that the competent tradesmen and draftsmen of Australia successfully built the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide,</inline> which worthily played their parts during the late world war. 1 appeal to the Government to recognize that it is wrong both in principle and in practice to allocate such a huge sum for the performance of this work overseas. <inline font-weight="bold">Major Elliott,</inline> a member of the Ramsay MacDonald Government, is preaching in and out of season in the House of Commons the doctrine of economic nationalism for Great Britain. How can the Australian Government justify to the. primary producers of Australia, thu taking out of circulation of &#163;3,000,000 raised by direct taxation in Australia? The farmers as well as the Government know well that the best market for the products of any nation is its home market. There are to-day in Australia 500,000 men and women living in the shadows of dole relief. They may be regarded as practically unemployed because they have to work for sustenance. No right thinking man feels that he is holding his proper place as a unit in the nation unless he is working a,t his calling for full award rates and conditions. It is useless for Ministers to quote the figures of the Commonwealth and State Statisticians to prove that employment is on the increase. No doubt they are true as the statisticians see them; but they are wrong as we see them. We are in a better position than Ministers of the Crown or officials who compile statistics to know the facts, because it is the section of the community we represent in this chamber that is to-day suffering the awful penalties of unemployment. The expenditure in England of &#163;3,000.000 which should be circulated in Australia will have a serious effect on primary production in this country. Money which, if paid to Australian workmen, would be expended by them in the purchase of fruit from Tasmania, wine from South Australia, sugar from Queensland, boots and shoes from Victoria, and in Australian products generally, will now circulate to the advantage of primary producers and manufacturers on the other side of the world. In asking the Senate to vote to send &#163;3,000,000 overseas for the purchase of a cruiser the Government is asking that the door be bolted and barred against Australian producers. Why not ensure this country&#39;s safety by manufacturing in Australia aeroplanes which would be of more value as a weapon of defence than any cruiser could possibly be ? God forbid that Australia should ever be embroiled in another war, but should that catastrophe overtake us, does any honorable senator imagine that our safety would be assured because of our possession of a 7, 250-ton cruiser? The &#163;3,000,000 would be expended to far greater advantage in the manufacture of aircraft. The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> spoke of Australia&#39;s danger in the event of war. I remind him of the vulnerability of the steel works at Port Kembla and Newcastle. These establishments are situated practically on the coast, and are not immune from attack by naval vessels whose guns have a range of over 25 miles. Britain showed wisdom when it established its great steel works and munition factories inland, where there is at least a fighting chance of their being successfully defended by fleets of aeroplanes. European countries, such as France, Austria, Italy, and even Turkey, have displayed similar caution. How can one cruiser patrol the thousands of miles of Australia&#39;s coastline, to say nothing of the trade routes between this and other countries? The Leader of the Senate has the audacity to ask Labour senators to agree to send &#163;3,000,000 out of this country when by expending the money here employment would be provided for Australian workmen. At Cockatoo Island there is the necessary equipment for the manufacture of the cruiser,&#34; as well as capable shipwrights, electricians, moulders, plumbers, carpenters, and other artisans, who have already displayed their skill in the construction of the <inline font-style="italic">Adelaide</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane.</inline> The Government having the numbers, will no doubt go ahead with iti proposals; but I assure it that a higher authority than this Parliament is awaiting an opportunity to pass judgment on it. Australians pride themselves that nothing necessary for the development of their country need be imported. In our forests and fields, our mines and our factories, there are the materials and the men to build as many modern cruisers as we require. I strongly oppose the proposal to send out of this country money which should be expended here. </para>

                        RAE  (New South Wales) &#91;10.9  j. -  I shall not appeal to the Government to change its mind in regard to these proposals, because I know that it would be useless to do so. Instead, I, and those who think as I do, will appeal to the electors who, after all, make and unmake governments. It is true that the platform of the Labour party provides for the adequate defence of Australia against invasion; but I feel impelled to ask myself, first, whether Australia needs a cruiser, and, secondly, whether the need is urgent. If the urgency alleged by the Minister for Defence is due to the disturbed state of Europe, I remind him that, ever since the close of the world war, Europe has been in a state of unrest. The terms of the treaty forced on enemy nations, and the artificial subdivision of certain European States, have intensified the resentment and racial antagonisms which existed previously. If, however, the urgency is due to causes which have had their culmination in resent events in Europe, it is possible that hostilities may break out at any moment. In that case we would have been wiser had we purchased a completed vessel, so that it would have been available for our defence when needed. If the urgency is only relative, there is no need to do more than set to work immediately to establish in Australia the means of defending ourselves. If a vessel such as that proposed to be bought in England is essential to the safety of Australia, it should be built here.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline>
                        spoke truly when he said that the first line of a nation&#39;s defence is a country worth living in. From a defence point of view it is not a sane policy to have thousands of people in enforced idleness.

                        <para>- We shall not dispose of our unemployment problem by sending money overseas. I cannot see that Australia is in imminent danger. Even in the great war, Australia was in danger only because its leaders chose to enter  the war, having been persuaded by the press that otherwise Australian citizens would be enslaved. The consequences of that war have been disastrous to the world; yet European nations, including Britain, are now engaged in another armaments race. There is, however, no reason why Australia should follow their example. The quarrels and territorial ambitions of European nations are no concern of ours ; our sole duty in matters of defence is to protect ourselves from invasion. Until that danger is manifested, we should take no other steps for the provision of defence than we have done as part of the ordinary programme in recent years. The demand at present for this orgy of expenditure on defence is due to the hysteria generated a few months ago by the press and by public men in search of a new means of publicity. To me it appears that the bounden duty of Australia to herself, and the world in general, is to keep out of the old world&#39;s quarrels, and to steer clear of the disagreements between the nations in Europe, which is the stormcentre of the world. We appear to be ambitious to become an imperial power ourselves, and to take part in the business of other nations, thus inviting reprisals. In my opinion, we could justifiably make neutrality treaties and peace pacts with other nations, and by those means keep clear of any war of aggression, and confine ourselves to defending Australia against attack. Practically every male citizen will be prepared to do his share to defend his country against any wilful or deliberate aggression on the part of any foreign nation. I regard the proposal now before us as nothing less than a political crime, which is being perpetrated upon the people of this country. I cannot describe otherwise the Government&#39;s action in contracting to spend this money on the other side of the world, when we have available numbers of artisans skilled in every class of labour who have already demonstrated their capacity by the construction of warships of considerable size in a manner that elicited favorable comment from competent judges overseas. It has already been demonstrated that we have the men <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> build ships, whether they be required for the merchant service or for war purposes, and, should war threaten, we would have ample time to carry out defence measures. </para>

                            <para>- I am not an advocate of peace at any price. I appreciate the fact that circumstances can arise under which an appeal to armed force becomes necessary; but the only justification for that is a foreign invasion. I agree with the statement recently made by a distinguished statesmen, when he said that his country did not wantto take a foot of territory from any other country, but would resist to the last ditch any attempt to steal a foot of its territory on the part of any other country. I would sanction and advocate any means of defence that would be rendered necessary by an attempted invasion of this country. </para>

                            <para>- We are in the most favorable position of any section of the white race to-day to decline to go to war for any reason except to withstand an attempted invasion to deprive us of our national rights. I admit the logic of the argument that there may not be any clear line of demarcation between defence and aggression; but, as we are an isolated country, thousands of miles from any other country, we are in a position to foresee when war is threatening. For the present, we should provide ourselves with the raw material of defence, by qualifying ourselves to construct whatever is necessary to defend us from attack, as we are doing in the manufacture of up-to-date cordite more than  ample to supply the needs of Australia. We should supply our own materials for defence, and keep them in reserve. In  thi3  way we can conserve the skill of our artisans, who at present are being driven to other countries in search of work. In practically every country one can find skilled- Australians occupying positions they could not have hoped to obtain &#34;in their own country, because of the imperialistic notion held here that kinship with Great Britain justifies us in getting everything done there, sacrificing our own people in order to feed others distantly related to us. I dissent altogether from that view. The principle under which this Government is working is repugnant to Australian opinion. The Government is abusing the position it gained by breaking the promise made at the last election, in order to embark on a course of action that does not. meet with the approval of the average citizen. The people of Australia are desirous of having adequate means of defence, but they are still more desirous that those means should be built up in the Commonwealth ; they do not approve of purchasing a ship overseas on the grounds of urgency, and overlooking the fact that there is an equally urgent need to provide employment for our own people. </para>

                        <para>. -  lt is always interesting to listen to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bae. His</inline> speech is invariably clear and logical, and it is easy to follow his arguments, whether one agrees with them, or not. I do <inline font-style="italic">not</inline> agree with him on the subject of defence. For instance, he said that many Australians occupy positions overseaswhich they would not have had the chance of gaining in their own country, because of the failure of the Government to utilize their skill when opportunities offer. One might reply that many people not born in Australia are occupying high positions here, and that the Governments of their native lands failed to provide sufficient opportunities in industry for the utilization of their services. Such men have included <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> M. Hughes, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Andrew</inline> Fisher, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Reid, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook, each of whom became Prime Minister of Australia, and it could not reasonably be argued that they would all have achieved similar eminence in the countries of their birth. The conditions which have forced Australians to go abroad in search of high position have operated equally in the other direction to induce people from other countries to come here. This will be found to be a tendency in business generally. We find that in engineering and commercial circles not only Britishers, but also foreigners, who have migrated to these shores have attained the highest distinction without influence and through sheer intelligence. This is the result of freetrade in brains. I do not see anything wrong in an Australian of ability going abroad to make his mark in his particular calling. Of course, his departure is a loss to his native land. </para>

We cannot afford to pay for skilled services what the older and financially stronger countries can pay, and it is only natural that able men should aspire to greater conquests in the outside world.

                        said that this Government is indulging in a perfect orgy of expenditure on defence. I do not suggest any ill-faith on their part, but the remarks of some honorable senators have been hopelessly wide of the truth. The summary of expenditure involved in the budget this year shows that war and repatriation services and invalid and old age pensions are costing this country &#163;31,000.000 per annum, whereas on defence we are expending a little over &#163;4,000,000. Docs that appear to
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline>
                        to be a fair apportionment; that  we  should spend, as it were, &#163;3.1,000,000 on the past, and &#163;4,000,000 on the future. Is that carrying out our obligations  to  future generations?

                            <para>- I consider that the vote for defence is disproportionately low, and quite inadequate, having regard to what we are expending on social services. The honorable senator also said that any one in Australia would be prepared to do his share in defending this country against invasion. I do not doubt that, but how is any one to be able to do his share unless he has been provided with the means to do it - unless he has been trained to shoot and drill and has assimilated some idea of discipline? If an invader threatened our land, what would be the use of a volunteer coming forward and saying, &#34; I have never had any training; compulsory training was done away with at about the time when I came of age for training; I have never lived in the country, and thus never had an opportunity to learn to shoot; and I do not care for discipline in any case ; but I am anxious to do my share for my country &#34; ? It would be of no more use for us, as someone once said in the House of Representatives, than if the honorable member for Bourke went out to defend this country with a soap box in his hand. It is idle to talk about defending Australia to the !a3t ditch, because, I put it to honorable senators opposite, with us the last ditch is the first ditch. </para>

                    <para>I should again like to pay a tribute to the old Labour party, of which the right honorable the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator</inline> Pearce)  was a prominent member many years ago, for the part which it played in the building up of the defence force of this country by instituting the system of compulsory  miltary  training for the youths of Australia. Every historian I have read admits that the establishment of the Australian Military Force on . that basis was of the greatest value, not only to the Commonwealth, but also to the Empire during the war years. This tribute is applied, not merely to the men in the ranks, but to the officers who were trained at Duntroon, and it so happened that they were just ready for service when war broke out. It is fitting that I should say a word or two on this subject because the Minister for Defence moved the second reading of this bill to-night. Probably no man living has done more for the defence of Australia than the right honorable  gentleman.  He held the portfolio of Minister for Defence during the whole period of the war. No one can deny that the old Labour party recognized that acceptance of the privileges which this country affords to its citizens also implied the duty to be ready to fight for it when the need arose. I am glad to be able to say a word or two in support of the excellent speech which the right honorable gentleman delivered to-night, although, as on other occasions, I did not find myself in complete agreement with everything that he said. I admit, however, that he is in a much better position that I am to state the facts about the defence of Australia. The right honorable senator expressed the hope that the Government&#39;s proposals would be treated in a non-party spirit. I regret that that is not possible. He said he hoped that this defence expenditure would be spread over a period of about five years, and that all parties would agree to carry out the programme. That also I say is impossible because, as at present constituted, the Labour party has turned its back on the defence of Australia. The only form of defence which it is prepared to concede is that which will give work to artisans in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Personally, I am all for peace when peace is practicable. But I had between three and four years of war, and I know what it means. I did not want to fight. Fighting was forced upon me, and, having had experience of it, I endeavour to recognize facts when I see them, and do not go about crying peace, peace, when there is no peace. No one can look at the general conditions of the world to-day without realizing that the nations are not at one another&#39;s throats simply because they are not in a financial position to carry on a war. This inability to finance hostilities is the only thing that prevents the outbreak of war instantaneously. </para>

                    <para>It is, I think, significant that the Soviet Union is the first country against which no Australian government must engage in war. It is strange that the United States of America is down at the bottom of the list. That arrangement, I suggest, is a little hard on that country, because so many citizens of the United States of America are sprung from the same stock as ourselves, although a century or two earlier. This being so, why should the United States of America be twelfth in this peace list of the Victorian Labour Conference, and the Soviet Union first? Apparently, also, no Australian government is permitted to suppress any movement for the independence of Ireland, India, or South Africa. In other words, we are, presumably, to encourage any movement in those countries to break away from the Empire. Further, we are not to engage in any war arising from the violation of the neutrality of Belgium or Denmark. Our participation in the Great War was due to the violation of the neutrality of Belgium. Apparently, that was a grave mistake in the opinion of the Australian Labour party, and wc must not make the same mistake again. </para>
                    <para>Now, I have something to say to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes.</inline> One of the resolutions of the Victorian Labour party states that Australia must not participate in any war to maintain British control of Egypt or the Suez Canal. This, I feel sure, will interest <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes,</inline> because Egypt and the Suez Canal are one of the main links in our trade routes. Much of our commerce goes through the Suez Canal. If, because of some trouble in Egypt, British control of the canal is jeopardized, Australia must not, wc are told by the Victorian Labour Conference, do anything to assist the Mother Country. It follows then, that if that trade route is closed to us, we must find some other route by which to send our commerce to overseas markets. </para>

                            <para>- I may not lie able to do that directly, but the honorable gentleman did say that a few aeroplanes could beat off any naval vessels that attacked Australia. Apparently, he entirely overlooked the fact that, even assuming Australian aeroplanes succeeded in bombing opposing war vessels off the Australian coast, the use of aircraft would not, of itself, be sufficient to keep open our trade routes, the chief of which is through the Suez Canal. I suggest that it is at least as important to Australia to be able to send our wool, wheat, wine, fruit, and dairy produce overseas as it is to defend our coast line against naval attacks. I do not know whether the honorable senator realizes even now the trend of my argument, which is that it would be useless to defend the coast line of Australia unless at the same time we could secure the safe passage of our produce, which represents the true wealth of Australia, to overseas markets where it could be sold, and get something in return for it. It would bc useless for thousands of farmers to grow sheep and produce wool if, owing to the closing of our trade routes in time of war, that produce could not be disposed of. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bae</inline> said that we should endeavour to make Australia a place worth living in. It is generally agreed that the standard of living in Australia and the number of persons employed is at least as high as it is in any other part of the world, though thousands who have no work to do know no such standard. </para>

                            <para>- I once - tried, I believe in Parliament, to answer that contention, and came to the conclusion that Australia led the world in three respects. The first was in the production of fine merino wool. No other country has ,yet beaten us in that respect, although some honorable senators opposite are loath to believe that pastoralists possess the modicum of brains necessary to achieve such a result. The second is in the cricket field ; but after all cricket is only a game; and the third is that Australia produced Madame Melba, who was once the world&#39;s greatest singer. I do not know that Australia has ever led the world in medicine, law, commerce, engineering or politics. The Torrens title system also originated in Australia, but such things are not vital matters. Even if a doctor discovers a remedy for one complaint, he is not regarded as leading the world, seeing that there are many other complaints to be remedied. We should not think that Australia, with a population of 6,500,000 persons can achieve what other nations  with ten times that number of highly intelligent persons, and with a long history, can achieve. </para>

                            <para>- Australia should be able to defend itself, and wherever practicable manufacture its own equipment, provided that it can be produced at a reasonable figure. We should manufacture our own ammunition, shells, guns and ships, if we can do so on a proper commercial basis. A reasonable allowance should be made in favour of Australia, but that is now provided by the tariff.  I  am not in favour of producing equipment in Australia simply with the object of producing it here, and unless such equipment is capable of performing the functions for which it is produced,  its  manufacture should not be undertaken  in  this country. The building  of  ships  of  any kind is a highly intricate and specialized work, and cannot be done without proper preparation, or with any more possibility of success than a nation can defend itself without adequate preparation. It is a question of whether ships can be built in Australia at a reasonable figure and properly equipped for the work which they are intended to perform. I am opposed to paying for locally-constructed ships a price two or three times higher than that at which they could be obtained overseas. </para>

                            <para>- Because some men are trained to a higher degree of efficiency than others. The Leader of the Opposition suggested that Great Britain should do more than she has been doing for Australia in the matter of defence. I have not the actual figures before me, but for many years past the cost of defence per head of population has been infinitely higher in Great Britain, where the people on the whole are poorer, than it is in Australia. The Leader of the Opposition, who suggested that Great Britain should present the Commonwealth with a cruiser, should remember that only a year ago Great Britain loaned five destroyers to  Australia  free of cost. </para>

                    <para class="block">That completely answers the assertion of the Leader of the Opposition that there is an obligation upon Great Britain to do anything more for Australia in the way of supplying naval equipment. There are other points upon which I could comment, but I do not propose to do so. I did not, however, wish the debate to conclude without other honorable senators on this side of the chamber stating that they firmly disagree with what has been said by honorable senators opposite in respect of the fundamental subject of defence. If, unfortunately, war should occur, I do not wish any one to be able to toll me that I knew that the position in Australia was not as it should be, and that although it was my duty to say what I thought should be done to ensure an adequate system of defence, I remained silent. So long as I am a member of this chamber I shall advocate a system of adequate defence for Australia as upon that the life of the nation depends. </para>

                        <para>. - I should not have spoken on this subject but for certain utterances of honorable senators opposite that require a reply different from that given by previous speakers.I congratulate the Minister for Defence upon his thoughtful speech, which should impress intelligent people.From information obtained from reliable sources I know that our present defence system is inadequate. We have a duty, not only to Australia, but also to the Mother Country, and we would be recreant to our trust if we did not keep our defence system up to a proper standard. I have listened tosome extraordinary remarks to-night from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> who professes to believe in an adequate defence policy for Australia. Is that also the belief of those with whom I understand that he is associated in a certain organization? If it is, how did it happen that a member of that body was detected in an attempt to distribute seditious literature on an Australian warship, evidently with the view to create disaffection among the ratings? If he and the members of the society of which I believe he is a member stand for an adequate defence policy, why are they trying by revolutionary processes to create disaffection in the navy? I know the facts, and I have to accept the honorable senator&#39;s statement with a good deal of doubt as to his earnestness. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator has good reason to know both who is in it and who is behind it. He also knows that the same organization is creating, wherever possible, what it calls cells in every industry and using every possible means to capture the imagination, particularly of educated people who they think may become fanatics. An instance was recently brought to my notice  in  which those tactics succeeded. A broken-hearted mother told a friend of mine that her daughter, who had been  in a  State Education department for years - she was an accomplished girl - had been, owing to her peculiar temperament., so impressed with these teachings that she resigned from the Education  Department  in  order  to enter  a  factory  as a worker,  for the purpose of creating  a  communistic cell in it. That  was  in Melbourne. </para>

                            <para>- I do not take my views from that paper. I am speaking  of what  I know and what the honorable senator knows. It  is  high time that this matter was  made more  prominent by public men who believe in protecting the best interests of the  people.  The sooner the public are warned of the danger  which  is not  only  apparent but  real,  and do  something  definite through their representatives  in  Parliament to eliminate it, the better it will be for the Commonwealth. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barnes</inline> said &#34; Let us make Australia a place worth fighting for &#34;. My reply is that in no other country in the world are the conditions nearly so good as those existing in Australia. No other country has so many blessings to the square yard as we have to the square foot. Honorable senators opposite know and appreciate that fact, but they depend for their political existence on sowing the seeds of discord and discontent among the people of Australia. I know that economic conditions are not so good here as one would desire, but they are much better than in any other part of the world. I rose principally to say that I accept not at its face value, but at its real value, the statement I heard from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> to-night that he believes in adequate defence, in view of the experience I had in connection with a unit of the organization to which the honorable senator some time ago said that he was proud to belong. </para>

                            <para>asked that he be called to order. If he had spoken frankly what was in his mind, he would have said that he regarded <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> as a liar. It is better for men to speak the truth than to camouflage their utterances in the way <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> did. In my hearing, and that of several others, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> stated plainly that he believed in the adequate defence of Australia. No man, except some old troglodite who did not understand the correct use of the English language, could cavil at or misinterpret that statement. It is well that we should speak in clear and straight-forward terms. We on this side of the chamber say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> is losing his perspective when he makes the statements he made to-night with regard to the Labour party. That party believes in adequate defence, but not in wars of aggression. If it was possible to educate the people of Australia to understand the difference between defence and aggression they would all stand solidly by the intelligent electors who comprise the Labour party, instead of being led away by the utter absurdities offered to the Senate to-night by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne.</inline> I hold no brief for Russia, but I believe in fair play. I know that representatives of Russia have stated at disarmament conferences that they arc working for the complete abolition of armaments. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> if it is not true that at a meeting of the Disarmament Conference, Litvinoff said that Russia would entirely disarm if the other countries of the world would do the same? Until the nations take up that Christian attitude there will always be war, or the possibility of it. The Australian Government is simply trifling with the position. The Minister for Defence spoke to-night of providing so many aeroplanes and ships. Sinking an obsolete ship outside the Sydney Heads will not solve the problem of war. Honorable senators opposite who pride themselves on their Christianity and intelligence arc afraid to take up a Christian stand by saying, &#34;We shall disarm altogether.&#34; Rather in a petty, smug, parochial way they accuse an honorable senator on this side of disaffecting the personnel of the navy. I have known <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> for 25 years, and can say, with confidence, that no cleaner man has ever drawn breath in this chamber. He has fought for disarmament and peace so long as I can remember, and I take off my hat to him. He lost two sons in the war. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> has no right to accuse such a man of spreading disaffection in the navy.  His  speech was a disgrace, and he should have been made to withdraw the charge. I speak with some heat, because it is time we faced the issue properly. No honorable senator should speak in the way <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> has spoken to-night, with his innuendoes and stupid utterances. Only the other day the Graziers Association approached the Government with the suggestion that an understanding should be reached with Russia, in order that a trade in wool and sheep should be established with that country. Does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> accuse the graziers of being Communists desirous of disaffecting the Australian Army and Navy? They are after trade. We should follow the example of other nations which are seeking opportunities to trade with Russia,&#34; and should hold out a friendly hand to its people. In my opinion, no nation is more eager for peace than Russia is: if every country were equally peace loving, there would be no more war. I disagree with the Leader of the Senate that the new cruiser should not bc built in Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DuncanHughes</inline> said it was a matter of money. Unfortunately, like those persons who would offer their fellowmen as a sacrifice to the God of war, some honorable senators opposite are obsessed by financial considerations. I have never heard so ridiculous an argument as that we should not build a ship in Australia because the poorly paid artisans of Britain could build it more cheaply. If I were an imperialist, I would say that one of the first things Australia should do is to take adequate steps to supply its own requirements of war vessels and munitions. Even if it cost, several millions of pounds to establish the ship-building industry in this country, from, a defence point of view that money would be well spent. We are asked to approve of the expenditure of  &#163;4,000,000  on naval construction. Would it, not bc better to spend some, if not all that money, in training Australian artisans to build ships? Any true patriot must agree that if Australia needs a cruiser it should  be  built in this country. It is ridiculous to say that those who object to its purchase abroad do not believe in the defence of Australia. I conclude by saying that I hope <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> will cease to be so stupid, and will reason things out before he again speaks in this chamber. </para>

I say that we should not cry &#34; war, war &#34; when there is no war. The world claims to  be  seeking peace;  but  on every hand we see evidence of the war spirit. Even in Australia that spirit is manifest in the existence of war museums, captured guns and other war relics. Unfortunately the spirit of  War,  instead of the virtue of peace, is being instilled into the minds of our young people to such an extent that one is inclined to think sometimes that the Prince of Peace lived and died in vain. Even many who claim to have espoused  Christianity  cry &#34; war &#34; not &#34; peace &#34;. Unhappily that tendency exists in every civilized country. People who believe in peace should not  be  afraid to proclaim their views, for -so long as nations talk war, and prepare for it, we cannot hope foi; peace. Before he is trained,  a  prizefighter might  be  a peaceful man-; but when his training has progressed far enough  for  him to know his own capabilities he develops combativeness ; having learned the art of fighting, he is keen to test his skill in combat.

                    <para>The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> said that the Australian cordite factory was supplying New Zealand as well as Australia with munitions. In other countries the manufacture of munitions is in the hands of private enterprise, and so long as that continues there will be wars. The shareholders of armament firms look for dividends, and they do not care if, to that end, the world is plunged into war. Until total disarmament takes place, the nations of the world would do well to follow Australia&#39;s example, and have the manufacture of war materials confined to factories controlled by governments. The prohibition of private armament making would go a long way towards  restoring peace to this war-stricken world. </para>
                    <para>I disagree with those who claim that the League of Nations is impotent and valueless, although I admit that the League lost a golden opportunity in failing to take decisive action when Japan declared war on China.

If Australia does not possess men with the necessary skill - and I disagree with those who say Australia has not such men - we should bring to this country men of special ability to train Australian workmen, who can hold their own with the workers of any other country.We have proved that we have the men in Australia with the energy and the skill to construct vessels of war that will compare favorably with any that have been constructed in other parts of the world. All that our workmen require are opportunities to apply their skill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> agreed that war vessels should be constructed in Australia but only if they can be constructed as cheaply or nearly as cheaply as they can he built overseas. </para>

                            <para>- As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DuncanHughes</inline> contended, no doubt, the men were in need of some training in this class of work, and I feel sure that, having got that measure of training, their work would continuously improve with the construction of each subsequent vessel. Even if the cost of local building were greater it would be worth something to keep the money involved in the country. In connexion with the proposed purchase, we shall be sending overseas &#163;3,000,000 in the form of goods, in return for which wc shall get a warship which could have been constructed in Australia. There has always been a tendency on the part of non-Labour governments to purchase overseas ships and almost everything else. <inline font-style="italic">My</inline> policy is &#34;Australia first, second, and always &#34;. Experts arc not agreed as to what are the best means of defending Australia. It would be foolish for  me  as a layman to argue on this point, but I have read the opinions of several men, who can speak authoritatively. Some of them are in Australia and others are overseas, but all of them agree as to the defensive value .of air forces. I am inclined to concur in that opinion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Duncan-Hughes  says that we must have means to keep our trade routes clear, and I agree that that could not bc done with an air force only, but it is a great pity that one nation should be forced to expend millions of pounds upon armaments merely because another nation is doing so. It is deplorable that some reliable agreement cannot be reached between the nations of the world. Only when a universal treaty for the abolition of war has been made can the nations be regarded as truly Christian and civilized. </para>

                        PEARCE.Does the honorable senator realize the full meaning of his suggestion? It would have meant another world-wide war. I remind him of the immense naval and military power of Japan and the remoteness of the other nations which would have had to act on behalf of the League of Nations, and invite him to visualize the conflagration that would have resulted had his suggestion been carried out. He also advocated disarmament. If the other nations were without armed forces, how could they possibly discipline Japan on behalf of the League of Nations? I do not know whether the honorable senator contemplated that Australia, as a member of the League, would take part in the adventure; if so, he opened up a prospect that offers little comfort to lovers of peace. I agree with
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hoare</inline>
                        that it is desirable that Australia should manufacture aeroplane engines, but
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline>
                        has rightly said that such production must be on an economic basis. I am pleased to be able to inform the Senate that, under the contract which we let recently in Great Britain for eighteen aeroplanes and 24 seaplanes, we are to receive copies of all the plans mid specifications, and are to have the right to manufacture the engines in Australia.

                    <para>Honorable senators of the Opposition spoke as though this Government were doing nothing to encourage the building of warships, in Australia. They have ignored the fact that two sloops are to be built at Cockatoo Island Dockyard at a cost of &#163;500,000. The difference between the construction of sloops and cruisers is that the material for the former can be obtained in Australia. For instance, the plates for the sloops are obtainable here, because they are not nearly so heavy as those required for the cruiser. If we were to undertake the rolling of plates for cruisers, we would require to expend &#163;300,000 in laying down the necessary plant, and it would tak? two years before a single plate could be rolled out. That possibility has been investigated through the Broken Hill Proprietary Limited. </para>

That would mean that we would have to wait practically half the life of the cruiser before we could utilize it.

                        was lost to us because of the time occupied in its construction. The
                        <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline>
                        was a more difficult ship to build than the sloops, but the new cruiser will represent the latest achievement in naval architecture, and will be much more difficult to build than was the
                        <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane.</inline>
                        Its great cost indicates that. The
                        <inline font-style="italic">Melbourne</inline>
                        cost &#163;350,000, and, although there is a difference of only 2,000 tons in the size of the vessels, this new cruiser will cost &#163;1,800,000. The higher cost is due to remarkable developments in recent years in internal construction features, engines, armaments, and all the paraphernalia required for the equipment of a modern war vessel. Great Britain is, and has been for some considerable time, the greatest ship-building nation in the world. The vast experience of the Mother Country in this business has resulted in the building up of a trained personnel unsurpassed in the world, and the establishment of a vast specialized plant and machinery. If we contemplated the building of a modern cruiser of this class in Australia, we should require to import practically one-half of the material, all the engines and all the armaments, as well as a very considerable proportion of the trained personnel. Then, having built one vessel, our activities would cease, and the whole of the skilled personnel would have to be discharged.

                    <para>. - In the debate on the Defence Equipment Bill, which has just been passed by the Senate, a good deal was said about expenditure on the other side of the world for the defence of Australia. I now invite the Senate to consider the advisability of spending money for defence purposes on the other side of Australia. The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> this evening spoke of the need for a continuous defence policy, and expressed the wish that even if there was a change of government after the next election, the defence programme which he submitted should be continued. In that respect I entirely agree with the right honorable gentleman. Before I resume my seat, I intend to remind him of a continuous defence policy which, 21 years ago,  he  advocated in equally eloquent terms. I consider that it is about time that effect was given to the programme which he then submitted so convincingly and with the same mastery of the subject which he displayed to-night when moving the second reading of the Defence Equipment Bill. This is not the first occasion on which I have endeavoured to obtain information from the Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> as to the assistance to be given to Western Australia in the matter of providing a dock at Fremantle or in resuming the work at the Henderson naval base on which &#163;1,250,000 has been spent. Realizing the liberal way in which the Government assists projects in Eastern Australia, I have endeavoured to ascertain principles upon which it gives such assistance. Last week, Parliament voted a. balance of &#163;600,000, making &#163;3,000,000 to complete the River Murray waters scheme, and I also find that nearly &#163;5,000,000 has been spent in constructing the Kyogle to South Brisbane railway. When I asked the Minister the principle upon which &#163;3,000,000 had been allocated for irrigation works on the River Murray he said that it was for the good of Australia. He said that that is also the dominating factor in connexion with the Queensland sugar embargo, which can be regarded only as an incubus and not in the interests of the Australian people. Why was not that principle observed when a reply was made to a request recently submitted to the Commonwealth Government by the Government of Western Australia? A few weeks ago a deputation of Federal and State members, which included <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collett,</inline> asked the Government of Western Australia to proceed with the construction of a dock at Fremantle. The Premier, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collier,</inline> pointed out that the State Government could not finance the project, but that the Commonwealth Government had commenced a work of that nature near Fremantle some time previously upon which &#163;1,250,000 had already been spent. He further stated that all that he could promise was that he would place the request before the Federal Government and ask it to contribute one-third of the cost. He said that as it was a defence measure the Imperial Government should also contribute one-third and that he had every hope, seeing that the good of Australia was involved, and that defence is the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government, that therequest would, at least, receive the same consideration as is given to requests made by the more populous and wealthy States in the East. The request was placed before the Government in most, convincing terms by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Collier. The <inline font-style="italic">Daily News</inline> of the 19th July last published the following report of the Premier&#39;s reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sleeman,</inline> member for Fremantle in the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia : - </para>

The Prime Minister has advised me that from a naval defence point of view, either a dry or floating dock located at Fremantle, would, if of suitable dimensions, be of undoubted advantage to the Commonwealth in meeting the docking requirements of the ships of the Royal Australian Navy, but that the construction in recent times of a naval base at Singapore had greatly improved the docking facilities in the Indian Ocean. </para>

                <para class="block">To-night the Senate voted &#163;4,160,000 for defence purposes, which includes &#163;2,260,000 for a new cruiser which is to be purchased in Great Britain. Yet, in the western State there is not a dock in which the vessel to be purchased, or other ships of the Australian Navy, can be accommodated. The Minister for Defence has urged the adoption of a continuous defence policy. I have before me the report of a speech delivered by the right honorable gentleman in May, 1913, when work at the Henderson Naval Base at Cockburn Sound was commenced. The speech does the right honorable gentleman credit, and I can readily imagine him bring ing tears to the eyes of members of the audience as  he  submitted a policy which he urged should  be  continuous. That speech was on exactly the same lines as  the  speech he delivered this evening. At that time  the  Minister favoured a start being made with  the  Henderson Naval Base,  but  I am inclined to believe that he is responsible for the work having been discontinued. His speech to-night  was  very impressive, and I believe that  that  delivered 21 years ago  was  equally  impressive  to the thousands who heard  or  read it. In the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> of the  18th May, 1913, the following report appeared : - </para>

Although the great admiral recommended the construction of two primary bases of equal importance, one on each side of the Continent, and after spending &#163;1,250,000 on  it  the  work  in Western Australia has been abandoned, and naval expenditure concentrated at Port Jackson and Sydney.

It met the wishes  of  the West Australian community. It is interesting to notice the influence  which  the Minister for Defence exercised over his western constituency at that time. At the time I have mentioned he painted a beautiful picture of the work to be undertaken, but which, unfortunately, has since been abandoned by this Government. Persons visiting the locality to-day naturally think that the federal blight has fallen upon the site; it looks like federal territory, as all progress has ceased. </para>

                    <para>It was also intended to provide in the  scheme  for barrack buildings for the seamen when ashore. Provision would be made for a reading room, recreation rooms, kitchens and drill grounds for training purposes. In addition, provision would be made for hospitals for the sick, including sick and attendants&#39; quarters, administrative blocks, hospital stores, surgeons&#39; and workmen&#39;s quarters, and kitchen blocks. Consideration would also  be  given to the matter of constructing a naval arsenal, which, when the scheme was completed, would be provided with magazines, buildings, laboratories, and store houses for storing quick-firing ammunition, shells, and projectiles for the fleet requirements. This arsenal would be designed in  every  respect so as to safeguard the life of workmen and property. It was proposed to create one  large  danger zone, and in that zone arrangements would  be  made for the new State explosivedepot. In a large naval establishment, such as he had outlined, it would necessarily be required to have large quantities of  stores  in readiness. He might explain that the Director of Naval Works, and his department, would design, construct, and control the  immense  works under the Naval Board&#39;s administration. In following out Admiral Henderson&#39;s report, it had been decided to create a sub-base at Albany shortly. The Director of Naval Works would take up preliminary data in connexion with that subbase, which would come under the control of the Western Base. It would be admitted he thought, that the Federal Parliament was giving effect to Admiral Henderson&#39;s report and naval scheme. The Federal Government was now taking up the work in earnest, and he __ for their co-operation in thecarrying out of that immense scheme. He need hardly say that the works he had referred to would give employment to a large number of men forseveral years. </para>

Admiral Henderson came to Australia, without any preconceived idea as to what nature his report would take.  His  recommendations had been influenced neither by anything he had heard in England nor by local considerations in Australia. He was given every assistance by the State governments of Australia, and they had placed in Iws hands all the documents at their disposal. He went right around the Commonwealth, visited all the important strategical points, and fathered that monumental scheme that would be associated with his name aa long as the history of Australia would endure. </para>

                <para class="block">That speech meets the conditions and requirements of to-day, so far as the naval defence of Australia i3 concerned. Its outlook is national, and its policy comprehensive. It covers not only the proposed naval base on the Western Australian coast below Fremantle, as recommended by Admiral Henderson, but also the sub-base at Albany, both of which are still non-existent. The Government is fortunate in having a big majority in both Houses, and in charge of the department a Minister who has shown enthusiasm in the past for this work. Including the &#163;4,160,000 that wo voted to-night in another measure, we are spending well over &#163;5,000,000 this year on defence. The State Government has asked the Commonwealth to join in seeking the assistance of the British Government to defray the cost of a dock for Fremantle - an undertaking which is entirely beyond the finances of the State. The Commonwealth could find &#163;3,000,000 for the River Murray wafers scheme. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know, but I am sure the total is small. In the pamphlet issued by the Government in opposition to the secession movement, the cost of defence is- charged to Western Australia on a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis, but T. am one of those who believe that nothing like that proportion was spent in Western Australia, nor do we expect it to be. That is one reason why we prefer a system of government of our own. </para>

I complain that he has violated his promises in regard to the Henderson naval base. &#60;I have simply reminded&#39; him of the policy that he put forward in regard to this naval work, and have asked him to induce the Government, in view of the large sums now being found for defence, and of the fact that &#163;1,130,000 has been already spent on the Henderson base, to resume construction there as soon as possible. If the Government does that, it will perform a great national service, and show the people of Western Australia that they are not entirely forgotten, so far as their requests for docking facilities and a naval base at Fremantle are concerned. </para>

                    <para>Dissatisfaction is expressed in the case for secession with the non-attainment of the strengths recommended in the Henderson and Jellicoe reports which would have enabled ships to be stationed in Western Australia after provision of the necessary base facilities  . . Changes in circumstances since the date of the Henderson report in particular are another factor to be allowed for. The occurrences of the Great War, with its added burdens of war debt and repatriation expenditure radically altered the budget position. There has also been the development of the Singapore Naval Base and the growth of importance of Darwin. The consequence of the financial aspect has been that the limited amount available for naval defence has been absorbed in maintaining the Royal Australian Navy Squadron at a much lesser strength than that envisaged by the reports...... </para>
                    <para class="block">It may be added that no development in the naval policy of the Commonwealth takes place without the advice of the authorities in Britain being sought, and it was they who recommended, in view of all the considerations referred to, that the development of Cockburn Sound as a repair port be abandoned. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>I specially commend the last statement to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston.</inline> I may also say, for his information, that he could not have cited a better illustration of the necessity for adopting the policy which I suggested of continuity irrespective of party. It was the Fisher Labour Government that began the establishment of that base. It was the Liberal Government, led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. (afterwards Sir Joseph)</inline> Cook, and including <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> that on taking office abandoned work on the base, after trying unsuccessfully to find a foundation for a graving dock. Owing to the limestone and cave nature of the country a foundation could not be obtained. The  State Government had already had a similar experience in Fremantle Harbour. The war then broke out, and, after peace was established, Australia had to face a great war debt; and the responsibilities of repatriation. The government of the day was therefore not prepared to undertake any new defence expenditure. In the meantime, strategy had altered, and the British Government had approved of the establishment of the Singapore naval base. It was the Admiralty which, after the decision to construct the Singapore base had been reached, recommended that the Henderson base should not be re-started on the lines originally put, forward by Admiral Henderson. It should be remembered that when the Admiral made his report, the Singapore base was not contemplated or even thought of. I trust that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston,</inline> when he &#39;--appeals to the electors of Fremantle, will tell them these facts also. </para>

                        <para>- I. have not bothered to do so. I have allowed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> and other critics to gain all- the glory and credit or discredit arising from attacking me and saying to the electors of Fremantle that Codlin, and not Short, is their friend. For many years I have allowed the honorable senator and others to put all the blame for this policy on my shoulders, knowing all the time that I could have proved from the official documents, including the authorized history of the Commonwealth, that it was not the government of which I was a member, but. the Liberal Government in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> was Minister for Defence, that stopped the work at the Henderson naval base. I could have shown, also, that the work was not resumed by a later government to which I belonged, on the advice of the Admiralty, because the Singapore base was being developed. Perhaps the honorable senator, when be is addressing the electors, or sending his speech to the Fremantle newspapers, will send them these facts at the same time. </para>

                <para>That the bill be now read a second time. </para>
                <para>Supply has already been granted for the first three months of the present financial year, that is, to the 30th September, 1934. This bill provides for expenditure for a further three months - up to the 31st December next - including provision for salaries due on the 21st December. The bill is based on the Estimates of expenditure for the present financial year. It is not possible to base this Supply Bill on last year&#39;s appropriations because certain proposals outlined in the budget provide for expenditure in the present year on a slightly higher scale than that of last year. The budget proposals involving increased expenditure have been, or are being, implemented under special bills, such as the Financial Belief Bill. By that bill, portion of the salaries and wages deductions made under the Financial Emergency Act is being restored. Therefore, it is necessary, in order that salaries and wages may be paid on the higher scale, that the present Supply Bill should be based on the Estimates for 1934-35. The Estimates for 1934-35 also include increased expenditure for carrying on the ordinary services of the various departments, and particularly the increased expenditure which the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department must incur to deal with the greater volume of business. This also makes it necessary to base the present Supply Bill on the new Estimates. As all the major policy proposals of the budget affecting expenditure have been, or are being,  deB.lt  with in special bills, they do not call for explanation or debate in the consideration of the Supply Bill now presented. </para>
                <para>The total amount to be appropriated for 1934-35, under Annual Votes, but exclusive of special appropriations, is &#163;22,516,417. On this basis, the amount required for the-first six months of the year would be &#163;11,258,209. Tho first Supply Bill for 1934-35 covered a total sf &#163;6,079,175. The total of the present bill is &#163;5,819,030. Taking the two Supply Bills together, the total is &#163;11,898,205. Comparing this sum with half the amount to be appropriated for the year, it is found that the provision in the Supply Bills exceeds half the necessary annual appropriations by &#163;639,996. This excess is chiefly accounted for by the fact that more than half the annual appropriation in respect of Treasurer&#39;s Advance was included in the first Supply Bill, so that there would be a margin for contingencies. The total provided in the Estimates for the year for Treasurer&#39;s Advance is &#163;2,000,000, while the amount included in Supply Bill No. 1, in respect of Treasurer&#39;s Advance, was &#163;1,500,000. It has also been necessary to provide in this bill the full amount required to cover the cost of the elections, namely, &#163;111,000. Under refunds of revenue and certain other votes in relation to which periodical payments fall due, the provision in the Supply Bills for the first six months slightly exceeds half the amount required for the full year. The amounts shown in this bill may be summarized a* follows : - </para>

                <para class="block">As the general position of the Commonwealth finances was placed before the Senate recently, I do not think that any further explanation regarding them, or the moneys included in the present bill, is necessary. I commend the measure to the Senate. Tt must he passed, and it is hoped that it will he given a speedy passage. There have been abundant opportunities for discussion on previous Supply Bills and other measures that have been submitted. </para>

                    <para>. - I have no desire to&#39; obstruct the passage of the bill, but it is fair to point out that the Government, after a recess of seven months, is springing many important measures upon Parliament. That may be quite satisfactory from the Government&#39;s point of view. But from the point of view of the people as  a whole, the Government has failed to achieve much. Now, e&#60;n the eve of a general election, the&#39; Government  has  submitted a number of proposal*, which we shall have no opportunity adequately to consider. Honorable senators, apparently; are anxious to hurry back to their constituents. Tills Government is supposed to be the custodian of the destinies of this country, but 1 wonder whether Ministers are concerned with the welfare of Australia so much as they are concerned about themselves. At the moment, war is in the air. The Government wants to go to the country. So do we, and, for our part&#39;, the Government may bring forward any number of measures to bo rushed through in the last hours of the session. They ave the Government&#39;s responsibility; not ours. AVo shall offer no opposition to them. </para>
