If. unfortunately, such a position should arise, all questions affecting Western Australia would have to be considered from a new point of view,and it would not be possible to treat the State on the same footing as those which continued to recognize their duties to one another and the Commonwealth. -(West <inline font-style="italic">Australian,</inline> 4.4.33.) </para>

The War Service Homes Act provides that the widow of a returned soldier may be granted up to 50 years in which to repay a loan.

Moreover, the act as amended in 1928 contains the provision that where a postal ballot-paper would not reach the Divisional Returning Officer for the division in respect of which the elector claims to vote, before the close of the poll, the envelope in which the ballot-paper is enclosed may be addressed to, and posted or delivered to any Divisional Returning Officer or to an Assistant Returning Officer, or may be delivered on polling day to any presiding officer. It is, therefore, considered that reasonable facilities are available to unable the electors concerned to record their votes. </para>

                            <para>In an endeavour to bring about the development of the Newnes shale oil undertaking, the Commonwealth Government and the Government of New South Wales jointly appointed a technical committee to inquire into various factors associated with the project, including the general economics of the proposition. The record of failures at Newnes had created a feeling of suspicion in the minds of investors which had militated against development, and the appointment of the committee mentioned was part of a policy designed to restore confidence. The committee has now submitted its report, and after a very close examination both governments have decided that joint negotiations should be entered into with persons considered to be possessed of the necessary technical and engineering qualifications with a view to bringing about the development of Newnes on the lines recommended by the committee. The Commonwealth Government is prepared, in co-operation with the Government of New South Wales, to provide financial and other assistance which may be necessary to induce development on the lines proposed. Pending the result of negotiations, it is not possible to disclose the extent of the assistance which will be necessary. </para>
                    <para>In the opinion of the governments, it is essential that the development of Newnes should bo undertaken by persons possessing the necessary technical, engineering and other qualifications, which are pre-requisites of success and stability. It is regarded of outstanding importance that another failure at Newnes should be averted, therefore it is imperative that caution should be exercised in the selection of a company to undertake development. </para>

<para>  On the 12th January, 1931, Mr. Robinson&#39;s estate was sequestrated on the petition of a judgment creditor. The outline of his case, as set out by Mr.Robinson, comprises nine pages of closely-typed matter, which I do not propose to read. It contains allegations of murder, forgery, corruption  of  courts and court officials, &#38;c. In my letter  to  the honorable senator, dated the 5th June,  1934,  I stated that I was quite prepared to make  all  the departmental papers available for his inspection, and this offer still holds good. These papers will show that full information has, during the past three years, been furnished to Mr.Robinson, and to the various members of Parliament who have made representations on his behalf. Certain letters Written by Mr. Robinson himself have not been replied  to,  because it is not the practice to answer letters couched in insulting terms or accusing the courts or its officers of corruption. </para>

                        <para>The plan aimed at national rehabilitation and progressive reduction of deficits, and it was not specified that its measures should operate for three years. It was generally considered that there would be a marked increase in prices of Australian products, which would assist recovery. As indicated on more than one occasion, the Government has stated that relief from some of the emergency measures should be made as and when practicable. In accordance with this policy restorations have already been made in respect of salaries, wages, old-age pensions, war pensions, superannuation, &#38;c. Remissions have also boon made of some of the heavy emergency taxation. On the other hand, interest reductions secured under the plan are stilloperatingfully, and have, in fact, been considerably extended since 1931. </para>

                        <para>. - The first thing that strikes one with regard to this comprehensive bill is the fact that it must have involved a great deal of minute work on the part of the draftsmen, because it contains 24 pages of matter so detailed that months of study would be required to understand the amendments which it makes to the various acts. Inotice, for instance, on page 14, this amendment of section 40 of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act: &#34; (b) Omit award), make&#39; insert &#39;award, make&#39;.&#34; In other words, the purpose of this amendment is to omit a bracket. It is obvious that the law officers who prepared this measure spent laborious days and nights over the business. The fourth schedule runs into nine pages of alterations to 54 groups of acts. In this matter I am sure we can rely on the assurance of the law officers that the alterations, which are set out in this measure have in fact taken place already, and that this amending bill simply places those amendments on record. Nevertheless, I should have liked a little more definite assurance from the Minister on this point, because the Senate must, to a great extent, be guided by his assurances in respect of a bill so complicated as this. The honorable gentleman said: &#34;It is believed&#34;, and &#34;I think I may say, that the fourth schedule, which I regard as a most important part of the bill, and the bill itself, respectively make no substantive amendment in the law &#34;. I should like the Minister to say definitely that it does not make any substantive amendment of any law except as set out and itemized in the fourth schedule.  His  statement as it stands is, I suggest, a trifle noncommittal. I presume the Minister will discuss the various groups of acts affected by this bill when we are considering it in committee. The point that strikes me, and really the only point to which I desire to direct the attention of the Senate at this stage, is that as the amendments made by this bill affect no less than 54 groups of acts, it is probable that some legal practitioners will be unaware of a number of amendments made- in this way to the respective laws. It would have been better if all the alterations in the fourth schedule had been made by different acts, that is to say, if each group had been taken separately. For example, alterations to the Commonwealth Public Service Act which has been amended repeatedly between 1922 and 1933, should have been submitted in an amending bill of the same name. To me it seems to be unnecessary, as well as confusing, to make alterations to that act in a measure to revise aud consolidate the statute law. The same remark may be applied to the other groups of acts which are amended by the fourth schedule to this bill. Why, for example, should we, in this bill, make amendments to the Defence Act or the Excise Procedure Act, which have always been altered by amending nets of the same name? It is perfectly obvious that if a legal practitioner wished to study amendments of a particular law, he would look through the alphabetical list of the Commonwealth acts passed between 1901 and 1933, and expect to find therein all references to it. Unfortunately, they will not bo found there. My concern is that the alterations which are being made to these 54 groups of acts shall be readily available to legal practitioners, and others who may wish to consult the law. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>As the Minister pointed out in his second-reading speech, this is the first statute law revision that has been attempted in Australia. Since there has been a number of similar revisions in Great Britain, I daresay lawyers in the Mother Country are accustomed to referring to the statute law revision measures when they wish to inform themselves of alterations made in various laws. As this is an innovation in the Commonwealth, we should do everything we can to facilitate the work of those whose business it is to study or consult the law. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> will agree with me that, in its present form, this bill will increase the difficulties of lawyers, and that there will be some risk of amendments of the various acts being overlooked. The difficulty could, I think, be overcome by including in the alphabetical table of acts, a memorandum in italics, indicating, in addition to the amendments made to a particular law by acts of the same name, the amendments made by the Statute Law Revision Act. Attention would thus be drawn to the amendments actually made. I realize that a great deal of the time of Parliament would be taken up if 54 groups of bills were passed through Parliament in the ordinary way. From another viewpoint, this bill -is comprehensive in that it amends no fewer than 54 groups of acts as shown in the schedule. </para>

                            <para>- I think we can rely upon the assurance of the Crown law officers that the first three schedules simply place on record amendments which have already been made, and that the fourth schedule is the only one containing new amendments. I hope that we can obtain from the Minister a definite assurance that the amendments mentioned in the first, second and third schedules have already been made, and that wo are now merely placing them on record for the purpose of convenience. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> that to go through the fourth schedule in detail would necessitate weeks of work. If the Minister will give the Senate the definite assurance for which I have asked, I shall be satisfied; but I suggest that he should prevent these amendments, which are so full, and which cover such a wide field, from being overlooked by those anxious to know what the law is. </para>

                <para>Since October, 1932, loans amounting to &#163;109,849,000 have been converted in London, reducing the average interest rate on that amount from &#163;511s. per cent. to &#163;3 17s. 8d. per cent. The Government confidently anticipates the com pletion of further successful conversions during the next eighteen months. Loans raised in Australia during the last two years amounted to &#163;39,000,000, of which &#163;12,650,000 was devoted to the funding of treasury-bills. All loan services are now being met from long-term loans and the yearly funding is slightly in excess of the bills provided for revenue deficits. Since June, 1932, the Commonwealth public debt has decreased by &#163;5,800,000, while that of the States has increased by &#163;40,600,000.

                <para>Coming to the year 1934-35, the improvement in the Commonwealth finances enables the presentation of a balanced budget. Certain considerations have influenced the Government to refrain from drawing against past accumulations for the purpose of financing the budget of the new year. The budgetary positions of State governments continue to be difficult and the Commonwealth proposes a non-recurring unconditional grant of &#163;2,000,000 to the States from the accumulated balances of the last three years. From these balances also an allocation of &#163;4,160,000 will be made for the development of national defence. </para>
                <para>The expenditure and taxation concessions provided last year to an annual value of &#163;9,000,000 are being maintained and supplemented by the liberalization of old-age and war pensions, adjustments of salaries, and further relief in respect of sales tax and primage.

                        <para>. - While I appreciate the anxiety of the Government to consolidate, as far as possible, the legislation of this Parliament, I consider that the bill is of sufficient magnitude to be referred to a select committee. Alternatively, I ask the Minister not to proceed with the bill  but to leave it to be dealt with by the next Parliament. The bill is not so simple as the Minister in his second-reading speech represented it to be, and I can quite understand that honorable senators have difficulty in comprehending the alterations which the measure will effect in the existing law. The fourth schedule is more than a mere consolidation; it proposes alterations of the law. For instance, the Gold Bounty Act is being amended by the omission of sections 2 and 3, and alterations are being made in the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act. If we are to debate these matters item by item in order to ensure that while driving in one nail we are not loosening a dozen others, we shall not have time to consider this measure fully before the election. There is no urgent need for the bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> has correctly pointed out that the fourth schedule involves a material alteration of the existing law. </para>

Also, I am reminded by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings,</inline> the amendment proposed to the Cotton Bounty Act, will alter the law. In any case what harm could be done by referring this measure to a select committee? I make no complaint against the Crown Law officers. I do not question their competency, but. over and over again even the Crown Law Department has had to submit to Parliament alterations to acts in order to meet circumstances that were not envisaged when the original measures wore drafted. Here we are asked- to alter the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, and to strike out of the Defence Act a provision relating to the retirement of officers without considering either the effect such alterations will have on the law appertaining to them, or the incidence of a principle which we may be forced to carry right through other legislation. </para>

                        <para>. - When moving the second reading of the bill I did not hesitate to commend the bill to the Senate, and to assure honorable senators that there was nothing in it that could be regarded as contentious. I repeat that assurance on the basis of information given to me by the Crown Law officers who have been engaged on this work, not only under the present Government, but under the preceding Government. It has been a colossal work and it would be disheartening to them if the enactment of this revision web further delayed. The bill has been on the tapis for some time, but it has been delayed in order to extend consideration to some members of the profession who, not knowing that this work was in progress, had also compiled a consolidation of the statutes. </para>

                            <para>- No, and I Jo not think it is necessary to do so. This work has been held up too long already, and I give to honorable senators the assurance that if, when dealing with this measure in committee any substantial alteration of the law is pointed out, I shall defer its further consideration. I am prepared to explain every item in the schedules, and I am assured by the Solicitor-General that the measure proposes no material alteration of the law. In the United Kingdom similar measures have never been examined by a select committee, nor have detailed explanations been sought by members before the committee stage. To illustrate the difficulties of the Crown Law administration I point out that nineteen amendments of this bill have been drafted since it was introduced into the Senate, and that fifteen of these have been necessitated by amending legislation introduced in the&#34; House of Representatives. When the fourth schedule is reached I shall be prepared to give a complete explanation of what is proposed. </para>

                        said that this measure will cause a great deal of difficulty to the legal profession. I assure the honorable senator that the Crown Law officers propose that, immediately legislative effect has been given to this bill, the statutes shall be reprinted as revised to date. In the present congested state of the statute-book, the various  amendments, references and cross references make the law complicated, not only to members of the legal profession, but also, undoubtedly, to the layman. It will be possible to obviate difficulty on the part of the practitioner who does not choose to purchase the revised and consolidated statutes by an italicized reference in the alphabetical list of acts that prefaces every volume of statutes, as
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline>
                        has suggested. But already a complete reference to all amendments made to any act may be. found in the chronological table of acts which is included each year in the annual volume of acts. Therein are set out the act, the amendments and a reference to the acts making the amendments. It might be advisable, also, to embody some reference to this in a short prefatory note to future volumes of statutes. I shall see that something of the kind is done, because it is important that members of the profession and the public generally should know how the various acts have been affected by this revision. I repeat that if we discover in this measure any substantial alteration in the law, I shall consent to postpone its further consideration. The first and second schedules are non-con tentious. They merely clean up the statutes by removing the dead wood from the trees.

                            <para>- This work has been going on for two or three years, and has cost about &#163;2,000. A tremendous amount of re-printing has to be done. I think it would be a vary poor compliment to our Crown Law officers, after their strenuous work, if this legislation were further delayed. </para>

                            <para>- I have pressed for it for a number of years, as have many other members of the legal profession. That pressure was relaxed somewhat when two private gentlemen prepared a consolidation of the statutes; but they were not in a position to clean up the statute-book. If this bill is passed, it will be possible to issue a consolidation of the acts of this Parliament under the authority of this statute. I repeat my assurance that no alteration of the law is involved. The officers of the Crown Law Department know their duties too well, and are too honorable to arrogate to themselves the prerogative of the legislature. </para>

I did not speak to the second reading, because I did not feel competent to discuss the measure at such short notice, and because I do not wish to be incapable of explaining my vote on this omnibus measure to those who sent me hero I am proposing to refer it to a select committee. It is an insult to our intelligence and to that of the electors, as well as derogatory to Parliament, that in the dying days of a session we should he asked to pass so comprehensive a measure, even though the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan)</inline> has given us certain assurances. If we pass this bill we shall have no time in this Parliament to correct any harm that might have been done. The Senate is probably too large to grapple with the details of this measure, and for that reason I have moved for the appointment of a select committee to consider thom. </para>

                            <para>- I object to such unseemly haste, particularly as Parliament has been sitting only a few weeks and intends to adjourn again not many clays hence. The balance of the legislation to be brought forward before the prorogation will,  probably,  be dealt with in the absence of half the members of this chamber. I strongly protest against the procedure which is being adopted. </para>

                        <para>. - I second the motion. I have already entered my protest against the bill being rushed through in this way. The Minister said that the Crown Law officers have no desire to arrogate to themselves the prerogative of Parliament, and I concur in his remarks. The position confronting us is rather illogical. The Minister says that the Crown Law officers say that this bill is right; that he thinks they are right, and that, therefore, we should accept his opinion that they alE right. That is not the way to deal with, legislation. I have no doubt that the motion will be defeated, because the Government has the numbers. The Opposition, having made its protest, must rest content with the recording of that protest in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> Before this legislation was introduced, the law societies of the several States, the trade union movement, which is vitally concerned with any amendment of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, as well as every other person whose interests are affected by the fourth schedule, should have been consulted. With all due respect to the Crown Law authorities, I venture the opinion that, before long, Parliament will be asked to correct some mistake in this &#39; measure which has resulted from the haste associated with its introduction. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> suggested that undue haste was being shown in connexion with this measure because of a desire to injure two young men who had prepared a consolidation of the statutes. I assure the honorable senator that, so far from that being the case, the introduction of this bill has been delayed in order to give those men an opportunity to dispose of their production. This bill is brought forward, not to injure any one, but to do something which will be of value, not&#39; only to the legal profession, but also to the general public. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> said that the Government has the numbers to carry the .bill: I want it to be carried, not by weight of numbers, hut by weight of reason. Honorable senators may accept my assurance that the first, second, and third schedules are merely formal. With regard to the fourth schedule, I have already promised an explanation of each item, if it is sought. The Cotton Industries Bounty Act, to which reference has been made, will be dealt with in an amendment which I shall move in committee. </para>

                    <para>This bill is not a subject for a select committee. In the first place, no principle requiring examination by a select committee is involved, for the measure merely seeks to  clean the statute-book of obsolete legislation. As 1 have promised an explanation of every item in the fourth schedule, I cannot conceive of a select committee accomplishing more than this Senate can accomplish. </para>

Something similar was attempted in Victoria, when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Leo</inline> Cussen was consulted, and assurances, supported by certificates, were given by the Crown Solicitor of Victoria. The practice of the English Parliament was followed. I cannot conceive of any better way of dealing with this bill than by the Minister explaining the various items and seeking to convince honorable senators that no alteration of the law is involved. </para>

                            <para>- That is by no means correct. It is patent to me that this bill is what the Minister says it is - a revision bill to repeal enactments which have ceased to have any force, or which have been rendered unnecessary. That is its main feature and purpose. If the honorable senator who has moved for its reference to a select committee turns to schedule  4,  he must be impressed with the fact that the main part of it relates to legislative enactments which no longer exist except on paper, and which have no force whatever. Naturally, they should be eliminated from the statute-book. The Minister has made a fair statement and a fair offer. There are one or two items in the fourth schedule of which I should like an explanation, but I feel sure that all such explanations can be given by the Minister in committee, just as in the case of an ordinary bill. I cannot understand why an attempt should be made to delay this measure, which should have been passed long ago, because it is evident to everyone who cares to wade through the statutes that they have contained for a long time hundreds of laws which are now inoperative, since they have either expired or been rendered unnecessary by subsequent events. The object of the bill is simply to wipe those obsolete acts out of existence, and at the same time to make certain necessary amendments, many of which are consequential on a large number of sections having been rendered unnecessary by the lapse of time. </para>

                        <para>. -  I should hesitate to express an opinion on a matter which is apparently one purely for the legal mind to understand, although two other honorable senators who are not lawyers have ventured into the arena. I rise, not for the pur pose of pretending that I have any legal knowledge, but rather to make some inquiries into the reasons for this legislation, and to ascertain, if I can do so, what possible good can be expected from it. I should not hesitate to support any proposed modernizing of our laws, or revision of those which have become obsolete. I am glad to assist in every possible way to make the law more simple or more easily understood, but I cannot understand why this enormous number of measures is listed here for repeal. Take, for example, supply acts, or acts making monetary grants to various States, all of which measures, in the nature of things, exist only for one specific purpose, and fall dead when that purpose is effected. </para>

                    <para>SenatorRAE. - We cannot remove them from the statute-books that have already been printed, so that they will still remain on record. If any good purpose can bo effected by clearing the statute-books of dead wood, well and good, but it seems to me to be a contradiction in terms to speak of repealing a thing which is already stone dead, and which no longer exists in fact. Why not pass a bill providing that whenever in the nature of things an act has no further application, it shall be considered dead? If, for instance Parliament passes a Supply Act, the money is granted by it and expended under it, and the measure then has no more existence than the shadow that passes across the surface of a lake. I do not know whether there is any legal term for an act which ceases to exist when its one definite purpose is served, but, if there is, why not use it? There is surely no necessity for reprinting a Supply Act, or an act making a grant of money to a State. It ceases to operate by the very fact that its object has been achieved. I should like the Minister to state what results are expected from this measure. It seems to me that it is only legislation to fill in time, seeing that federation has continued now for 34 years without anything of the kind having been found necessary ere this. </para>

                        <para>. - I think I remember the Minister in charge of the bill giving the Senate a solemn assurance that there was nothing to be afraid of in the measure, and that it would reduce printing costs. I do not know whether that is a complete or sufficient summary of the Minister&#39;s remarks, but in view of it I was ready to allow the bill to pass. If I am mistaken in my recollection of what the Minister said, 1 am prepared to support the motion to refer the bill to a select committee. We have been informed by the Minister that all the acts listed in the schedule are so much dead wood, and that he simply requires our assistance to relieve the treasury of further printing costs, because the existing law requires that acts which are still on the statute-book shall be reprinted. What I heard the Minister say to-day confirms that. He has assured us that there is nothing in the bill to interfere with the laws that have been passed by both Houses. I am, however, naturally suspicious of anything that comes from the front bench on the other side. We are warned always to suspect a Highlander - or so the AngloSaxon version runs - and one must always be prepared for a certain amount of Gaelic subtlety in all that the Minister does, but in this case I am quite ready to be a victim to any concealment that may be practised, especially as the Minister&#39;s assurance is reinforced by the Crown Law Department, which, after all, is the common property of all parties in the chamber. </para>

I cannot seethat any useful purpose would be served by the appointment of a select committee to consider the bill. I initiated the discussion of this matter, and do not in the least regret having done so, because this is a work of sufficient importance to deserve at least some attention, but I am satisfied with the assurances that the Minister has given. He rather suggested that he had already given those assurances in his second-reading speech, but he was more emphatic and definite to-day, and I am perfectly satisfied Avith what he has said. As regards the chronological table, it certainly appears in the statute-books, but in my experience, and I think in the experience of others, it is very seldom referred to. The ordinary alphabetical list of acts is all that most practitioners use. </para>

I am prepared to listen to the Minister&#39;s explanation. He has told us that he intends to submit nineteen amendments. Unless they are of a minor character, we should have until to-morrow to consider them. </para>

That can hardly be regarded as a minor alteration of the law. But if the Minister assures me that, the amendments are not important in character, I shall not detain the Senate further. I do suggest, as a general rule, that before Ave are asked to vote upon amendments, we should be furnished with copies and given an opportunity to consider them. </para>

                        (New South Wales) &#91;5.8j. - The Minister
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan)</inline>
                        has told us that he intends to submit nineteen amendments to the bill. Surely this indicates that there is something wrong in the drafting of the Government&#39;s proposals.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator DuncanHughes</inline>
                        made a veiled attack on
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings,</inline>
                        because he had moved that the bill be referred to a select committee. In the course of his remarks the honorable gentleman also  attacked
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang,</inline>
                        the ex-Premier of New South Wales. He Was at great pains to show that
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline>
                        had introduced and passed certain legislation expeditiously, and he blamed the Labour party of New South Wales for its support of those proposals.
                    </para>
                    <para>The honorable senator had nothing to say about legislation that Was rushed through this chamber by his own leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> in a way that wouk almost shame a bootlegger. Now he wouk like Labour senators to support the Government&#39;s proposals to amend or repeal certain statute laws of the Commonwealth. The explanation given is that some of them have become obsolete. Notwithstanding the drastic amendments to a large number of acts made by this bill, the leader of the Senate has intimated, by way of interjection, that he proposes to submit nineteen additional amendments. This bill reminds me of a &#34; cash and carry&#34; outfit. On the assurance of the Minister we are expected, without further delay, to accept all that it contains. I am not prepared to do that, because I would not trust Ministers in this Government as far as I could throw them. It is only right that honorable senators should, tl rough inquiry by a select committee, ascertain precisely what is in the mind of the Government in seeking to amend so drastically certain laws and repeal others. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> suggested that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> should have devoted the twelve clays during which the Senate has been in recess to the study of this bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings,</inline> like other Labour senators, has other important work to do for the people he represents in this chamber. In any case, why was not the Senate kept in session to deal with the Government&#39;s measures? Had that been done, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> and other members on this side would  have been able to give the bill the detailed criticism which its importance demands. Amendments are being made to a long list of acts, including laws relating to the Pacific Islands. This being so, the bill should not be passed without detailed examination. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> would be glad to give the Senate tha benefit of his legal knowledge by accepting appointment to the proposed select committee. What is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Duncan-Hughes</inline> afraid of? I object to giving too much power to this Government to alter the statutes. It is true that the Minister has promised to give honorable senators an opportunity to consider the proposed further amendments; that is not enough. We should be furnished with a copy of the proposed alterations, so that we may know what they mean. The select committee could, if appointed, consider the bill ,this week. </para>
                    <para class="block">When the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> was in opposition, he and his supporters secured the appointment of a select committee to consider the Scullin Government&#39;s central banking proposal. That measure, like the one now before us, was drafted by the Crown Law officers. We have every right to be given the opportunity to examine the Government&#39;s proposals. I hope that the amendment will be carried. </para>

I have already said that I do not question the ability or honour of the Crown Law officers. Nor do I challenge the assurance given by the Minister. I merely submit that better results could be expected by referring the details of this bill to a select committee. Will the Minister give honorable senators all the information they require when the measure is in committee? </para>

                    <para>. - It would appear that some fairly substantial amendments to the Dairy Produce Export Control Act are proposed. The proviso to section 2 which is to be omitted relates to the taking of a poll of producers before certain proclamations are issued under the authority of that act. It is also proposed that section 5 which deals with the election of members of the board, and section18 which has reference to certain contracts, shall be repealed, while section 19 is to be amended by omitting sub-section 4. I take it that the necessity for these provisions no longer exists, but I should like to hear the Minister&#39;s explanation. </para>

A favorable poll having been taken, and the board having been elected, these provisions have exhausted themselves and are no longer necessary. Sections 18 and 19 refer to contracts in existence at the time when the Dairy Export Control Board was constituted. The legislation proposed to be omitted or repealed is no longer necessary. </para>

                    <para>In instances where a person who has been convicted of an offence against the act is released upon finding security for the payment of the penalties, the giving of the security operates as a complete discharge of any order for imprisonment in default of payment of the fine, and no further action can be taken against the offender. This has created a very difficult position for the department, particularly in connexion with cases, which are very rife, of illicit distillation of spirits. In most of these cases the offenders are released upon finding security for payment of the penalty. In some instances, the sureties accepted by the court have been persons of small, or relatively small, means, and when the release of the offenders has been secured, strong representations have been made that no action bo taken to enforce the security given in view -of the hardship which would be entailed on the surety. </para>
                    <para>It is considered that in cases of this kind, where the enforcement of the security is impracticable or would occasion real hardship to the surety, there should be some provision to enable the actual offender to be dealt with. The object of this bill therefore is to provide authority so that in cases of this kind the court may be approached for an order to commit the offender to gaol until the full penalty has been paid. </para>
                    <para>I may mention that the law in most of the States is that offenders are not relieved of their liability to imprisonment if their sureties make default in payment of the fine, but these provisions are not applicable to offences under the Excise Act. It is also proposed that the provisions of section 149 of the Excise Act shall apply to the imprisonment of an offender for whose committal to gaol an order of this kind has been made. That section  provides  for the discharge of the defendant at the expiration of a certain period if the penalty remains unpaid, and in calculating such period any terms of imprisonment served by the defendant prior to&#39; his release upon security and also any portion of the fine which may have been paid will be taken into account. </para>
                    <para>Honorable senators will realize that it is of the utmost importance to the Administration that the powers sought in this bill should be granted. Without such powers, proved offenders may escape the penalties laid down in the act. In the administration of this department I have found it extremely difficult, when mothers or females had come to the rescue of perhaps undeserving sons or relatives, to enforce the penalty. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator knows, from his own administration of the department a few years ago, that there is another method of dealing with  such cases. In one case which caine under my notice a mother had gone surety for her son, her security was vouched for by officers of the court, and the young man was released. Subsequent investigations disclosed that the means of the unfortunate mother were so limited that enforcement of the security would have involved the sacrifice of her household furniture. It is felt that effective steps should he taken to prevent the law from being flouted. A similar provision was inserted in the Customs Act recently. I hope, therefore, that honorable senators will pass the bill. </para>

This is highly desirable. I have known of persons who desired to appear in support of certain claims, but in the state of the law, their evidence could not be accepted. The amendment, proposed will remove a very great disability from which a considerable number of people are suffering. </para>

It is unfair to the members of trade organizations that the figures supplied by them are not accepted by the Arbitration Court, while those supplied by the Commonwealth Statistician are admissible.

                        <para>. - The honorable senator will see that the proposed section relates to the production of a document containing statistics or abstracts purporting to have been published by the Commonwealth Statistician. I submit that it would be unwise to extend the scope of the section which at present is confined to official and independent figures and facts. Sub-section 2 also provides the power of delegation. No one other than the Commonwealth Statistician, or persons nominated by him, has any power or authority to collect statistics, and while he may rely to some extent upon the figures supplied by organizations such as those mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> there must not be any possibility of conflict between the figures he supplies and those compiled by any other authority. The Commonwealth Statistician may delegate certain of his powers to some other persons, but the information collected is always open to challenge. This amending measure is merely to facilitate proof of the results at which the Commonwealth Statistician has arrived. </para>

                        <para>. - Having had 20 years intimate experience of the Commonwealth industrial arbitration system and the Commonwealth Statistician&#39;s figures as supplied to the Arbitration Court I realize the difficulties with which the Government is confronted. There was a prosecution in Adelaide some weeks ago for a breach of an award in which provision was made for a basic wage to increase or decrease according to the index figures contained in the bulletin issued by the Commonwealth Statistician. The court held that as the bulletin issued by the Commonwealth Statistician was not a <inline font-style="italic">Government Gazette</inline> it was not admissible under the Evidence Act, and that it had to be strictly proven. If this provision related only to the strict proving of the document I would have no objection to it, but while the amendment moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> will not overcome the difficulty the Minister will see that there is something to be said in favour of the points raised by the honorable senator being considered. If this provision is passed in its present form not only the document but also that which it contains will be admitted as evidence. The production of a notice in the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Government Gazette is</inline> evidence that such notice was published by the Commonwealth. This clause is open to the interpretation - I do not say that that is the only interpretation - that the admission of such a document is proof not only of the document but also of its contents. At times I have had occasion to challenge the results arrived at by the Commonwealth Statistician. If such documents are to be conclusive proof of the facts contained in them, the trades union movement will not have the opportunity to check, challenge or possibly qualify the figures submitted by the Commonwealth Statistician. I can understand the motive behind those who have asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> to move this amendment. The Australasian Council of Trade Unions and other organizations, including the organization of which my honoured leader is the  president,  have for years been collecting statistics, and in several cases have brought them before the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. Although there was a possibility of qualifying the information supplied by the Commonwealth Statistician that right has been denied to the organizations. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> wishes to make it as easy for the trade union movement to prove such figures as it is for the Commonwealth Statistician to do so. I suggest that the Minister report progress and consult with the Crown Law officers in order to see whether the measure can be so amended so that the document itself and not its contents shall be admitted. If the bill makes the production of a document proof of its contents, then the right to challenge should be given. We are laying down the new principle that the Commonwealth Statistician&#39;s figures shall be accepted by the Arbitration Court as proof of a particular fact. I do not suggest that the Commonwealth Statistician&#39;s Department is in any way inefficient, but other recognized authorities should have the right to submit similar information. I am anxious that the proving of the Commonwealth Statistician&#39;s bulletins shall be facilitated, but the Evidence Act should not be extended further unless organizations such as those suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> are placed on the same footing as is the Commonwealth Statistician. </para>

                        <para>. - This measure does not go so far as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Daly</inline> suggests. The Evidence Act of  1905  contains a series of sections, dealing with the proof of proclamations, orders, regulations, published books, documents and the votes and proceedings of Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- It is proposed that such bulletins may be used without calling the Commonwealth Statistician to prove their contents. If honorable senators opposite do not like the bill we shall not proceed further with it, but I remind them that it has been introduced entirely in the interests of the trade union organizations which have had great difficulty in proving matters of this kind. The amendment of the law has been proposed to enable the figures contained in such bulletins to be accepted without the Commonwealth Statistician being compelled to travel to distant cities to prove them. The contents of every document mentioned in the Evidence Act is open to argument. The figures of the Commonwealth Statistician are used in framing awards of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court and the bill permits such figures to be accepted by the court. In a case before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly,</inline> sitting as a special magistrate under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, it was necessary to prove the index numbers tabulated by the Commonwealth Statistician. The <inline font-style="italic">Quarterly Summaries of Australian Statistics</inline> containing the index numbers were tendered as proof of the index numbers, counsel contending that mere production was sufficient proof under section  9  of the Commonwealth Evidence Act. He relied, also, upon sections  5  and  0  of that act. The magistrate held that the documents were not admissible, and the figures were held not to have been proved. This meant that, either the Commonwealth Statistician must be brought from Canberra to verify  bi3  compilation of the figures, or that the case must be abandoned. The case was of importance to the trade unions. This proposed new section carries the proof of Commonwealth statistics no further than the proof of any other official document under the Evidence Act. </para>

I repeat that his view of this clause is wrong. If he will consent to refer to the Solicitor-General the point I have raised I shall be prepared to abide by the opinion of that officer. I submit that this clause makes the statistics themselves evidence, and the document containing them, whereas the provision in the Evidence Act, to which the Minister has referred, provides for the proof of the document and not its contents. The issue of a proclamation is proved by producing the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> in which the proclamation is published, but that is not proof of the facts contained in the proclamation. I want to give to either party the opportunity to challenge the Statistician&#39;s figures. </para>

                        I resent the threat of the honorable senator. This has been provoked, apparently, by the plea made by members of the Opposition that consideration be extended to the trade union movement in connexion with the compilation of statistics.  Neither

                        nor I has suggested that there is any disagreement with the Commonwealth Statistician&#39;s figures. We are pleading on behalf of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions, which represents well over 1,000,000 trade unionists in this country, that any statistics which might be produced by a prescribed authority, shall be admissible as evidence. We accept the assurance of the Minister that, if necessary, he will give equal opportunity to the representatives of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions to present their figures alongside those of the Commonwealth Statistician in hearings before industrial tribunals.

If that is so, we are conferring infallibility on the Commonwealth Statistician. No matter where he may have to go for the raw material from which to compile his statistics, we are to accept his published figures as absolutely correct and beyond question. In the proposed new section &#34; Statistician &#34; means the Commonwealth Statistician, or any one to whom he has delegated power to collect and compile statistics.

Even if the Statistician himself is above suspicion of making mistakes, are we to suppose that every one to whom he delegates his power also is infallible? I cannot see how any legal quibble can surmount the provision in this proposed section that the Statistician&#39;s figures must be taken as absolutely correct. </para>

                <para class="block">This is a bill to amend section 59 of the Distillation Act 1901-1931, which provides, <inline font-style="italic">inter alia,</inline> that no Australian wine shall be fortified under the act so as to contain more than 40 per centum of proof spirit. Certain countries, such as the United Kingdom, allow the importation of wine fortified in excess of 40 per cent. proof spirit. There is a demand in the United Kingdom for Australian wines fortified up to a strength not exceeding 42 per cent, but owing to the provisions of section 59 of the Distillation Act it can be met only to the extent of supplying wines fortified up to 40 per cent. As a result, trade in wines of higher strength is lost to the Commonwealth: it is being captured by other countries, such as South Africa, where similar restrictions are not in force. There seems to be no valid reason for limiting to 40 percent. the strength of Australian wines for export. The Federal Viticultural Council, which has been consulted, strongly supports the proposal to raise the limit to 42 per cent. in respect of wine for export in view of the loss of trade to the Commonwealth as a result of the existing limitation of strength. In  the event of this measure being agreed to. wine fortified up to 42 per cent. proof spirit will not be made available for home consumption, but will be kept under customs control until exported. The object of the bill is the encouragement of our overseas trade in wine. I commend it to the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- Our wines stand high in public estimation overseas; but I understand that there is a difficulty in carrying wines which are not sufficiently fortified. The Viticultural Council suggests that our wines he fortified to 42 per cent., but I do not think that Parliament should raise the percentage further without first consulting those engaged in the wine trade. There may be a danger in making the percentage too high. </para>

                    <para class="block">This bill is designed for the purpose of continuing the assistance which is given by way of bounty to certain wines exported from the Commonwealth. The existing Wine Export Bounty Act will expire on the 2Sth February, 1935, and unless Parliament makes provision for the continuance of the system no bounty can be paid on wine exported from Australia after &#34;that date. It will, I think, assist in the consideration of this measure, if I outline the history of Commonwealth wine bounty legislation. Under their respective repatriation schemes, the governments of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia placed large numbers of returned soldiers on the land to grow grapes for wine-making. The scheme, although excellent, was overdone,and, as a result, there has been serious, overproduction. The only means of providing an outlet for the surplus grapes was by export, and in order to develop overseas markets for Australian wines a bounty of 4s. a gallon on fortified wine exported was agreed to in 1924. That amount included ls. 3d., which represented the drawback of the excise duty on the fortifying spirit contained in the wine exported. In 1927, the bounty was reduced to ls. 9d. a gallon, exclusive of ls. 3d. a gallon drawback. It was, therefore, equivalent to 3s. a gallon on the wine exported. Although the reduction was assented to in April, 1927, it did not operate until the 1st </para>
                    <para class="block">September in that year. During the interval abnormally large quantities of wine were exported to Great Britain on consignment, in order that the benefit of the higher rate of bounty might be obtained, but that action on the part of wine-makers built up such large stocks of Australian wines in London that the orderly marketing of our wines in Great Britain was prejudiced and untold harm was done to the industry. In March, 1928, the bounty was further reduced by 9d. a gallon. In June, 1930, the position of Australian wine-makers and grape-growers became critical, and, in consequence, the present act was passed by Parliament. The bounty was restored to ls. 9d. a gallon, as was the case in 1927. Until 1930 the bounty was paid out of Consolidated Revenue, but in that year a departure was made when part of the burden of financing the bounty was placed on the domestic trade. That was done by increasing the excise duty on fortifying spirit by 5s. a gallon and placing the extra collections into a trust account out of which the bounty was paid. It was also provided that if the amount in the trust account was at any time insufficient to pay the bounty, any deficiency was to be made up from Consolidated Revenue. The Financial Emergency Act of 1931 further reduced the bounty by 20 per cent., making the rate ls. 4.8d. a gallon. In 1932, on account of the prevailing financial stringency, the Wine Bounty Act was further amended to restrict the payments from Consolidated Revenue in respect of the bounty on wine to &#163;96,000, plus the amount received from the extra excise duty of 5s. a gallon imposed on fortifying spirit in 1930. It was further provided that the money available for payment of the bounty should be distributed pro rata amongst exporters, and, to this end, provision was made for the distribution of the bounty by progress payments. Since the commencement of the Financial Emergency Act a first payment of ls. a gallon has been made, further payments being dependent on the amount of money available in the trust fund at the end of each year. In 1932-33 the bounty paid was at the rate of ls. 4.2033d. a gallon; in 1933-34 the maximum rate of ls. 4.8d. a gallon was paid. In June, 1934, there- was approximately 14,000,000 gallons of fortified wine in bond in Australia, a quantity far in excess of local requirements. Moreover, there is little prospect of increasing the local consumption of wines to any appreciable extent in the immediate future. It is therefore incumbent on Australia to find overseas markets if the surplus production is to be absorbed and the wine industry saved from disaster. The continuance of assistance by means of a bounty is essential. If the bounty were discontinued our export trade in wines would suffer, the making of wine would be severely restricted for at least three years, and grape-growers would be faced with ruin. It should also bc remembered that the Governments of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, particularly Ibo last-mentioned, have invested large sums of money in irrigation settlements on which the growing of wine grapes i3 a very important feature. The withdrawal of the wine bounty would undoubtedly result in those governments suffering heavy financial losses. </para>
                    <para>Although the Government is convinced that the continuance of the wine bounty is essential, it is of the opinion, that the present rate is too high. Competent authorities in the trade consider that Australian wines could be sold in London, without loss of trade, at a higher price than is now being realized. South African wines, which are certainly of no better quality than Australian, bring higher prices in London. The present fixed minimum price of the Wine Overseas Marketing Board is 3s. 7d. a. gallon, less prescribed quantity discounts, whereas South African wine realizes approximately from 4s. to 4s. 3d. a gallon on the London market. Moreover, there are good grounds for the belief that some Australian makers arc selling at a figure below the board&#39;s minimum price. The present rate of bounty encourages that undesirable practice. The Government, in the legitimate interests of the industry has decided to correct the position by reducing the existing bounty. Such action will at least make price cut-, ting more difficult, and will probably result in the Wine Overseas Marketing Board, without loss of trade, being able to increase its minimum price for wine to a figure more in keeping with its real value. The resultant stabilization of price would enhance the prestige of Australian wines on the United Kingdom market. Moreover, a reduction in the rate of bounty will allow for considerable expansion of the export trade without <inline font-style="italic">any</inline> additional burden being placed on the finances of the Commonwealth or the industry. The proposed act is to operate for five years, and there is every prospect of development of the export trade during that period, particularly as the United States of America market is now open to Australian wines. </para>
                    <para>The Federal Viticultural Council has expressed the view that the rate of bounty should be stabilized at not less than <inline font-style="italic">ls.</inline> a gallon. The present rate is ls. 4.8d. a gallon. The Government, however, realizes that a heavy reduction effected suddenly would considerably disturb trade, and would probably result in loss of business, while sellers and buyers were adjusting contracts and prices. It is, therefore, proposed to make the reductions by gradual stages, so as to cause a minimum of disturbance to the trade. Briefly, it is proposed further to vary the rate of bounty from ls. 4.8d. a gallon to ls. 3d. a gallon for the first two years, and thereafter, by the operation of a sliding scale, a reduction in the rate of Id. a gallon per annum is to be made until the rate of bounty has been reduced to ls. a gallon. Reduction of the bounty in this manner will also tend to discourage exporters to rush large shipments overseas before February, 1935, in order to take advantage of the higher rate of bounty under the existing act. </para>
                    <para>The original Bounty Act of 1924 had two main objects, namely, the protection of the interests of growers by the fixation of minimum prices for grapes, and fortifying spirit, and the encouragement of the exportation of wine. Since 1927 the Minister for Trade and Customs has fixed the prices to be paid for grapes and fortifying spirit each year. Up to 1933 winemakers who operated in both the local and export markets, and who claimed bounty on wine exported were called upon to pay such prices for all grapes and fortifying spirit purchased for the domestic and export markets. This action was considered necessary in order to satisfy the </para>
                    <para class="block">Minister that reasonable prices had been paid for the grapes used in the production of the wine on which bounty was claimed. In April, 1933, a prominent wine-maker advised the department that during the 1933 vintage &#39;he proposed to purchase grapes up to a certain date for use in the manufacture of wine for export under bounty conditions, and pay approved prices for such grapes, and after that date to purchase grapes for wine for the domestic market at prices mutually agreed upon between himself and the growers. This maker kept the two classes of wine separate, which rendered it impossible for the department to hold that fixed prices had not been paid in respect of grapes used in making wine exported under bounty. Other makers quickly followed suit. As the Commonwealth Government has no authority to control the prices of grapes used in the manufacture of wine for the domestic market, the new procedure adopted by wine-makers forced the department to recede from the position which it had previously taken up. It was obliged to acknowledge claims for bounty where approved prices were paid in respect of the wine exported, irrespective of the prices paid by the maker for grapes used in the manufacture of wine for the Australian market. The lack of power to enforce the protection hitherto afforded grape-growers with respect to prices for grapes used in making wine for the domestic market has seriously impaired the efficacy of price fixation. It lias been suggested, however that, as the State governments have power to fix prices  within  their respective States, action should be taken by the wineproducing States to ensure that wine-makers shall pay prices considered fair and reasonable by the Minister for Trade and Customs for all  grapes  purchased, and that the States should make the manufacture of wine illegal except under licence - a condition of which should be that -prices considered fair and reasonable under the Wine Export Act be paid for all grapes purchased. If the price of grapes for the domestic market is left uncontrolled, and the present Commonwealth policy with respect -to grapes for the export market is maintained, there will be a tendency on the part of some makers to average the prices paid for their grapes each year by reducing the price of their domestic requirements to a low level. This prospect is most unsatisfactory. It circumvents one of the principal objects of the Wine Export Bounty Act, by forcing growers to accept an uneconomic price for grapes, and gives to the wine-maker who buys&#39; grapes for the domestic market at low prices an unfair advantage over competitors who either pay the prices fixed by the Minister for all grapes or who do not operate on the domestic market. Wine-makers, generally speaking, dc not desire to purchase grapes from growers at uneconomic prices, but the unfair and favored position enjoyed by a few makers who have taken advantage of the strict legal position will gradually force all makers who are interested in the local market to pay low prices in order to retain their domestic trade. Numerous conferences with a view to co-ordinating State and Commonwealth powers, so far as price fixing in the wine industry is concerned, have been held between the Commonwealth and State governments, but the desired result has not yet been achieved. South Australia has approved a draft bill. New South Wales has not yet expressed its concurrence, and the attitude of Victoria is uncertain ; but it is believed that it will come into line with South Australia. </para>
                    <para>Price fixation is a very contentious question, but it. is hoped that, at an early date, all the States concerned will fall into line and give the grower the necessary protection to ensure that he receives a reasonable price for all the grapes he produces. To ensure that growers received a reasonable price for grapes, all claimants for bounty have, since 192&#39;7, been required to give an undertaking that they would pay fixed prices before bounty was paid to them. The time within which payment was to be made, however, was not fixed, and although most makers have honoured the undertakings given within a reasonable time, there are some companies which have not paid growers in full for several years. Provision is made in this bill for payment for grapes used in the production of the wine upon which bounty is paid by a system of quarterly instalments. As regards payments for fortifying spirit purchased by claimants  for bounty, the bill provides that payment shall be made within six months from the date of delivery. It is considered that makers should pay growers within a reasonable time, and the terms of the bill in this respect should not embarrass wine-makers to any appreciable extent. </para>
                    <para>As this bill provides for a system of deferred payments for grapes and fortifying spirit, there is a danger that some makers may be tempted, through a shortage of finance, to dispose of large quantities of wine at low prices, and consequently, at a later date, be unable to meet their obligations to grape-growers. A provision has, therefore, been made in the bill which will enable bounty to be withheld unless the Minister is satisfied that the price at which the wine was sold was sufficiently high to enable the winemaker to meet his commitments to both grape-growers and suppliers of fortifying spirit. I may add that the bill makes specific provision for - (a) the fixation of prices of grapes used in making wine exported under bounty; (t) vesting in the Minister power to withhold bounty in cases where a claimant fails to observe the prescribed conditions in respect of past, transactions on which bounty had already been paid; and (c) empowering the Minister to insist on vignerons paying reasonable wages and observing reasonable conditions of employment. Similar provision is contained in the existing act, but. it has been found by experience that the system needs tightening up in respect of wages and conditions of employment. For instance, some vignerons in South Australia are able to evade the requirements and are thus competing unfairly with other vignerons. </para>
                    <para>In addition to the bounty, the Government has rendered valuable assistance to the wine industry in other directions. For example, the excise duty on fortifying spirit has been reduced from 10s. and lis. a gallon to a flat rate of 6s. 6d. a gallon. Another valuable concession granted to wine-makers is the provision for the manufacture of wine in bond. Prior to 1927 winemakers were required to pay excise duty on fortifying spirit when it was added to the wine. If the wine was subsequently exported, a drawback of the duty was paid. In 1927. owing to a large expansion of the export trade in fortified wine, and to the general financial stringency, wine-makers ware permitted to manufacture wine in bond for export and home consumption. Under this provision wine-makers are not required to pay duty on fortifying spirit used until the wine is actually delivered for home consumption, and if the wine is exported no duty is payable. Makers are thus saved a great deal of worry and expense in interest payment in finding large sums for the payment of excise duty in respect of wine which may be stored for long periods pending delivery for home consumption or export. This concession has created many administrative difficulties, but recently the conditions governing the procedure have been improved, and provision has been made to allow wine-makers to make a deduction of 2&#163; per cent, from the excise on fortifying spirit added to wine in bond to cover losses due to evaporation and cellar operations. I have dealt with the essential principles underlying the measure. Details may require to be explained in committee, but I feel sure that enough has been said to enable honorable senators to appreciate the importance and usefulness of the bill. I, therefore, commend it to the favorable consideration of the Senate. </para>

Victoria will bc ready to help the re-constitution of the Australian Country party on sound lines and with an up-to-date platform. &#34;lc will bc interesting to note the attitude of the public to Victorian federal members who may be endorsed in a left-handed manner by a skeleton organization. This would result in a reaction which may relieve the Australian public of a monopolistic incubus such as no other nation in the world has been called upon to support. &#34; </para>

This afternoon a question was addressed to the Leader of the Senate with reference to the Premiers plan, and the right honorable gentleman could not answer it without referring to &#34; Jack &#34; Lang. This of course is part of the game. These Simon Pures arc always talking about dissension in the Labour movement. It is true that we have strong differences of opinion, but we are big enough to fight our disputes to a finish. We get our mandate from the rank and file in the movement. Our opponents are running round the country endeavouring to dope the electors with the belief that the antiLabour candidates are the only people who have an intelligent grip of Australian problems, and will, if returned, bring this country out of its present trouble. </para>
