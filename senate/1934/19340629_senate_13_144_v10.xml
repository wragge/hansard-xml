                        <para>- I ask the Leader of the Senate if it is a fact that on the evening of Thursday, 28th June, a conference was held at the residence of the Prime Minister in Canberra, at which the following persons were present: - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons,</inline> Prime Minister; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parkhill,</inline> Postmaster-General; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir George</inline> Pearce, the Leader of the Government in the Senate; <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page, M.H.R.; and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Paterson,</inline> M.H.R.? Can he say  further, if, at that conference, the date of  the  elections was discussed, and if union of the United Australia party with the Country party was considered on the basis of a further reduction of the Australian tariff? </para>

                    <para>There are certain inaccuracies in the honorable senator's question. I am not aware of any conference having been held at the residence of the Prime Minister, so it is apparent that the honorable gentleman has been slightly misinformed. The Government, and the party with which it has conferred, have nothing to hide. The Government held a conference with the leaders of another party on a matter of major political importance and of great interest to the primary producers, and, indeed, the whole of the people of Australia.

I submit that, under cover of a question addressed to Ministers, the honorable senator is not entitled to suggest that other honorable senators arc extreme freetraders. The purpose of asking questions is, I understand, to elicit information, but the honorable senator has taken advantage of a question to place his own interpretation on the votes of other honorable senators. </para>

                    <para>The bill is to grant Supply in order to carry on the services of the Commonwealth for the first three months of the coming financial year. The amount involved is Â£6,079,175, which includes the following sums for ordinary services: - </para>

                    </para>
                    <para>The items making up these sums are based on the appropriations passed by Parliament for the present year, and represent approximately one-quarter of the appropriation. In addition, the usual provisions are made for " refunds of revenue " and " advance to the Treasurer ". The amount set down for "refunds of revenue" is Â£400,000, and for " advance to the Treasurer " Â£1,500,000. This latter item is required to carry on uncompleted works in progress on the 30th June, 1934, and other urgent works, and to cover unforeseen and miscellaneous expenditure, including special grants to South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania. These special grants will be continued on the same basis as during the present: financial year, pending consideration of the report of the royal commission which is at present inquiring into the circumstances of each of these States and the introduction of new bills. </para>
                    <para>Provision is made in the bill only for the amount which is estimated to be sufficient to carry on essential services on the same basis as that provided for in the appropriation for the current financial year; 1933-34. No provision is made in this measure for any new expenditure or for any departure irons existing policy. It is hoped to introduce the budget early in August, when the full financial proposals of the Government will be submitted to Parliament. </para>
                    <para>As we have almost reached the end of the present financial year, honorable senators will no doubt be anxious to know what the financial results for the year are likely to be. I am not yet in a  position  to supply even an approximate statement of the financial position for the full year, as final returns from the various departments and branches in all States will not be received for some days after the 30th June. I may mention, however, that the revenue for the year has been particularly buoyant, especially the customs and excise revenue, which, up to the 31st May, showed an increase of approximately Â£1,600,000 over the budget estimate for that period. Post office revenue also disclosed a considerable improvement on the budget estimate, the receipts for the eleven months being Â£270,000 in excess of the <inline font-style="italic">pro rata</inline> budget estimate. The statement of receipts and expenditure for the eleven months ended the 31st May showed an excess of receipts of Â£2,625,000. In considering this balance, however, 'it is necessary to take into account that very heavy expenditure has had to be met during the month of June, including expenditure on new works commenced late in the year. The balance of Â£1,400,000, in respect of relief to wheat-growers, completes the total of Â£3,000,000 appropriated under that head. "While it is too early to forecast definitely the financial position fer the full year, it is apparent that when all returns are to hand they will show that the  balance  of the Consolidated Revenue Fund is on the right side of the .ledger. I hope to be able in about eight or ten days to submit to honorable senators a statement of the Consolidated Revenue Fund under various headings, showing the approximate results for the year. A more detailed statement will, of course, be submitted with the budget for next year. As honorable senators are aware this is one of the annual measures that must be dealt with at this stage of the financial year. We may regard the passing of this bill as practically a formal procedure, for it does. not involve any new financial policy, and. I ask the cooperation of honorable senators in giving the measure a speedy pass-age.* They will have ample opportunity later to discuss financial policy. </para>

                        <para>. - I hays' no intention to 'discuss the details pf the bill at tins juncture, for as the Minister has ^pointed out, ample opportunity to debate the Government's financial proposals will be afforded later in the session. According to press reports published during the long recess that we have just experienced, the Government has been well aware of the buoyancy of the revenue. Knowing that the Estimates of receipts were being greatly exceeded, the Government might well have taken action to deal with the grave problem of unemployment, which is wide-spread throughout Australia. It should have used some of its extra revenue to provide employment for the workless. Deputations representing the unemployed and the secretaries of industrial organizations have drawn the attention of the Government to the desperate position of these men; so the Government cannot plead ignorance of the conditions that prevail throughout the land. Ministers are most blameworthy for not having made a determined effort to relieve the situation. The Government is certainly deserving of a vote of censure for the ineptitude displayed by it in this regard. </para>

                    <para>The announcement has been made in the press recently that the Government intends to propose amendments to the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act during the present session. Several important amendments are required, and I shall  direct attention to one in particular. The last amending bill contained a most atrocious provision, the significance of which none of us realized at the time. It might have slipped through Parliament even if every member had been a King's Counsel; but the Government, of course, had at its disposal the services of legal experts. As a result of that amendment, on the death of a pensioner the department can claim the proceeds of his life insurance policy in order to recoup itself for the amount paid to him by way of pension. I do not believe that that amendment would have been passed by this Senate without serious opposition, had honorable senators, irrespective of their party views, 'realized at the time how serious the effects would be. Sub-section 4 of section 476 of the Victorian Companies Act 19,18, provides - </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">I do not know whether a similar provision is contained in the company law of other States. Under that sub-section the insurance cannot be claimed by any creditor, but is reserved to the widow or to a member of the deceased's family; but under the amendment of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act made last session, the department can claim even so small a sum as Â£50 in order to recoup itself for pension payments. I hope that the Government will give early consideration to the need for rectifying this anomaly. </para>
                    <para>We have been told by the press that the Government intends to send 100 men from Canberra to work on the East- West railway. It is said that they will be selected by the railway authorities and sent 1,000 miles or more to engage in the work of re-sleeper ing that line. I have a telegram from the Australian Workers Union in South Australia expressing strong resentment of this proposal. The work involved is usually carried out by members of that organization and the secretary informs me that there, are 17,000 registered unemployed in South Australia to-day, so there is ample labour available locally. It seems absurd that the Government should incur the heavy expense of transporting 100 men from Canberra to Port Augusta. The cost of their fares alone would be probably  Â£1,000.  We are told that Commonwealth money is to be expended on this work, and therefore the Commonwealth Government is entitled to send men from any part of Australia to participate in this relief. That argument might be convincing if no labour were available in the vicinity of the work to be undertaken, but thousands of men are available in South Australia, and as the people of that State are taxpayers of the Commonwealth, they have a prior right to employment in their own neighbourhood. The Federal Capital Territory comprises about 900 square miles, and surely this Government has sufficient ability to find employment in the Territory for the 100 unemployed whom it proposes to send to Port Augusta. The Government has Â£4,000,000 more revenue than was estimated, and the unemployed in Canberra, who are undoubtedly entitled to work, should be found employment near their homes. .  </para>

                            <para>- The money that would be expended in sending Canberra unemployed to the East- West railway would have to be taken from the sum to be appropriated by this 'bill. The Government recently approached the money market with most satisfactory results. According to newspaper reports, the Â£12,000,000 asked for could have been subscribed in. about two hours, and Â£25,000,000 could easily have been obtained. The Government claims that that response to its appeal is evidence of the confidence of the people in the present Administration. One is entitled to complain when a government which finds the borrowing of Â£12,000,000 as easy as the kissing of a girl, fails to care for those of its citizens who live practically on the doorstep of this Parliament House. </para>

                        <para>. - 1  agree with the, Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes)</inline> that nothing that we on this side may do can prevent the passing of this bill. Nevertheless, this measure, which seeks to appropriate over Â£6,000,000 for the service of the next financial year, affords an appropriate opportunity for criticism of the Government's administration. During the recent long recess, many senators have visited States other than those they represent in order to make themselves conversant with conditions throughout Australia. I visited every State, but not the Northern Territory. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> and the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons),</inline> in common with many of their camp followers, boast that conditions in Australia are better to-day than they have been for three or four years. They tell us that prosperity is just around the corner. But the  chairman  of the Commonwealth Bank Board, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Claude</inline> Reading, told us recently that conditions in this country are uo better than they were about two and a half years ago, in the middle of the depression. So serious does he consider the position to be that the Commonwealth Bank has stopped all further credit. In their policy of misrepresentation, responsible Ministers have been aided and abetted by the first civil servant of the Commonwealth, the High Commissioner in London. In a congenial atmosphere, with mellow wine and good food on the table, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> spoke into the microphone, and his words were heard by thousands of listeners sitting in comfort in their homes throughout Australia. Unfortunately for the Government, the  chairman  of the Commonwealth Bank Board has, as it were, thrown  a  spanner into the works. The Premier of South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Butler,</inline> is another who is out of step with the Com* monwealth Government. A critical situation developed recently when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Butler</inline> raised a loan in his own State, and informed the Loan Council that in the future South Australia would arrange its own borrowing. Since then, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ogilvie,</inline> the new Labour Premier of Tasmania, whose recent election has given the </para>
                    <para class="block">United Australia Party a nasty jolt, has stated that Tasmania is on the dole. He warned the Commonwealth Government that unless Tasmania obtained further relief from the Commonwealth, the people of that State would be given an opportunity to decide whether or not they favoured secession. Ministers continue to say that all is well in relation to the agreement signed at Ottawa; but a consideration of many of the items in this schedule, particularly those connected with the Department of Commerce, forces us to the conclusion that all is not well. When in Western Australia recently, I found that the only industry -in that rich State which showed evidence of prosperity was . gold-mining. Although- - Western Australia is now probably the leading wheat-producing State of the Commonwealth, the wheat-farmers there are in a very bad way indeed. Notwithstanding, bounteous rains and good seasonal prospects, the &gt; high capital value placed on their land imposes a burden too heavy for them to bear. Many of the small farmers of Western Australia are practically dependent on the dole, and those with larger holdings are experiencing great difficulty in meeting their commitments. These conditions exist notwithstanding the optimistic forecast of the effect of the Ottawa Conference on the primary and secondary industries of this country. In New South Wales also, the position of the wheat-growing industry is serious; nearly one million acres of wheat laud has gone out of production in that State in recent years. The Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart),</inline> from time to time, endeavours to encourage the wheat-farmers of Australia by a variation of the old adage, " Live, horse, and the grass will grow ". The only industry in New South Wales which shows any evidence of prosperity is the pastoral industry, which has benefited from the increased price of wool. Closer observation reveals a decline in the production of wool in Australia due to the somewhat clearer international atmosphere. Nations which were preparing for war, are, at the moment, not so active in that way, probably because their warehouses are already fully stocked. During recent years, science  and invention have made remarkable progress, and have done much to shape the course of nations. We are now told that a German scientist has discovered a process by which synthetic wool can be produced. Such a discovery must inevitably have a serious effect on the Australian wool-growing industry. Further evidence that all is not well is the failure of the attempt to regulate wheat production throughout the world. Thu ink was scarcely dry on the agreement, which the High Commissioner signed on behalf of Australia, when the Argentine and other wheat-producing countries commenced to " scab " on the other signatories to, that agreement. One wonders whether trie, action of the Argentine Republic is in any way connected with the fact that British interests J have invested over Â£700,000,000 in  the industries of Argentina. Because of the policy of economic nationalism 'that is being preached itf all countries,' even by the present coalition Government in Great Britain, the outlook for the farmers of Australia is very serious, and their plight demands the immediate attention of this Government. </para>
                    <para>The schedule to the bill contains1 items dealing with certain phases of the Government's defence policy. It is well known that the Government intends to earmark Â£4,000,000 of its estimated surplus of Â£6,000,000 for defence purposes. I and my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> are quite willing to vote supply for the ordinary purposes of the Government, but I tell the Minister plainly that when its defence measures come before us they will have our uncompromising opposition. </para>

                        referred to the proposal to transfer a number of unemployed from Canberra to Port Augusta, in South Australia, for work on the transcontinental railway. The condition of the workers in all States is most unsatisfactory, due to the operation of the Premiers plan, under which wage-earners were forced to suffer drastic reductions of wages, as well as loss of employment through the cessation of public works. Actually, many of the leaders of the workers had to " take it on the chin ", during the regime of the previous Commonwealth Government, following the acceptance of the Premiersplan.

Banking and other financial institutions, insurance companies, merchant  princes  and manufacturers with money to spare rushed to take up government bonds in preference to investing money in industry and so providing remunerative employment for our people. Their chief concern is to get the best return on their investment regardless of the way in which they exploit the great mass of people employed in both primary and secondary industries, or how much they squeeze the farmers, who have been obliged to pay anything from 6 to 12 per cent, for money advanced to them to carry ou their operations. Some sections of big business, notably the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, enjoy even higher dividends. </para><continue>

After a recess of seven months, during which I travelled all over Australia seeking tangible evidence, of the alleged prosperity, I feel that I am entitled to give the Senate my impressions. "Wherever I went I saw hundreds of men and wemen, sOme of the latter with children, carrying their swags or wheeling perambulators along country roads in search of work. And this is in a land that should bo one of the brightest gems of the British Empire. Because of economic conditions, for which this Government must accept some responsibility, these people were unable to obtain -employment, although on either side of the roads on which they travelled were millions of acres of fertile land, which had gone out of production owing to the calamitous fall of world prices for primary produce. To-day many of our farmers are on the dole.

Because of the vacillation and the "backing and filling" by this Government, the electors are now in a frame of mind to demand, in no uncertain manner, the immediate introduction of more effective measures to alleviate the sufferings' of the people. This Government has not dealt justly with Public Service employees. Under the Premiers plan, which was adopted by the Scullin Administration, they suffered reductions of salaries ranging up to 22J pgr cent. Those reductions should be restored. When the measure is in committee I shall have, some further comments to make with respect to the political tripe which has appeared in the newspapers during the last few months concerning the activities of this so-called " prosperity " Government. </para></speech>

                        <para>. - Honorable senators on this side of the chamber intend to adhere to the decision that factious opposition shall not be offered to the passage of the bill. I shall reserve any comments which I wish to make upon financial matters generally until the budget papers are before the Senate. At this stage I shall content myself with making an observation concerning pensions. There is another phase with respect to insurance policies, in addition to the point taken by my leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes),</inline> and I ask the Minister to give attention to it. On the death of a pensioner, not only is his insurance policy treated as an asset from which the Commonwealth Government can retrieve the amount of pension paid, but it is also treated as an asset during his life, which, in my opinion, is even worse. To-day when a  deputy  commissioner is deciding whether a person is entitled to a pension, and if so of what amount, his assets are taken into consideration. An insurance policy valued at Â£40 or Â£50 will not be available to the pensioner or his relatives until after death, but its value is treated as an asset during his life-time, and the sum, however small, is used to bring his assets of all kinds above the statutory limit and the pension is reduced accordingly. I am using moderate terms when I say that such action is deplorable and discreditable. This is a matter which could be adjusted by administrative act, even before the budget is considered. It is cruel to allow the present system to continue for 48 hours longer. I am sure that honorable senators will treat this as a non-party matter, and that they do not favour a continuance of the present, system. As the Minister has assured us that the bill does not provide for any new expenditure, I shall assist in giving it a speedy passage. </para>

                        <para>. - I wish to say a few words with reference to the Government's proposal to send unemployed men from Canberra to work on the East-West railout from Port Augusta. As was mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Barnes)</inline> there is a considerable number of unemployed men in South Australia, and at Port Augusta ' itself. The proposal of the Government to send 100 men from Canberra to engage in work on the East-West line has drawn protests, not only from Labour men, but also from the members of other political parties, and I think it would be fair to say that protests have been uttered by representatives of every section of the community. The reason for such protests are these : The unemployed at present at Port Augusta are nearest to the work and their employment would, as a matter of course, obviate the cost which would be involved in sending men from Canberra to Port Augusta. Moreover, it is quite probable that the unemployed at Port Augusta are more accustomed to the local conditions and to the work which is to be made available, than men sent from Canberra could possibly be. There is nothing to show that the men whom it is proposed to send from Canberra are in any way specially qualified for the work. If it were work on which experts should be employed, and such experts were available only in Canberra, there would be something to be said in favour of the Government's proposition, but those conditions do not obtain. As the Leader of the Opposition said, suitable men can be obtained on the SpOt and it is therefore reasonable to ask that they should be employed. I appreciate the Government's difficulty. It ils all Commonwealth work, and Commonwealth  money is to be expended. Naturally, the Commonwealth Government feelsthat it is under a special obligation to its former employees who are at present out of work, but the unemployed men in Canberra are actually  no more the concern of the Commonwealth than are the unemployed men who reside at Port Augusta or in any other part of South Australia. All are Australians, and should receive equal consideration. The men at Port Augusta are closer to the work, and their services could be more readily employed, and at a lower cost to the taxpayers. The intrusion, if one may use the term, of the unemployed of Canberra at Port Augusta is bound to lead to friction with those on the spot who have been deliberately overlooked. The proposed action of the Government also suggests that preferential treatment is being given to those residing in the capital city. A question was asked to-day concerning details of the unemployed as revealed by the latest census figures, and although the reply was that the figures were not available, it would be interesting to know how the proportion of unemployed in the Federal Capital Territory compares with that in the States. Probably it would be found that the percentage of unemployment in Canberra is not so high as it is in some of the States. I do not suggest that there are not difficulties" associated with the problem, or that the Government is not trying to do what it thinks fair; but I do not think that it is prudent or businesslike to do as . the Government suggests. I sincerely trust that the Government will reconsider the matter, and make the work available to those who are experienced, and are already on the spot. </para>

Yesterday the Minister in charge of development <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLachlan)</inline> replied to a question I asked concerning the reported closing down of the Government Experimental Tobacco Farm at Mareeba. The reply by the Minister was to the effect that this farm has been passed over to the control of the State authorities, but I was precluded by the rules of the Senate from making any comment at the time. 1 have before me a paragraph which appeared in the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail,</inline> in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bulcock,</inline> the. Minister for Agriculture and Stock in Queensland, referred to the closing down of the experimental farm ait Mareeba. The paragraph concluded with this sentence - </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">That statement conflicts with the reply given to me by the Minister in Charge of Development. I direct the attention of the Minister in charge of the bill to the contradictory nature of the two statements. </para>
                    <para>I protest against the effect of existing pensions legislation. ' I cannot expect the Government to adopt the Labour party's policy and restore invalid and old-age pensions to the rates and conditions which were in 'force before a reduction was made - which a. majority of Australians believe to be the undoubted right of pensioners- - but I direct the Minister's attention to the practice adopted in dealing with the property of pensioners, and also to amounts pensioners may receive under the present system. It is unreasonable to expect every member of a family seeking employment to be equally successful in industrial life, particularly under the present order of society. One member of a family may be comparatively successful and another meet only with failure. I know a family one female member of which was successful - it may not have been due entirely to individual effort - and could live comfortably without the aid of a pension.  Her  sister, who -had not been so fortunate, needed a pension. The more fortunate, out of kindness of heart, offered to provide a higher standard of comfort for her sister, who undoubtedly deserved it. Because one sister gave the other a home, the department deducted 12s. 6d. from her miserable pension of 17s. 6d. a week. That sort of treatment tends to dry up the springs of private benevolence. I believe that many similar eases have occurred throughout Australia. Immediately a pensioner receives a sum of money, such as a bequest or inheritance, above a small amount, he or she is called upon to submit to a reduction of the pension. The great majority of Australians look upon the old-age pension as a payment to which elderly folk are fully entitled. Under the capitalistic system, all cannot succeed. The success of one man may be due to the failure, through circumstances over which they have no control, of ten others, or, in the case of great financial success, to the failure of a thousand others. I trust that the old system will soon be restored entirely. </para>

                        <para>. - A case recently came under my notice in which an aged couple received a pension of 12s. 6d. a week each. Before the days of the depression, they had accumulated a property which they sold for Â£300; but, unfortunately, they did not receive payment. Occasionally, the purchaser gives them Â£1 or Â£2 by way of interest, but they have no immediate prospect of any payment of the principal. The  Deputy  Commissioner of Taxation informs me that the property is valued at Â£300, and that there is no proof that it is a hopelessly bad debt. Consequently, these pensioners are compelled to submit to a reduction. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. The Government has callously deprived a great number of pensioners of money to which they are justly entitled. If the Ministry hopes to survive at the next election it will have to repeal those provisions of the act which allow the property of  pensioners  to fall into the hands of the department to be used in recouping it for pension payments. Such legislation is disgraceful. It is stated that the provisions relating to contributions by relatives of pensioners are to be repealed, but there are evenworse provisions in the act. 6 </para>

It is a standing disgrace for the Government to claim credit for having made savings, considering that it has remitted taxation to the wealthy sections by robbing the pensioners. Until the present policy of the Government is reversed, there will be no peace in this country. I am happy to state that the pensioners are organized throughout the Commonwealth, and that the number of members of their organization is rapidly increasing. Any conservative senator who wishes to retain the present unjust provisions in the Pensions Act will meet his "Waterloo at an early date. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. The safety of the Commonwealth loan induced investors to rush in their applications for the stock. When State Ministers receive deputations from the' unemployed, they account for iiic meagre allowance for relief works h.v saying that they have only the money which the Loan Council allots to them for that purpose; yet the Postmaster-General boasted recently,' when speaking in connexion with the Martin by-election, that the Government had raised Â£38,000,000 by way of loans in the last ye.ir, and out of that money provision had boon made for relief works in the States. Very few of these works will be nf a reproductive nature, and the fact that they are to be financed out of loan money clearly shows that the  so-called  prosperity is of an unsubstantial nature, and will lead to a greater collapse thanthat from which Australia is supposed to be emerging. Certainly, the expenditure of. loan money on relief works has led. to a temporary revival in some industries; but, if the mere ability to raise moneyby loan is an index to prosperity, Australia should be one of the most prosperous countries in the world. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator probably gauges the prosperity of others by his own success. Although the Government has taken great credit to itself for having pulled Australia out of the depression, a country that relies upon wholesale borrowing can enjoy but a transitory prosperity. To say that unemployment is decreasing under the regime of the present Ministry is merely to express one of those half-truths which, in effect, are worse than lies. The number of unemployed is not decreasing, because there is no justification for regarding as employed every person who receives a few days' work intermittently as the result of the expenditure of loan money. It is useless to attempt to cover up the fact that unemployment is still as bad as it was in the worst days of the depression. <inline font-style="italic">Sitting suspended from 1S.U5 to 2.15 p.m.</inline></para>

                            <para>- We have learned from the newspapers that the Government intends, ' when introducing its budget, to propose the expenditure of two-thirds of its surplus on defence. I take this opportunity to protest against such expenditure at a time when there is noproposal to restore Public Service salariesor the " cuts " made in pensions and in  other social services. While I remain, a member of this Senate, I shall oppose to the limit of my powers any such expenditure on defence. Hundreds of thousands of people in Australia to-day arestruggling to maintain a bare existence,, and the difficulty experienced by householders in balancing their domesticbudgets has not been lightened by the boasted prosperity which for so long has. been "just round the corner," and still remains there. The expenditure on, munitions will be a waste of publicmoney: that criticism applies equally to many other items in the defence votes. We shall have an opportunity later to deal  with such proposals at length. For the time being, I shall content myself with saying that we must keep a keen eye on this expenditure; indeed, I should be glad to have an opportunity to reduce even the amounts provided in this bill for the service of the Defence Department during the next three months. 'I consider that most of the expenditure authorized by the Government has been for the purpose of helping those most able to help themselves, and oppressing those who occupy the lowliest positions in the community. Such a policy can only have the unswerving opposition of any man who styles himself a democrat. </para>

                        said that no provision had been made by the Government for the unemployed, but I remind the honorable senator that the Government included in its last budget a greatly increased provision for unemployment relief as compared with the previous year. In 1932-33, the amount provided for new works from revenue amounted to Â£874,392. In 1933-34, the provision was Â£L,624,8S0. In 1932-33, there was no provision for new works from loans, but in 1933-34, Â£810,000 was provided. Thus the total provision for new works in 1932-33 was Â£874,390 as against Â£2,434,SS0 in 1933-34. These figures re.fute the statement that the Government has been blind to its obligation towards the unemployed, and has done nothing to alleviate their position. This bill is merely to provide for essential services, for three months, based on last year's expenditure.

                    <para>In looking through this bill I find that no provision has been made to relieve the  burden placed upon officers of the Commonwealth Public Service. Those employed at Canberra have lost Â£39 as &amp; result of the cessation of the special allowance, and, with other officers in all parts of the Commonwealth, have during the last three years lost a total of .Â£42 as a result of cost-of-living, adjustments. These reductions were included in the general reduction of salaries which applied to the whole of the Commonwealth Public Service. There was last year a partial restoration, but it amounted to very little. The Government is content to make remissions to the wealthy taxpayers of Australia, especially those in Sydney, and is doing nothing to help the public servants. </para>
                    <para>In connexion with the mail services to the Pacific islands, nothing has been done to assist an Australian steamship company and its employees engaged in that trade. In that company millions of pounds of Australian capital are invested, but it is likely to be forced out of business owing to the suspension of the coasting provisions of the Navigation Act. If they are to be swept away by vessels of the Inchcape line - a line built up by Lord Inchcape from a fortune made out of the sweat and blood of the coolies he employed - the outlook for the white employees of the Australian steamship companies which pioneered the trade is black, indeed. </para>

                            <para>- In the past, a great deal of money has been expended in wrong directions. The Government has given scanty consideration to the poorer classes of the community, which have 'been most severely hit by the depression. The Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Lawson)</inline> says that an increased amount has been provided for public works, with a view to absorbing some of the unemployed, but I submit that the Government has made no proper attempt to deal with the national ills which are the outcome of the depression. It is content to allow things to drift, and from time to time .to offer some temporary relief, such as a dole to the farmers when the price of wheat is low. It has not done anything to prevent a recurrence of a similar national collapse in the future ; but has 'been content with a hand-to-mouth, stop-gap policy of voting a little money here and a little money there in order to grant some small measure of relief to suffering people. Either Parliament is capable of dealing with these problems, or it is not. If Parliament is not capable of dealing with them, it should be honest enough to recognize its impotence, and to seek elsewhere for a remedy. If, however, Parliament considers that it is capable of dealing with the situation, it should set to work to do so. The policy of drift which characterizes the present Government may lead us into insolvency earlier than some of us expect. </para>

                            <para>- The public works policy of the Government will lead us nowhere because, with a few exceptions, the works which are undertaken are not reproductive. Moreover, that policy tends to break down permanently the Australian standard of living. Various organizations and semi-governmental institutions, such as water and sewerage boards and municipal councils, are voted portions of these loan funds for the carrying out of work at the least possible cost and with no regard to arbitration awards. In that way, inroads are being made into the normal and settled rates of wages, hours of labour and other working conditions in this country. In order to grant temporary relief to a few unemployed persons recognized standards are being thrown overboard. </para>

                            <para>- If my criticism of the actions of the Government in the past will lead to an improvement in the future, surely my remarks are justified. Should the Government end the financial year with a surplus it should immediately restore to the public servants the amounts taken from them under the financial emergency legislation. Reductions of salary were made only to meet a financial emergency, and, therefore, with the removal of the cause, no question of 25 per cent. or 50 per cent. restoration should arise; the whole amount taken away should immediately be restored. What confidence can be placed in a government which fails to honour its solemn promise? Apparently the Government does not consider that its promise need be kept merely because no definite date for the restoration was mentioned. It is like a person who, when asked to call at any time, says that he will be round some day, and, merely because no definite date was mentioned, considers that no breach of promise has been committed by his failure to call. </para>

                            <para>- For the most part, they get what is due to them. It is true that certain voluntary loan conversion operations have been undertaken in recent years, and bondholders have made a satisfactory bargain by taking long-term bonds in return for the securities which they surrendered. The fact remains that this Government, which believes in private enterprise, has lived up to its reputation in that respect by affording relief to an enormous extent to large taxpayers while still requiring public servants to suffer salary reductions ranging up to  22Â½  per cent. It has assisted the most prosperous elements in the community at the expense, largely, of public servants and invalid and old-age pensioners. The fact that this percentage deduction is still levied upon public service salaries gives the lead to private employers to treat employees in a like manner, and I know from personal knowledge that the employers are doing this to such an extent that the arbitration law has become a dead  letter.  In New South Wales, shopkeepers and persons controlling big businesses are paying less than award rates. They require their employees to sign dockets for the full amount for  fear  of dismissal. The whole system of arbitration has broken down, largely because of the connivance of this Government and its unjust policy of retaining the emergency deductions made in public service salaries. </para>

My contention is borne out by a statement made recently by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Gullett who attacked the Government on this point. While not claiming to he a financial expert, I affirm with every confidence that the policy that is being pursued by this Government is demoralizing and debasing the Public. Service of this country. By its system of unemployed relief, it is seeking temporarily to camouflage the real position with regard to unemployment. It is not making any serious attempt to tackle the real problem. Unless something is done soon to rectify the position, we shall find ourselves, industrially and otherwise, down to the level of the lowest nation on earth. </para>

                        <para>. - It is my intention to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae's</inline> amendment, but I do not wish to give a silent vote on this matter. I, and I assume other members of my party, would have spoken in a similar strain, but it was understood that the passage of the bill would not be delayed in any way. I agree with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has said. This Government has not made any serious attempts to grapple with the serious problem of unemployment. Instead of taking 100 men from Canberra to Port Augusta, where they are to be provided with work on the East-West railway, it should consider proposals which I have advocated on other occasions in this chamber, namely, the unification of the railway gauges and the building of - a railway to the Northern Territory, via Western Queensland. Those works would provide employment for tens of thousands of men instead of a paltry hundred or so who will be given work on the transcontinental line. I should like to see the division on the amendment taken without delay, so that we may consider the items in the schedule. All members of the Labour party are fully seised of the need for a well considered plan to relieve unemployment, and, as regards the Public Service, we believe that there should be a full restoration of the salary deductions. I may add that, prior to my election to this chamber, I was a public servant in Queensland and suffered a reduction of Â£80 a year under the Moore Government, and there were thousands suffering similar losses. Naturally, I felt bitter about the wholebusiness. That was really one of the reasons why I am now a member of the Senate. </para>

I propose to do so now. I direct the attention of honorable senators to a cable message which appeared in the newspapers of this country a few months ago. It dealt with remarks made by one of the leaders of a trade union congress in India, which is supposed to be one of the most backward of the industrial countries. This official, at the termination of the conference, exhorted his followers to endeavour to retain whatever rights they possessed, otherwise, he said they would soon find themselves reduced to the coolie level of the Australian workers ! That clearly indicates what other people think of the condition of the working classes in Australia. </para>

Australia and Papua and the Mandated Territory, to the detriment of Burns Philp andCompany, which pioneered the trade with the Pacific Islands and developed it to a remarkable degree. The unfair competition with which that company has to contend is seriously affecting its operations in the Pacific. The steamers under the control of Burns Philp and Company which trade between Australia, Papua, the Mandated Territory, and the Solomon Islands are manned by white crews, whereas the vessels now conducting cruises to the South Sea Islands, and with which they have to compete, are worked by coloured labour. The men employed on the Burns Philp steamers are working under awards of the Federal Arbitration Court, while the owners of the vessels with which they are competing are not subject to the awards of that court. These overseas companies first commenced by conducting a pleasure cruise from Australia to Port Moresby, but they have since extended their opera- tions to Samarai, and according to the latest information available their ships are now to visit Rabaul. </para>

                    <para>.- It is most refreshing to hear the leader of the Lang Labour party in this chamber trying to "grease the fat pig." I do not know what he has in mind, because every one knows that Burns Philp and Company, which is providing a magnificent service to the Mandated Territory of New Guinea and elsewhere, is in a sound financial position. One has only to look at the current values of the company's shares, and to study the dividends paid, to see that it is a prosperous company. It deserves to be prosperous, because of the service which it renders to the community, and because of the attention which it gives to its ships. Not. long ago, I applied for a passage from Australia to New Guinea on one of the Burns Philp boats, and although I tried to book a berth five weeks before I proposed to sail, I was informed that the ship was full. I applied twice subsequently, and each time was told that there was no room, which shows that the other vessels engaged in the trade are not interfering with the operations of Burns Philp and Company. My experience shows that the trade is prosperous, and that is possibly due to the excellent service which Burns Philp and Company is rendering, and to the manner in which it is assisting, in the development of the Mandated Territory and the Pacific Islands generally. I am glad to learn that other vessels are carrying passengers to the Mandated Territory, because I believe that there is room for them all. ' I am particularly anxious that New Guinea shall become more popular with tourists. The Australian people cannot have any idea of its potentialities and what it means to Australia, unless they visit it. It is ridiculous to suggest that Burns Philp and Company is being ruined by the advent of other vessels, when their ships are crowded on every trip. I cannot understand the attitude of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn,</inline> who usually denounces the activities of those engaged in private enterprise. </para>

                    <para>[3.7]. - Having recently assumed Ministerial control of the territories mentioned on behalf of the Prime Minister, I am glad that attention has been directed to them. I am reminded that from the 9 th November, 1931, Burns Philp and Company agreed to reduce the payment under the contract for providing shipping and mail service to the Pacific Islands, from Â£55,000 to Â£44,000 - a reduction of 20 per cent. That reduction was made when the financial crisis was at its peak and when others were making substantial sacrifices in an endeavour to meet the situation which then existed. I have noted what has been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dunn</inline> and will inform my mind concerning the actual position. I shall, if necessary, confer with the honorable senator on the subject. </para>

                    <para>.  - Provision is made in the schedule for the expenditure of Â£29,400 for salaries and general expenses in connexion with the electoral office. I trust that honorable senators will not accuse me of having what is sometimes termed a " bug " in regard to this matter. If we can suggest an improvement in the present electoral system we should do so. For over twelve years, J have been studying the working of the preferential system of voting adopted in connexion with federal elections, and I have made suggestions for its improvement in this chamber from time to time. On one occasion <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Reid</inline> agreed with the proposal I made that different political parties should have the right to arrange their candidates within the group as they desired, instead of in alphabetical order as is necessary under the electoral law. If the candidates nominated by a particular party were named, say, Anderson, Jones and Murphy, their names would, under the present law, appear on the ballot paper in that order, notwithstanding that the party might wish Murphy's name to appear first. If the different political parties were permitted to group their candidates and one party wished to place Murphy at the top of the group it could do so. In Queensland, where the Labour party operates the plebiscite system, it was found unsatisfactory to be compelled by law to place the names in the order determined by the electoral law. We should have the right to place them in the order we desired. This is not a party matter and the alteration I suggest would increase the success of the preferential system of voting. A good deal of expenditure is incurred in conducting the electoral office and those in authority should be asked to submit proposals to improve the present preferential system. </para>

                <para class="block">It has been said frequently that political parties endeavour to secure suitable candidates whose surnames commence with the letter " A " because of the supposed advantage such a candidate would enjoy in having his name placed at the top of the ballot-paper. In a recent political ballot, I noticed that out of 25 candidates the names of no fewer than eight began with the letter " B " It is imagined that because of the position of " B in the alphabet, the plebiscite selectors will prefer men whose names begin with that letter, because, having their names at the cop of the ballot-papers, they think they will be placed at the top of the ballot paper and thus have the best chance of election. The electoral officers should give serious consideration to this matter. I suggest that a better system would Joe to choose by lot the party whose representatives should be named at the top of the ballot paper. This selection could be undertaken by the electoral officers in the various States. I was glad to hear the Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Pearce)</inline> mention that action is likely to be taken to amend the present electoral law. </para>

                    <para>. - I propose to reply to the criticism offered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne,</inline> who, referring to my claim for the protection of the white Australians engaged in the coastal shipping trade, said that I was advocating " the greasing of the fat pig". The members of the marine trades industrial group in Sydney are much concerned about the sabotaging of the coastal steamship companies by the overser.3. companies. So far as Lord Inchcape's control of the shares in the latter companies is concerned, I have no entree to those select clubs and circles which are open to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne.</inline> I am not aware of the whole of the ramifications of " Comrade " Inchcape, or any other industrial go-getters. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne,</inline> of course, is in close contact with the commercial houses of London and Japan, which are interested in cheap labour. The Australian steamship companies employ white officers and white crews, and I am pleased to have the assurance of the Minister that he will investigate their disabilities. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> comes from Tasmania, where, I am proud to say, a Labour Government was recently returned to office. I am not ashamed to place on record in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the fact that one of the planks of Labour policy is the socialization or nationalization of the Australian shipping trade. Part of the policy of the ex-Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> when he swept the polls in Tasmania, was the provision of a national steamship service between Tasmania and the mainland. </para>

                <para>The crews, of the <inline font-style="italic">Aorangi</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Niagara,</inline> of the Union Steamship Company are Australians. . They total 600 and the wages and overtime paid yearly amount to approximately Â£60,000. Each time either ship comes into port, about 750 men are employed in getting the vessel ready for sea for the following voyage, and the two ships visit Sydney thirteen times a year. The expenditure in Sydney during the twelve months in wharf labour, repairs, stores, docking, &amp;c, amounts to about Â£81,000. A similar circulation of money occurs in Australia as a result of the operations of other coastal steamship companies. For instance, Burns Philp and Company, which trades to Papua, the Mandated Territory of New Guinea, and the Solomons, employs white crews who are employed under awards of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. Incidentally, I am of opinion that the standard of living provided for by that court should be improved. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Payne</inline> is in favour of Japanese and other coloured labour manning the ships that trade to this country, so it is idle for him to say that the members of my party stand for the greasing of the fat pig. It is true that private enterprise controls the coastal steamship companies, but they give employment to thousands of Australians, and their work results in the expenditure in Australia of hundreds of thousands of pounds a year. I refer to the operations of the Union Steamship Company, Burns Philp and Company, the Adelaide Steamship Company, Huddart Parker Company, Howard Smith Company, and the Australian Steamship Company. These companies are being forced into competition with overseas shipping lines, and many of their vessels are tied up from time to time, with the result that Australian seamen have to walk "the streets and live on the dole. I hope that the Government will lose no time in taking steps to remedy this evil. </para>

                    <para>. - I was interested in what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MacDonald</inline> said about the grouping of the candidates on the ballot-paper.  His  suggestion reminded me of the fact that in the last election for Adelaide a gentleman whose name began with Z was unfortunate enough to be at the bottom, of the poll. That would appear to lend support to the contention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MacDonald</inline> that a man whose name begins with the letter A has a better chance at the ballot box than has a man whole name begins with, say, the letter J. In the case to which I have referred, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Z</inline> secured only 655 votes out of a total of 431,634 votes; but he lost his deposit not so much 'because of his name as because of his political views. He was a Communist. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MacDonald</inline> might be well advised to begin his reforms with his own party, before be asks Parliament to agree to abandon the present system of listing alphabetically the names on the ballot paper. Only a year ago, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Yates</inline> failed in an election for the South Australian Legislative Council, being beaten by a candidate whose name commenced with 0. I understand that it is a rule of the Labour party that when two or more of its candidates contest the same election their names shall appear on the ballot paper in alphabetical order. </para>

                    <para class="block">The purpose of this bill is to furnish the Government with a means of carrying into effect certain provisions of the trade agreement concluded with New Zealand last year, and ratified in this Parliament towards the close of last session. Article 9 of that agreement contains a reciprocal provision which, in short, recognizes the right of New Zealand to ask Australia to admit goods from that dominion at the same rates of duty as New Zealand applies to the like Australian goods, and vice  versa. If Australia fails to comply with a New Zealand request, of this kind within three months, New Zealand is at liberty to raise its tariff on the goods covered 'by the request to the level of the Australian rates on the like New Zealand goods. The agreement with New Zealand contains two schedules. One specifies the actual rates of duty payable in New Zealand on a long list of Australian products. The other sets out the specific duties payable in Australia oh a list of New Zealand products. These lists cover the classes of goods of chief interest to the two dominions. In regard to the remaining classes of goods, that is, the residual items in the respective tariff schedules, the agreement provides that they shall be subject to the rates of duty imposed under the respective British preferential tariffs of the two dominions. Article <inline font-style="italic">9</inline> deals only with the goods not specifically mentioned in the schedules to the agreement, and it is to goods falling within this category that the bill now before honorable senators refers. This provision was practically insisted on by New Zealand for the reason that the level of the Australian British preferential tariff is higher than the level of the New Zealand preferential tariff, and, therefore, a mere exchange of British preferential tariff rates was inequitable. During the time Parliament has been in recess, New Zealand has requested that it be accorded rates equivalent to the New Zealand British preferential tariff on three lines of goods. In the absence of any enabling provisions in the Customs Tariff (New Zealand Preference)  1933,  we had to ask New Zealand to await the re-assembling of Parliament, when immediate action would be taken to comply with its requests. The exports to New Zealand in all three lines are considerable, and Australia would be distinctly the loser if the dominion exercised its right and raised the duty against Australia in the event of non-compliance within the three months allowed by the agreement. </para>
                    <para>The proposed amendment provides the machinery to enable requests of this nature from New Zealand to be met promptly. Delays in compliance lead to friction. New Zealand is a very valuable outlet for many classes of Australian goods. It is desirable to develop a spirit of reciprocity in the trade relations with our sister dominion. Without some general provision such as  ib  proposed in this bill, circumstances will arise in which it will not be possible to comply with the requests within the three months allowed, and we cannot reasonably ask New Zealand to meet our convenience on future occasions. The growing extent of Australia's trade with New Zealand in the three lines to which I have referred will be seen from the fact that the value of the exports to the dominion of knitted or locks tiitched piece goods of silk or artificial silk amounted to  Â£498  in  1930 ; Â£11,592  in  1931 ; Â£21,498  in  1932 ;  and  Â£35,717  in  1933.  Australian exports to New Zealand of wireless broadcast receiving sets, not mounted in cabinets, were valued at  Â£5,343  in  1930, Â£4,136  in  1931,  and  Â£37,114  in  1932.  Dry batteries and dry cells to the value of  Â£4,090, Â£11,838,  and  Â£34,807,  respectively, were exported to New Zealand in the same years. I assure the Senate that this is merely a machinery measure, which is in accordance with the spirit of the agreement which has already been adopted. In drafting the measure certain items were overlooked. </para>

                        <para>.- I accept the Minister's assurance that this is a machinery measure which will benefit Australia. When arrangements for reciprocal trade between the two dominions were being considered, I endeavoured to get something done in connexion with sporting ammunition, which was being manufactured in Melbourne. The Minister was good enough to say then that he thought the matter could be arranged in future negotiations with the Government of New Zealand. I should be glad to know if anything has been done in that direction. </para>
