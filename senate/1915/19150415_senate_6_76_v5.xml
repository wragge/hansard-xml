                            <para>- I wish to ask your ruling, sir, and I trust it will be understood that it is not only on this particular question that I am raising the point. Our Standing Orders enable us to ask questions without notice at one stage of the proceedings. Having proceeded to the business of the day, we are entitled to ask questions of which notice has been given, and I should like your ruling as to whether it is in order immediately to proceed to interrogate Ministers by questions of which no notice has been p-iven, on the excuse or with the justification that they arise out of the answers given. I submit that that practice, if allowed, would enable honorable senators to go on pounding Ministers with question after question of which no notice had been given, to the violation of the spirit, if not the letter, of our Standing Orders. </para>

                    <para>The  PRESIDENT. -   Yes. It has been the practice to allow a further question arising out of the answer to elucidate the matter, and within reasonable limits I see no objection to that practice. It is the course I have hitherto pursued, and shall continue to pursue. It would not be possible to continually pound Ministers with questions, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> suggests, so long as only questions legitimately arising out of the Ministerial answers were allowed to be put. I shall allow further questions to be put if they are strictly legitimate, and arise definitely out of the answer already given to a question. </para>

                        <para>It is presumed that the honorable senator&#39;s question has reference to the tenders which were invited in October last for the supply of 14,000 tons of coal for delivery at Fremantle. I have been advised by the Engineer- in-Chief for Commonwealth Railways that the coal in question was required for storage and general stand-by, and that Collie coal is not suitable for storage purposes. It is fully intended to use Collie coal wherever practicable and wherever regarded as being suitable by the Departmental experts. I may mention that the Western Australian Government imports from New South Wales about one-third of its coal requirements. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like to remind honorable senators, by way of preface, that, although this is actually a continuation of the session commenced in the autumn of last year, it is, for all practical purposes, the beginning of a new session. It was necessary, in the circumstances in which the Government found themselves situated, that Parliament should be kept in a position to be called together at any moment. But for that, the session would have closed in the ordinary way, and we should now have been meeting, as. in  fact  we are, at the commencement of a new session. It is for that reason, I presume, that the Government have seen fit to present to this Chamber the statement which we are now considering, and the Minister has moved that that paper should be printed, not because he desires it to be printed any more than it has already been printed, but in order to provide honorable senators with the opportunity which would have been theirs had the session been opened in the ordinary way by a debate on the Address from the Throne. </para>

                        <para>- It is. But the adjournment of Parliament was merely a device adopted to enable the Government to call Parliament together ac any moment if circumstances rendered that course necessary. We are, therefore, practically commencing a new session. At such a time, it is usual for honorable senators, and especially for members of the Opposition, to embrace the opportunity of reviewing the administrative acts of the Government during the recess, and of directing some attention to the programme for the session. When we met here at the commencement of this session, I was the recipient of more than a doubtful compliment from the Minister of Defence. H&#169; paid me the compliment of having been brief in my remarks. I am willing to accept that compliment. It is one which is not too often heard in legislative halls. But he went on to say that it was one of the most pleasant speeches he had ever listened to from my lips in this Parliament. I am not quite certain that that compliment was entitled to be placed in any other category than that of reproach. But, whether it was a compliment or a reproach, I am afraid that I shall render myself liable to a repetition of it on this occasion. When we met on the occasion to which I have referred, we were then, as now, meeting with the knowledge that the one matter which transcended all others in importance - which was filling our minds to the exclusion of all others - was the great war, in which is involved the fate of the Empire. The position is exactly the same to-day. It is true that a certain period has elapsed which has enabled us to adjust our ideas a little more accurately, but the fact remains that this war is still undecided. The reasons which then induced me to refrain from anything in the nature of a critical examination of the Government programme, or to venture a reference to its administrative acts, are those which prompt m&#169; to-day to adopt a similar course - as, indeed, they ought to prompt any public man with a full sense of his responsibilities. Therefore, I do not propose to occupy the time of the Senate for more than a few minutes. This war still overshadows us, and, in comparison with its vital importance, all other matters which at ordinary times might excite our interest, or appeal very strongly to our reason, sink into absolute insignificance. I candidly confess that I find it extremely difficult to interest myself in those other matters. I believe that in saying that I am merely expressing the&#39; attitude of the general citizen of this country. It is to me inconceivable that honorable senators can address themselves with any seriousness to quite insignificant &#39; matters when at the present moment the fate of the Empire is undecided. </para>

                        <para>- So far as they are connected with the war, they are matters which should receive our attention. But I am not referring to them. Seeing that the situation to-day is the same as it was then, I feel that it is only necessary for me to repeat the assurance which was then given. I can repeat it with all the more emphasis to-day, because that assurance has been already given by a higher authority&#39; in the party than myself - by the Leader of the Opposition - and I venture to say that it has been buttressed by the action of the Opposition ever since the advent of the present Government to power. The Government are assured of the hearty co-operation of the Opposition in anything they may do to assist in carrying the war to a successful conclusion. In saying that, I do not merely mean that assistance will be given to them in any action which they may take here. I go further, and say that the Opposition will be found disposed to give the Government the fullest powers for which they may feel called upon to ask, and will consider it its duty not to pass too closely under review their administrative acts, or to criticise  them  too minutely. Before passing from this matter may I say that I read with considerable pleasure the intimation in the Ministerial statement that the .Government are disposed to take a somewhat brighter view of the outlook of the war than apparently they felt justified in doing when this Parliament met a few months* ago&#39;. There are indications in the statement - prompted, I presume, by official communications with the Home authorities/ - that matters in connexion with the war are proceeding, if slowly and painfully, still satisfactorily. We have been induced to hope so much from the news which has come -to us in scanty form through the newspapers, that it is a gratification to us all to find that there is throughout the paragraphs of the statement read here yesterday a distinctly optimistic note. There is one phrase used in it to which I should like specially to refer - </para>

                        <para>- I am not saying that we are not, and the honorable senator cannot assume from anything I have said that that is the view I take. I trust that the speeches which will be made in this Parliament in connexion with the? war will be designed as much for the encouragement of public opinion as- for any influence they may be expected to have upon members of the Parliament. I have said that in my view the war overshadows everything else, and it is for that reason I distinctly regret the announcement made by the Minister of Defence in reply to an interjection of mine in which he made it quite clear that it is the intention of the Government to proceed with their full party programme this session. That statement, whilst having all the authority of a Ministerial statement, has also been given to the country, though not in such a decisive form, by other members of the Ministry, and particularly by the Prime Minister. Yesterday an interjection was made hene, I believe by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator de</inline> Largie, to the effect that there is no party now. Might I suggest to tha Government, and to honorable senators, that the cessation of party warfare in the presence of this overwhelming crisis muse surely be reciprocal. There cannot be a cessation of party warfare by one side simply ceasing to try to give &#39;effect to its political views, whilst the other side insists on giving effect in the fullest extent to the political views it holds. </para>

                        <para>- I ,am glad to get that interjection, because I should like to say that we are to-day faced with an entirely different position. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Needham</inline> refers to the proposal to abandon the elections, it was clearly shown at the time that there was no constitutional or legal means by which that could have been done. The question whether the people should choose those into whose1 hands they wished to give the administration of the country was one thing, but, the people having made their choice, the question whether&#39; Parliament should <inline font-style="italic">h&#38;</inline> called upon to devote all its energies, capacity, and patriotism to a united effort to . strengthen the hands of the Government in dealing with the big matters which now call for attention, or whether it should be compelled by the action of the members of the Government themselves to become the arena of heated1 party controversy is an entirely different thing. </para>

                        <para>- So am I. I have given my justification for the interpretation I placed upon it. The Ministerial statement which is before us admits that we are not, to-day, somewhat slightly interested relatives of Great Britain trying to help her in a struggle that is hers, but refers to the struggle that is taking place as &#34; our war.&#34; And it is our war. That being the case, may I appeal to honorable senators to, as far as they can, put the Government in the best possible position to prosecute their portion of the. efforts made to carry the war to a successful conclusion. What is the position to-day? There is no one who lias had even a few months&#39; parliamentary experience who will for a moment dispute the statement that there is sufficient work to be done in connexion with the war to exhaust the energy, and demand the most minute attention, of the most active Ministers who ever held office. </para>

                        <para>- I quite understand that there is a  type  of mind which cannot for a moment recognise seriousness in an opponent, and that is unable to be serious itself in the consideration of even the most important questions. I aru entitled to put the position before the Senate, and I say that no one will venture to contradict the statement that matters arising out of the war are of sufficient magnitude and frequency to demand every moment of. Ministerial time. If there is any member of the Ministry who should be free to deal with these matters, he is, not even excepting the Prime Minister, the Minister in charge of the Defence Department. I am speaking with a knowledge of what happened during the first months of the war. Though we may assume that matters have to some extent fallen into a beaten track, there must be still a thousand and one new problems coming up for consideration by the Minister of Defence. In the circumstances it is, to my mind, little less than criminal that the mau charged with the conduct of our Expeditionary Forces, and the many matters involved in the control of the Defence Department during the present crisis, should be spending a single moment at the Minister&#39;s table opposite to me in this chamber. The Opposition have offered to place the Government m possession of the fullest powers for which they think it necessary to ask for the purpose of prosecuting the war. </para>

                        <para>- It is nob a matter of generosity at all. I want to bring home to honorable senators opposite, and to Ministers themselves, this fact, that in my judgment Parliament ought not to have been called together to deal with anything except matters arising out of the war, and that beyond that Ministers should be set as free as possible to devote their energies and their time to the prosecution of this war. What has been done elsewhere? That is the course that has been followed in Great Britain. The Prime Minister there, speaking recently about the matter, said he assumed that any other course than that to which I refer would be received with a considerable feeling of anger by the people and the parties. In Great Britain, Parliament meets and passes the necessary war legislation, granting the Government the fullest powers possible, with the result that the Government there is in the position of an autocrat by reason of the power accorded to it by the united Parliament. </para>

It does not appear to be at all reasonable, nor does it indicate anything in the nature of statesmanship,  that the Government should use these immunities for the purposes of party propaganda. Not only would the Government be clothed with the fullest powers, but they would have the assurance that their political opponents would not be too  critical of them in the exercise of those powers. Except in regard to the necessary legislation which we are bound to pass. Ministers should be set free from attendance in Parliament, and the harassment which must follow a heated party session. There is that alternative before the Government, and, according to the choice which they make, the country will be able to determine from the result whether they have been successful in placing the interests of the Empire before the interests of party. </para>

                <para>There are two or three quite  minor matters which arise out of the presentation of this document. The first is the publication of a list of figures as to the number of troops sent abroad and in training. I hope that the presence of this document and of those figures is indicative of the obligation resting upon the Government to adopt a more reasonable rule in regard to censorship than that previously existing. Not long ago, the military authorities were insisting that it was little short of criminal to disclose any figures at all connected with the movement of our troops, and in many other ways they imposed on the journals of this country measures of restriction in excess of the needs of the case. </para>

                        <para>- I am not going too closely into the details, but there were other reasons which animated the authorities in declaring that no newspapers should give particulars as to the numbers of the troops. Even if a parade took place in the city, newspapers were prohibited from giving any particulars,, and that, I say, was carrying the thing to a ridiculous extent. I am hopeful that time, experience, and calmer judgment will induce the authorities to relax their restrictions. I do not say that, we should publish information which would be of use to the enemy, but the temperament of the Australian people is; such that they would resent any refusal to give information the publication of which would not be detrimental in tha public interest. </para>

                <para>There is one other matter to which I want to refer, and, next to the war, it is the most serious question with which we are confronted. It is closely connected with the war. I refer to the matter of finance. We shall have shortly an opportunity, on the presentation of the Budget, or of a Supply Bill, to go more fully into the matter; therefore, I propose only to indicate one or two aspects which are of a disquieting nature. It is evident that our expenditure has gone up beyond the anticipations of a few months ago. I am merely stating the fact, not criticising the expenditure, as indicating the financial responsibility we shall have to face before long. The point that I wish to bring before the Senate, as showing the seriousness of the position, is that not a single penny of the war expenditure has yet been found by Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; but there is a difference between what a man or a country borrows to-day and what it may be called upon to repay when the loan becomes due. We are incurring a liability which will add to our annual outlay later on, and we are nob receiving sufficient income to meet our ordinary expenditure. As we are not paying anything towards the cost of the war, and shall have to do so eventually, the position is this : that our annual income being insufficient to-day to meet our expenditure, when we add to it the amount that will be involved in the redemption of the loan, we shall find ourselves confronted with very serious financial difficulties. </para>

                        <para>- I have no doubt that an indemnity will be demanded, and if the matter rested in my hands, I would see that the amount was so heavy that those who brought about this outrageous war would not be anxious to repeat it at an early date. In my opinion, no indemnity can be placed on any nation to-day which will in any way meet the cost of the war; the figures are too big. </para>

                        <para>- The only objection I raised last session to the proposed additional taxation was that not a single penny of it was to go to meet the cost of the war. I never discussed the merits of the new taxes, but what I did was to point out then, as I do now, that, so far, we have not done a single thing to raise a penny towards meeting the cost of the wax; in other words, we are financing the war out of borrowed money. I am making no objection to that, and I do not know that anything else could have been done. My purpose in referring to the matter was merely to point out that on the termination of the war, instead of borrowing money, we will have to pay back at least some portion of what we have borrowed. Remembering also that there is a deficiency to-day between ordinary revenue and expenditure, it does occur to me that the financial position ahead is one which is gloomy in the extreme. </para>

The Minister of Defence has just admitted that the Government will have to redeem the loan of &#163;10,000,000 from the banks. I conceive - that we are entitled to still keep this problem in view in order that we  shall  balance matters as far as we can see mentally in considering what action we are to take in the future. I want to point out that, apart from the assistance of the Imperial authorities which has been for the purpose of financing the war, the key to the Government&#39;s finance has been the note issue; there is no question about that. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, the Commonwealth Government could have commandeered the gold in the banks, and, as a last resort, they would be entitled to tlo it. In a national emergency I do not question the power of the Government to do anything. &#39; I am not dealing with that issue now, but am pointing out, first, that the key of the Government&#39;s finance was first the issue of the notes; and, second, that this document contains an admission by the Government that the notes by themselves would have been of little value. It is the action and the cooperation of the banks, with their supply of gold, which has enabled the Government to use the Notes Fund as advantageously as they have done. </para>

                        <para>- Where would the Commonwealth Government have been but for the banks? This document admits that the Notes Fund could not have been used in the manner indicated but for this vitalizing influence supplied by the banks. It is not the Government who are assisting the banks to-day, but the banks which, on the admission of this document, have been enabling the Government to impart to the Notes Fund <inline font-style="italic">an</inline> extent of usefulness which would have been entirely absent but for the cooperation of the banks. The financial obligations will intensify as time goes on. On the other hand, our resources for meeting them, so far as the Notes Fund is concerned, are, as I think I will show from this document and other sources, nearly exhausted. Some honorable senators may argue that by drawing further on the supply of gold we could place the Government in a position to issue a further amount of notes, but I think it is quite evident to those who have read this document that even the Government recognise that they have reached the limit at which notes can be safely issued. According to this document, the Government have just now not only borrowed from the Imperial authorities for the purposes of the war, but have borrowed &#163;3,500,000 from them for the purpose of carrying on public works. If the Government were in a position to issue an additional amount of notes with- safety, there was, I submit; no reason why they should have gone to the Imperial authorities for money for any purpose outside the prosecution of the war. But the fact that they have borrowed for public works to the extent of &#163;3.500,000 is, I think, va recognition by the Government that they cannot pursue the policy of issuing notes to an unlimited extent, and  that  they are getting sufficiently near the margin of safety to render it prudent on their part to call a halt, and look elsewhere for the money they need for public works. That seems to me to be the position, and I am not alone in that view. In reading the accounts of the Political Labour League&#39;s Conference at Sydney, I noticed that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman,</inline> in discussing that interesting document - the Norton-Griffiths agreement - referred to the claim of those present that the note issue could be exploited to a greater extent. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman</inline> said &#34; he did not believe in the issue of a large amount of paper money beyond a certain limit, and that limit was fast being approached.&#34; I think that he&#34; was stating a simple fact. In my opinion, this document shows that the Government themselves recognise that they cannot proceed along the road which they have travelled to a much greater extent, otherwise they would surely abstain from borrowing, not for defence, which I put in a different category, but for the purpose of public works in Australia, if they had the money available from the Notes Fund ? </para>

                        <para>- The Government to-day are entitled to call up 7,000,000 sovereigns from the banks. With that gold in the Treasury, the Government would be entitled to issue &#163;28,000,000 worth of paper money. If the note issue is capable of an unlimited extension, the Government, instead of borrowing &#163;3,500,000 from the Imperial authorities for public works, could have used the money in the Notes Fund for the purpose of carrying on public works. I am not quarrelling with what Ministers are doing. I think that they show a proper recognition of the facts of the situation when they recognise that we cannot go on issuing notes to an unlimited extent. </para>

                        <para>- The sole purpose of my observations has been to try to bring home to honorable senators that today we are  financially  in a position which is going to call for the most careful thought and the most prudent action on the part of those charged with the responsibility of managing our affairs.  That is the position, and I do not know that, I have said a single word to which honorable senators, if they are prepared to dispossess themselves for a moment of party prejudices, can take any exception. It appears to me that the big national questions for the moment - the war and its financial problems - are going to make the heaviest demand on our administrators, and, in spite of what they can do, I venture to say that, without the hearty co-operation of all sections of the community, and loyalty on the part of both private and public men in rallying together to endeavour to face the trials ahead, we shall find, not merely our parliamentary concerns, but our national affairs, in a very parlous condition indeed. At any rate, no harm can be done in considering them as far as we possibly can before we are called upon to deal with them. I have invited the Government&#39;s consideration as to whether even now, at the eleventh hour, they would not be better advised to try to limit our work here to those matters which are associated with the war, in order that Ministers could have their hands free for administrative purposes, in order that they could absolutely shut out all party feeling from the walls of Parliament, and assure themselves of the hearty support and cooperation of those who ordinarily are opposed to them. I still think that there should be made known outside as widely as possible the serious results which are attendant upon the war. and in consequence of that there will be a continuation of that intention and determination to support the Government in anything they can do to see that Australia  loyally  and  energetically  discharges the obligation in respect to the war which she has taken upon herself. </para>

                    <para>. - I feel that I echo the feelings of honorable senators present when I say that we are thankful to the Government for giving us this informal opportunity to express our opinions on matters as they have developed during the long adjournment. The statement submitted to us takes the place of the ordinary Address-in-Reply, and although I am not, and never have been, an admirer of that obsolete practice, still I think on the present occasion, owing to the exceptionally trying experience through which we are passing, there is every reason for us to be glad that the Government have given, us an opportunity to discuss the events that have taken place since we last met here. I was pleased to hear the friendly note sounded at the beginning and end of the Leader of the Opposition&#39;s speech, but unfortunately he fell away from that high standard in the middle of his address. He began well, and finished well, but, while he did not actually commit himself to a hostile form of criticism, he certainly indicated his displeasure at the course that the Government propose to&#187; take in adhering strictly to the letter of the programme laid down by them when first intrusted with the reins of office. The Government would he false to their pledges unless they tried to make some headway with the programme on which they were elected. </para>

                        <para>- Independent of the circumstances. It is quite true that it would be of great advantage to the Leader of the Opposition to secure a truce on all matters affecting the public welfare while the war was in progress, because so long as things remain as they are he and his party will score all the time. Those gentlemen are here, sir, with the object of bringing about the former order of things. Every day on which they succeed in maintaining the <inline font-style="italic">status quo</inline> is to them a day of victory. They and their party want to stand still, and it is, therefore, only natural that they should ask for a truce, so that they may avoid as long as possible putting to the test those measures which we, at all events, feel to be in the interests of the bulk of the people. With the Lea der of the Opposition, I recognise that Australia, in common with every other civilized nation in the world - and also Germany - is engaged in one of the most terrible struggles recorded in human history. . It is incumbent upon us, who belong to  that great Empire which has taken up the cudgels on behalf of right and justice, to make every effort to bring the war to a glorious conclusion. I am sure that what the Government have done may be taken as an earnest of what  they  are prepared to do until the exertions of the Allies are crowned with success. We can well draw a big lesson from this war. It is very necessary that we should bend all our energies and exhaust all our resources to see that the arms of the Mother Country and her Allies are strengthened in this struggle, and this is, therefore, no time to talk about remedies for future cases. This is hardly the occasion to dogmatize, or experiment, or to talk about what may happen if ever such another monumental exhibition of human folly is given as we have seen during the last seven or eight months; but I honestly believe that the time lias come when all the nations that claim to be civilized should radically remodel their ideas as to the way in which wars  should  be undertaken, if we are ever pressed to such a cruel necessity. </para>

                <para>Up to the present, owing to our peculiar methods of government, and the insidious influences which strong personalities and parties are able to exercise in different countries, the voice of the people has not been heard on the question of the declaration of war. In order to bring about a radical change in that regard, it is absolutely necessary that we should come to some common understanding as to how war should be declared in the future. My proposal is that the nations which claim to be civilized should agree not to associate with any other nation unless that nation is prepared to consult the bulk of its adult population on the question of whether war should be entered upon. </para>

                        <para>- There is hardly a proposal or expedient that has been offered since deliberative assemblies began but some ingenious critic like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has pointed out its imaginary weaknesses, and predicted that something fatal might happen if something else happened previously. A slip-shod attempt was made by the nations in the past to bring about this peaceful order of things by the establishment of The Hague Conference, where the nations had informal talks as to what should be done to minimize, if not altogether prevent, the horrors of war. That expedient was attended with very little success. If the British Empire, which claims to be a Democracy, and the United States, which is a Democracy in theory if not in practice, agreed to enter into no league or treaty with any other country unless it agreed not to declare war until its adult population  had been consulted, a solid advance would be made. This might be said to be impracticable, but it is worth trying, because our methods up to the present have proved a hopeless failure. Representative government has been cast to the winds, and a very important element in the political life of one of the enemy countries has had its views, if not actually stifled, at least not heard in the counsels of its country. The Socialists in Germany have been silenced or submerged. If any of the enemy countries had previously been warned that to enter upon a war without first consulting its adult population would lead to its being annihilated by a league of all the other civilized nations, the present disastrous conflict would probably never have taken place. I look forward to a strong union of nations like Great Britain, America, and France, which will give concrete expression to my idea, but until that time comes we can never expect that absolute cessation of war which every person who loves his kind desires. It is clear that such a policy would allow the play of reason to operate, and the animal passions that inhere so much in our nature would not be permitted to predominate. All the civilized nations of the world, if they joined together for this purpose, could force their views upon any other nation. I entertain the liveliest hopes that the present war will be brought to a successful issue, though I realize that we are not yet near the end. A long and weary track has still to be passed over, but having started with the first essential in any fight - a just cause - we believe that we shall succeed in the long run. </para>

                <para>The Leader of the Opposition expressed the very hearty hope that a party truce would be arrived at in substance. That is a very laudable opinion for him to express at any time, because no person wishes to see the two parties at handgrips in this chamber, even though one is a big party and the other a very small one, at a time like the present; but, unfortunately, the honorable senator and his party have not set the worthy example which they want the Ministerial party to follow. If the Opposition set the example they will be entitled to exhort the Ministerial party to do what they have done. The honorable senator alluded to what had been done in the Old Country, and urged that, as was done there, Parliament should not be called together except to deal with matters arising out of the war. That practice has certainly been followed in the Old Country, but it &#34;has been carried much further, for there the Opposition have religiously abstained from entering into any political contest where the retiring candidate was a Ministerialist. Unfortunately, the Opposition in this country, who now want the Ministerial party to mark time, made the first declaration of war on their own part when they decided to contest every seat held by the Ministerial party that could be contested up to date. </para>

If there be any loophole for escape under the sun, or under the moon, or under the earth, we may be sure that the agility of the honorable senator will enable him to get through ft. If the Opposition had been sincerely desirous of squaring precept with practice, they would have refrained from contesting those two seats, just as did the Opposition in the Old Country, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> would then have been justified in making the appeal which he made this afternoon.

                <para>There is another feature of the present position to which I feel called upon to refer. Hitherto, the party which now occupies the Ministerial benches have been systematically taunted with a want, of loyalty to the Mother Country. Our opponents have frequently gone out of their way to question our devotion to the British Empire. Of late, it is true, they have abandoned these attacks, but only because the people of Australia, having listened to that fairy tale so long, now turn a deaf ear to the libel. But how has our loyalty endured the supreme test to which it has been put by the present war ? We find that the party with which I am associated has not only proved equal in patriotism to our political opponents, but that it has risen superior to them on every occasion. Recently, figures were compiled by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs,</inline> the Commonwealth Statistician, which show the number of trade unionists who&#34; are now serving with, our Expeditionary Forces abroad. According to those figures, the total number of unionists in the Commonwealth who are eligible for service are either with our Expeditionary Forces abroad, or who are in active training for such service, amounts to 6| per cent.&#39;, whereas the number of non-unionists and of persons generally who are not favorable to our policy- </para>

                        <para>- It is about time that attention was drawn to these facts. If public attention is not now riveted upon the monstrous libel which has been circulated for years and years, that the Labour party is deficient in loyalty, it never will be focussed upon it. The impression which has been left upon the public mind will never be removed unless attention is directed to the valuable vindication which adherents of the Labour party have experienced at the hands of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Knibbs.</inline> I repeat that from the party which has been repeatedly taunted with disloyalty a higher percentage of men has gone to the front than has gone from the adherents of the opposite political party, who have always boasted of their overwhelming loyalty and bursting patriotism . </para>

                <para>I turn now to another phase of this question, which discloses the hollowness and hypocrisy of the case that has been sought to be established against our party. Recently this Parliament enacted legislation with the object of preventing trade with the enemy bv the commercial classes of the Commonwealth. Although the Act has been in operation only a few months, we find that some men engaged in commercial pursuits required looking after, and looking after very badly. Although they were prepared to attend public meetings, at which they were profuse in their professions of loyalty, we now know that when their pockets were touched they were disloyal in the extreme, and were even ready to  sacrifice their country&#39;s interests for the sake of personal gain. As the result of. inquiry from the Attorney-General&#39;s Department, I learn that no less than twelve - of these gentlemen, whose loyalty has not hitherto been questioned, and who-&#39; have been prepared to go to extremes in expressing their  slobbersome  devotion to the Empire, have already been haled before the Courts and fined, for having attempted to make money by trading with, the enemy. In addition to that, there are fourteen others who are now on the carpet under suspicion of having been guilty of the same offence. Having regard to the fact that 100 per cent, of those who have already been tried have been convicted, there is strong presumptive evidence that the remainder will suffer the same fate. It is an old saw that a straw indicates the direction of the wind. Small things indicate big things just as plainly as if they were blazed across the firmament. If any want of loyalty has been exhibited amongst the citizens of this country, unquestionably it has been exhibited by those who have heretofore ostentatiously labelled themselves as patriots. In opposition to that,, it is worth while noting what the adherents of the Labour party have been doing. We have observed that throughout the Commonwealth . disturbances have taken place in industrial centres. Why? Not because the men were desirous of trading with the enemy. The truth is that they found themselves working on ships and in the country alongside of enemy subjects, and they sacrificed their earnings day after day rather than continue in that position. In Port Pirie, in Sydney, and in Western Australia, we find examples where supporters of the Labour party, without hesitation, sacrificed their means of livelihood for the purpose of upholding principles which they regarded as sacred; whilst, on the other hand, the commercial men of the community were endeavouring to make money all the time, even at the sacrifice of the Empire&#39;s best interests. </para>
                <para>I come now to the CommonwealthBank. I notice that the Leader of the Opposition in his address this afternoon skimmed very lightly over the long reference which is made in the Ministerial statement to this subject, and to   the Australian note issue. We might have expected that, because, perhaps, he is under the impression that the work of the Ministerial party speaks for itself, and requires no extolling on his part. But lest the public outside should lose sight of the good results which have flowed from the establishment of that institution, they are worth recalling. During the present crisis, which is without a parallel in our history, the Australian note issue has been the direct means of sustaining the credit of the country up to date. But before dealing with that aspect of the matter, I want to correct one statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> concerning the note issue. In referring to it he spoke of &#34; the rather inflated note issue of to-day.&#34; Now I say advisedly that it is not wisdom on his part to refer to that form of currency in such language, because if there is any note of warning to be sounded, it certainly should not proceed from such an authoritative source, unless there is the most solid ground for uttering it. The Leader of the Opposition is not entitled to take the lead in casting a veiled&#34; reflection on our Australian note issue. I hope that he did so iu haste, and whilst his mind was centred on other points connected with his subject. In his calmer moments he will, I am sure, realize that it is not the duty of the patriotic citizen, and least of all of the leader of a political party, to lead the public to believe that our note issue is inflated. </para>

What I wish to direct attention to is that, whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> lias told the Senate and the country that we have a rather inflated note issue, the honorable senator should be sorry for what he has said. In order to enlighten the honorable senator and the country, let me say that the matter under discussion was previously, the subject of a searching inquiry in New South Wales. During that inquiry men of distinction, and with a lifelong experience of banking, testified that a very much lower percentage of gold would be quite sufficient for a note issue. A Commission was appointed in New South Wales in the early nineties, and the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Miller,</inline> who was then manager of the Bank of New South Wales, which I shall not advertise beyond saying that it was one of the banks which withstood the financial shocks of the early nineties, was asked by the Commission what gold backing was required for a note issue. He stated in evidence that, in his opinion, 3s. 6d. in the &#163;1 would be an ample gold backing for every note  issued. </para>

                        <para>- No such thing. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Miller</inline> was asked the plain question as to what, in his opinion, would be a fair amount of gold to hold for the redemption of notes, and his answer was that it would be sufficient to hold 3s. 6d. against each note issued. Another manager - I think of the Bank of Australasia - said that as low as 2s. 6d. in the &#163;1 would be an ample gold backing for the redemption of notes. It must he remembered that it was not, at that time, suggested to these gentlemen that a State bank should be established. They had not before their minds the issue of notes by a State bank when they testified that from 12 to 1G per cent, of gold at most would be a sufficient backing for a note issue. So that, in the opinion of the most experienced bankers in Australia, a gold reserve of from 12 to 25 per cent, is ample for the redemption of notes. Here, in connexion with the notes issued by the Commonwealth, we have behind them the resources of Australia, and, what is far more important, the credit of the whole of the people, and! 40 per cent, in gold in addition : and yet the Leader of the Opposition tells us that a gold reserve of that percentage is not ample for our note issue. </para>

As there is a gold reserve of a fraction over 40 per cent., the issue is referred to by the Leader of the Opposition as rather inflated. That means that by putting more gold in the Treasury it would become less inflated. </para>

                        <para>- When those men who have claims to be considered experts were called upon to express an opinion, they said that in the case of private banks from 16 to 25 per cent, was ample. Although in the case of the Commonwealth to-day there is a gold reserve of over 40 per cent., yet we are told that our note issue is &#34;rather inflated.&#34; I am pleased to say that the&#39; predictions of our opponents in that regard have not come true. One of the wise gentlemen among the Opposition - a man who, I suppose, has been more or less successful in business - indulged in a witty saying regarding the note issue. &#34;This proposal,&#34; he said, &#34; contains the germs of disaster.&#34; Where is the disaster that has been produced? I can only say that since our opponents have already placed on record their appreciation of the note issue in helping to finance the Commonwealth in the present Parliament, that in itself is a- sufficient credential without any words of mine to reinforce it. The Opposition said before the last election that this country was secure. Why did they make that statement? It was because we had a note issue. Why did the country have a note issue ? Because it had a Labour Government to establish the note issue. Did the Labour Government do that with the support of the Opposition? No. The Opposition said that our proposal contained the germs of disaster; but we are pleased that, just as in regard to the development of every other proposition tackled by the Labour Government, it has been attended by success. The note issue has been the positive financial salvation of this country up to date. It has helped the Government, not only to finance the requirements of the Commonwealth, but to finance the States. Aye. and even private banks, as well as private individuals. </para>

                <para>That is quite true; but in regard to that arrangement there is always the other feature to be presented - that the note issue could not have been the help it was without the assistance of the banks. No more could the banks have assisted this country without the aid of the note issue. The position is just the same as if I was in the back country and wanted to get a ton of merchandise carted out from a railway station. If my team were inadequate for the purpose, and I obtained two horses from a neighbour, of course, with the aid of the horses I could get the ton of merchandise landed at its destination, and it could properly be said of me that I could not have achieved that result except with the aid and the help of my neighbour ; but I would know that he came to my assistance as a neighbourly act. or to gain  an advantage for himself in the future. Had not the banks come to the assistance of the Commonwealth Government, what would have been the result? Would we not have had a certain dislocation of trade throughout the country? Whilst I am willing to give credit, to the banks for their action, let me remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> that they could not have done what they did on their own account. It is  a  case of mutual co-operation, in which two parties co-operated in a very creditable spirit. </para>

                        <para>- The note issue has kept the gold in the Commonwealth. It has enabled the people of this country to trade, because, after all, 4,000,000 persons must have some credit, the same as any person of passable repute has credit. The people of this country had no credit until the Fisher Government gave them the power to trade. The note issue could not exist on <inline font-style="italic">its</inline> own; it wanted a gold base, and by that means it has enabled the Government to circulate &#163;4 for every sovereign deposited in the Treasury. That is an advantage to the banks. It was a transaction praiseworthy to all parties, and no particular share of praise ought to be given to the banks. Had they not come to the rescue we would have had a serious shortage, and such a disruption in our industrial and commercial life as possibly to bring about a repetition of the distress and unemployment experienced in the past - in times, by the way, when Liberal Governments could not cope with the difficulties which the Fisher Government happily have been able to cope with to such an extent that the position of the country is as solid and sound as a bell. This result has been accomplished by a Government who have been exposed to much criticism. </para>

                        <para>- But so far from injuring the private banks, the Commonwealth Bank has actually come forward to their help, if not to their rescue. It is a strange <inline font-style="italic">role</inline> to be filled by a bank which was said to be incubated in a spirit of revenge, with a design to injure other banks, that it should be&#187; their actual saviour at the present time. We have lived and learned, as we always do. The predictions of our opponents have been falsified in regard to the Commonwealth Bank as well as in regard to the Government, the note issue, and every other big reform which has been carried to a successful issue by the Labour party. </para>

                <para>Our proposal to establish a Navy was also opposed. It was referred toby members of the Opposition as a &#34;mosquito fleet&#34;; but where are our critics now? The Labour party brought the Navy into existence, but we do not hear any criticisms now. Thus one more prophecy is tossed overboard, one more prediction is pulverized. We had to wait for good old Time to vindicate the party on the Treasury bench. I am pleased at the progress which the Commonwealth. Bank has made, and at the thought that in three months it has increased its deposits by &#163;500,000. That shows the expanding confidence which is making itself manifest everywhere in this grand institution. What do we find when we turn to the other end of the world? Amongst the banks of the Old World, according to this Ministerial statement, the Commonwealth Bank and the Bank of England were the only two banks which kept their doors open, and did not take advantage of the moratorium passed by the Imperial Parliament. What have our opponents and critics to say on that point now ? Nothing ! Of course, they cannot say anything. They are as scarce on the landscape as a rabbit would be on the Sahara. We do not hear our opponents criticising the Commonwealth Bank, because the operation of time has brought out the weakness and the falsification of the arguments they used in times past against our proposal. I am also pleased that the Government have taken advantage of their power, although it was a very extraordinary thing to do, to remit the duties on hay, chaff, and fodder entering the Commonwealth. </para>
                <para>Although the revenue has not been too buoyant, still we find the Fisher Government sufficiently alive to the primary industries to do a thing which I have not heard of as being done before, in order to help the primary industries during dry times. Those of us who are acquainted with the dry conditions in the inland parts of Australia, and. know the hardships which many a settler lately in the ranks of the wage earners has had to undergo, cannot too highly appreciate the action of the Fisher Government in making fodder free of duty. Ministers have, it is true, gone behind the back of Parliament. </para>

Knowing the desperate position of some men who cannot get fodder to keep their horses alive - and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Shannon</inline> will support my statement - I cannot appreciate too highly the statesmanlike act of the Labour Government during the last few months. They did not hesitate to do a thing which many a Government would not dream of doing; they have given a chance to farmers and settlers to cling to their holdings through being able to get cheaper fodder to keep hungry horses alive and get a crop in. How often have the present Government been told that they were not a farmers&#39; Government? How often has the quintette who remain in the Senate told the people of this country that the enemies of the farmers are to be seen on the Treasury bench ? </para>

                        <para>- Of course I am, but these are not normal times. I have no need to tell the honorable senator that the Tariff was not made for abnormal times. It was made to advance the interests of this country, and although it was about to press severely upon many an anxious farmer and settler throughout the Commonwealth, the present Government stepped forward and did everything they could to ease the burden on his back. Are our opponents truly sorry for what they have said of the Labour party in the past? I hope that they will be sorry. I do not know whether they want to be tested according to the Christian or the old Egyptian code. The new Christian code is that a person is held responsible for the acts he is guilty of, whereas under the old Egyptian code a person was condemned for the acts he had omitted to do. I verily believe that the old Egyptian code will be the safer one for our honorable friends to be tested by. In fact, their sins of omission and commission have been so numerous that -&#39;t would be a good thing to re-establish the Egyptian code in order to -allow them to escape the fury which awaits them in the future. </para>

                        <para>- In other countries a very stiff tax would be imposed such as has been imposed on persons in the Old Country who are able to pay. So far, that has not been the case here. While it will be necessary for the Government to resort to the power of taxation to cover the expenditure of the war, still, owing to the disastrous times we have had wisdom prevails in the ranks of the Ministerial party, and no taxation is to be imposed until the productive energies of the country are in a state to stand the strain.- - So the Opposition should be thankful that their main supporters have been allowed to escape so long; but let them not take that fact as a guarantee that they will escape always. I believe that the burden will be fairly adjusted. I believe that when we get a return to normal seasons and the cruel war is over we shall be able to adjust the burden in such a way as will entail no hardship to any individual, and at the same time will secure the finances of this country. The items in this statement so far as I have had time to criticise them have appealed to me very favorably. I am particularly impressed with the way the Government have handled the situation. I only hope that with the return of good seasons and the cessation of hostilities, Australia, in common with our Allies in the war, will experience a lengthened era of prosperity. </para>

                    <para>. - I must confess that after listening to the very able speech that, as usual, we have heard from the Leader of the Opposition I address myself to this question with a certain amount of trepidation. In that gentle pleading language, of which he is a master, he has appealed to us not to encroach on the domain of party or controversial politics, and after listening to a great portion of his speech I felt that I should almost be committing sacrilege if I turned a deaf ear to his pleadings. I confess that it is my intention to deal with one or two questions which may be considered as of a party nature, because whilst I agree with the honorable senator that the titanic struggle in which the nations of the world are engaged is of paramount importance, not only to those of our kith and kin who are risking their lives on the battlefield, but also to those of us who remain in this country, I realize at the same time that it would be foolish for this National Parliament to stand idly by and pass no legislation except that immediately connected with the war. As a result of that very war, of which I trust the world will never see the like again, there is misery and distress within the four corners of our island continent. &#39; That distress is very keen, and has been accentuated by the unfortunate seasons that we have experienced. When the would be over-lord of Europe declared war on the nations of the world, the elements in Australia declared war against us, and five of the States have had a very severe drought. We have a large amount of misery and distress owing to unemployment, and it is therefore imperative for this Parliament to introduce and pass legislation to relieve the situation. It is all very well for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> speaking, I presume, on behalf of the party with which he is associated in both branches of the Parliament, to say that they are willing to give the present Government full power to deal with war questions and war issues. I was amused at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long&#39;s</inline> interjection about the honorable senator&#39;s amazing generosity. Whilst I thank him for his intentions, which I believe to be sincere, his assurances in that regard were totally unnecessary, because the Government already have power without the consent or assistance of the Opposition to do everything possible for the protection of this country, and in regard to every other kind of legislation that will be beneficial to the people who placed them through the ballot-box in their present position. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator&#39;s leader, who was Minister of Defence when war was declared, and the ex-Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Cook, also made a statement that the Government were not doing all they could and should do to assist the Empire in this world-wide struggle, and those statements received a considerable amount of prominence in the Australian press. Both those gentlemen asserted that we must sand to the front 100,000 men. They practically told the people that the Labour Government were not doing all they could to send as many men as possible to help the Allies to victory. Let me tell the honorable senator what really occurred. The Minister of Defence could not reply in public to those allegations.  His  lips were sealed, and every sensible man knows why. He had from the Imperial authorities information that he could not disclose. He had local knowledge of the abilities of Australia to fit. equip, train, and transport troops. Was he then to open his mouth, and tell the people of the world the actual facts of the position, and thus give information to the enemy that we are endeavouring to destroy? Of course he could not do it. If he could have made the statement which was in his possession, he would have thrown the ranks of the Liberal party into confusion. The Attorney-General, who was at that time Acting Prime Minister, sent to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> a certain confidential State document, which explained the whole position, thus taking that gentleman into the confidence of the Government, and from that day to this neither <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cook</inline> nor <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> has repeated in public the statements they then made, nor have they had the common courtesy or manliness to withdraw or apologize for them. Both owed an apology not only to the Government, but to the Australian nation, because the substance of their public allegations was that we in Australia were indolent or indifferent as to the result of this titanic struggle. Those are plain and straightforward facts which neither <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap</inline> nor any other member of his party can deny. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator might as well talk about what happened in the time of Adam and Eve. The fact is that from 1901 to 1907-8 the honorable senator&#39;s party opposed our policy of withdrawing the naval subsidy and paying for what was really a phantom fleet, with a view to devoting that &#163;200,000 annually to the development of an Australian Navy.  His  party also stoutly opposed the initiation of compulsory training in the first instance. Indeed every proposal which the Labour party brought forward, including the establishment of the Small Arms Factory and of other Commonwealth instrumentalities, was dubbed &#34; Socialism run mad.&#34; But we would thank God to-day if those factories had been established ten years earlier. Had our Small Arms Factory been established a decade ago we would have been able more easily to equip our men who are to-day going forth to fight the Empire&#39;s battle. </para>

                        <para>- There is still another lesson which this war teaches, and that is the necessity for being industrially self contained. In this Parliament the battle of Free Trade and Protection used to be fought, but I am told that there are no Free Traders here now - that we are all Protectionists. However, I am not so sure about that. The war has taught us that if we had had a really effective Tariff on the statute-book we should have been in a far better position, both industrially and commercially, than we are. In referring to the Tariff, let me express the regret which I feel in learning from the Ministerial statement that our Customs and Excise revenue has increased. When the new Tariff was laid on the table of the House of Representatives towards the end of last year, I was under the impression that ic was an effective Protective Tariff. </para>

                        <para>- I hope so. I shall endeavour to amend it to the best of my ability. I admit that, in the terrible time through which we are now passing, there may be a desire on the part of the Government to collect as much revenue as possible through the Customs. I do not say that the Ministry would experience the same feeling in ordinary times. But I hope that that feeling will not be permitted to carry us away from the pledge we gave to the people to the extent of depriving them of that foi which they have asked, viz., a truly Pro&#39;tective Tariff. This is the time to initiate such a Tariff if there ever, was a time, and L trust that no delay will occur in putting the Tariff schedule through&#39; Parham ment. The very, fact- that to-day we have to depend upon other countries- for commodities which, we can easily manu facture here is proof positive that we have been lacking in that regard. I would like to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen</inline> and his party whether they consider that the Tariff is a question which should not be discussed during the war ? Perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bakhap,</inline> who is the only representative of the Opposition in the Chamber, will answer my question ? </para>

                    <para>Proceeding, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Irvine spoke of the Labour party&#39;s proposed amendments of the Constitution. Some of them, and notably the proposal to nationalize monopolies, as the result of a chance vote, were among the most ridiculous proposals ever put before a sane people. At the same time, he wanted to say that the proposals did contain &#34; the germ of some necessary improvements in the Constitution.&#34; As for the Constitution itself, the cloth was very good, but the cut was always a little old-fashioned. (Laughter.) Moreover, the garment, as a whole, was bursting at the seam. Dealing with the financial question, he deplored the fact that seven different bodies in Australia were in a position to compete in a game of &#34; Yankee-grab,&#34; the stakes of which were the product of the industry of the people of Australia. He could not conceive of a system more likely to lead to financial disaster. In the domestic establishment of Australia, not only had the housekeeper the key of the storeroom, but six housemaids had separate keys. Also, there had been attempts at agreements among the borrowers themselves; but he thought there was not much to be hoped from such attempts. This was the position that he asked the people&#39;s party to take into its serious consideration, as he considered that on this party lay the duty of investigating the fundamental defects of the Constitution under which they lived. Until somebody could coordinate the other borrowing bodies to itself, there would, he thought, be no improvement. </para>

He felt this was a time when no man who had firm opinions should hesitate to express them. He concluded - &#34; It is true we must not sacrifice what you are pleased to call State rights. We must retain that measure of home rule that enables them to manage their own affairs. I, for one, would never dispute that. While you maintain State rights you must also uphold the national security, the development and the fulfilment of the destiny of this country of ours.&#34; </para>

                        <para>.- I wish to take advantage of the motion to call attention to what I believe to be a gross act of injustice on the part of this and previous Governments to the isolated people of King Island. For several years past, I and other members of the Senate have made constant representations on their behalf. Unfortunately, we could never get any declaration from the responsible Minister as to the probability of relieving the King Island people from their isolation by providing them with the required means of communication with the mainland or Tasmania. I had some hope that a Labour Government would be sufficiently alive to the wants of people so situated as are the people of King Island that they would be willing to incur the necessary expense to provide them with communication. In the statement which we have had presented to us, we are told that it is proposed to carry out the preliminary survey of a railway from the Port Augusta line to some point in Queensland, an undertaking that will possibly commit Australia to the expenditure of millions sterling. Yet. we cannot induce this Government, nor could we induce the previous Government, to undertake the very small expenditure necessary to provide the wire less communication with King Island which the residents of that island have been pleading for for years past. </para>

If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Blakey</inline> knows of any other people in the same condition of isolation as are the people of King Island, he has failed in his duty by not calling attention to their needs. When representations are made to the Government in connexion with the matter to which I am referring, we are told that it will be looked into, and that the Government will get reports. Then the old useless method of submitting the matter for report to the  Deputy  Postmaster-General of Tasmania is followed. He instructs a subordinate to make a report. The subordinate officer makes a report. In due time it goes to the  Deputy  Postmaster-General, and finally reaches the Minister through some of the officials of his Department, and the Minister acquiesces in the old practice of some of these highly paid officials not to interfere with existing conditions. </para>

It must be within the knowledge of honorable senators that I have been unceasing in my advocacy of their claims in this connexion. It has been a matter of regret to me that time and again the Postmaster-General, and Postmasters-General who have been members of Labour Governments as well as others, have permitted themselves to be browbeaten by the highly paid officials of their Department who do not wish to get out of the rut in which they have been operating for years past. </para>

                            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> when the tea hour arrived I was addressing some observations to the Senate on what I considered the neglect  of the Government in not providing some means of communication between Victoria or Tasmania for the people of King Island. I. have learnt since that it was the desire of honorable senators to complete the day&#39;s sitting at the tea adjournment, and I am sorry if any action of mine in prolonging the discussion has caused any inconvenience. This Government have persistently refused the requests of King Island residents in connexion with the wireless communication, and the most recent happening is one which I think will cause no little astonishment. For some time negotiations of a kind were proceeding between the Government and the people of that island whereby the people were called upon to pay a subsidy to the Commonwealth Government in return for the services established by them. It has been pointed out - and I think that I am justified in again pointing out - that wireless communication has very properly been established at Flinders Island without imposing any such restrictions on the people there. I am in entire agreement with the action of the Government in that respect, and I will not be charged with unreasonableness when I ask that the people of King Island shall be similarly treated. Quite recently, as honorable senators will gather from the question I asked yesterday and the answer by the Minister of Defence this afternoon, the wireless station which had been erected by a private firm at King Island for purely experimental purposes has been entirely dismantled. The Leader of the Government in the Senate carefully evaded one part of my question asking if it was intended to restore communication to those people. Now I am not pleased with this Government, nor am I pleased with the other Government, for what I am inclined to regard as their inhuman neglect of the people in connexion with the- matter. Honorable senators will know that there is only a mail steamer service between Victoria and King Island, or between King Island and Tasmania, and there are times during rough weather when several weeks - in one instance, more than three weeks - have elapsed from the time the boat left Victoria until it was heard of again. Imagine the agony of mind of the relatives of the people on board the steamer, situated as they were, and unable to get any information as to whether they reached King Island safely or otherwise. And now we find that the Government, instead of making an effort to prevent that in the future, have wantonly destroyed the wireless station, which was the only means of communication people had on the island. What is the reason for it? Economy? Why, it would have cost the  great Commonwealth Government of Australia nearly &#163;150 a year to maintain that wireless station ! The Government ought to blush, if they have a blush left in them, at their neglect in this matter. I understand that at the outbreak of the war they thought it necessary to place a guard over this wireless station, as a similar precaution was taken in the case of most private wireless stations in Australia. The guard was there for nearly six months, and it has now occurred to the Government that the cheapest way to exercise absolute control over this wireless station is to dismantle it altogether, and so do away with the guard on the island. The Government are to be commended for this decision, and commended for having deprived the people on King Island and the people on the mainland of Victoria and Tasmania of the opportunity of getting into communication with their relatives - a convenience which the residents in almost every other part of Australia enjoy. I think I am entitled to a definite statement from the Ministry as to whether  they  intend to make some provision for the people to whom I refer. In matters of policy I do not want to go to subordinates for information. I do not want the Government to adopt a circumlocutory process in giving a reply, and find that after a lapse of six months the matter will come back from the Postmaster-General with an indorsement that it is &#34; contrary to the practice of the Department &#34; ; but I want the Government to have the courage to tell the Senate definitely what they intend to do in this matter. If they do not propose to undertake the construction of a wireless station, which they say can be erected for half the cost for which they could purchase the wireless plant already erected on the island, I want them to tell me so. I have no brief for the proprietors of the wireless station. My sole object in taking up the time of the Senate on this as on previous occasions was to get some means of communication for the people on the island. If the Government think it is too mighty a project for the National Government of Australia to undertake, let us know exactly where we are, so that the people on the island may be privileged to make whatever arrangements they think best. According to the Minister&#39;s reply this afternoon, it is not the intention of the Government to compensate the owners of the wireless station, which is one of the finest and most powerful in all Australia, for their action in dismantling it. Now, this does not appear to be justice, and I hope it will not appear to members of the Senate as being justice. Although it might have been necessary - and I am not disputing it for a moment - from a defence point, of view to take the action that they did, some other arrangement ought to have been made for the  people,  and, in justice, the Government ought to compensate the proprietors of the wireless station for whatever damage has been done. </para>

                            <para>- &#163; understand that is so. The most inexpensive system of communication is by wireless. The Minister said this afternoon, in reply to one of my questions, that the stations had been dismantled in accordance with instructions issued by his Department, and that this instruction referred to all  privately  owned wireless stations in Australia. It would be intensely interesting to know to what extent those instructions have been carried cut, and what number of wireless stations have been closed as the result of that action. I intend to get the information, and to-morrow I shall move for a return of the number of wireless stations that have been closed in Australia since the outbreak of the war. When we get that information I think it will be found that- the answer given to one of my questions this afternoon was simply begging the point at issue, and that, after all, the Government of the day have been actuated by the paltry motive of saving a few pounds. They are pretty lavish in other respects, and will not hesitate to pay mighty large salaries to incompetent individuals who are responsible in some measure for the development of our defence scheme. But that does not worry the Government in the least, though they take fright at the thought of having to spend &#163;150 a year to bring the people of Kine Island into touch with civilization. I have no wish to delay the Senate at greater length, but in this matter I feel very keenly. I have entertained a desire to prosecute a vendetta against the Government because of their apathy. I have made one protest to-night which will be followed by a number of others if something in this connexion is not done. </para>

                            <para>- What are the facts? I am not disputing that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> put them very accurately before the Senate, though he expressed them in what may be termed strained language. The military authorities thought it was expedient that the wireless station established at King Island should be dismantled. Furthermore, the postal authorities, as business men conducting a business of the Commonwealth, were of the opinion that the. wireless station established at King Island was too costly a station for them to take over. They had no desire to deal with the people of King Island in any harsh manner, and they put a certain proposition before  them. During the dinner adjournment 1 had an opportunity to discuss the matter briefly with the Postmaster-General. The  proposition  put before the people of King Island by the Post and Telegraph Department is such as has frequently been submitted to people in isolated districts of the mainland. </para>

I had not time during the dinner adjournment to inquire into everything that had been done in connexion with this matter. I do not contend that every one brought into communication with civilization, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> has phrased it, should be called upon to pay for the service rendered, but I do say that a plain and practical business proposition his been put before the people of King Island. They were told that if they agreed to contribute a certain amount towards the cost of the communication required  the Government would&#34; be prepared to do their share. As I understand the matter, that proposition is still under consideration. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> will not help the matter at all by the use of harsh phrases addressed to the Government. I tell the honorable senator at once that the Government will make no promise to do at once anything he desires to ask. </para>

I do not think that it is fair that they should be met at the present time with an attack couched in the strongest language imaginable, merely because, during the few short months in which they have been in office, this matter has not been fixed up to the satisfaction of the honorable senator who has put this claim forward to-night. </para>

                            <para>- I wish only to put the position fairly. The Government considered that the wireless system established at King Island was altogether too costly for them to take over, when, from a business point of view, a satisfactory system could be established that would not be half so costly. A matter of this kind affecting a place like King Island cannot be settled off-hand. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long,</inline> departing entirely from his usual good-natured manner, has used expressions concerning the Government which might lead to the impression that they have lost the confidence of the whole of the people of the Commonwealth because they have treated the people of King Island .harshly. I will not say that the whole of our departmental machinery does not sometimes work too slowly for all of us, but I give a promise which the honorable senator assured me he will not take. </para>

                            <para>- I am not in a position to give the honorable senator an unqualified promise. If the people of King Island can in any way be brought more closely into touch with civilization and with Tasmania, I shall be prepared to do my utmost to bring that about. I feel sure that when the honorable senator has fairly considered all that has been done up to the present, he will admit that he was not justified in what he has said. The first proposal made was to take over the existing wireless station ; and, in the opinion of the authorities of the Post and Telegraph Department, it was altogether too big a concern for them to take over. There was then the question of the establishment of another wireless station that would not be nearly so costly. It is only reasonable to expect that it would take some time to consider a business proposition of that kind. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> believes that the strength of his language will make any very great impression upon the Government, he is mistaken. This is purely a departmental matter, which might easily have been settled without making it a matter for discussion in the Senate. Communication with the mainland is a matter of importance to the people, not only of King Island, but of other islands belonging to the Commonwealth, and it is becoming more important every day, owing to the peculiar position in which we are placed. </para>

                            <para>- I am not going to take the responsibility of what happened years ago. There has been delay. I recognise that all negotiations or business transactions between the Department and any section of the community are necessarily slow. We have to move slowly in order that we may move safely. There is many a rapid move which, ;f made, would probably please a few persons, but which would end disastrously so far as the Government and the Commonwealth are concerned. I could put before the Cabinet a hundred and one propositions which would be highly satisfactory from my view-point, but which, perhaps, the more matured minds of my colleagues would regard otherwise. 1 recognise that the establishment of communication with King Island cannot afford to wait, and there will be no unnecessary delay. At the same time .the matter will not be expedited either by threats or by the strength of the language which is hurled against the Government. </para>

                    <para class="block">King Island is probably a matter which can better be arranged for with the Department directly than by occupying the time of the Senate. I have recognised that fact ordinarily; I have recognised it still more strongly in recent times on account of the peculiar circumstances that have made other matters of great urgency for both Houses of Parliament since the outbreak of the war. I have had a good deal of correspondence with the Department on this subject, and, like other members of Parliament, I have had interviews with successive Postmasters-General and members of the staff. In coming over from Tasmania this time I brought over some of my own file on this subject to supplement what I already had here, and the file I have would make a respectable file in any Department, so thick is it. I propose to say a few words in support of the proposition that the Government should take into early consideration the provision of this facility, more especially since the communication which had been established for some time has recently been dismantled. King Island in this matter stands in a peculiar position - a position different from that of any of the other islands round the coast of the Commonwealth. The population, I suppose, is about 1,000 or 1,200. It is a place where a good deal of business is conducted with both Victoria and Tasmania. There has been open there for some years a branch of a prominent bank, whose head office is in Victoria. In order to carry on financial matters for clients in Tasmania, Victoria, and King Island it is essential in banking business that there shall be some means of regular and, speedy communication. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> has pointed out that there is a steamer service which runs between Victoria, King Island, and Tasmania. On more than one occasion a steamer has been weatherbound at King Island for a week or a fortnight or more, and nobody on either side of the strait could even know the simple fact that it was weatherbound there, and that the passengers were safe. That occurs, I think, at least once or more in every year during the stormy months. When it occurs, those who are interested in the passengers on the steamer have to go through a very painful time of apprehension indeed, and it is just at that juncture that representatives from Tasmania are generally impressed by those in anxiety with the necessity of having some sort of communication, and again the Postal Department is stirred up, though with no result. Some years ago, when I was a member of a Government that was arranging to establish Commonwealth cables between Tasmania and the mainland to replace the private cables, I asked my colleague, the Postmaster-General, to ascertain if it was not practicable to lay one cable <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> King Island and the other <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Flinders Island, and thus have communication with both islands. A submarine survey revealed that the bottom of Bass Strait in those places was of such a rocky character that the life of a cable, if laid, would be very short indeed. As a result of that survey the present cables run from Flinders, in Victoria, to Low Head, in Tasmania. Neither Flinders Island, on the east side of Bass Strait, nor King Island, on the west side, can be connected by cable. Therefore, so far as telegraphic communication is concerned, they are both dependent  upon  wireless, and in that regard both communities stand distinct from any other outlying island which could be connected by cable. That is a feature which should never be overlooked. The Postal Department have satisfied themselves long since that it is impracticable to lay a cable to either King Island or Flinders Island. It is a case of wireless or nothing. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> has pointed out that the steamers trailing from King Island to Tasmania and vue mainland are frequently weatherbound. Their size is not very great, and mail communication is of very little value in cases when the storms are prevalent. That, again, is a feature in connexion with King Island which must not be overlooked in regard to any provision for communication. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> baa asked how long Tasmania has had this island, and has not provided some means of communication; but I would point out to him that Tasmania could not, at any time, have laid at cable to the island. That was impracticable, and the wireless telegraphy has only been a means of communication since King Island came over to the Commonwealth. It was in 1905 that this Parliament passed a Bill making wireless telegraphy a monopoly of the Commonwealth. No wireless telegraphic communication can be established except by the Commonwealth. Cable communication may be established, but it would be of no value. Postal communication is necessarily infrequent, and, in many instances, very irregular. </para>

                            <para>- I have known it to be three weeks and more. I have had bulky correspondence with the departmental officers for a considerable time, and have asked questions here on more than one occasion. I have asked, on notice, why provision for wireless telegraphy with King Island was not made. I have asked the question asked here today by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long,</inline> why do the Government insist upon the residents of King Island entering into something in the nature of a guarantee when no such guarantee was asked in the case of Flinders Island. I do not deprecate the action of the Government in establishing wireless communication with Flinders Island without asking for a guarantee, but I have asked in this chamber, in questions upon notice, why a : differentiation has been made between the two cases. I heartily approve of what was done in the case of Flinders Island; but why should not both communities be treated alike ? I think thai I am not exaggerating when I say that never once could I here get a definite answer to that question. The answers furnished to the Minister representing the Postmaster-General in this chamber, no matter what Government he belonged to, have always, intentionally or otherwise, evaded this issue. For a long time I believed that there was some reason why  the Department deliberately evaded the issue, and I think I am right in saying that for a considerable time in my correspondence with the Department I sought unsuccessfully to pin them down to an answer to my question. On one occasion, immediately on receipt of a letter from the Department answering one of mine of a date some time before, I wrote a rather strong letter, pointing out that I had asked this question and wanted an answer to it, and that the answer they had given would be very well in its place, and quite relevant if I had asked something else. In their reply - and I believe this was the only time the fact was brought under my notice - they pointed out that the Flinders Island station was established as part of a scheme of wireless stations throughout the Common wealth for defence and strategic purposes-, and was not established primarily or solely for the purpose of telegraphic communication, and that King Island, was not included in that scheme. It was for that reason that Flinders Island got a. wireless station without any local guarantee being asked for, while King Island was asked to provide such. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gardiner</inline> has somewhat stressed the statement that the policy of the Government in regard to outlying districts and telephonic communication was, in most instances where the estimated revenue wa&#38; not proportionate to the outlay, to ask the local residents to make a contribution or give a guarantee. That may be &#187; very correct policy so far as concerns outlying places on land, because they can. always have regular communication by post, and generally have, or can have,. telegraphic communication. King Island;, on the other hand, until its population, and trade grow, and its ports are made of: such a character as to admit shipping to which the storms of Bass Strait will be* of no moment, cannot have regular mail communication, nor can it have effective&#39; submarine telegraphic communication.. It is, therefore, in a different position from outlying places on the mainland. It must have regular communication, and the only means for it is wireless or nothing. To those other places,, which have regular mail communication and which already have, or may. have, telegraphic communication, telephonic communication is comparatively a luxury superadded to the necessities with which* the Commonwealth has already provided them. I am not aware that the Postal  Department ever asks an outlying town which sends in a request for telegraphic communication for a guarantee in  regard  to it. </para>

                    <para>Australia who have trading relations with King Island, will be considered. Victoria does a tremendous amount of business with the island in proportion  to  its population. King Island stock is frequently seen  in  Victoria, and is highly appreciated. The- stock sale-yards often witness the marked appreciation of Victorian buyers for stock fattened on King Island.  Many  more people would do business with the island if regular communication was established. It would mean a great increase in business and a great development of the resources of the place. I am sure the Postmaster-General will realize that there is every need for the Government  to do  something to provide King Island with regular wireless communication. </para>

                        <para>. - Every Tasmanian senator has approached the Government on the question  of  the isolation from which the island communities between the mainland and Tasmania have for so long  Buffered.  I fully believe that the promises  of  various Ministers  to  remedy this state  of  affairs will be redeemed, and I want  to  inspire the Government to regard the providing  of  wireless communication with King Island as an absolutely safe revenue producing proposition. King Island is one  of  the largest islands, outside Tasmania, included  in  the territory of the Commonwealth. It is  in  some respects a terrestrial paradise. It may be  news to  some  to  learn that  in  the midst  of  this great drought there has been an abundance&#39; nf fodder  on  the island, and that the output  of  fat cattle this season runs up  to  10,000 head from a community  of  1,000 white people. It is a community which is growing  in  wealth and  in  trading possibilities very rapidly. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating;</inline> has alluded  to  the nautical difficulties in the way of providing it with regular communication. It  is  surrounded  by  reefs which are flung  forward,  and make navigation at times very difficult, thus adding  to  and intensifying the isolation  of  the community. Successive Administrations have poured out money like water  on  the Northern Territory,  in  the hope  of  inducing an influx of white settlement, but  in  the few years that have elapsed since the consummation  of  Federation over 1,000 white people have settled on King Island. At that rate  they  will soon equal the number of white settlers in the Northern Territory. They are a prosperous and enterprising community, and the provision of wireless communication will add to the possibility of remunerative trade with the mainland and Tasmania. In the Northern Territory I found a zealous and useful official dignified with the title of &#34; Excellency,&#34; and millions of Commonwealth money being spent, or about to be spent. Although the Territory has been taken over quite recently, hundreds of thousands of pounds have already been spent there to provide railway facilities for the few isolated and somewhat reluctant to remain white settlers. On the other hand, the population of King Island bids fair to increase very rapidly, but the settlers have pleaded in vain through their - representatives in this Parliament for reasonable consideration at the hands of the National Government. I sincerely urge the Government to take into consideration the fact that this community is distant only 45 miles from the State in which is placed the seat of the National Government, and yet it is more isolated than if it were in the South Seas. Excluding Tasmania, King Island has the largest white population of all the insular parts of the Commonwealth, and certainly deserves consideration. The Department need have no fear that the provision of wireless communication will result in a loss. It is a rich community, and will become richer, and I urge the Department to take heart of grace, to regard&#39; the present opportunity as most auspicious, and to give King Island the communication it so urgently needs, and which will be so useful to it. I have nothing to say as regards the demolition of the wireless station which has been erected for some time on the island. It is impossible to think that any reasonable National Administration would wantonly destroy the works erected there without good excuse. Notwithstanding the political differences that separate us, I credit the Government with sufficient common sense to- refrain from the wanton destruction of such an important wireless station. They must have very good reasons for their action, and, putting the consideration of that question aside, I would urge the Minister to induce the Government to address itself immediately to the question of removing the isolation from which the community on the island undoubtedly suffers at present. </para>

                        <para>. - If a wireless station is established on King Island by the Postal Department at this juncture, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> is altogether out of his reckoning in thinking that it will cost only &#163;150 a year to maintain. It would cost very much more, because more than one operator would be required if the station were kept open throughout the twenty-four hours each day; and, in addition, every wireless station, for obvious reasons, has to be supplied with a military guard whilst the war lasts. Now the naval and military authorities say that there is absolutely no reason why a wireless station should be maintained on King Island for naval and military purposes. It therefore becomes purely a question for the Postal Department to say whether its existence is justified. We all know that a wireless station was in existence on King Island when the war broke out - it had been established there for scientific purposes - and being there we had to supply a military guard for it. The position is that the Postal authorities say they do not require the station for postal purposes - that it is too costly - and the naval and military authorities declare that they do not need it for naval and military purposes. They affirm that they have dismantled the other wireless stations throughout the Commonwealth, and that the obvious thing for them to do was to dismantle this one. There is no reason why we should keep a military guard there throughout the currency of the war, seeing that the station is not required. As to other privately-owned wireless stations, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Long</inline> has thrown some doubt on the answer given by me this afternoon. All I can say is that the general instruction was sent out that all privately-owned wireless stations were to be dismantled. That does not necessarily mean that the masts have been pulled down, but the effective wireless portions have been dismantled. I know of no case in which a private wireless station has been maintained. If there are any such stations, either they are being maintained without the knowledge of the naval and military authorities - which is extremely unlikely - or they are being maintained by those authorities for naval and military purposes. It may possibly be that there are some privately-owned stations in the Commonwealth which are maintained for such purposes. </para>
